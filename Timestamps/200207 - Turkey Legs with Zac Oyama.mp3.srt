1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Forever.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,680
Dog.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,540
Warning, the following podcast weighs about 1.5 pounds.

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,080
And clocks in at 720 calories and 36 grams of fat.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,980
It has been cured with a salt solution

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,440
and many say it has a ham-like taste.

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,080
Zach Oyama is with us today to talk turkey legs

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,920
on Podcast The Ride.

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:50,240
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the show where we usually talk turkey figuratively, but today

10
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,920
we're talking turkey literally and also figuratively.

11
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,560
I'm Jason Sheridan, joined here as always by Mike Carlson.

12
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,880
I'm here.

13
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,520
There was one time real quick that you submitted

14
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,000
for Prairie Home Companion.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,040
I submitted for years to Prairie Home Companion.

16
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,960
I feel like that would have been perfect for it.

17
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,960
I think so.

18
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,800
Yeah, so.

19
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,640
I was ready for that.

20
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,480
Those stupid idiots who didn't hire you really,

21
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,360
they should be very sad now after they hear that intro.

22
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,800
Scott Gardner also here.

23
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,800
I nailed the tone, but well enough time will tell.

24
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,440
Whoa, you're perfect for it too.

25
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,160
Wow, I at least have the intonation right at least.

26
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,160
Yeah, that's all you need.

27
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,920
I assume, knowing almost nothing about that thing.

28
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,800
You know, all I know is Lake Wobegon.

29
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,400
Lake Wobegon, I submitted for both hosts.

30
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,880
I can't remember the second guy's name,

31
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,320
because that guy took over and then they changed the name to like,

32
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,560
Oh yeah, yeah.

33
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,520
Something else.

34
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,160
Was that because of me too with Garrison Killer?

35
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,000
Or was that before?

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,840
I think so.

37
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,800
And I think they were trying to go in a different direction.

38
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,640
I mean, they didn't do any of the old characters.

39
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,480
A less me too direction.

40
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,320
Yeah, well.

41
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,920
It's always a good direction to take.

42
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,760
Ideally, hopefully.

43
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,600
If you can.

44
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,640
Well, you should be the host of it, let's be honest.

45
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,920
I mean, I would love that.

46
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,760
Yeah.

47
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,520
So let's put that into the universe.

48
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,040
Well, and let's bring in our guest

49
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,120
to see if he has any folksy wisdom for us.

50
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,240
Oh boy, do I.

51
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,240
Does he agree Jason should be the host of Perihom Companion?

52
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,080
You know him from his work at College Humor

53
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,000
and Associated Properties and his work at the UCB Theater.

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,200
We didn't realize just now,

55
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,480
like we did not ask you how you want to be introduced.

56
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,680
It's Zach Oyama.

57
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,520
Thank you.

58
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,280
Associated Properties is honestly perfect for me.

59
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,200
Right?

60
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,680
And also the host that took over,

61
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,360
his name is Chris Thiele.

62
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,360
Chris Thiele, yes.

63
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,240
The mandolin player from Nickel Creek.

64
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,560
Whoa, really?

65
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,600
I almost never know trivia.

66
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,040
And that was one of the few things I knew.

67
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,680
He's a John Bryan musician.

68
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,520
Yes.

69
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,360
He's amazing.

70
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,360
I've seen him pop in at Largo and stuff,

71
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,360
but I don't know anything about his hosting work.

72
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,320
So I should wish he loses his job.

73
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,360
So Jason gets the job?

74
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,200
I don't know.

75
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,600
I think I feel comfortable saying that too.

76
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,680
Jason, you should take over for him.

77
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,520
Something should happen to him.

78
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,320
That's fine, he seemed like a nice enough guy.

79
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,880
I mean, I had no contact with him,

80
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,160
but I watched some samples to try and get a vibe for it.

81
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,080
He's a very talented musician.

82
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,920
I could pull Chris, I couldn't pull Thiele.

83
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,160
That's a very distinctive name.

84
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,000
Gotcha, yeah, yeah, yeah.

85
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,760
Eventually his morning show moment will come

86
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,160
where he's kind of over the hill

87
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,280
and doesn't really have the spirit anymore

88
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,080
and you'll be the, oh, what's her name?

89
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,960
I've been watching it and a lot,

90
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,040
her name's Barley Mandrew or something.

91
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,320
Oh, oh, Reese?

92
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,160
Yeah.

93
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,560
Oh yeah, what is it?

94
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,960
Sure, it's Barley Mandrew.

95
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,120
Don't bother to look it up.

96
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,680
It's like Sam Strongfella.

97
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,560
Sam Stryver or something.

98
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,160
Sam Spunkwell.

99
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,000
Yeah.

100
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,440
Something with a lot of spunk.

101
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,560
It's Sally Hedstrom.

102
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,480
You'll go viral talking about Cole

103
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,320
and they'll have no choice but to put you on.

104
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,800
You've done more publicity for the morning show

105
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,120
than Apple and the Golden Globes combined.

106
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,120
Zach, you a morning show man?

107
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,960
Oh, love it, definitely seen it.

108
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,720
Well, I definitely have Apple Plus in a,

109
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,560
or whatever it's called and definitely watch that show.

110
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,400
Sure.

111
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,040
Good on ya.

112
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,240
I'm looking up her name right now.

113
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,680
It's Bradley Jackson.

114
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,520
Bradley Jackson.

115
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,480
I said Barley, very close to Barley Mandrew.

116
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,320
Bradley Jackson.

117
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,160
Yeah.

118
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,160
Wow, it sounds like Jackson Brown or James Taylor,

119
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,000
like another acoustic guitar kind of musician.

120
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,840
From the 70s?

121
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,680
From the 70s.

122
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,520
Yeah.

123
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,600
Which maybe that's what,

124
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,400
it's why we trust her inherently

125
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,600
because she sounds like America, like those people do.

126
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,600
They were from a more simple time in America

127
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,480
when we believed in America

128
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,280
and that's what Bradley can get us back to.

129
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,360
Yeah.

130
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,520
She's got spunk.

131
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,040
Sure does, but so does Jason.

132
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,440
That's what Jason is to Bradley.

133
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,320
Jason's a lot like Bradley Jackson.

134
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,920
Yeah, I got spunk.

135
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,800
Zach, I would describe you as having spunk as well.

136
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,640
Oh, thank you.

137
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,800
I think I would take that.

138
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,800
I feel like, gosh, it's very hard to describe yourself,

139
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,960
but I think spunk would be something I would,

140
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,360
I feel fine taking.

141
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,680
I feel like I'm not good at taking compliments or anything,

142
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,120
but spunk doesn't quite feel like a compliment.

143
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,960
Yeah.

144
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,400
It could be perceived as,

145
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,200
if that's the only quality we know about you,

146
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,080
it's like, well, tell me more.

147
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,360
I need a couple more.

148
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,200
It's not bad.

149
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,040
I think it's good, yeah.

150
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,880
It could be passive aggressive.

151
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,640
It could be wielded in a certain way.

152
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,480
Yes.

153
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,120
It doesn't sound like from Jason.

154
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,440
That's sincere.

155
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,480
I feel like it is sincere from Jason.

156
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,320
It is sincere.

157
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,160
He's a fan of your property.

158
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,840
But if a 50-year-old man who was my boss or something

159
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,840
told me that I had spunk and didn't look at me or something,

160
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,440
that would feel really bad.

161
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,280
Oh, yeah.

162
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,080
I just clenched my soda can when you said that.

163
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,360
Yeah, it does feel threatening in some way.

164
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,560
This is tangentially related,

165
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,760
but I got to go to the Annie Awards

166
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,800
because Lindsay's show, Infinity Train, was nominated.

167
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,640
Oh, yeah, cool.

168
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,960
And the category was presented by Ed Asner

169
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,120
and the guy who did The Voice of Crang

170
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,720
on The Old Ninja Turtle Show, among many other voices.

171
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,120
And they did the famous Mary Tyler Moore line

172
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,360
about spunk, Lou Grant, this is for the children.

173
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,400
He was like, I hate spunk or whatever.

174
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,880
And they did that.

175
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,720
Crang and Lou Grant did.

176
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,720
Was he playing Crang?

177
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,440
He didn't play Crang in that moment,

178
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,120
but he was playing Crang in a different bit during.

179
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,880
He did the Crang voice.

180
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,080
So Lou Grant and Crang were presenting Lindsay's category.

181
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,920
Wow.

182
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,680
And he does look like a little muscly brain, right?

183
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:56,040
Honestly, he looks like a handsome-ish 70-year-old,

184
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,200
unfortunately, because I was shocked.

185
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,920
Because you assumed he was a tiny little brain.

186
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,920
I thought he was real.

187
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,400
But he more resembled the suit, the Crang.

188
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,840
He looked a lot like the suit with hair.

189
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,560
Crang's Android body with hair.

190
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,320
So I believe his name is Pat.

191
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,160
That's a plus up.

192
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,480
It's too bad that guy had no hair.

193
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,320
Yeah.

194
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,360
That fake guy.

195
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,480
Pat Fraley.

196
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,240
Fraley, I believe is his name?

197
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,200
Anyway, that reminded me of that.

198
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,520
That's a good moment.

199
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,320
So Zach, when I asked you to be on the show,

200
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,960
you came out, I was saying,

201
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,160
well, we usually ask for a few options

202
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,520
or is there stuff you really like

203
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,520
that you wanna talk about?

204
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,120
And you came out with two things.

205
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,240
And the one was turkey legs.

206
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,080
Yes.

207
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,840
Which is, pun intended, the meat of the episode today.

208
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,840
Whoa, Prairie Home, come on, listen up.

209
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,680
Package rose.

210
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,840
Just submit this episode.

211
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,560
I should.

212
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,720
Mail the podcast.

213
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,000
I'll do a little punch up on my old samples

214
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,040
and then this episode.

215
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,200
How about we trade Chris for you?

216
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,920
We'll make like a sports trade.

217
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,800
We'll take the host of Prairie Home as our third man

218
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,280
and you'll go to Prairie Home to be the host.

219
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,800
You gotta move away.

220
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,640
Oh wow.

221
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,040
I have to go to Minneapolis?

222
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,040
And then we get a lot more like guitar plucking.

223
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,080
We hear stories about John Bryan and stuff.

224
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,920
Yeah.

225
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,960
But you had another story as well.

226
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,800
Yes.

227
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,920
When I said like, is there parks,

228
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,240
do you have parks experiences you wanna talk about?

229
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,400
This was just a weird story that came to mind

230
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,680
when I was just trying to think of any park specifics,

231
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,680
but yeah, like the last time I went to Disney,

232
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,320
I went with my girlfriend and her friend

233
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,040
and we were just trying to like,

234
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,320
we hadn't been in a couple of years

235
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,240
and trying to like kind of do everything.

236
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,200
And when we were in Tomorrowland,

237
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,480
we got kind of like, there's this,

238
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,880
harried Disney parks worker just trying to stop anyone

239
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,880
to get like them to listen to like a time share presentation

240
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,800
or something.

241
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,120
And to get that, to do that,

242
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,440
you would get free fast passes to like other rides.

243
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,840
And we like kind of walked by him and we're like,

244
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,280
no, I don't, no way.

245
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,480
And then we thought about it and we're like,

246
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,360
he was saying it was only 30 minutes.

247
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,200
We're like, you know what,

248
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,080
maybe that actually makes sense to go sit

249
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,560
through this weird presentation

250
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,920
and like get a fast pass for anything.

251
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,200
Anything except for Guardians was the deal.

252
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,880
And so eventually we like, you know,

253
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,280
came back to him and said we would do it.

254
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,160
And then we got like,

255
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,760
it was clearly like getting worse and worse

256
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,720
as the time went on where he was like, great,

257
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,280
we just gotta wait for a couple more people.

258
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,840
And then we had to stand there for like 20 more minutes.

259
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,960
And it was like us like trying to decide

260
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,400
if we should leave or not.

261
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,680
And then eventually we get like maybe one other person

262
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,040
tagging along with us.

263
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,640
And then he was like, all right, great.

264
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,760
Now we just have to go to the conference room

265
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,000
in one of the hotels.

266
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,320
And he like takes us out of the park

267
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,320
and we're walking all the way through like,

268
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,480
is it Downtown Disney's?

269
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,040
Is it really like whatever that area is?

270
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,760
So this is from, you were at a Disney vacation club

271
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,960
like booth in Tomorrowland,

272
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,760
which is pretty much just a wagon.

273
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,840
It looks like a rocket.

274
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,080
It looks like a rocket.

275
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,920
Yeah.

276
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,880
With pictures, with like binders and a guy there.

277
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:20,280
And the presentation area is at the Disneyland Hotel,

278
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,760
probably about as far away as you can get.

279
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,960
Like a 25 minute walk for sure.

280
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,800
Yeah.

281
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,520
And like the whole time we're like,

282
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,800
we should probably leave.

283
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,600
We made a mistake,

284
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,600
but he's clearly been doing this for 20 years or whatever.

285
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,800
And he's so used to people trying to walk away.

286
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,080
Like he started telling the story and it was like,

287
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,040
I think he had like, he would never stop talking as well,

288
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,400
just to like never give you the opportunity to say,

289
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,880
actually, I think we want to leave.

290
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,960
And he launched like as we were like out walking

291
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,320
out of the park to Downtown Disney or whatever,

292
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,920
to the hotel, he starts going into his conspiracy theory

293
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,600
about Princess Di and Dodie Faye.

294
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,440
What?

295
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,440
Where he was like, let's just say,

296
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,560
I don't give England any of my money.

297
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,680
And was for sure, he was trying to say like,

298
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,120
they were assassinated.

299
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,040
And he was like, I've been to,

300
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,280
I've gone to his apartment and like,

301
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,040
I've made a trip there.

302
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,440
I think, just like kind of, we never got his full take,

303
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,840
but it was just so weird in the middle of this,

304
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,440
you get these benefits and these benefits.

305
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,440
And I don't think Dodie Faye was a regular car crash.

306
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,600
Obviously you get the fast pass,

307
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,160
just like peppered in perfectly,

308
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,040
just like a sketch character or something.

309
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,920
And like, it's just this bizarre string of events

310
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,400
where like he's now launching into this.

311
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,680
And now I'm just like snapped back into it.

312
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,000
Like I was trying to leave and now I'm like,

313
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,640
I have to hear every opinion you have about this.

314
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,440
But it didn't really like,

315
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,680
that was basically the ceiling of the Princess Di opinions.

316
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,320
Like I was trying to get more out of them,

317
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,240
but he like wouldn't really, at a certain point,

318
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,920
I think he knew he had us hooked.

319
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,480
And then we get to the hotel

320
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,360
and it seems like the presentation has started.

321
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,120
And like his attitude completely changes

322
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,440
now that he thinks he missed it.

323
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,080
And this like 45 year old man starts running around

324
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,160
the Disney hotel, like in his slacks,

325
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,880
tucked into his like polo shirt going, oh fuck, oh shit.

326
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,560
What?

327
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,880
He's actually cussing.

328
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,480
And like, we're like, wow, this is really interesting.

329
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,800
And we like follow him.

330
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,240
And eventually he finds the room

331
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,560
where the presentation's going on

332
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,400
and like they were able to sneak us in

333
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,240
and we heard a really sad presentation appealing to like,

334
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,840
don't you wanna secure your children's futures

335
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,320
just in case anything happens to you?

336
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,440
Don't you want them to have a vacation?

337
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,640
And it's like, that's what the cell

338
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,280
for the Disney parks thing is.

339
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,880
In case you die in a limo crash mysteriously.

340
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,560
What year was this?

341
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,240
This was like a year and a half.

342
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,840
It was right before Star Wars.

343
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,080
I haven't been there since the Star Wars stuff is open,

344
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,000
but like it was right before that.

345
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,120
Oh, so in 2018, I mean, everybody's thinking

346
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,640
about Princess Di and Dodie.

347
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,640
This is a different time you have to keep in mind.

348
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,320
That's what I wanted, historical context for it.

349
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,280
Yeah, so that makes so much more sense.

350
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,600
I wonder if that's like, cause he,

351
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,600
obviously like, cause there's tips when you're like,

352
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,120
like standing outside a grocery store

353
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,840
and you want people to sign a petition.

354
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,960
The tip I've always heard and I've never done that

355
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,760
is you like, you put something in their hands

356
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,200
and then they can't leave cause they have part,

357
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,280
like your thing and then you don't take it back from them.

358
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,400
Like you put your hands down

359
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,160
and then you're like leaving them holding it,

360
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,600
which is a psychological trick for doing that.

361
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,240
So this guy has obviously figured out

362
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,960
a good way to walk and do that.

363
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,080
It was so stressful.

364
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,280
And then also he like had our cell phone numbers

365
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,960
when we like signed the book thing.

366
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,320
And so like, he called us when it was time to go

367
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,560
do the thing and that's like kind of,

368
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,880
we were like kind of close enough that we're like,

369
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,720
I guess we could try it.

370
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,840
And then like after we had done the presentation,

371
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,680
he was like, he called us and he was like,

372
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,360
I just want, I think you guys are really great

373
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,800
and I want to set you up with a little gift.

374
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,960
And we're like, oh cool.

375
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,160
Like, well, I have no idea what this is going to be.

376
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,360
We walked back over to the booth and it's like,

377
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,560
some incredible two stickers.

378
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,560
And like one of those like FastPass like bracelet things

379
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,040
that like you can scan instead of a,

380
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,320
like it was almost, it was a bunch of trash.

381
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,360
I want to set you up with some stickers.

382
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,120
I pulled some strings, my sticker contact.

383
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,040
We're like all 30, like, okay.

384
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,040
You met the Willy Loman of like Timeshare presentations

385
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,720
of like wrapping it up, like kind of like.

386
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,440
It was really upsetting.

387
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,120
Did they offer, cause when I did,

388
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,720
I did it like six months ago and I was alone.

389
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,600
I was at the Disneyland Hotel working on my computer

390
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,440
and a woman came over and I thought she was going to like

391
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,080
arrest me for just loitering.

392
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,040
And she said, she was like, ask her any questions.

393
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,880
And then I realized, oh, she's trying to get me

394
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,360
to do a presentation.

395
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,240
And then she explained the FastPass and I was like,

396
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,320
you know what, I should do this.

397
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,040
So I did it and I was alone in the room.

398
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,040
But then after I was done with the sad presentation.

399
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,960
Only you getting the presentation.

400
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,520
It was me and me alone.

401
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,440
I was asking a ton of questions.

402
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,400
And I was like trying to.

403
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,240
I was real interested.

404
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,840
I was trying to, I would say like,

405
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,160
oh, so this is like an investment.

406
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,160
And he goes, no, no, no, no, we can't say investment.

407
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,640
It's not an investment.

408
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,480
I was like, oh, okay.

409
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,720
But like you own something.

410
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,880
Yes, you own something, but we can't say investment.

411
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,120
And I go, what if I wanted, cause like, well,

412
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,640
basically what it works, how it works is like,

413
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,680
you have a home resort.

414
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,520
So you pick one of the hotels that's your quote unquote

415
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,120
home resort, but then you get a certain amount of points

416
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,640
every year to get a different hotel anywhere

417
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,480
around the world.

418
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,600
And they have properties everywhere.

419
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,840
Properties everywhere.

420
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,960
I assure you they have properties everywhere.

421
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,440
Yeah, but there's only like two hotels left

422
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,720
that you can have be your home resort.

423
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,080
Cause like rooms have filled up on every everything else.

424
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,760
So I would say like, well, can I get like a Polynesian

425
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,600
or that's like sold out?

426
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,360
He goes, well, I can see what I can do.

427
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,280
And I'd be like, well, what do you mean?

428
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:15,080
You can see what you can do to like things come open.

429
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,920
He goes, all I can tell you is I can see what I can do.

430
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,120
It's like carbine.

431
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,960
Right.

432
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,800
And I was like, well, I gotta check.

433
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,640
Right.

434
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,480
So there's like a whole level.

435
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,560
He goes, my job is to make you happy.

436
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,760
He said, it's like a robot.

437
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,600
Like, yeah.

438
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,120
Do you want me to kiss you?

439
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,240
I can do that.

440
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,880
He does seem pre-programmed with 25 phrases.

441
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,200
So it's pretty interactive.

442
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,040
Yes.

443
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,800
He's triggering distinct answers,

444
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,520
but he'd run out at some point.

445
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,520
Yeah.

446
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,600
And then he goes, so what I can do is if you do,

447
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,480
didn't that, did they do this?

448
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,080
I'm just tripping all over my words.

449
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,440
Did they offer you like a year's worth of points

450
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,000
if you signed up today?

451
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,840
Yeah.

452
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,200
There was like a PowerPoint that had like

453
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,280
certain point values.

454
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,720
And I think the guy, like my girlfriend's friend,

455
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,280
Dave is like, and my friend, I should say,

456
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,920
he was like pretty savvy with this stuff

457
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,400
and started crunching the numbers in the room

458
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,440
and whispered to us, he was like,

459
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,680
you have to go like literally every weekend or something

460
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,360
for this to be worth it.

461
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,200
Yeah.

462
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,040
It's insanely expensive.

463
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,480
It's for people who want to go every year

464
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,640
or every other year.

465
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,960
I mean, that's what my family was in it in the 90s.

466
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,120
And we would, there was a few years where we went every year

467
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,880
where we would bank the points.

468
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,960
And one year we went for two weeks.

469
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,280
And that is a long time to be in the bubble.

470
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,360
Like that, I mean, we definitely did SeaWorld

471
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,920
and Universal, like we did other stuff too.

472
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,920
But at the time, Old Key West was like the main,

473
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,840
that was the Vacation Club Hotel.

474
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,680
Right.

475
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,080
And there weren't a ton, I think shortly thereafter,

476
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,600
they opened up the Boardwalk Hotel in Florida

477
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,160
to be Vacation Club.

478
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,320
But they're building a fourth tower at Disneyland,

479
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,160
the Disneyland Hotel.

480
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,560
North tower, it sounds so.

481
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,600
The fourth tower.

482
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,000
The fourth tower four, building four.

483
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,920
Building four over just a patch of grass

484
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,040
at the Disneyland Hotel.

485
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,840
So that could be a home resort in the future.

486
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,680
When we got back from Disney World,

487
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,480
I feel like you guys were trying to sell me

488
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,480
just for no reason on why it might be a good idea for me.

489
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,480
I'm gonna get the stat wrong.

490
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,480
I know exactly what you're saying,

491
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,760
but we were not selling you on doing it.

492
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,720
I've tried to sell you on a number of different things

493
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,120
over the years, but I think we were just explaining to you

494
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,040
and you were feeling like we were trying to sell you

495
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,760
because you were like, I don't need that.

496
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,560
And I was like, no, I think I was just explaining it.

497
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,720
I think I shouted, Mike.

498
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,120
Well, there was force is what I'm saying.

499
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,600
I don't think, you didn't shout,

500
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,560
but I remember you going like,

501
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,120
well, I'm not gonna use that.

502
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:40,960
I'm not gonna go up a year.

503
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,960
In my memory, and I'm probably wrong,

504
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,440
but my probably false memory of it

505
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,480
is you guys came to a point that was like,

506
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,520
well, I mean, it makes sense if you're gonna go

507
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,600
like six times a year.

508
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,120
Well, that's exactly, no, we were here.

509
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:50,960
I know exactly the memory.

510
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,800
I'm not gonna go six times a year.

511
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,960
You were standing in the corner,

512
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,240
they backed you up into it.

513
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,600
I broke a lamp or two.

514
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,760
We had a contract.

515
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,800
I felt their sweat against my face.

516
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,760
Scott, it just seems like you're the type of person

517
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,040
who would like to secure your family's vacation future.

518
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,280
I mean, you know.

519
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,120
God forbid something happens.

520
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:07,960
That's what we were trying to do.

521
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,160
Don't you want some leisure?

522
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,280
I mean, all those hard times.

523
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,320
I guess love in my life is important.

524
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,240
Are you saying I won't have it if I don't do this?

525
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,240
That's what he's saying.

526
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,360
I'm not saying anything.

527
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,480
I'm just here to make you happy.

528
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,760
You're just being my buddy.

529
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,600
You're just seeing what you can do.

530
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,520
Absolutely, absolutely.

531
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,280
I am trying to steer you away from the reset,

532
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,000
this aftermarket, like the secondary market.

533
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,080
The shady aftermarket,

534
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,840
which is a thing we will get into eventually.

535
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,640
Can I have the Polynesian as my home hotel?

536
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,560
Well, you can see what you can do.

537
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,000
Okay, all right.

538
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,800
We'll see what we can do.

539
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,880
Zach, did they offer you a ride like they offered me?

540
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,520
To where? I've said this before.

541
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,040
Exactly.

542
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,880
I was offered at the end of my presentation,

543
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,880
do you need a ride anywhere?

544
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,000
Now, I stupidly said, no, I'll just, I'll walk out.

545
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
And I go, where would you take me?

546
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,600
He goes, well, anywhere you wanna go, the parks or,

547
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,280
I go, how would you take me there?

548
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,600
And he's like, well, like a golf cart or,

549
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,840
and I was like, no, no, I'm good.

550
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,280
And then I left going, what the hell is wrong with me?

551
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,560
I'm never taking a golf cart

552
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,480
from the Disneyland Hotel into Disneyland.

553
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,680
That could have been really fun.

554
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,840
Yeah.

555
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,200
They did not offer us a ride.

556
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,200
And also so deep down in me, I had to leave immediately.

557
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,440
You know, like I was, as soon as we sat down,

558
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,000
I was like, this feels wrong.

559
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
This feels bad.

560
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,240
Like there's a couple other families that were like,

561
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,280
I don't know.

562
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,800
I don't know how earnestly they were considering it,

563
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,560
but it made me feel so bad.

564
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,120
Not that that's the worst.

565
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,520
Like obviously there are people who would love to do that

566
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,560
and it would make sense for them.

567
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,120
But like, I just felt it in my bones

568
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,520
that I had to like break through a wall to get out of there.

569
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,760
So he may have shouted at you

570
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,000
as you were running out the door.

571
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,320
Well, give your ride somewhere.

572
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,960
Give me those fast passes, I gotta go.

573
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,120
Yeah.

574
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,760
So you're saying you wanted to go back to the theme park

575
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,080
that you'd paid to attend.

576
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, pretty much.

577
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,520
Seemed appealing.

578
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,680
But we used the fast passes

579
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,560
and I think all things considered was a better deal.

580
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,000
I think it was better than waiting in a line

581
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,240
just for the experience.

582
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,480
It's akin to waiting in a line.

583
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,560
It's similarly tedious, but a unique experience.

584
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,000
Right, it felt bizarre enough to like,

585
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,480
I will still remember it for a long time.

586
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,840
Did they make you look at the fake hotel room?

587
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,800
No, they did not.

588
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,640
Wow.

589
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,400
Interesting. Different presentation.

590
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,560
2019 is different.

591
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,840
Are you aware that there's a previous correlation

592
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,520
between the Disneyland Resort and Princess Diana

593
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,560
that there was this ride,

594
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,000
there was supposed to be a very fast limo ride

595
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,440
that they had to cancel because of a,

596
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,280
it was supposed to be a ride

597
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,480
where a paparazzi were chasing you in a limo.

598
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,320
What?

599
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,240
It was gonna be a madcap trip

600
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,680
and then that incident occurred

601
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,680
and they were like, we can't do that

602
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,800
and it became a very slow moving ride

603
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,880
that was very like tedious and bad

604
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,080
and considered one of the worst rides of all time.

605
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,280
Does that ride, that ride doesn't exist anymore?

606
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,360
It's what Monsters Inc. is now, if you've been on that.

607
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,280
We did a whole episode about it,

608
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,960
but Monsters Inc. is a redress of this ride

609
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,400
where a slow limo took you to see Drew Carey

610
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,160
and Cindy Crawford

611
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,880
and played by bizarre mannequins.

612
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,080
Jackie Chan, Tim Allen, Whoopi Goldberg,

613
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,480
and they all look like bizarre, like bad drawings.

614
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,800
Like Thunderbird puppets.

615
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,680
Like DC Follies type.

616
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:31,560
So there has been Princess Diana Disneyland.

617
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,840
Cross over.

618
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,360
Wow, that is so weird.

619
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,800
I was not aware of that at all.

620
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,360
I don't know if that guy would be bothered

621
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,160
by that fact as well.

622
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,880
Not only is it a conspiracy,

623
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,480
but also it ruined what could have been a different ride.

624
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,440
I wonder if he maybe worked on the early iterations

625
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,360
of that ride and that being ruined made him.

626
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,080
Oh, and it's deep.

627
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,840
So then when the incident happened,

628
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,080
then he is like, okay, new pitch.

629
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,320
It's a ride where we take you deep inside the conspiracy

630
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,720
and we tell the truth of what happened to Doty

631
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,560
and then they're like,

632
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,080
oh, maybe you could go work in Timeshares instead.

633
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,920
He's been stewing about it for 15, 20,

634
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,920
or however long, 30 years.

635
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,160
I don't mean to distract from everybody.

636
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,480
Edwin is using a sandal as a pillow.

637
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,760
I got a good POV for a picture.

638
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,160
You can get a picture of Edwin with that.

639
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,960
I'll do that if we wanna figure out our next bit of business.

640
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,800
Beautifully.

641
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,640
Yeah, for sure.

642
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,200
It's really dramatic in front of a fireplace.

643
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,880
Yeah, it is really.

644
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,840
So yeah.

645
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,760
He looks like Bane from Berserk.

646
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,800
Oh my God, he does.

647
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,640
Oh.

648
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,200
Okay, check the Twitter.

649
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,280
We'll be posting photos of this Bane dog.

650
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,440
You know, you get, like a child,

651
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,080
the dog is like, I take photos of him.

652
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,240
So I have to really assess like,

653
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,960
is this a new original photo?

654
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,880
This is something I don't have in my phone already,

655
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,600
and I do not have this in my phone.

656
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,960
It's pretty good, yeah.

657
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,080
All legs deep down wish to be humped.

658
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,080
Brother.

659
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,240
Edwin's Bane voice.

660
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,080
It's pretty good.

661
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,000
I was trying to think of like what it is.

662
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,680
That's what comes off the top of my head.

663
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,280
The first trailer was like,

664
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,440
Oh yeah.

665
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,840
Unintelligently, yeah, you couldn't.

666
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,800
And it felt like they re-recorded the voice,

667
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,840
much like they probably did with Doolittle.

668
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,560
The first time he did it.

669
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,240
Cause if you watch Doolittle,

670
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,400
a lot of the lines look ADR'd.

671
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,240
Oh.

672
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,000
So I assume whatever voice he was doing

673
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,640
when they shot the movie, you couldn't understand.

674
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,040
We've been doling out, oh sorry.

675
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,120
People of England.

676
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,440
I talk to our animals.

677
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,960
Robert Downey Jr.'s voice?

678
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,560
Yeah, he was doing the Bane voice.

679
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,400
Oh.

680
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,960
He made a choice.

681
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,560
You know, have you seen this movie called Dark Knight Rises?

682
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,840
Why no, I haven't.

683
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,920
There's a voice that's a little similar,

684
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,400
I'm gonna tell ya.

685
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,720
Please don't yell at me, Robert.

686
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,800
Do what you want.

687
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,240
So bizarre to me to be like,

688
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,760
you know what, I'm finally out of the Iron Man world,

689
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,640
and they'd be like, next up,

690
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,640
a couple of Doolittle movies probably.

691
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:10,640
A man without a franchise is a man with no structure.

692
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,160
He replaced drinking and drugs with a franchise,

693
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,280
and he needs his next one.

694
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,120
Yeah.

695
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,160
And look, we're obviously gonna get 10 Doolittles.

696
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,640
We'll get the avatar, like an avatar amount of Doolittles.

697
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,280
Does it end after the credits?

698
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,440
Is there a scene with like a hippo or something?

699
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,280
Hippo with an eye patch?

700
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:31,240
We're building a, we're putting together a team.

701
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,960
We stayed till, Jason and I stayed till the end.

702
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,800
There is not an end-end credits,

703
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,680
but there is a tag, there's a mid-credit tag.

704
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,640
Where you find out a character dies

705
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,600
more gruesomely than you thought.

706
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,200
Yeah, it's less of a tease,

707
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,880
it's less of a tease and more of like a snuff film.

708
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,200
Yeah.

709
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,440
It's very weird.

710
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,800
Can we say, all right, skip one minute ahead

711
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,640
if you don't want spoilers.

712
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,280
What is this, what happened?

713
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,960
It's Michael Sheen's character,

714
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,800
who's one of the only characters.

715
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,840
Michael Sheen's in this movie?

716
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,680
Yeah, he's like the bad guy.

717
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,920
He's the bad guy.

718
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,560
And he's like, at least you can understand what he's saying.

719
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,600
At least that's nice,

720
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,520
that's the nice part about his moments in the movie.

721
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,720
Like you understand what he's saying,

722
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,480
you know like he's mad at Doolittle.

723
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,200
And he's playing the level of like camp,

724
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,240
like excitement.

725
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,080
Yeah.

726
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,760
Like Steve Martin and that live action Looney Tunes.

727
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,600
Each animal.

728
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,440
The genitalian.

729
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,280
Yeah, he's fun in that, yeah.

730
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,120
Yes, each animal in Doolittle

731
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,640
is having their own movie, separately from the movie.

732
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,280
And then Doolittle,

733
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,160
you can't understand half of what he says.

734
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,640
And then Michael Sheen, at least you can understand him

735
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,440
and you know he's mad at Doolittle and he hates Doolittle.

736
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,120
So then there's like a tag where,

737
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,600
it just seems like he gets murdered by bats.

738
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,440
Yeah.

739
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,920
No.

740
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,040
That's it, yeah.

741
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,320
He just gets to like, we're like,

742
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,240
cause I thought it pops back up during the credits

743
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,320
and we're like, oh yeah, here we go, this is Doolittle too.

744
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,960
And then it's, no, no,

745
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,200
it's Michael Sheen getting murdered by bats.

746
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,320
What's the Jared Leto movie called?

747
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,160
Morbius?

748
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,000
Yeah.

749
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,840
Michael Morbius.

750
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,000
Yeah.

751
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,040
Oh, if Sheen was in Morbius, that's a good idea.

752
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,080
They cross over the Doolittle and Spider-Man universes.

753
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,080
Just to clarify,

754
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,960
you know that he was,

755
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,240
you know he was killed by bats,

756
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,480
but then you see him get more killed by bats.

757
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,320
Or the bats are new information.

758
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,880
Well now he just kinda got fucked up and disappeared.

759
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,640
Yeah, cause they end the movie.

760
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,480
Have we spoiled the movie on the podcast yet?

761
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,320
A little bit.

762
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,760
We talked about the dragon's butt.

763
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,600
Yeah, we talked about that.

764
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,520
Dragon, so yeah, if you didn't hear it,

765
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,400
they pull bagpipes out of a dragon's asshole.

766
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,920
That's the end of the movie and the dragon like farts

767
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,760
and then Doolittle's like,

768
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,200
rrrr, rrrr, rrrr, rrrr.

769
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,120
And you don't understand what he's saying.

770
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,000
He's like a Tusken Raider or something in Star Wars.

771
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,720
You really can't understand what he's saying.

772
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,280
And then yeah, Michael Sheen just gets like fucked up,

773
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,040
like cartoonishly suggested

774
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,120
that he gets like kinda fucked up by bats.

775
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,200
And then they just post credits to make you know,

776
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:56,680
no, no, no, I want you to know he gets fucked up by bats.

777
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,560
Like that's how they want you to know that.

778
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,280
And then they cut to more of that Jurassic World lady

779
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,560
dying at the hands of the,

780
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,400
meanwhile.

781
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,880
The assistant getting dragged by,

782
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,360
what did the water dinosaur do it?

783
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,200
Or did it care at all?

784
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,800
It was a combination, but yeah, ultimately

785
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,840
the water dinosaur.

786
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,680
They teamed up.

787
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,520
But they do like micro closeups of which bones shattered.

788
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,640
Just really want you to know, this is a very tough death.

789
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,560
They do like the Simpsons season one gag

790
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,040
where she's in the ambulance, she gets loaded into it,

791
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,400
goes up a hill and then the ambulance gets attacked

792
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,320
by a dinosaur and she spills over the cliff,

793
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,960
crashing all the way down into the water again.

794
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,920
And with each land a different dino chomps

795
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,520
a different piece of her off.

796
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,640
Yes.

797
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,280
Pterodactyl, raptor.

798
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,280
Don't text around children until this happens to you.

799
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,400
Right, cosmically she deserved that.

800
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,800
Yeah, don't be doing your job or whatever.

801
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,600
I forgot what I was gonna say.

802
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,760
Oh well, I guess we could talk about turkey legs.

803
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,800
Yeah, I think it's, yeah well speaking of,

804
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,160
yeah, eating flesh.

805
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,120
Number one on our list of two things.

806
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,280
Ding ding ding, it's the sound of the dinner bell

807
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,040
and everyone comes a running.

808
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,840
Just more of that great frary hunk of a.

809
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,560
This has become a killer peg.

810
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,080
It's come from a maybe you've got a chance

811
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,200
to you're on fire.

812
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,040
You're shooing.

813
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,200
Just don't call me late for dinner.

814
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,040
Yeah.

815
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,960
That's good too, can we use that?

816
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,960
Yeah, absolutely.

817
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,680
So turkey legs.

818
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,040
Turkey legs, can I say, I wanna start with,

819
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,160
did everyone see the Snopes question?

820
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,000
Have you Googled it?

821
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,840
Yeah.

822
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,400
And I just wanna start with that.

823
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,120
There's a question that people have asked,

824
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,400
are Disney's turkey legs really emu legs?

825
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,880
Oh, I've heard that post before, I never heard the answer.

826
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,720
False.

827
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,560
False, okay.

828
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,880
So I just wanted to spell that myth right off the bat.

829
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,480
This rumor was propagated, I believe,

830
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,400
maybe a Conan appearance by Zachary Levi,

831
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:04,320
who said that he knows employees who told him that.

832
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,520
So he's like, I think it was maybe a little dead

833
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,480
and then he cracked it back open.

834
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,240
And then I have my own Snopes tangentially,

835
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,400
but relatedly, are the rumors true

836
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,960
that Zach Levi is the king of Comic-Con?

837
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,320
When will he answer this?

838
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,040
I have an answer, hell yeah.

839
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,800
Wow, confer true.

840
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,640
True.

841
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,720
No need to go to Snopes on that one.

842
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,840
I've snuck into Nerd HQ, the hottest Comic-Con party.

843
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,680
He's DJing.

844
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,720
The ZL is DJing.

845
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,680
He's holding court.

846
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,520
He's holding court.

847
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,120
I'm holding court, cause he's a nerd.

848
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,800
He's actually a nerd.

849
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,960
Yeah, what's the show he was on?

850
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,880
He was on Chuck.

851
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,600
Chuck, Chuck was the biggest nerd.

852
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,720
He was on Chuck, he was on telenovela.

853
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,840
But Chuck, he was a nerd.

854
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,640
Straight up nerd, dork.

855
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,840
I believe that the season telenovela came out,

856
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,040
the Heroes reboot or continuation.

857
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,480
I think he was on that too.

858
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,480
There was one NBC season where he was on two shows.

859
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,640
He was the face of two shows.

860
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,840
To save the network.

861
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,640
There's Heroes content on another episode coming up.

862
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,000
Do you guys know why offhand teaser?

863
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,080
I can't remember what we recorded, so no.

864
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,680
Because we've sinned and God is punishing us.

865
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,520
That's why.

866
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,800
Stay tuned for Heroes.

867
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,440
I think you'll run into it too.

868
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,720
Yeah, anyway.

869
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:32,440
So did you see the, there's a funny quote on that Snopes

870
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,040
from Tim Williams of Gatorland.

871
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:39,200
An emu leg is eight times larger than a turkey leg.

872
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,560
If you're going to walk around with an emu leg

873
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,440
in a theme park and shoe on it,

874
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,760
you'd have to get a cart with wheels

875
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,600
to push that thing around.

876
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,440
They're huge.

877
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,320
I'm picturing the Flintstones here.

878
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,160
Yeah.

879
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:56,920
Sort of a dinosaur themed, but 50s style theme park.

880
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,920
Oh yeah.

881
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:01,720
I actually have something related to the Flintstones

882
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,960
about turkey legs.

883
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,360
Because, so I think the,

884
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,280
as you look at articles or videos about it,

885
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,960
what people seem to respond to about having a big turkey leg

886
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,760
is the primal nature of it.

887
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,320
That it feels very caveman.

888
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,800
That you're just biting into a big dumb thing.

889
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,720
And I watched a clip from a show that I love

890
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,240
and have watched many times, Unwrapped,

891
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,600
hosted by Mark Summers.

892
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,120
Where he tells you how Cracker Jacks

893
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,720
or M&Ms are made or whatever.

894
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,080
And he did an all Disney episode

895
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,320
and there's a turkey legs section of it.

896
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,920
And they talked to an employee

897
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,680
who's describing why people like turkey legs.

898
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,960
And she's like, I think it's just, you like,

899
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,040
like biting into a big thing like a caveman.

900
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,160
Like you take a big bite,

901
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,960
just like those little Flintstones.

902
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,960
Just little.

903
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,320
Famously little Flintstones.

904
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,600
I really like that they're little.

905
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,280
I guess because they're like the Smurfs, right?

906
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,920
Yeah, I think so, yes.

907
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,800
If they're cartoons on TV, they are little.

908
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,440
The Flintstones are. They do look short.

909
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,920
They're three apples tall.

910
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,760
If the Flintstones walked in here right now,

911
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,400
they'd be Edwin's height.

912
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,680
We'd have to like keep them away from Edwin.

913
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,080
Might chop their heads off.

914
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:09,920
Wow.

915
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,960
I was trying to think of why I liked

916
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,440
turkey legs so much as well.

917
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,640
And like, you know, come back to the, you know,

918
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:21,000
I would get them as a kid going to like theme,

919
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,840
to Disney specifically.

920
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,880
Like whenever I'd go, I'd get like a turkey leg.

921
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,720
And that was such a treat.

922
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,800
And like, before that, like, I think I was like

923
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,480
a pretty picky child.

924
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,120
Like, you know, like my parents had to like,

925
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,320
there's just like a family story is that

926
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,280
they would have to tell me things were chicken all the time

927
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,680
in order for me to eat them or whatever.

928
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,520
And I'd only eat pizza or whatever.

929
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,080
And like, thinking about it today, I was like,

930
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,400
oh, I think I just like liked cartoons

931
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,280
and wanted to eat what cartoons.

932
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,400
And that's like very much chicken, you know,

933
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,200
like a little like drumstick or whatever.

934
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,400
And then a turkey leg is so that,

935
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,600
especially considering Flintstones.

936
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,640
Just like a little dumb kid who wanted to eat cartoon food.

937
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,480
Yeah.

938
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,600
You would request it.

939
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,440
A turkey leg?

940
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,280
Yeah.

941
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:08,120
Yeah, I mean like, I forget exactly how it started,

942
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,600
but I like for sure thought that looked cool

943
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,320
and wanted one.

944
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,160
It looks like a prop.

945
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,000
You're right.

946
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,840
It looks like a foam rubber piece essentially.

947
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,040
Do you still, if you go to the parks now,

948
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:21,880
are you grabbing one of those?

949
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:25,120
Yeah, I mean like mostly out of nostalgia doing that

950
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:29,440
and like coming to terms with how gross it is now.

951
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,240
Like it's just, it is technically portable,

952
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,880
but then you're just disgusting for,

953
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,640
unless you have to like go to the bathroom

954
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,920
and like wash your hands and face afterwards

955
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,760
and like eat this thing with like bony tendrils in it.

956
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,600
It's pretty gross.

957
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,760
Bony tendrils, a lot of dripping.

958
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,520
Like every article about it,

959
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:52,000
in the New York Times, they say caveman so much.

960
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,440
In the New York Times article about it,

961
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,760
and then they say dripping so much.

962
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,600
Yeah.

963
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,040
It's always dripping.

964
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,880
And I'm like, that's a negative of it.

965
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,400
I mean, I like, I don't want it dry certainly.

966
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,200
I like that, for one, I like that it's dark meat.

967
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,360
We were a big dark meat house.

968
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,120
It is a very good like bang for your buck

969
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,400
in terms of food there.

970
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,480
And I think it's just because you can really go to town

971
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,640
on one of those for a while

972
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,640
until you feel really bad about yourself.

973
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,480
Yeah.

974
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,880
And like, so you're like, I don't know.

975
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,800
I feel like there are a lot of things you can get

976
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,800
at theme parks in Disney or whatever,

977
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,000
where it's like, I'm not really full

978
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,720
and like I spent way more money than I thought.

979
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,680
I'd prefer.

980
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,720
And so, and that way I like it, I guess,

981
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,160
but like it is disgusting.

982
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,800
And it doesn't slow you down is a good thing about it.

983
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,640
You don't like have to,

984
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,480
because sometimes you stop

985
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,200
and have a too expensive Disney meal

986
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,840
and you have two hours out of your day.

987
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,480
You can grab that and go and be in a line,

988
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,200
but you're also dripping juice all over the place.

989
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,480
And you're just like, you have napkins stuck to your hands.

990
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,240
It's just horrible.

991
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,960
If you do think about it, like there must,

992
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,320
they sell a lot of these still.

993
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,440
It's something like.

994
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,560
This is where unwrapped would be helpful.

995
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,960
It's exactly what they're bread and butter.

996
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,800
Among the six domestic parks,

997
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,000
they sell two million of these a year.

998
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,680
So, wow, two million a year.

999
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,880
So imagine how much residue is all over the park.

1000
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,320
If there's like a black light that could tell what turkey,

1001
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,440
like turkey residue.

1002
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,160
The greasy wax paper.

1003
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,520
That's what kind of gives me,

1004
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,400
because Zach, I was like you as a kid,

1005
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,000
as a chubby middle schooler, every trip I was like,

1006
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,400
well, I gotta have my turkey leg.

1007
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,880
I gotta have one turkey leg.

1008
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,240
I especially liked that.

1009
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,840
I mean, this comes up in articles too.

1010
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,680
It tastes a little like ham.

1011
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,760
It's weird.

1012
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,240
I like that it was smoky.

1013
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,840
It tasted like ham.

1014
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,360
I like pastrami for that.

1015
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,800
I like things that tasted like ham.

1016
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,560
I really have to talk about it until you said that,

1017
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,680
but that is so true.

1018
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,520
It does taste like ham.

1019
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:59,280
It tastes like ham because it's cured in a salt solution,

1020
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:04,280
which you more often associate it with ham than turkey.

1021
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,120
What else tastes like ham though?

1022
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,520
Pastrami tastes like ham

1023
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,080
because it uses a similar curing sort of thing.

1024
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,440
But you're not holding out on any snacks or chips

1025
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,440
or crackers that are ham flavored.

1026
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,760
Well, that depends.

1027
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,960
I'm trying to think now.

1028
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,160
I mean, there are like,

1029
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,840
I feel like there was a lot of bacon flavored stuff.

1030
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,960
I think if it's not meat and tastes like ham,

1031
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,680
it's just like, what am I?

1032
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:34,680
I'm very, I think I feel like it's so technically,

1033
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,440
it's so false feeling in my head

1034
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,760
that I'm like, I can't eat that.

1035
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:42,040
If it's at least meat in some way that it tastes like ham,

1036
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,040
maybe that tricks my brain a little more.

1037
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,640
It's probably liquid,

1038
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,160
at that point it's just liquid smoke

1039
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,920
or powdered smoke flavoring or delicious.

1040
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,880
Would you say ham is your favorite flavor?

1041
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,080
I'm not a bit, not anymore, I don't think.

1042
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,520
As a chubby middle schooler.

1043
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,760
As a chubby, yeah.

1044
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,400
My favorite flavor is ham.

1045
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,240
Is ham.

1046
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,000
Why is it, is it like a,

1047
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,240
is ham kind of more for kids in a way?

1048
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,120
I've definitely lost my taste for it.

1049
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:11,960
I'll have it sometimes.

1050
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,800
Yeah, I don't have it.

1051
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,040
I have no taste for ham.

1052
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:14,880
I will be honest with you.

1053
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,600
Oh, I think it's more of a holiday food.

1054
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,640
Yeah, I used to be like,

1055
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,240
and this feels maybe not that,

1056
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,320
I feel like more kids like ate turkey sandwiches

1057
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,440
and like growing up.

1058
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,840
Yes, that's what I did, yes.

1059
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,520
I would, I don't know, I think my dad liked ham

1060
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,960
and we would get ham sandwiches and, you know,

1061
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,520
I liked ham sandwiches as a little kid

1062
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,360
and like would bring that up to people

1063
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,760
who find that absolutely disgusting today.

1064
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,400
Oh, we would switch it up and then a lot of it,

1065
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,400
like capicola or salami and sounds great, yeah.

1066
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,480
Scrambled eggs with diced ham I still do.

1067
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,320
Oh, sure.

1068
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,160
That's a good diner option.

1069
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,000
I like that.

1070
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,200
That's something diners can't really mess up in my mind.

1071
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:56,000
I prefer it if it seems like fresh or carved

1072
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,680
rather than just like deli meat,

1073
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,640
like kind of torn up and placed in the eggs.

1074
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,400
That's what it usually is, I feel like.

1075
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,080
You're in trouble if you, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1076
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,000
You do that though?

1077
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,840
You dice up ham?

1078
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,720
Well, if I have ham in that, I'll switch it,

1079
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,240
that guy will still switch it.

1080
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,320
I have ham in the house.

1081
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,040
How often do you have ham in the house?

1082
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,880
I usually have turkey, but once in a blue moon

1083
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,400
I'll switch it up and either get like a third

1084
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,040
of a pound of roast beef for third pound of ham.

1085
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:22,860
When you enter.

1086
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,520
It doesn't make that many sandwiches, you know.

1087
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,680
When you enter the house, do you put it up in there

1088
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,240
and you go ham in the house and you raise the roof?

1089
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,960
I guess now.

1090
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,680
From now on.

1091
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,560
Zach, what meats do you have in your apartment?

1092
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,280
I do a lot more turkey now.

1093
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,560
I think just vaguely for health reasons,

1094
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,440
it seems healthier and like, I will occasionally

1095
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,560
have some ham in the house though.

1096
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,600
It's hard because my girlfriend won't eat it

1097
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,760
and so it makes me feel very aware

1098
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:05,360
that I'm the only one eating this ham sandwich stuff.

1099
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1100
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,960
Is that vegetarian or just this taste for ham?

1101
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,300
I think it's more, she'll have poultry and stuff,

1102
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:16,840
but beyond that, tries not to eat pork or beef.

1103
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,840
Have you guys ever shared a turkey leg?

1104
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,680
A big turkey leg.

1105
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,800
Because Disney is like, these are meant for sharing.

1106
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,880
Please share these.

1107
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,240
That's disgusting though.

1108
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,440
Right, like share a turkey leg?

1109
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,720
I think like, she had like a couple of bites of it,

1110
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,560
but was not that interested in it.

1111
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,760
Like last time we went after our time shared

1112
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,920
Prestige and I'm soup.

1113
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:41,000
But like, I'm not like, if the four of us went to Disney

1114
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,280
and shared a turkey leg.

1115
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,720
No, we'd have to get two so we'd pair up.

1116
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,280
I don't know, that's still gross.

1117
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,280
No, no, no, no.

1118
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,080
You would do it.

1119
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,760
You've saved money.

1120
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,000
You've eaten soup after me before at Disney.

1121
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,360
Sure, yeah.

1122
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,840
Mike doesn't like to share.

1123
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,320
Mike doesn't like to like.

1124
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,160
Yeah.

1125
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:03,240
Certainly not turkey leg sharing.

1126
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,600
Like a family passing around a turkey leg,

1127
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,920
get me away from that.

1128
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,560
Yeah, I could see, okay, I could see it

1129
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:15,080
if it was like my child or girlfriend or wife

1130
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:18,160
and she's like, I'm done with this, do you want the rest?

1131
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,000
Okay.

1132
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,960
That's fine.

1133
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,280
But not to alternate, like it's ice cream.

1134
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,320
I gave her like, I was eating it and I was like,

1135
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,160
do you wanna bite?

1136
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,080
And she like had a couple of bites and then gave it back

1137
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,520
and that was the end of the sharing and that felt fine.

1138
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:33,360
That didn't, yeah, I think there's a fine,

1139
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,160
you do hit a tipping point where it's just,

1140
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,200
it's already so gross by yourself.

1141
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,280
And you're getting drippy residue all over the place.

1142
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,120
Yeah.

1143
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,800
And then you're like out of kiss commission

1144
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,720
for a couple hours, I feel.

1145
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,880
Like you don't wanna share and then like

1146
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,360
have a romantic moment.

1147
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,200
Right.

1148
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,200
Yeah, because it tastes like ham.

1149
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,600
Front of the line for me.

1150
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,440
Yeah.

1151
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,080
That's a bass bass.

1152
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,360
Oh.

1153
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,560
Jason likes ham lip balm.

1154
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,400
Oh.

1155
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,400
Ham flavored lip balm.

1156
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,240
There is bacon flavored lip balm.

1157
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,080
I've seen that.

1158
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:09,920
Sure.

1159
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,280
I think, you know, there's been a big,

1160
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,560
like bacon has been meme-ified a lot

1161
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,560
in the last few years.

1162
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,440
It might be a little bit, you might argue it's too much.

1163
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,280
People use it too much.

1164
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,560
I would, yes.

1165
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,840
But maybe it's time for ham

1166
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,080
to become meme-ified a little more.

1167
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,120
Maybe ham in the house is the meme.

1168
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:25,960
I don't know.

1169
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,520
It doesn't have to be, but.

1170
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,320
These certainly got, these have like,

1171
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:34,600
one of the articles said like the massive increase in these

1172
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,200
with the rise of social media,

1173
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:40,400
something like a 25% bump in sales.

1174
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,240
So people can post pictures of themselves.

1175
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,400
You can post pictures of the,

1176
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,680
it's like very photographable.

1177
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,000
And it was already like organically popular.

1178
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,840
Like there used to be one station that had these

1179
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,360
in Frontierland at Disney World,

1180
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,360
big Al's coonskin caps.

1181
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,200
The stand would sell these.

1182
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,040
And that's gone.

1183
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,360
And I believe so.

1184
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,200
Yeah.

1185
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:06,520
My mom, my sisters and my niece all went to Disney World

1186
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,400
like two weeks ago.

1187
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,440
And my mom, when I talked to her right after,

1188
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:13,120
she was like, yeah, I didn't really see any turkey legs.

1189
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,400
And I immediately Googled it.

1190
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,320
And like, there were like two or three places that had them,

1191
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:21,200
but like, I think they're like scaled back in a way.

1192
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,400
Yeah, I think so.

1193
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,200
They were trying to get healthy for a few years there.

1194
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,880
I think now that some of the crazy sweets they sell,

1195
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,680
I feel like they're less concerned about being healthy.

1196
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:36,280
And the Instagram angle is more crazy indulgent stuff.

1197
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,120
So that makes sense.

1198
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,520
It would kind of get a reprise.

1199
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,920
I think it's a little funny that it feels so old timey

1200
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:46,040
of a food, but I was surprised that you had that big Al

1201
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,760
entry point for it that that was only in the mid 80s.

1202
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,480
This has not been a Disney phenomenon for that long.

1203
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,440
It was like State Fair and Renaissance Fair.

1204
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,920
It feels kind of borrowed from that.

1205
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:58,760
For a long time.

1206
00:43:58,760 --> 00:43:59,360
Yeah.

1207
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:02,240
And what I don't think was on the West Coast for a little while.

1208
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,800
And then we demanded it.

1209
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,560
I do have the list of like where you can get them.

1210
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,840
But people might know already.

1211
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,760
Stans, usually stands.

1212
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,960
The only restaurant I can think of that,

1213
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,440
and I don't even know if they still have them,

1214
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:19,640
but they did for a while was the three broomsticks

1215
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,600
in Harry Potter was selling them.

1216
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,680
Oh yeah, they're universal too, right?

1217
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:27,400
I mean, obviously with that, but are they like,

1218
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,920
are there multiple universal spots?

1219
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,280
You get them at Universal Florida?

1220
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,120
That's a good question.

1221
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,960
Well, they got rid of the Flintstones barbecue

1222
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,280
at Universal Hollywood,

1223
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,360
which would have been a perfect place for them.

1224
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,920
Seemed gross as hell.

1225
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,560
Gross as hell, they never ate there.

1226
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,200
At the Disney World thing that I looked at,

1227
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,920
they had one dedicated turkey leg stand

1228
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,320
and then two restaurants that had it.

1229
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:52,760
So it's like not as prevalent as I remember as a kid.

1230
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,160
But you know.

1231
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,440
Well, and for a little while,

1232
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,160
they were really sticking it on a lot of merch.

1233
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,480
Magnets and like cookie shaped like it.

1234
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,120
These weird shirts, does any,

1235
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,920
I don't even know what to call these shirts,

1236
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,880
but this certain kind of art.

1237
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,000
That's like the like guy, the old timey guy saying

1238
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,800
like marijuana cures what ails you.

1239
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,000
Yeah, like beer.

1240
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,520
It's not just for dinner.

1241
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:18,800
Like a 50s advertisement kind of like.

1242
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,640
Yeah.

1243
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:22,440
I remember these posters would be at like Suncoast Video.

1244
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,920
They were like one of the 20 choices of poster

1245
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:27,760
for your stupid high school room or dorm.

1246
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,680
Yeah, I truly, it's so embarrassing

1247
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:31,760
to suddenly remember this.

1248
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,600
All right.

1249
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:36,800
Like middle school Zach had a beer helping white guys dance

1250
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,840
since 1985 or something.

1251
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,440
That was a big one.

1252
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,880
I remember like hitting a point where I was like,

1253
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:47,000
mom, I need some posters and like getting fat.

1254
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,560
I think I had a, oh God.

1255
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,400
Oh yeah, list your posters.

1256
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,240
This is a horrible memory.

1257
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,080
List all your posters.

1258
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:51,920
Oh, that's a good idea.

1259
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,120
I had, oh fuck, this sucks.

1260
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,440
Oh, I'm sorry.

1261
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,280
No judgment, no judgment.

1262
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,520
I think I went to like a Coconuts

1263
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,480
and bought a bunch of posters

1264
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,720
and like I had a Dukes of Hazzard poster.

1265
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:04,640
The movie. The movie?

1266
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,360
No, like I thought it was like, I don't know, ironic.

1267
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,320
I'd never even seen it and you know,

1268
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,160
thought it was cool in some way.

1269
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,960
I think I had, oh God.

1270
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,040
Those are the two that stand out.

1271
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,800
I think I had one or two Simpsons posters,

1272
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,320
but they're like more vague in my brain.

1273
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:27,720
God, very cool stuff.

1274
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,880
I think those were my posters.

1275
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,440
Trying to remember.

1276
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,200
I had an Austin Powers poster.

1277
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,600
Yeah, I had like the first Austin Powers.

1278
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,560
I had the Dr. Evil monologue

1279
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:42,480
about like a Zoroastrian named film,

1280
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,680
Shave My Testicles.

1281
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:44,520
Of course.

1282
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,320
But I was very, I mean, and certainly by college,

1283
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,440
I was very like highfalutin and like,

1284
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,400
my college dorm poster is Punch Drunk Love.

1285
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,240
Yeah, I definitely had.

1286
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,640
People want to punch me.

1287
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,840
I had a freshman year,

1288
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:02,600
I definitely had Fight Club and Donnie Darko.

1289
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,440
Whoa, really?

1290
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,360
Yeah, really on the.

1291
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,760
Then I had Shattered Glass.

1292
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:08,600
I didn't have Boondock Sames.

1293
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:09,600
Shattered Glass.

1294
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,280
Shattered Glass had come out

1295
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,680
and then the art theater, when it left,

1296
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:18,120
they would always just sell the posters for like five bucks.

1297
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:21,280
I somehow eventually ended up with a giant,

1298
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,680
like not like regular movie poster size,

1299
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:26,640
but like really hard cardboard,

1300
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:30,720
like nine feet tall poster of Step Up Two.

1301
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,840
That was like an ironic fun thing

1302
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:35,040
that I like went out of town

1303
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,000
and my mom immediately threw away.

1304
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,120
Oh, I had an ironic roll bounce.

1305
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,120
Similar area.

1306
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,440
That's good.

1307
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,880
Or was it Drumline?

1308
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,680
Oof, I can't recall actually.

1309
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,880
The Simpsons poster with everyone,

1310
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,920
the giant everyone poster.

1311
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,840
I had an X-Men 3 poster that I bought

1312
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:57,560
like six months before the movie came out.

1313
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,400
X-Men 3.

1314
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,240
Wow.

1315
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,240
Because I knew it was gonna be so good.

1316
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,480
Because you fucking love Ratner.

1317
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,560
I love Rat.

1318
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,240
That's why I bought it,

1319
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,640
because I did know Ratner.

1320
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,560
So I was excited to see his take on the material.

1321
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:11,840
I will say X-Men 3, not as bad as people remember it.

1322
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:15,880
Bret Ratner looks like he always just ate a turkey leg.

1323
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:16,720
I had.

1324
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:17,560
Yeah.

1325
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,040
It's just greasy.

1326
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:19,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1327
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,800
I remember working post on a movie

1328
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:26,800
and they were doing Tower Heist on the movie,

1329
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,080
like a floor above me.

1330
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,840
And he like, the times,

1331
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,760
I don't think he was really ever there.

1332
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,520
But there were times where the whole parking lot

1333
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,400
would be blocked by a nice Mercedes

1334
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,240
and that's pulled in diagonally.

1335
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,520
I was like, is Bret Ratner up to help him out?

1336
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,360
God.

1337
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,840
Gotta get the movie ready.

1338
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,920
Eddie's hosting the Oscars.

1339
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,000
T.C. Tommy's in.

1340
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,560
Sounded something like that, right?

1341
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:53,400
Yeah, that's right.

1342
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,920
It's the spirit of it at least.

1343
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:58,040
Eddie's got him produced and he's gonna do it.

1344
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:00,960
More turkey please.

1345
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,120
Michael Jackson and I threw water balloons

1346
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,280
at homeless people.

1347
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,240
Michael and Chris and I.

1348
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,720
That's a true story.

1349
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:08,560
Good God.

1350
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:13,400
Me and MJ and Chris Tucker at a dance party in RPGs.

1351
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:17,320
Look up all those classic clips online.

1352
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,320
We'll probably post them also.

1353
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,440
Ratner rarities coming soon.

1354
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,600
Yeah, add that to that series, yes.

1355
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,640
Spacey, Travolta, we're trying to hit all the creeps.

1356
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:29,480
That might just be the second.

1357
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:32,120
We're not related, but on the second gate anything goes.

1358
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,920
That might just be a second podcast.

1359
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,200
Oh sure.

1360
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,800
Paywall only.

1361
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,320
Your girlfriend already has a podcast

1362
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,480
with creeps in the title,

1363
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:42,240
so I don't want to infringe on her territory.

1364
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,320
We'll figure something out.

1365
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,160
Back to turkey legs.

1366
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,680
Turkey legs.

1367
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,920
I am creeped out by the color.

1368
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,280
I recognize that, yeah.

1369
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:55,360
I recognize that when you put that ham thing together,

1370
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:59,280
that makes sense, but it's also kind of ham colored to me.

1371
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,760
I think I've always reacted adversely,

1372
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,240
and I will admit never had a turkey leg,

1373
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,760
because I don't like the range.

1374
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:10,000
I feel like at best it's pink, which is weird to me,

1375
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,480
and seems raw or not correct or something.

1376
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,600
Well, the meat is pink.

1377
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:15,440
The meat becomes pink, but the skin gets very brown.

1378
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,280
Sure, sure.

1379
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,120
From the smoke.

1380
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,720
Well, I feel like I also see some purple in there,

1381
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:19,880
which is not an appealing.

1382
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,720
You're gonna get some purple.

1383
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:26,200
I mean, that's like kind of dark meat in a weird way has,

1384
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,360
oh, does it have purple?

1385
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,280
Maybe I'm wrong.

1386
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,600
Sometimes, yeah.

1387
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,000
Let's go around the room.

1388
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,680
Dark meat, white meat, everyone?

1389
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,400
What's everyone's feelings?

1390
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,080
As a kid, I think I liked eating the drumstick

1391
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:40,360
because it was fun, but white meat for sure, I think.

1392
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:43,560
White meat now, but yeah, definitely dark as a kid.

1393
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:47,840
And I ate like drumsticks, chicken legs.

1394
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:51,280
I ate shake and bake chicken legs for lunch

1395
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,560
for a lot of high school.

1396
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,480
My mom prepared a batch.

1397
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,320
Wow.

1398
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,880
Yeah, how gross.

1399
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,600
And those don't hold?

1400
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:01,200
They get weird, but I was so picky.

1401
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,080
I guess like, yeah, I don't wanna implicate you

1402
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:04,360
in that gross habit.

1403
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,160
No, I was pretty picky, yeah.

1404
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,800
I would have chicken again, I guess.

1405
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,520
I would eat it, so she made it, but disgusting.

1406
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:14,400
Did you get to go off campus ever for lunch?

1407
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,240
Not so much.

1408
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,080
We never did.

1409
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:17,720
Not allowed or just never did?

1410
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,280
You would have very rare exceptions.

1411
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,840
You got some kind of pass that let you go,

1412
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:24,400
but like almost everyone was not allowed.

1413
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:27,520
And I will say for the record, I am 100% dark meat.

1414
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,360
Amen, brother.

1415
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,080
I mean, come on.

1416
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:35,760
Chicken thigh, that's my adult version of,

1417
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:40,200
just like, I can't just make a batch of chicken legs now.

1418
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,120
I can't justify that to myself.

1419
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:44,880
And it's also not, I don't want to.

1420
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,760
The dark meat seems just inconsistent

1421
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:51,160
and it feels like I'm gonna get a big hunk of fat

1422
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:53,800
and like that's disgusting now.

1423
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:55,640
You're saying that's a good thing?

1424
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:58,200
You gotta, I mean, it's part of the gamble.

1425
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:02,520
I will say though, I do think my feeling on meat

1426
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,080
is changing slowly.

1427
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,480
I'm eating less meat in general.

1428
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,920
I don't really have meat in the apartment anymore.

1429
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:11,440
I have like salmon and that's about it.

1430
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:15,400
And I'll have a hamburger once in a while,

1431
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,600
but when I go to Taco Bell, I go all beans now.

1432
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,880
I all go all black beans.

1433
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,040
It's basically the same, it doesn't really matter.

1434
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,920
The only thing I think I've said before is

1435
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:28,040
hot chicken is my last indulgence.

1436
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:30,480
Which is white meat more so.

1437
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,880
Yeah, really.

1438
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:36,520
So we'll see if they can get an impossible chicken meat

1439
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,240
that fills the need.

1440
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,240
That would be nice.

1441
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:42,880
The chicken imitators out there are not so good.

1442
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,200
Not so good.

1443
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,720
I forget if a Gardein is one of those.

1444
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,640
There's something with an S, I don't dig them.

1445
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:51,720
Yeah, no, I haven't had a good one yet.

1446
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:53,840
I like the impossible burger though.

1447
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:56,720
I'm fine if they all across the board do that.

1448
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:57,560
That's fine with me.

1449
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:00,000
I like seitan if it's prepared well.

1450
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,320
Oh yeah, I don't really like that.

1451
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:02,520
Oh okay.

1452
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:05,040
It's a certain texture, it depends.

1453
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:08,840
Yeah, so yeah, I think I feel like

1454
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,640
the idea of eating dark meat right now is gross.

1455
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,320
I wouldn't do it.

1456
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:18,320
What would you say to just a big seitan turkey leg?

1457
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,160
It's a big, yeah.

1458
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,680
Imitation bone, it's like recycled PVC pipe.

1459
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,320
Does it have the, did they manufacture it

1460
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,040
so that it has the purple in it?

1461
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:31,080
It's got the purple, it's dripping, it's disgusting.

1462
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,080
You gotta have that drip.

1463
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:35,280
Because the impossible burger simulates blood

1464
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,240
in a burger by dripping with red.

1465
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,560
So as long as it drips with purple.

1466
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,280
And you share it with your whole family.

1467
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,760
Share it with your whole family and any friend,

1468
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:48,080
a friend of yours too that might be next to you.

1469
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:49,680
I don't like the scenario where we all

1470
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:50,800
go to Disneyland together.

1471
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,920
I like that part, but we're all at Disneyland together

1472
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,200
and then Jason says, pair off.

1473
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,680
Who's my turkey buddy?

1474
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:01,760
Turkey Tom, who's a little turkey Tom.

1475
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,320
Ooh, I want the purple bite.

1476
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,760
I want a purple bite, save me a purple bite.

1477
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:08,920
Save me a purple bite.

1478
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,000
Really clinging a lot of phrases on this.

1479
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,720
The Tom's are the key.

1480
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,600
The reason these are so big are they're from male turkeys,

1481
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,600
which are called Toms.

1482
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:22,400
Your Thanksgiving turkey is a female turkey, it's a hen.

1483
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,000
You're doing this in a real strange way

1484
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:24,840
with your hands clasped together.

1485
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:25,680
Is that true?

1486
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:26,520
Wow.

1487
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:27,360
It is true.

1488
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:28,200
You're rubbing it in, you never knew that.

1489
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,040
That's the solution.

1490
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,400
It's illegal to, they're not steroided.

1491
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,960
Apparently there's regulations about

1492
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,800
steroiding these things up.

1493
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,680
But they exercise them a lot so the legs get real big.

1494
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:38,520
Oh my God.

1495
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:39,360
Around the track.

1496
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:40,200
Around the track.

1497
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,040
So sad.

1498
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:41,880
Yeah, it's sad.

1499
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:43,920
But.

1500
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,200
These jack turkeys.

1501
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,400
They're jack turkeys.

1502
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,720
I have been in grocery stores where they have

1503
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:52,520
two wrapped turkey legs, big turkey.

1504
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,080
You can make this at home.

1505
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:56,600
I watched a video, it's not that hard to make at home.

1506
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:59,760
I know someone who will do turkey legs for Thanksgiving.

1507
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:00,600
Okay.

1508
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,240
Because, I don't know, that makes sense to me

1509
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:06,240
because I'm not dying to have the other parts of a turkey.

1510
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,960
And I don't know, maybe that's better.

1511
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,680
I don't super look, I guess I appreciate it

1512
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:11,720
when I go home and there's turkey.

1513
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:14,120
But I don't think I would choose.

1514
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:16,160
I'm gonna make the turkey this year.

1515
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:17,800
Not interested.

1516
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:21,600
It's so hard to keep, you just have to keep basting it

1517
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:25,400
if you want it to be moist, if you want it to be.

1518
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:28,880
I like dark meat because it's less dry, part of it.

1519
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:29,720
Yeah, sure.

1520
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:30,560
Sure.

1521
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:35,360
Any meat we had growing up, my mom would cook it

1522
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:38,800
to the point of no moisture so there was no disease.

1523
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:40,600
Oh my God.

1524
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:41,440
Oh my God.

1525
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,920
So we had, yeah.

1526
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:43,760
That's miserable.

1527
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,480
We would have, yeah, if we had chicken or something,

1528
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:48,000
it was as dry as you can imagine.

1529
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:48,840
Oh God.

1530
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:50,720
But as we learned, she's gonna dispute this.

1531
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,960
She will argue, well, she will argue about this though.

1532
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:56,720
I've made this comment for years now

1533
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,440
and she doesn't have too much of a defense against it.

1534
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:01,080
There was a lot of salmonella scares in the 90s.

1535
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,880
So everyone just cooked the hell out of everything.

1536
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:03,920
And mad cow.

1537
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,320
Mad cow, yeah.

1538
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,120
Oh, I remember how stressed we were

1539
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,840
about mad cow as a family.

1540
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,880
But people yelled at us because we were wrong

1541
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:14,200
about how Y2K was a real thing.

1542
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,360
Yeah.

1543
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,320
And we were brazen and dumb about that.

1544
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,240
Are we gonna make fun of mad cow?

1545
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:21,440
And then, well, mad cow was a problem, I guess.

1546
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,240
Right, I think it was a problem.

1547
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,760
It felt like a problem at the time.

1548
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:25,600
No, I don't think so.

1549
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:26,440
It was fake.

1550
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:28,120
Mad cow was fake is what I'm saying.

1551
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,720
Just like Dodie Fayette's death.

1552
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,440
He's out there.

1553
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,600
He's out there.

1554
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,160
It's a conspiracy.

1555
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:41,440
I had a friend who had roommates in college

1556
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,360
or people in his fraternity or something

1557
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:48,000
that got swine flu and had a really fun time

1558
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,720
while they had swine flu.

1559
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:51,560
They were quarantined and just chilled

1560
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:55,360
and I think ended up just smoking a lot of weed

1561
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:56,840
and were fine eventually.

1562
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,240
This was their, whatever they had,

1563
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:02,360
obviously it's possibly a very serious disease

1564
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:04,800
that has killed people, but these weird bros,

1565
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,600
they got it and were fine.

1566
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,200
They had a chill time.

1567
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,040
Yeah.

1568
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,200
It was like a movie.

1569
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,120
Swine flu.

1570
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,240
Swine flu in the house.

1571
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:17,040
Swine flu in the house.

1572
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,240
That's very strange.

1573
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:21,000
Yeah, it's interesting to think about.

1574
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,520
I mean, swine flu was how many years ago?

1575
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:23,840
I mean, it still exists.

1576
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,960
2007 or eight or something like that.

1577
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,080
So I would be very interested to see the statistics

1578
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,680
of how many bros got it is what I'm saying.

1579
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:36,480
Did the bro population droop?

1580
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:37,320
Bros more than.

1581
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,400
It's affecting the bros.

1582
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:42,680
It latches onto their hats.

1583
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:44,680
It latches onto their sports hats.

1584
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,280
When a cap is turned backwards.

1585
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,120
Yes.

1586
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,800
The virus because they're not looking.

1587
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:54,360
Because it's like behind them.

1588
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:57,520
Sales of beer making white people dance

1589
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,320
since they J5 posters plummeted.

1590
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,240
This is only tangentially related.

1591
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:06,440
My roommate in college used to play me,

1592
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,200
the Budweiser real men of genius.

1593
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,160
Campaigns that he had on MP3.

1594
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:14,240
You'd be like, have you heard these?

1595
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,320
What was real men of genius?

1596
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,880
Real men of genius.

1597
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,240
Like sing.

1598
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:21,680
Mr. Zamboni driver.

1599
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,840
Yeah, it was like specific jobs.

1600
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:26,840
Paving the ice so we can play hockey.

1601
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:27,880
And like none of them were.

1602
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:28,720
Yeah.

1603
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,920
And then they would do the jingle again.

1604
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:33,480
And he had them all on MP3.

1605
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,520
That's such a phase that I remember too.

1606
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:39,240
When I had like Kazaa and would try to be

1607
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:42,040
the person who had funny shit on his computer.

1608
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:42,880
Sure.

1609
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:43,720
Oh yeah.

1610
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:46,920
Did you have the only gay Eskimo?

1611
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:47,760
Yes.

1612
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:48,600
Whatever that was.

1613
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:50,840
A live performance on MAD TV

1614
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:53,120
that was a weirdly omnipresent MP3.

1615
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:53,960
Yeah.

1616
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:54,800
Wow.

1617
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:57,960
If you searched funny song or something,

1618
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:01,680
maybe that's somehow just called that.

1619
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:02,520
Or even.

1620
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:03,360
You know like.

1621
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:07,040
Dynamite Hack, Boys in the Hood cover.

1622
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:07,880
God.

1623
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:08,720
Yep.

1624
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:09,560
Yeah, that for sure.

1625
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:10,400
I don't think what else was in this category.

1626
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:13,440
Like the squirrel with like big nuts.

1627
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:16,640
That's still pretty good though.

1628
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:21,400
All the Me First and the Gimme Gimmies albums, right?

1629
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:24,160
The Elmo like shooting someone or something.

1630
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,000
Did anyone?

1631
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,880
Elmo like cussing, like someone doing an Elmo impression

1632
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:32,200
where he like had like a Glock.

1633
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,640
It's been a thoroughly embarrassing podcast.

1634
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,760
This was the last gasp of like,

1635
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,080
not the last cause they're still on

1636
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,040
and making tons of money.

1637
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,160
It's not the last gasp at all.

1638
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,360
Morning radio DJs I feel like,

1639
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,080
now they're this weird little corner,

1640
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:52,480
but that was their last gasp at relevancy maybe

1641
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,200
was their weird songs.

1642
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,680
They're like Monica number five,

1643
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:59,080
Bill Clinton, Mambo number five parody.

1644
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:01,800
Like those kinds of things really spiked on Kazaa,

1645
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,280
an audio galaxy.

1646
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:05,280
What a time.

1647
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:08,880
I have a lot of my music that was on my iTunes still.

1648
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:09,720
Oh really?

1649
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:10,560
It's been floating around.

1650
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:11,400
Mine's been kind of been wiped out.

1651
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,560
Like it's all been reset.

1652
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:15,840
Huh, I'm trying to see if I can find something really great.

1653
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:16,680
I probably won't.

1654
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:17,920
This probably shouldn't even mention it,

1655
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,440
but yeah, I have a lot of,

1656
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:22,120
I did that thing where you can upload your music.

1657
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:24,960
I have Apple music and then you can like pay $20 a month

1658
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,800
and it just uploads all of the things you had on your iTunes

1659
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:28,920
into your cloud.

1660
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:30,000
Oh wow.

1661
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:30,840
So I have like.

1662
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,840
But that really messed some people up, right?

1663
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:35,600
Cause if people had like bootlegs or live record,

1664
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:38,120
like and it couldn't match it.

1665
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:38,960
No, well.

1666
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:39,920
To thematic emission.

1667
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,240
I think it might've done that,

1668
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:42,680
but it should just upload.

1669
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,480
It shouldn't like destroy it.

1670
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:45,320
Oh okay.

1671
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:46,800
It should just upload it as a separate thing.

1672
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:50,600
Cause I have like stuff I did that's uploaded.

1673
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:51,800
Oh that went through, okay.

1674
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:52,640
Yeah.

1675
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:53,720
Your music?

1676
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:54,560
Or a comedy.

1677
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:55,840
Well you're a touring musician though.

1678
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:56,680
Well sure.

1679
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,160
Comedy bits, bad comedy bits.

1680
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:01,200
Oh man.

1681
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,040
There's a whole.

1682
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:02,880
Is this all around?

1683
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:03,720
Is it in the cloud?

1684
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:04,800
A lot of it's in the cloud, yeah.

1685
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:05,680
Wow.

1686
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,040
We're not gonna do it here though.

1687
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:10,720
I have to go through it first.

1688
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:11,560
I understand.

1689
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:13,800
At least a pass of,

1690
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,200
which we didn't allow you, Zach.

1691
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:18,000
You've just been freewheeling with embarrassing shit.

1692
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:18,840
That's okay.

1693
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:21,440
No filter.

1694
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:22,560
I feel like I deserve it.

1695
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,720
After years of taste sin.

1696
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:30,000
What else on turkey legs?

1697
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,520
Nutritional value.

1698
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:32,360
Oh wow.

1699
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:33,200
Look at it.

1700
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,320
720 calories a leg.

1701
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:36,160
Okay.

1702
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,000
720.

1703
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,040
36 grams of fat.

1704
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:39,880
That's a lot, right?

1705
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:40,720
That's a lot.

1706
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,120
What's the salt content?

1707
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:43,800
God, who knows.

1708
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:44,640
Does it say it on there?

1709
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:45,480
Do we have a stat about that?

1710
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:46,320
Let me see.

1711
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:47,680
Let me check the notes.

1712
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,720
When was the last time you had one?

1713
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:50,560
A turkey leg?

1714
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:51,400
Was it in that trip?

1715
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,640
It was this last trip.

1716
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:55,560
So maybe two years ago.

1717
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:01,080
I haven't fully examined my desire to get them,

1718
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:02,520
but I think I try to get,

1719
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:04,480
end up getting one every time I go.

1720
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:05,320
Sure.

1721
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:07,280
I don't know.

1722
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,640
I'm wondering if I'll get one next time.

1723
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,160
It has been such a fixture

1724
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,200
of every theme park experience for me.

1725
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,440
My mom sent me this very cute picture of me

1726
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:23,600
when I'm like four holding a Coke and a turkey leg.

1727
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:26,000
And it's very sweet,

1728
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,520
but it's also very disgusting.

1729
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:30,360
Sure.

1730
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:31,200
Well, you were a kid.

1731
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,040
Yeah.

1732
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:32,880
Sure, sure.

1733
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,480
Jason, was the last time you had one?

1734
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:35,960
Not in a long time.

1735
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:36,800
Okay.

1736
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:37,920
I don't think, maybe high school.

1737
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,080
But even then I feel like we were gravitating more towards

1738
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:44,280
like sit down meals or run and gun.

1739
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:47,320
Cause I feel like the rest of the family would be like,

1740
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:49,240
we want to eat a meal.

1741
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:53,360
Like we don't want to just walk and only eat meat.

1742
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:54,200
There's a problem with it.

1743
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:58,840
I mean, you can't eat bread or a side dish or salt.

1744
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:01,520
Like I don't really dip a turkey leg in anything.

1745
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:05,000
I think one time, no, you don't really dip it.

1746
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,200
And it's like very unwieldy,

1747
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:11,600
but like one time I went and I got a corn on the cob

1748
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:12,520
and a turkey leg.

1749
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:14,200
I think you maybe it were there.

1750
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:15,320
I think it was like our,

1751
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:17,400
like people from our mod team went on it.

1752
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:18,760
Oh, I remember that happening.

1753
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,400
I don't think I ended up going on that trip,

1754
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,440
but I know, but that, okay, that's a good,

1755
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:23,920
you can two hand that.

1756
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:27,600
Yeah, it's still, I mean, when you need a napkin though,

1757
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:28,440
you're done.

1758
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,520
Like you need help from someone for sure.

1759
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:31,920
You do need some help.

1760
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,080
Ice cream when it melts.

1761
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:34,560
Like Edward Scissorhands.

1762
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:38,360
All of those foods, like the stands at Disneyland,

1763
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:41,680
you usually sell a turkey leg, corn on the cob,

1764
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:42,800
chimichanga.

1765
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:43,640
Yes.

1766
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:47,360
And all of those are meant to be portable and run and gun.

1767
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:49,280
And I think I've ordered all of them.

1768
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:50,920
I think in the last few years,

1769
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:54,480
I gravitate more towards the like, I don't know,

1770
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:57,400
I've had the chimichanga more recently.

1771
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:00,880
The corns are right if you just need, you know, a snack.

1772
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,640
I never actually never done that at Disney actually.

1773
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:05,080
The corn is good.

1774
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:07,440
Corn, how do you screw up corn though?

1775
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:08,280
Yeah.

1776
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,880
So I'm sure there are theme parks that do.

1777
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:12,120
It's just tough because you have to like floss

1778
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:12,960
and then you're just like.

1779
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,080
Oh yeah, yeah.

1780
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:14,920
Ooh yeah.

1781
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,480
Oh, that could screw you up for the rest of the day.

1782
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:19,200
I should, I realized when we went recently

1783
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,440
for Rise of the Resistance,

1784
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:23,080
I should have done a turkey leg as research,

1785
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:25,440
but we were like, at this point,

1786
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,120
I just forgot we were gonna do this.

1787
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:32,120
And I'm now so, I really have my Disneyland food down pat,

1788
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:34,480
which is like not really a full sitting lunch,

1789
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:38,360
but you do at some point, you spread out a Ronto wrap

1790
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:41,800
and a bow from Tropical Hideaway.

1791
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:44,720
And I so like, I think I used to like worry

1792
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,200
about eating at Disneyland or like,

1793
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,960
I gotta go outside the park.

1794
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:49,720
And now I know I can stay in the park

1795
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:51,600
and have those things and be set.

1796
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:53,920
I'd probably put corndog in that rotation too

1797
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,680
now that I'm having those.

1798
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,160
I still don't do corndog.

1799
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:58,760
I'm sure I've said it on the podcast before

1800
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:03,120
because I threw up after eating one when I was little

1801
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:04,800
and it's stuck in my head that they're bad.

1802
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,600
It's crazy how long that can stay with you.

1803
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:09,760
Yeah, but I will declare, I mean, I will declare,

1804
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:13,640
I will do it at Disneyland at a certain point.

1805
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:16,160
Build a whole month long event out of it.

1806
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,600
And I will rise, I will Sivakho,

1807
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:19,800
I will rise to the challenge.

1808
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:20,760
The corndog?

1809
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:21,920
Yeah.

1810
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:22,960
Yeah, I love the corndog.

1811
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,200
That's probably the run and gun thing

1812
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:26,600
I've gravitated towards the most in recent years.

1813
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:31,320
If you could invent a portable food for Disney to sell,

1814
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:32,240
what would it be?

1815
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:33,680
Oh, that's a great question.

1816
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:39,720
Yeah, that's, I was gonna say that I thought like,

1817
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:42,080
there's the Bengal barbecue over in Adventureland,

1818
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:45,200
which I feel, I looked it up, opened in 1990.

1819
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:48,440
That is a much more portable version of this.

1820
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:51,240
It's like skewers with different meats on it.

1821
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:52,280
That's pretty good.

1822
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:56,160
And it's like, that's the portable version of the turkey.

1823
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,440
Like, cause you're also getting vegetables,

1824
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:58,880
you can get a bunch of roasted vegetables.

1825
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,480
That's a very good option.

1826
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:02,320
Much leaner meat.

1827
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:03,520
Yeah.

1828
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,280
And it's nice little snack.

1829
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,640
So that already exists, at least the meat,

1830
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:10,840
the meat version of what you're asking.

1831
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:13,280
I always think Disneyland does fish well.

1832
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:16,880
I like a fancy fish at the fancier Disney restaurants.

1833
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,480
So if they could bring that to a portable experience

1834
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:24,200
and maybe, is there some, imagine a snack

1835
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:26,960
that is a longer piece of fish,

1836
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:30,640
like on a cone or on a stick,

1837
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:34,960
and then surrounded by a little like row of French fries.

1838
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:39,960
Like, as if it's like a fish flower blossoming.

1839
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:42,720
Like, where it could all be held on the same cone.

1840
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,120
Fish and chips on a cone.

1841
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:44,960
Yeah. Wow.

1842
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,840
Yes. Oh, that's a good idea.

1843
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:47,840
And the food's just regular.

1844
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:49,760
It's not some weird, then it's desertified.

1845
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,880
It's just fish, but can we arrange it portably?

1846
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:53,960
I'm picturing a teenager just eating shit,

1847
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:55,200
falling over with that.

1848
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,560
Bro, stick pokes him in the eye.

1849
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:58,400
Oh, fuck.

1850
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,120
I know for a few years now,

1851
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:04,720
they've been selling a whole fried fish for Lunar New Year.

1852
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:05,560
Whoa.

1853
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:07,280
For like the line of food for that.

1854
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:09,120
But I think you have to pick it apart.

1855
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:13,040
I was gonna say, you could go the other way

1856
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:17,080
and they should do a full fish version of like a turkey leg

1857
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:18,760
with that's just a full fish with the eyes

1858
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:20,440
and then you eat it like Heathcliff.

1859
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:22,040
Oh yeah. Where you suck off the fish

1860
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:24,000
with the bones. The bone, the whole intact skeleton

1861
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:24,840
comes out of your mouth.

1862
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:25,680
Yeah, exactly.

1863
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,200
So that's very Instagrammable.

1864
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,560
I would want them to really innovate

1865
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:33,240
and have something run and gone, like soup or cereal,

1866
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:35,440
something you cannot eat when walking.

1867
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:36,800
Soup or cereal, did you say?

1868
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,040
I'm trying to think of something in a bowl

1869
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:40,800
that you eat with a spoon

1870
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:43,440
that's difficult to eat walking.

1871
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:46,520
I mean, you hear the walking taco, like that's a thing.

1872
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:48,840
What about cereal? That's like a Frito pie.

1873
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:52,200
What about cereal with a sippy cup lid?

1874
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:54,080
But then how do you get the?

1875
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:56,480
It's a bigger opening.

1876
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:57,920
But then you're tilting your head back,

1877
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:00,880
I feel like the liability of choking on cereal pieces.

1878
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:03,560
Maybe it's sort of just like connected to your face

1879
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:05,400
and sealed around your nose and mouth.

1880
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:06,520
It's like a mask.

1881
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:08,200
It's like a Bane mask.

1882
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:09,040
Bane mask?

1883
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:09,880
It's like Bane.

1884
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:12,640
Bane mask mixed with like a horse feeding bag.

1885
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:13,480
And that's very Instagrammable.

1886
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:16,200
I like this, it's very Instagrammable.

1887
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:17,040
I think.

1888
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:18,680
Hashtag foodie brother.

1889
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:20,040
If I had to pick one,

1890
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:22,760
I just got back from Hawaii over the holidays

1891
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:26,480
and I think they could do like a cool like Moana ride tie-in

1892
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:29,280
that's like Spam Musubi or something.

1893
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:30,680
I think that would be good.

1894
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:32,160
It's still kind of gross

1895
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:34,760
to have like a little greasy cellophane wrapped thing.

1896
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,600
I've gotten it at Disneyland before.

1897
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:37,440
Oh really?

1898
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:39,360
Every now and then, one of the stands will have.

1899
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:41,440
Like a tropical hideaway switches up.

1900
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:43,800
Like they have like a secret menu item.

1901
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:45,600
Sometimes it's a pork sandwich.

1902
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,320
Once it was Spam Musubi.

1903
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:48,720
Wow, man I don't know this.

1904
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:50,040
Wow, yeah I didn't know that.

1905
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:51,600
You just go ask what's the secret thing?

1906
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:52,920
Sometimes it's displayed

1907
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:55,480
and then sometimes it's like secret secret.

1908
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:56,960
But like they usually have some sort

1909
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:59,000
of rotating option there.

1910
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Do they have sushi anywhere in the parks?

1911
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:04,480
I don't think so.

1912
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:06,960
I feel like at Disney World I had, well.

1913
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:07,800
Disney World has a lot of sushi.

1914
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:10,920
I had sushi in Epcot.

1915
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:11,760
Yeah.

1916
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:13,200
It was not great.

1917
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:16,360
California Grill has a giant sushi menu.

1918
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:19,600
Okay and I'm sure the better restaurants.

1919
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,400
Yeah and we'll have them as appetizers

1920
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:24,000
but I don't think there's just in-park sushi.

1921
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,760
But that would be not a bad idea.

1922
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:28,240
A little in-park because you can eat that

1923
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:29,080
relatively easy on the go.

1924
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:30,800
Sometimes it's not baking in the sun.

1925
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:31,960
Sure.

1926
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:34,360
Oh yeah with mayo, spicy mayo.

1927
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:39,360
In little Mickey ear shapes would be nice.

1928
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:42,040
Stamp out, have a big piece of fish

1929
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:43,640
and stamp Mickey's head into it.

1930
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:44,680
Forgive me if you have

1931
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:46,480
but have you been to Disney Sea?

1932
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:47,320
Yes.

1933
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:48,320
The two of us have.

1934
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:49,160
Okay.

1935
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:51,760
Did they have a fish thing there?

1936
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:53,560
I'm sure they did.

1937
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:57,920
We had a couple, the thing we kept eating was curry.

1938
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:00,680
They had a good curry stuff.

1939
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:05,320
In Frontierland there and in the Aladdin area in Agrabah

1940
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:07,960
they had curry we ate.

1941
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:09,840
And I had a sit down fish meal

1942
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:14,840
that was full on Japanese where there's 15 components to it

1943
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:17,600
and a great soup and little salad

1944
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:20,560
and lots of little dippings and toppings.

1945
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,600
So there's great Japanese food around there.

1946
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:25,960
I don't know if there's a walk around fish component though.

1947
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:26,920
Gotcha.

1948
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:28,080
Yeah that's a good question.

1949
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:29,760
Yeah somebody else knows.

1950
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:32,520
Someone who's been there 25 times tell us.

1951
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:36,320
But good place, it's a very good place.

1952
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:38,520
Highly recommended if you ever get out there.

1953
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:41,200
Well.

1954
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:44,120
There's, yeah I was just trying to think of,

1955
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:45,560
there's that tiger tail they have,

1956
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:47,600
Shandu's tiger tail but that's not.

1957
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:48,640
Kind of like a bow.

1958
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:49,480
It's a bow.

1959
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:50,320
Yeah.

1960
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:51,160
Oh that's true.

1961
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:52,080
It's like an orange.

1962
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:55,120
You eat little, Shandu is, where is he there?

1963
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:57,440
He's a tiger from the Sinbad ride.

1964
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:58,560
A tiger in a little turban.

1965
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,160
Whoa, okay.

1966
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:02,280
It's an original, it's basically like

1967
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:04,760
an original Disney movie ride that doesn't,

1968
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,200
the movie doesn't exist.

1969
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:07,520
But it's an original Al Mankin song.

1970
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:09,520
And anyways, Shandu you can eat his tail.

1971
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:12,280
You can eat that, he's the most adorable character

1972
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:13,280
you've ever seen and you can eat.

1973
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:14,560
Gotta eat that guy's tail.

1974
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:15,960
Yeah, yeah.

1975
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:19,320
So there's interesting stuff there as well.

1976
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:24,160
The turkey, so Thanksgiving from the website Delish,

1977
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:26,000
please state like Thanksgiving,

1978
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,200
you average when you're making a Thanksgiving turkey,

1979
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:32,960
you average like 1.25 pounds per person.

1980
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:35,880
These weigh 1.5 pounds.

1981
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:37,640
The turkey leg.

1982
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:40,480
But I don't think I eat that much turkey at Thanksgiving.

1983
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:44,320
I think I get a lot of sides and a couple slices of turkey.

1984
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:45,280
Sure.

1985
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:46,400
I would say this feels like,

1986
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:49,200
a turkey leg is the most dense part of a turkey.

1987
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,320
There's just like the huge cavern in the middle.

1988
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:56,320
So like, it is too much turkey for sure.

1989
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:57,840
Yeah, it's definitely a lot.

1990
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:58,680
Yeah, that's why you share.

1991
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:01,120
You'll probably walk it off.

1992
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:02,920
You're walking a lot at Disney.

1993
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:04,600
You walk a lot of miles a day.

1994
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:07,280
Yeah, I mean, for sure, as long as you're doing a whole day

1995
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:09,120
and you aren't eating multiple legs.

1996
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,160
The most unnerving thing I encountered

1997
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:15,400
when reading about this was the Times talk to someone

1998
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:18,760
from Schlitterbahn, the water park chain.

1999
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:20,960
They sell turkey legs and they said that

2000
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:23,200
just cooking these causes more,

2001
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:25,480
it's like the fajita effect to chilies.

2002
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:28,480
The smell causes people to go,

2003
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:32,200
not even I want a turkey leg, just, oh, I'm hungry.

2004
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:34,880
So the snack stands do see an increase

2005
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:36,320
if they're cooking these.

2006
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:39,440
But I have to say, dragging one of these

2007
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:42,760
around a water park seems like a recipe for disaster.

2008
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:45,920
That's the most disgusting thing I can imagine.

2009
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:48,120
I think that even I have my limits.

2010
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:50,000
You can't bring it on the water slide, can you?

2011
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,560
Well, obviously I would think not,

2012
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:55,360
but just if it's dripping and you're like half dressed,

2013
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,040
you're gonna burn yourself on the drippings.

2014
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:59,280
Just like some dumb ass is dropping their turkey leg

2015
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:01,360
in the water and then that water has had a turkey leg,

2016
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:03,440
you know, like all of it's so gross.

2017
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:04,400
It becomes soup.

2018
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:07,200
Yeah, you got a stew going.

2019
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:10,360
What percentage of the wave pool is turkey drippings?

2020
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:14,200
Jason's thinking of this fantasy now

2021
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:16,640
is a wave pool of turkey drippings.

2022
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:19,160
2% dripping, 7% urine.

2023
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:23,840
My mirepoix got my carrots, celery and onions in.

2024
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:27,320
Oh, what clumsy me.

2025
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:29,280
Wait, are you cooking yourself in this scenario?

2026
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,120
Oh, what?

2027
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:32,160
You are?

2028
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:33,000
Who's cooking?

2029
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,520
Something smells good.

2030
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:37,800
You're cooking everyone and yourself in the wave pool.

2031
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:38,640
Yeah.

2032
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:42,480
You just wanna eat like in a cartoon, like Zach said.

2033
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:44,800
That's different though.

2034
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,840
This is cannibalism.

2035
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:48,880
Even if you're not straight up eating the brain,

2036
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,720
the Looney Tunes didn't know it.

2037
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:54,120
Like they'd be in the pot cooking stuff

2038
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:55,200
and they'd be like, what smells good?

2039
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:56,840
And then they realize, oh no, it's me.

2040
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:57,800
It's me.

2041
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:00,480
But you just took out the part where it's a problem.

2042
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:01,320
Yeah.

2043
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:03,880
Well, I'm saying I don't know it until the end.

2044
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:05,200
I'm just saying. But you do know it.

2045
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:06,800
Well, part of you knows, I guess.

2046
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:07,840
No, we're telling you.

2047
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:09,200
Okay.

2048
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:10,600
We're telling you what's going on.

2049
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:11,920
You're in a stew,

2050
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:14,120
but you're baking in the hot Texas sun.

2051
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:18,800
Someone accidentally spilled potatoes.

2052
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:22,760
It's a lazy river.

2053
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:25,960
My thought about turkey leg also is that

2054
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:30,520
it is grandfathered in now to being acceptable.

2055
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,200
Cause like if they all of a sudden,

2056
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:34,880
if it all of a sudden was like cow leg,

2057
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:37,040
and I know you can eat legs of other animals,

2058
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,720
if they were to introduce another type of leg right now,

2059
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:41,160
people go, what the hell?

2060
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:42,000
Yeah.

2061
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:42,840
This is crazy.

2062
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:45,440
It's definitely too crazy to be a new thing.

2063
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:46,280
Yeah.

2064
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:48,960
So it's going to survive as long as it's culture,

2065
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:50,440
like acceptable to eat meat.

2066
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:52,840
I was, I was eating a field a couple of years ago

2067
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:56,120
with a friend of the podcast, Andrew Grissom,

2068
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:58,360
and he ordered frog legs.

2069
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:01,520
We were downtown and,

2070
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:06,440
and hypothetically I was like, yeah, maybe I'd try it.

2071
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:08,320
And they put it in it's fried and I picked it up

2072
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:10,000
and I was like, oh my God, never.

2073
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,320
No, no, no.

2074
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:12,160
Whoa, really?

2075
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:13,960
It's not escargot.

2076
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:14,800
Would I eat it?

2077
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:15,640
Have you had it?

2078
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:16,480
No, I have not had it.

2079
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:17,320
I'm not saying I wouldn't have.

2080
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:19,920
I'm just saying I touched it and it felt,

2081
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:21,600
it just felt like in a leg.

2082
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,840
It felt too, it's too real.

2083
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:24,720
But then I was also like,

2084
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:26,360
I just haven't grown up with this.

2085
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:27,200
Yeah.

2086
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:28,440
And I would, as much as it's gross,

2087
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:30,480
I would still feel comfortable holding a turkey's leg,

2088
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:32,040
which of course, what's the difference?

2089
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:36,000
But I really had a visceral reaction to even picking it up.

2090
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,200
And I was like, I cannot eat this huge basket.

2091
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:41,720
Luckily, or I don't know, luckily in quotes,

2092
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:43,920
I have the disconnect with turkey legs

2093
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:46,240
or chicken legs or something where like,

2094
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:49,280
eating like an amphibian just is an insane barrier

2095
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:52,000
in my mind that I just haven't crossed.

2096
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,280
It felt like it's whole like hips and leg,

2097
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:56,600
like I could feel its body.

2098
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:58,240
And it pretty easily snaps.

2099
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:01,720
Yeah, and I just, I almost threw up a little bit.

2100
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:03,360
I threw up in my mouth a little bit.

2101
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:04,200
No way.

2102
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,640
A little bit, even.

2103
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:07,240
Was that even a thing?

2104
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:08,080
Uh.

2105
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:08,920
Yeah.

2106
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:11,760
The old man of genius,

2107
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:14,600
the guy who throws up in his mouth a little bit.

2108
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:16,760
Hey buddy, that's not even a thing.

2109
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:19,760
Now college kids just trade office waves.

2110
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:20,600
Right?

2111
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:21,440
I think I have it right.

2112
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:22,280
Yeah, that's right.

2113
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:25,680
Dwight two dot wave.

2114
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:29,760
What do you got?

2115
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:31,360
I was gonna ask everyone's opinion.

2116
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:34,120
So turkey legs, again, have been merchandised to death

2117
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:34,960
at this point.

2118
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:37,440
Would everyone think these food magnets,

2119
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:38,640
anyone into these?

2120
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:41,640
Okay, tell us where you're, yeah, go clockwise here.

2121
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:42,960
Mickey waffles.

2122
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:46,320
I think I always like to see a Mickey waffle.

2123
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:48,600
Mickey pretzel, that's fine.

2124
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:50,120
Donut with Mickey sprinkles.

2125
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:52,440
You're starting to like lose the thread a little.

2126
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:54,440
And then Mickey ice cream bars,

2127
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:55,760
I think are very iconic.

2128
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:56,920
But then the turkey legs,

2129
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:58,720
and they've included in the magnet,

2130
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:01,840
the greasy wax paper with Mickey ears on it.

2131
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:02,680
Oh.

2132
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:03,520
Like.

2133
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:04,480
Is that what?

2134
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:08,760
The greasy wax paper is pulled way too high for my liking.

2135
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:10,560
Show me a little turkey leg, guys.

2136
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,400
Don't be such a prude.

2137
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:17,760
Look at the checkout, that was Gams.

2138
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:21,520
Zach, would you put a turkey leg facsimile magnet

2139
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,480
on your refrigerator?

2140
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:24,600
Why not?

2141
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:27,480
It's not like, I think a magnet's fine

2142
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:31,360
because it's not actually gross and dripping.

2143
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:33,800
I think that's, I would do that for sure.

2144
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:36,240
Would you go with the air freshener they briefly sold?

2145
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:37,080
No.

2146
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:37,920
They did?

2147
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:38,740
Not at all.

2148
01:17:38,740 --> 01:17:39,580
Jesus.

2149
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:41,240
Do they smell like turkey?

2150
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:43,920
I believe it smelled like a turkey leg.

2151
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:44,760
Really?

2152
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:45,600
Yeah.

2153
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,760
Oh, can we find that on eBay?

2154
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:48,600
Turkey?

2155
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:50,080
Yeah, give me a second.

2156
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,440
Did you have Fisher Price,

2157
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,120
because I guess my sister had it,

2158
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:59,400
the Fisher Price fake food in like a fake fridge.

2159
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:03,320
And we had all this like fake plastic meat from the fridge.

2160
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:05,360
Have you seen the thing about?

2161
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:06,840
I never really had that

2162
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:08,120
or don't really remember having that,

2163
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:12,000
but my niece and nephew have had that stuff recently

2164
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,160
or when they were like eight years ago or whatever.

2165
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:20,160
And I can still see a little chicken leg

2166
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:21,600
from a set like that and be like,

2167
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:22,960
oh, that looks pretty good.

2168
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:25,200
It's a cartoon.

2169
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,880
Is he still like, yeah, yeah, there's an appeal to that.

2170
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:29,660
And then I always, I liked them,

2171
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:31,880
but I always found the fake chicken McNugget toy,

2172
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:33,080
they were toys.

2173
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:34,760
You know what I'm talking about?

2174
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:35,920
That transformed?

2175
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:37,720
No, well, they had like a fireman's hat.

2176
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:39,840
They were like the village people.

2177
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:42,080
Yeah, yeah, all the professions.

2178
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:43,880
The McNuggets dressed as the village people.

2179
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:44,720
They're cute.

2180
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:47,080
But they still, they had gotten the texture so close,

2181
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:50,520
I feel like as a kid, I even like kind of felt weird about it.

2182
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:52,120
I felt like the food is alive.

2183
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:54,640
New in bag.

2184
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:55,480
Whoa.

2185
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:57,080
It looks like a photograph.

2186
01:18:57,080 --> 01:19:01,800
It's shaped like a turkey leg, $10 on eBay.

2187
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:05,400
But then it's got a little cartoon turkey leg.

2188
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:06,240
Oh, the leg's cute.

2189
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:08,680
Guy saying turkey leg scent.

2190
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:09,680
He's cute.

2191
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:11,000
I like him.

2192
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,000
How can that fake turkey leg smell be good?

2193
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,280
It must be the grossest smell.

2194
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:19,840
Again, we were saying ham facsimiles are bizarre.

2195
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:22,880
Right, but Jason said that's his favorite smell on earth,

2196
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:23,720
is ham.

2197
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:25,320
It used to be.

2198
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:26,440
Ham air fresheners anywhere?

2199
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:28,480
Oh, here's a waffle air freshener.

2200
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:30,320
That's probably more pleasant.

2201
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:32,640
Yes, that's much better.

2202
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:35,480
But were there only a ham air freshener

2203
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:39,480
so Jason could always say ham in the house?

2204
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:40,320
Ham in the house.

2205
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:41,800
Ham in the house.

2206
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:43,320
Turkey leg on a sweatshirt.

2207
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:44,920
I mean, they put it on everything now.

2208
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:48,120
But as people, I mean, people are trying to eat less meat.

2209
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:53,120
I wonder if the Instagram ability kind of balances out

2210
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:56,160
like Disney, because Disney's offering a lot more

2211
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:59,760
vegetarian stuff where imitation meat stuff.

2212
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:02,200
I wonder what that does to the turkey leg.

2213
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:05,040
I'm sure there's scientists working on

2214
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:07,760
some sort of a fake meat turkey leg.

2215
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:08,600
Yeah.

2216
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:09,520
There has to be.

2217
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:10,360
The air freshener may have come from that.

2218
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:12,760
What do you think that person thinks of their job?

2219
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,600
I think they have some sort of God complex.

2220
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:19,800
Yeah, at the power of God, I would think.

2221
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:20,640
Yeah.

2222
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:24,520
So they are wheeled there like, we're close.

2223
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:28,800
I wonder if I became that involved and invested in science

2224
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:34,400
what I would assume I would be doing with my career.

2225
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:37,760
And then if I would be satisfied, I think like, yeah,

2226
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:40,280
maybe that is satisfying.

2227
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:41,120
I don't know.

2228
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:42,280
In my head for a second, I was like,

2229
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:46,040
I don't know if they would enjoy being in that lane.

2230
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:48,480
You mean like there's a, I assume all scientists

2231
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:49,920
are in like one lab together.

2232
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:52,280
There's one room where they're doing cancer research

2233
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:55,160
and then the next lab over, this guy is trying to crack

2234
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:56,360
fake turkey leg.

2235
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:57,400
Exactly.

2236
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:00,320
That can simulate the purple and the dripping.

2237
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:02,640
And they like go to lunch together and they're like,

2238
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:03,480
what are you working on?

2239
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:05,120
He's like, oh yeah, well, I'm working on a thing

2240
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:07,440
to make the white blood cells like kind of really react

2241
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:08,480
and kill the cancer cells.

2242
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:09,760
And he's like, oh yeah, well,

2243
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:12,080
we perfected the purple today.

2244
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:15,080
Purple is now the exact same color as in real meat.

2245
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:15,920
You got the purple?

2246
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:17,640
You got the, holy shit.

2247
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:19,840
Yeah, it's actually the cancer researchers who are like,

2248
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:22,280
God damn it, I wanna be in the turkey leg room.

2249
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:23,240
That's so fun.

2250
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:26,560
The carefree playboy lifestyle of the big turkey men.

2251
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:28,920
Someday.

2252
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:31,440
Someday, we'll get the good assignment.

2253
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:35,760
Closing thoughts, anything else you wanna share about?

2254
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:39,920
Your fondness or at least putting up with turkey legs?

2255
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:44,040
You know, I think it'll be a sad day in some way

2256
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:46,800
when the turkey leg is maybe not there anymore.

2257
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:52,680
It feels very nostalgic to me and as gross as it is,

2258
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:56,280
I think I'll keep getting it as long as I can.

2259
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:58,240
Sure.

2260
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:00,040
Just don't drip on those fast passes

2261
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:02,280
if you do another timeshare presentation.

2262
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:05,240
I'll have to go to another hour of man flailing.

2263
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:10,240
Well, I hope you can avoid this

2264
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:13,760
and Zacharioma, you survived podcast The Ride.

2265
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,680
Thanks for being here, that was a blast.

2266
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:18,280
Thanks for having me, this was so fun.

2267
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:19,760
Let's exit through the gift shop.

2268
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:21,560
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

2269
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:22,560
Oh gosh.

2270
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:28,000
You know, these days I'm doing some stuff on Twitch

2271
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:33,000
at Zacharioma, across all platforms at Zacharioma

2272
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:36,920
and over on Twitch I'm just playing some,

2273
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:38,720
what am I playing, Sekiro right now?

2274
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:42,400
I'm just playing games over there if that's your thing.

2275
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:43,240
Sure.

2276
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:44,080
Neat.

2277
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:47,280
A related video game would be nice in some regard.

2278
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:50,880
Yeah, can you, on Twitch I'm only a little bit familiar

2279
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:54,680
with it, can you play but also eat

2280
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:56,440
and then can they see you eating?

2281
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:58,960
Yeah, you can have, a lot of people do a picture

2282
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:01,320
and picture thing so you can eat whatever you want.

2283
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:03,640
So maybe when this comes out you could be eating

2284
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:05,720
a giant turkey leg while you're playing.

2285
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:06,880
Pick up a turkey leg.

2286
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:07,720
Go home.

2287
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:09,040
That's a subscriber goal.

2288
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:09,880
Yes.

2289
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:11,720
And then when you eat it people will send you bits.

2290
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:15,240
Let's say if I had 50,000 subscribers I'll do that.

2291
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:17,520
Thanks for the bits, thanks for the bits everyone.

2292
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:18,360
We'll drive.

2293
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:19,200
As you're chomping down.

2294
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:22,240
I'm gonna drip to drive home in a hickory scented car

2295
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:23,320
that's our back.

2296
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:25,640
That's holding it one handed.

2297
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:28,560
That's your new gaming persona too.

2298
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:29,960
At Zach drips.

2299
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:30,800
Oh.

2300
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,840
At dripping Zach.

2301
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:37,600
50,000 subscribers I will change my handle

2302
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,200
to at dripping Zach.

2303
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:43,000
And I'll eat a turkey leg with every stream.

2304
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:46,920
And the people who subscribe thinking

2305
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:48,520
something else is going on.

2306
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:50,720
Hey, what's going on?

2307
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:53,120
Whatever it is I'm in.

2308
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:56,080
Here's some bits.

2309
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:56,920

at patreon.com slash podcast the ride.

2315
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:11,920
I think there's a more even like,

2316
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:14,160
this is like a tried and true snack.

2317
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:16,240
But I wonder is there like for the second gate

2318
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:20,120
a deeper cut snack to do a whole ep about?

2319
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:20,960
Corn?

2320
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:21,800
The answer is.

2321
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:22,640
Do you want all corn?

2322
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:25,600
Corn on the second gate.

2323
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:29,000
Yeah, there's obviously like ice cream and Mickey bar

2324
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:29,840
but that's not obscure.

2325
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:31,520
You're looking for like something that's less.

2326
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:32,640
Yeah, I think so.

2327
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:33,480
Yeah.

2328
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:35,560
It seems like there's only four minutes.

2329
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:37,080
We've done a bread bowls kind of thing.

2330
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:37,920
Oh, we have not.

2331
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:38,760
Bread bowls pretty good.

2332
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:40,440
No, yeah that's a good call.

2333
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:43,960
Vegetable skewer from bangle barbecue.

2334
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:46,120
Each type of skewer gets its own episode.

2335
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:48,040
You know what should actually get its own episode

2336
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:50,520
and it's not that obscure is the now defunct

2337
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:53,760
fried green tomato sandwich from the hungry bear restaurant.

2338
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:54,720
Oh yeah, boy that was good.

2339
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:57,320
Which was we would go and get it all the time.

2340
01:24:57,320 --> 01:24:58,560
Lindsay loved it.

2341
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,840
It was like we would do it and they got rid of it

2342
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:02,760
and people were furious.

2343
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:04,240
So it's still not that obscure

2344
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:07,120
but maybe there's a whole 90 minutes on that.

2345
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:08,720
That's, you might've gotten it.

2346
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:11,840
Yeah, that seems like the kind of thing we would do.

2347
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:12,680
Yeah.

2348
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:13,520
So maybe we should do it.

2349
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:14,340
Okay.

2350
01:25:14,340 --> 01:25:15,640
So subscribe if you want to hear that

2351
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:17,000
unless we bump that up to main feed

2352
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:17,960
because there is like.

2353
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:18,800
The demand.

2354
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:20,000
Fried green tomato mega demand.

2355
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:20,920
Yeah.

2356
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:22,920
Until then, thanks for listening

2357
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:25,280
and hey, ham in the house.

2358
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:26,120
