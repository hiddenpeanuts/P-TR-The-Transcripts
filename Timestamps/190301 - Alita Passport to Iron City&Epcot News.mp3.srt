1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:11,040
Warning, the following podcast may contain zero big eyes, a dispute over the meaning

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:18,000
of field day, a hexagon themed restaurant, and hot dogs, hot dogs, hot dogs.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,040
We catch you up on the latest news out of Epcot Center and give you a passport to Iron City,

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,800
the world of the Leda battle angel with an interview with IM8Bits John Gibson.

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,600
Be careful, the factory is watching.

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:52,120
This is Podcast The Ride.

9
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:57,400
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the show hosted by three men who are jacked by today's big

10
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,680
theme park news.

11
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:04,280
And I am of course talking about the announcement of the Today Cafe, the Today show themed

12
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,120
restaurant at the entrance of Universal Studios.

13
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,720
I'm joined as always by Scott Gardner.

14
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,400
I got it up on my phone.

15
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,200
I was ready for this.

16
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,400
I was ready to do the real news and then, but you know what?

17
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,840
The big one, we were thinking the same thing.

18
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,840
Yeah.

19
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,840
And of course, Mike Carlson.

20
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,840
I'm here too.

21
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,840
Yes.

22
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,640
A very excitedly Jason this morning when I saw him, he goes, did you see the press release

23
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,400
we got? That's Jason Sheridan, by the way, his WordPress.

24
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,160
Now, yes, we're inside info.

25
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,760
We do. And it's six in the morning, which of course would be nine a.m.

26
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,320
Eastern. Yeah, that makes sense.

27
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,440
Because you are on the radio.

28
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,680
You all are on KROC 106.7.

29
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,120
And I didn't go because there weren't enough microphones.

30
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,160
That is a true fact.

31
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,680
And also, you are making a television show.

32
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,160
Well, not at seven in the morning.

33
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,000
No, we don't know.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,400
Yeah, we're no, we don't keep radio hours.

35
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,960
No, not like you nuts.

36
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,720
There were there were not no microphones.

37
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,160
Well, we we asked we got to be on KROC on the Kevin and Bean show today.

38
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,600
And yeah, the first thing Jason said to me when I picked him up was,

39
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,560
did you see the press release we got?

40
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:17,280
And it was for the Today Cafe, the Today Show themed restaurant

41
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,280
at Universal Orlando, replacing what again?

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,400
Whatever that generic restaurant at the entrance was called.

43
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,880
The Hollywood restaurant, probably whites camera restaurant.

44
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,120
Today Cafe will soon make its way to Universal Orlando Resorts.

45
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,240
Neck of the Woods is how the press release starts.

46
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,800
People get that off the bat.

47
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,120
Do we know neck of the woods without stopping and thinking about it?

48
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,400
I think Al Roker has been saying it for like 20 plus years.

49
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,560
He does that on the time that's embedded in my head.

50
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,960
Yes, of the tram tour, because he did the weather section,

51
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,920
which spoiler culminates in a flash flood.

52
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,600
And it would always be so the line was

53
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,840
what's going on in your neck of the lot?

54
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,200
I said he would always say what's going on in your neck of the lot,

55
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,680
because it was always the same video I play.

56
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,720
Like, why am I saying he would always say this?

57
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,240
What a repetitive guy. Right.

58
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,520
In the clip that we had to play over and over again.

59
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,040
It was video. He didn't have the chance.

60
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,160
There was no option for him to say something else.

61
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,800
Anyway, neck of the it's coming to the universals,

62
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,920
neck of the woods, which is universal.

63
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:28,360
Yeah. So this is this is more synergy from Comcast Universal.

64
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,040
Obviously, this is they did.

65
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,520
That's a night show ride.

66
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,680
So I think they're starting to make all their TV shows, I guess.

67
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,920
And the last call with Carson Daly dumpster in the back of the park.

68
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,520
And that's being that's over, though.

69
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,600
The dumpster is done.

70
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,040
The show was canceled.

71
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,360
The dumpster canceled it. Yeah. So

72
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,640
Drew Tarver had the martini shot

73
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,920
Oh, yeah, I heard this.

74
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,120
He was on like one of the last episodes.

75
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,840
Yes. Oh, my God.

76
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,040
It is it does seem like this is whoever.

77
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,760
Whichever theme park owns like the CBS catalog, this does seem like

78
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,520
like 60 Minutes, the cafe or something like what a weird choice.

79
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,840
I mean, I guess today's show makes a little more sense than 60 Minutes, though.

80
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,600
Jason has an Andy Rooney walk around character at the 60 Minutes Cafe.

81
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,800
It would be a wonderful, wonderful treat.

82
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,920
Can you believe the prices at this restaurant?

83
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,520
And also maybe not a walk around character.

84
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,600
You would just be sitting in a booth in the corner with a big newspaper

85
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,520
and you'd like go over and you'd like hassle you and complain

86
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,960
about vertical blinds or something.

87
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,520
I bought one small coffee early in the morning.

88
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,920
I bought nothing else, but I'm posting up.

89
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,680
I clearly brought my own snacks, not paying for their overpriced.

90
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,400
This is all like bit stuff, but not also bit stuff.

91
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,280
Just stuff you would do in general.

92
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,480
Yeah. For those of you don't know, Jason has done Andy Rooney

93
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,960
a long time out in Los Angeles at a bit show called Term of Nerds.

94
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,920
So it's a lot of sense.

95
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,320
Probably most people know what I think a lot of people have done a lot of research

96
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,400
and what characters Jason's played on a stage isolated to Los Angeles.

97
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,520
And the Sandi Rooney impression.

98
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,120
The impression has gotten worse and worse over the years

99
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,680
and the jokes have just gotten meaner.

100
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,560
I think it's really that you're morphing into him, though, completely.

101
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,960
Yeah, that's probably right.

102
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,360
So every year that goes by, you're turning more into an old war veteran

103
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,040
that's upset with everything.

104
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,400
Yeah, that's true. Yeah.

105
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,200
So today showed that what were the other details?

106
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,280
Were there any other? Oh, yeah.

107
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:36,360
I was saying this is the benefit of being podcast the ride today in 2019

108
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,960
that we get access to universal Orlando's share file dot com

109
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,120
portfolio with files posted by Haley Fitch.

110
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,440
It says the name of the person who posted it.

111
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,520
And we get high res imagery of the meals that will be available.

112
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,520
I didn't look at the pictures yet.

113
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,040
I didn't see this. Oh, God.

114
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,000
Let's let's see. She's a platter.

115
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Is it themed to a person on the show?

116
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,640
Oh, yes, Mike. In fact,

117
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,320
yeah. Additionally, in a tribute to long running tradition

118
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,320
in Kathy Lee and Hoda's hour of today, guests can enjoy wine and beer on tap

119
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,480
with a delicious cheese platter for two. OK.

120
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,400
But doesn't have a name.

121
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,480
It isn't the Hoda and Kathy cheese platter.

122
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,760
OK, OK. Do we?

123
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,960
They currently are just named generic things such as vegan sandwich.

124
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,920
OK, this is I'm just, you know, if you've been with us for a long time,

125
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,440
you knew you know that we've always wanted to be insiders.

126
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,000
And now we're getting official universal emails

127
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,680
with three megabyte crystal clear quality photos of vegan sandwiches.

128
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,360
We can see every little seed on the strawberries

129
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,160
that adorn the vegan sandwich platter.

130
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,240
Well, of course, my favorite thing is and most theme park websites

131
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,240
had this in their their roundup announcements about this opening

132
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,280
is the the like CAD concept art

133
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,880
JPEG featuring like what it will look like in 3D rendering,

134
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,680
which features one of my favorite things.

135
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,560
The humans that aren't quite 3D aren't quite 2D,

136
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,080
but I think feel pain because they look like little monsters.

137
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,320
They exist in some horrible world now by virtue of them being created

138
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,560
in this 3D simulation.

139
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,400
They're like that Black Mirror Star Trek episode.

140
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,080
And they're walking around this awful digital trapped space

141
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,240
where they will live for 1000 years unless they can somehow

142
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,840
like zap themselves into suicide.

143
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,640
This poor this like mother who is not

144
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,360
keeping a correct eye line with her little son.

145
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,280
We'll have to post this.

146
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,960
Yes, yeah.

147
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,640
And like real like the most like boxy, polygony hair.

148
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,880
They all look like original Toy Story characters.

149
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,200
They're pre they wish they were Toy Story 3s.

150
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,200
They are distinctly Toy Story 1s.

151
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,240
So like pre are they like pre

152
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,640
just we didn't rewrite Toy Story characters before

153
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,240
just for the on to it.

154
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,520
Yeah, or not. Not at that level of rendering

155
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,400
with like a oh, boy,

156
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,040
it's like a big TV playing the Today Show and then a smaller TV

157
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,200
also playing the Today Show and people like cheers and coffee.

158
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,760
This is something we were we were joking on.

159
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,520
And we were joking on that one.

160
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,960
I think it was a void episode a while ago about all the different

161
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,520
like NBC universal experiences.

162
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,200
Oh, yeah. Yeah. You could do which like this is getting closer to that.

163
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,480
It's getting closer to that.

164
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,000
At that point, had Matt Lauer been shown the door?

165
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,920
We had a bunch of Lauer jokes.

166
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,160
Oh, yeah. But we didn't have

167
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,240
Megyn Kelly had not like tacitly gone like, what's wrong with Blackface yet?

168
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,160
Today's show stock is not super high right now.

169
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,680
Yeah. How would they would like the bathroom stalls

170
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,160
locked from the inside with a button?

171
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,440
Is that how they would honor Matt Lauer and his legacy in the Today Show?

172
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,360
Yeah, probably.

173
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,240
And if you're and while you were in the while you're in the stalls,

174
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,920
is the TV showing you photos of potentially racist Halloween costumes

175
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,160
and just just to let you ponder it and just a little like title underneath.

176
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,320
It's a what? We're just asking the question. Right.

177
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,160
Is this race? It's not racist to ask if it's racist.

178
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,320
Right. This is a dialogue.

179
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,840
We're opening a dialogue

180
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,080
and shutting the door so you can't get out.

181
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,000
Will there be a Jenna Bush Hager face character?

182
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,320
Jenna Bush Hager famously joining the fourth hour of the Today Show.

183
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,560
Because Kathy Lee is, of course, leaving.

184
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,560
Hoda is staying.

185
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,600
Is Jenna Bush Hager replacing is replacing Kathy Lee.

186
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,960
So in case again, in case you don't know, the fourth hour

187
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,840
of the Today Show is like a drinky like, I don't know if you want to say

188
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,440
like fluffy, not that the whole show is boozy. Yeah.

189
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,880
Yeah. But Kathy Lee is leaving.

190
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,040
And Jenna Bush Hager, George W.

191
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,160
Bush's daughter is joining permanently.

192
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,600
I actually didn't know that.

193
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,200
I am a big fan of her work in the annual

194
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,240
Barney Christmas videos.

195
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,280
I was just posting some of these on Instagram.

196
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,240
Every year, the Bush White House made videos

197
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,240
with some bad little plot with their little dog.

198
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:13,960
Oh, right. Right. Right.

199
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,320
Haring the White House for Christmas.

200
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,640
And Jenna acts in the final one.

201
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,800
And like what, Barney, that is a fantastic idea

202
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,320
to spend our final White House holidays together.

203
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,320
Like, I don't know what the eye line is.

204
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,600
Yeah, it's as if like, no, remember, when it's your line,

205
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,360
exclaim out as if there's a giant theater in front of you.

206
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,880
Don't look at the human beings, you know, in front of your face.

207
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,400
She admittedly is a child.

208
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,240
She's not well known.

209
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,880
All right. Fine. No, not even.

210
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,000
This was the last year. This is the last year.

211
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:53,000
So but she is a lot more polished as a host.

212
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:58,120
I doubt they would give a full hour of a show to somebody who exclaims

213
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,720
with no eye line like that.

214
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,280
However, they gave Megyn Kelly time.

215
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,120
Sure. It's dollars.

216
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,400
Was that what it was?

217
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:11,320
And we're really in that we're in the age of the pay the walk away.

218
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:16,240
We are cutting ties and she will only be left with what's in the 68 million dollars.

219
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,120
The payout was like 69.

220
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,360
Oh, my God. Million dollars.

221
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,240
I was lowballing. Mm hmm.

222
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,640
Well, wasn't there also a thing a few years ago where

223
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,560
Chelsea Clinton was given a ton of money to do correspondent stuff

224
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:35,720
for NBC News and did like two segments and then almost with the money.

225
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,480
She's really I think so. Oh, we got to look into that.

226
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,880
Yikes. If we get into some trouble and are forced to exit forever,

227
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:48,200
dog will make sure that we get all one hundred and eighty dollars of our

228
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,440
fellow fresh money.

229
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,360
There is no way I'm walking without the payout.

230
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,640
Yeah, you hear me forever, dog.

231
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,040
We'll get the big bonus. Don't worry.

232
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,000
So we have covered it.

233
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,280
The big theme park news.

234
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,920
Well, and let's end with one last thing, though.

235
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,160
One standout features of the take today.

236
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,920
Cafe menu will be seasonal dishes inspired by co-anchor Al Roker's favorite recipes.

237
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,600
I mean, that's all we're looking for.

238
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,040
Yeah, I mean, I like Al Roker.

239
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,840
I think Al Roker just fine. Yeah.

240
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,120
I you know what? I'll say I'm happy for Al Roker because that might have been fun.

241
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,720
He might have came and be like, hey, there's a today show cafe.

242
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,040
We're going to use some of your recipes.

243
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,720
And he was like, that's nice.

244
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,360
So you know what? Great.

245
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,600
And that was the end of his interaction.

246
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,120
Yes. You describe the proper amount of time.

247
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,080
Yeah. And he's never going to think about it again.

248
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,640
I would like the idea because Jim Hill brought this up on one of his pie.

249
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,800
I think you called Jim Jim out for this.

250
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,800
The idea or no, it was a different thing.

251
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,800
You called him out for it was the twister.

252
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,400
But Jimmy Fallon was going to live inside the twister ride.

253
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,200
Basically, live from it.

254
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,920
Yes. Yes. Night. Yes.

255
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,040
It seemed a little inexplicable to me.

256
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,880
That's but you listened to one of Jim's

257
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,760
15 other podcasts and have come away for with something else.

258
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,320
Well, anyway, he was said there was an idea, I think, for the tonight show ride

259
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,760
to have a live feed to the studio up in 30 Rock.

260
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,440
So if they were taping a show at the time

261
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,600
that an audience or a bunch of tourists went through,

262
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,160
Jimmy could interact live with the people getting on the ride.

263
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,880
That did not happen.

264
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,400
I think they felt like, well, that's not going to happen that much during the day.

265
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:35,040
What's the point? But maybe for this, you know, you can have Roker chime in

266
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,120
like it is comments on what you're eating or something.

267
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,160
Like if you got the tray, you're going through the line.

268
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,520
And he goes, oh, I see you got my mashed potatoes there.

269
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,360
And then you go, oh, wow, it's Al Roker.

270
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,280
He's talking to me or something like that would be fun.

271
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,960
I feel like I hope that I hope it has a successful passage

272
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,840
to your neck of the digestive tract.

273
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,000
That's great. Right.

274
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,040
Itself. Yeah, it's perfect.

275
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,520
All right. Well, that was sort of the above the fold news of the day.

276
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,160
So I guess we have a lot of news to dig into the.

277
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,760
Yes. Well, yeah, we well, news and then we're also talking about this

278
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,840
interesting experience that we had in getting a passport to Iron City.

279
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,200
Yes. Of course, the the

280
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,320
setting of the I can do the word setting.

281
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,040
I struggled there.

282
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,280
He the film Alita Battle Angel, we went to this like very odd

283
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,880
but but cool interactive experience.

284
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,800
We're going to talk about that.

285
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,320
But before that, there has some theme park news has dropped.

286
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,960
And we're getting this one out quick so we could talk about it.

287
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:40,240
Yeah. Staying in Universal opening June 13th, Hagrid's magical creatures

288
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,920
motorbike adventure, continuing the recent trend of new attractions,

289
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,080
having very long names.

290
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,880
How many words in that nine?

291
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,440
One, two, three, four, five, five.

292
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,440
Five. It's only five, but only one.

293
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,520
It feels like nine.

294
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,120
It feel it does feel like nine long.

295
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,640
A lot of syllables in there.

296
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:04,240
Well, because it's Hagrid, Hagrid is the owner of all of it.

297
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,440
The magical creatures are not the owners of the ride like Hagrid is.

298
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,480
So I guess they don't need an apostrophe.

299
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,080
They're like, I might like I,

300
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,840
I got to go back to an English class and figure out

301
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,480
grammatically and punctuationally how this works.

302
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,400
But there's no possessive qualities of the magical creatures.

303
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,400
They're just on it, I guess.

304
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,120
Yeah, they're just on it.

305
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,800
I guess. Yeah. So what I know about the right, what we know about the ride

306
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,400
is it's like a giant cool roller coaster with a lot of launches

307
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,080
and there's a lot of robots of creatures.

308
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,040
So that's fun. Now back to the title.

309
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,760
Now let's talk about the title.

310
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,480
Not enough punctuation.

311
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,200
I already joked on Twitter.

312
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,960
We got to have we got to feel superior to this cool ride somehow.

313
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,440
And it is through the amount of words that they chose.

314
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,760
It's a little nuts.

315
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,640
And this is in the wake of what these Star Wars rides call again

316
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,320
Star Wars, Falcon, Millennium,

317
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,560
Spalm, Smuggler's Run, Smuggler's Run,

318
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:11,480
which sounds like the reminds me of the Glenn Fry, Miami Vice song.

319
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,800
Smuggler's Blues.

320
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,520
It's not so much as Millennium, Falcon, Smuggler's Blues.

321
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,560
It was soundtracked by that song.

322
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,960
Yeah. Is that is there a button I can hit in the ride to make Smuggler's Blues play?

323
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,400
Oh, wow. I'm on board.

324
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,720
I think maybe there'll be a phenomenon where we could bring in a little boombox

325
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,000
and set it on the console of the Millennium Falcon.

326
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,080
If it's about making it your own and making it and it's an interactive experience,

327
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,480
I should be able to do that.

328
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,600
I agree. I think and you know, what's going to happen, too,

329
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,600
is that when we all go together for the first time, I'm going to hang my trusty dice

330
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,880
on the rear view mirror.

331
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,960
So that's I'm going to make that my own that way.

332
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,480
And also blast some red hot chili peppers music

333
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,080
to tie in with our.

334
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,560
Yeah, that's sweet.

335
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,000
Patreon knows, but I bet one of those buttons has to be

336
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,400
one of them has to turn on the world famous one of six point seven K.

337
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,240
Rock Rock. Am I getting that right?

338
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,800
Do you do you know?

339
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,360
Yeah, one of six seven K.

340
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,920
Rock and then Sublime plays. Yeah.

341
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,800
So that's that's my Millennium Falcon.

342
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,400
Right. What the hell is the other one called?

343
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,720
Rises and resistance.

344
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,360
All right. I guess that's fairly that one's shorter.

345
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,400
But that one still feels a little vague.

346
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,360
It doesn't sound like the name of a ride. Right.

347
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,200
Because I think the like

348
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,720
what would be written on a lot of websites before that was revealed

349
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:34,280
was battle escape attraction, which is cooler like battle and escape.

350
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,000
That sounds fun. There's going to be fighting.

351
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,360
There's going to be some sort of an escape.

352
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,360
This one is rise of the resistance, which is a very general like

353
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:44,320
this could just be like a PowerPoint presentation on the resistance.

354
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,160
So we've been in the middle of a rise of a resistance

355
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,600
in the nation for the last two years, and it's about the boring as thing

356
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,000
you could ever because there's never been like a cool moment of it.

357
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,200
You don't think like, you know, a bunch of Georgetown graduates

358
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,040
are the same as like storming the Bastille and the second actively miss

359
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,720
as exciting as exciting.

360
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,120
Nancy Pelosi clapping.

361
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,200
A bunch of yeah.

362
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,880
Yeah, that's like fire in a cannonball.

363
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,240
Ivy League people going, sir.

364
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,480
Excuse me.

365
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,600
Exciting. I call him 45.

366
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,200
I don't even say his name.

367
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,680
You shall not be named.

368
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,600
I think, yeah, I think that there might be some more thrills

369
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,520
and chills on this ride than the clapping, but maybe now we'll see.

370
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,880
We'll see. Yeah.

371
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,840
Kylo Ren, the robot clapping at you. Maybe.

372
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,960
Like, like it could be.

373
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,560
Look, it could be all Imperial Senate.

374
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,160
We don't know. It could be the first order exclamation point.

375
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,360
That could escape. The first order is good.

376
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,440
Yeah, that's more exciting.

377
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,720
Yeah, that's more. That's more dynamic.

378
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,120
And I like the I do like the rides.

379
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,000
How it gives you a little command like Twister, right?

380
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,120
It out to bring it up for the second time.

381
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,360
I mean, I think from the rumors we've heard, too, there's a little bit of like

382
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,000
there's a couple. There's like a narrative and then a fake out.

383
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,960
So I do appreciate maybe it just keeping it general to like

384
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,200
hide the surprises, perhaps.

385
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,480
But does it really mean that they kind of revealed something this week?

386
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,880
I don't know. If you look, you can find like what's going to happen.

387
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,840
Did you see this?

388
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,360
You might be concerned.

389
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,760
There's a ride. There's a height requirement.

390
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,240
Oh, on Rise of the Resistance.

391
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,440
Spoiler alert. Spoiler.

392
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,080
That ends with a drop. A drop.

393
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,520
I did read that and go, oh, no.

394
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,040
But at least now I'm prepared.

395
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,120
But it's only a two.

396
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,600
It is two stories.

397
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,120
But I feel like the most to could drop you is one story.

398
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,480
Yeah. Unless they dug into the ground.

399
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,120
Oh, potentially.

400
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,240
Or they shoot you up real high out of the building.

401
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,680
Oh, it's not part of the deal.

402
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,000
It's going to be crowded enough as it is.

403
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,960
I don't want my rides having drops and launches.

404
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,320
There's just the Wi-Fi vehicle drives its way onto a giant trampoline.

405
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,640
You bounce out of those building itself.

406
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,920
I think it's possible.

407
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,200
I mean, they're doing crazy stuff with this technology. Yeah.

408
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,080
Anyway, Hagrid's coaster.

409
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,680
Yeah, what is Hagrid's coaster?

410
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,320
You know, a lot of rumors about this Orlando Park stop.

411
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,040
You know, they were the ones who had the video going around,

412
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,520
like showing the expected track layout, what the encounters with creatures

413
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,920
are going to be.

414
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:24,000
So it's rumored there's going to be multiple launches on this ride.

415
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Like five to seven. Yeah.

416
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,280
But like probably another problem, probably more like it.

417
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,680
But still, that's a lot of launches.

418
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,880
It's a lot of launches.

419
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,800
Even for even if you are a launch queen.

420
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,960
Yeah. How much are can you really?

421
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,120
How much can you?

422
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,640
I mean, it is a family coaster.

423
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,920
So I'm assuming more like the way that Slinky Dog Dash has starts with a launch.

424
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,880
It better be. It's all backwards sections.

425
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,320
Also, potentially a drop on this at one at towards the end.

426
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,960
On a roller coaster. I'm not having it.

427
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,720
There are launches and drops.

428
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,480
Scott's worst nightmare on one ride.

429
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,640
So unless I can listen to this ride as a part where you pull up to a tavern,

430
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,040
get out, have a beer for a little bit and then get back on.

431
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,400
No, that's no dice. Yeah.

432
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,200
That should be part of that Star Wars.

433
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,440
The rise of the resistance, though, because it's a 28 minute experience.

434
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,960
So you should be able to stop off and have a drink in the middle of it.

435
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:22,480
Well, spoiler, the thing that the main topic of today's show, this experience

436
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:28,080
we got to do, I think the main way they got me on board is drinking was involved.

437
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,400
Started a bar. Yeah, that's true.

438
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,400
They were after they were after my heart.

439
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,280
But we'll we'll get to that later.

440
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,960
Two hours thing. You need you need drinks.

441
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,680
Yeah, sure.

442
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,960
Hagrid's like you don't imagine is two hours.

443
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,360
But I think the wait will be long.

444
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,800
But I think if this were any other year, if the Star Wars stuff wasn't opening,

445
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,880
this would probably be the new attraction of the year.

446
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:56,480
Hands down, it might still be because it'll have less intense waits.

447
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,760
I mean, I waited four hours, three and a half hours for Gringotts, the opening summer.

448
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,960
But it is interesting.

449
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,160
I mean, I hope we're about that.

450
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,320
We're at the start of this.

451
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,040
I think we've said this before, like a theme park or a Renaissance

452
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:12,080
where it's like this is just one of the crazy rides opening.

453
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,000
Yes. Yeah. In another year, you'd be like this thing like a different

454
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,640
like years past, you'd be like, this is the craziest new ride ever.

455
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,840
It's amazing.

456
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:25,200
Whereas like this could be the third best ride that opens this year.

457
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,600
I hope so. I don't want it to be the nightmare scenario is

458
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:34,760
what happened in all of our childhoods where the Indiana Jones adventure

459
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,880
was the part of this climb of great attractions.

460
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,400
And then it sort of stopped.

461
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,160
There was not really great new rides after that.

462
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,080
I don't want a peak to happen.

463
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,560
And then we plummet down the peak.

464
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,000
I don't want drops in general. Sure.

465
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,920
Metaphorically or on my actual rights.

466
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,960
I agree. I think I think there probably nothing can beat this.

467
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,680
Nothing will beat this year.

468
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,400
Next year, like nothing.

469
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,160
There's not enough rides next year that are coming out.

470
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,640
But I hope like it's an overall trend and then Nintendo and Nintendo.

471
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,640
Well, Nintendo is the rumors.

472
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,000
I believe it's next year for Japan out here.

473
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,440
I think it's twenty twenty one.

474
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,040
And then they don't seem that close yet.

475
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,280
It's still I feel like they're still like in ground clearing mode.

476
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,640
Yeah. Well, yeah. If you drive by the lot over here, they're still doing

477
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,240
like site prep or maybe there's a big tall crane.

478
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,320
Though we have passed by that a lot.

479
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,040
I like seeing that crane. I know good stuff's coming.

480
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,240
Yeah, because what's also weird is I keep forgetting

481
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,720
Jurassic World opens this year, too, out here, which is obviously a reskin.

482
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,720
But still, like this is that's way down the list.

483
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,920
And they did it looks to be a ton of work.

484
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,320
Yeah, I don't think it's an insignificant.

485
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,120
I think it's a little more than a paint job.

486
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,600
Since we're talking Jurassic stuff, we're just starting to hear the rumblings

487
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,520
about a potential Jurassic Park coaster in Island of Adventure.

488
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,280
I was all right. Yeah. Yeah.

489
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,960
It's unclear like where because there's rumors of Jurassic

490
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,120
World going in that third park in Orlando.

491
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:10,520
And it's very it's it's I think there's a lot of stuff moving around there.

492
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:16,320
Yeah. So who knows what's going to land where and we're in a theme park arms race.

493
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,880
Yeah. Yeah. The the rumor is that

494
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:24,360
Disney knew that some long awaited details about this Hagrid

495
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,520
ride were going to come out and they had to strike back,

496
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,920
which is why on the same day they announced day with

497
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:38,720
they their their press armada launched quite emissive, which is an attraction,

498
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,280
an unnamed attraction about the general notion of play.

499
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,320
Come in that car.

500
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,880
So, yeah, so they did a big press release.

501
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,560
They announced a while ago, they announced, I know, big changes.

502
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:54,400
Epcot, they've announced that Guardians coaster and then they had two is coming.

503
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,120
I haven't talked about that a ton, but that's going to the France.

504
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,760
Is that this year?

505
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,080
I don't know what year that is.

506
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,160
That's part of the general.

507
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:04,880
I don't think so.

508
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,680
There's also a Beauty and the Beast sing along that will alternate

509
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,160
with impressions to France.

510
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,480
Did you guys know? I don't even know.

511
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,240
That's still going to do.

512
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,240
They're still going to do impressions.

513
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,360
But then sometimes in the day, they're going to do like a Beauty and the Beast

514
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,040
sing along.

515
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,920
No child will have a bigger tantrum than if their parents got

516
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,520
took them into the wrong screening.

517
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,840
I have to say, the last time I was in Florida, that one, the very end of one night,

518
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,960
I was like, OK, according to the map and the app,

519
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,480
I this should be open.

520
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,640
And I got there and I forget what the they're like, oh, no, it's he's close.

521
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,680
Like I was and I was very specific.

522
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,680
Void.

523
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,280
So mournful. So sad.

524
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,920
Ratatouille, the rumor, I think, is May 2020.

525
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,320
Wow. Yeah.

526
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,440
So that's a big step.

527
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,560
Until 2021.

528
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,280
Yeah, that's right.

529
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:01,120
On the way or as part of this rejuvenation of Epcot.

530
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,440
Yeah, we're getting a new.

531
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,480
What do you call it?

532
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,960
What the pavilion?

533
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,480
No. Yeah, but the entrance way.

534
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,240
Sorry. The entrance way.

535
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,440
Yeah, you're getting a new entry way.

536
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,280
Right. Which I don't know.

537
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,280
What else to call it?

538
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,200
New entry way.

539
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,200
Guess what? Universal eat it.

540
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,400
New Epcot entry way.

541
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,160
This actually probably will be very nice.

542
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,040
Yes, it looks nice. It looks beautiful.

543
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,280
Taboo, your trees.

544
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,240
Someone was speculating that's what the pink trees are called.

545
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,400
What taboo, your trees taboo.

546
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:37,280
Yeah, I was trying to find a pronunciation of it online.

547
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,840
And I could only find those YouTube robot pronunciations where it's like

548
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,320
eight seconds long and it goes like taboo.

549
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,880
Why in those videos?

550
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,080
I've had to use these multiple times.

551
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,200
Why does it take so long before the word is said?

552
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,480
And you don't know what volume to set it at.

553
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,280
So you might like, am I just not hearing it?

554
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,800
And then you turn your computer up all the way.

555
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,760
Awful.

556
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:04,040
Whoever whatever bots are making these pronunciation videos,

557
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,560
get your acts together.

558
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,040
Stick to Johnny Johnny.

559
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,200
Glad we're addressing this.

560
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:13,040
Finally, I could see a robot in the play pavilion pronounce words for you,

561
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,960
like that's the job.

562
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,600
That's the whole thing is you would type a word and then it would say it.

563
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,800
Like that's I think that might be what they're going for.

564
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,600
So you think it's pronunciation robots?

565
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,640
I kind of do.

566
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,080
I kind of think that maybe that's sort of what it is.

567
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,360
Well, I have a question.

568
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,480
Which one or which one do you want to discuss?

569
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,440
I am the answer.

570
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,120
Or the play? Yeah, it's like we don't know whether to go into interventions,

571
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,320
West or East. Which way do we go?

572
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,160
I don't have much to say about the fountains or about the new entrance.

573
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,560
But I have a couple of quick things.

574
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,360
Well, let's here's their press release that it will be.

575
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,800
So as you're entering Epcot Center on your way to the glorious golf ball,

576
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,560
a lush you'll see a lush area with sweeping green spaces, new pathways

577
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,400
and a reimagined fountain.

578
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:01,360
Take that potter that will pay homage to the original park entrance

579
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,440
with fresh takes on classic elements.

580
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,760
I'll probably like that because I love the architecture of Epcot Center so much.

581
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,400
So maybe this will be good.

582
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,400
But one thing that I want to talk about a little is that they are moving

583
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,960
the leave a legacy pillars.

584
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:21,320
If if you don't know about the leave a legacy pillar, congrats,

585
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,920
you're not a dork.

586
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,880
But the leave a legacy pillar, if you don't know, are

587
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,440
around the millennium.

588
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,040
They put up these big gray

589
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,720
tilty boxes. Monoliths.

590
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,920
Yeah, yes.

591
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:41,280
2001 ask Monoliths, but not as aesthetically pleasing as the 2001 monolith.

592
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,360
No, no one ever gathered around one like those apes.

593
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,240
Nobody was ever intrigued by these.

594
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,520
Everybody marched past him as quickly as possible.

595
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:53,840
So big monoliths, that sounds scary and unfriendly with lacking a personal touch.

596
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,360
Right. No, no, no.

597
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,360
This is the millennium.

598
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:01,400
You need to leave your mark on this era as mankind crosses into a new century.

599
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,520
You you could make a way they'd take a picture of you

600
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:10,080
and then they'd make a weird etching on this monolith.

601
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:14,720
So and there's like hundreds of thousands of these things all lining

602
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:19,680
these bizarre, not too detailed black and white etchings of visitors

603
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,040
to Epcot Center.

604
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,560
And they promised these would not get moved for at least a decade.

605
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,560
I think they made it almost two.

606
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,480
And now they're getting moved somewhere outside the park to a garbage can.

607
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,240
I don't know. But apparently.

608
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:37,000
But I you guys ever looked into the leave a legacy pillars for any reason?

609
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,960
I'm shocked. I'd be very curious.

610
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,320
I should ask my parents.

611
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,880
Like, did you ever get a brochure about this?

612
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,160
And did you ever consider this?

613
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,800
Did you ever consider naming a star?

614
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:51,400
Did you ever consider having your name on one of the spaceships on the Mars Rover?

615
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,640
I haven't looked into the details.

616
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,560
How much was it to leave your legacy?

617
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,120
Thirty five dollars a face.

618
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,200
There'd be a two for deal.

619
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,240
You get a little maybe maybe if you're doing two faces, you maybe get that for 60.

620
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,400
So they got you some millennium slack very kindly.

621
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,440
Well, now I'm mad that we didn't because that is a lot less money

622
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,160
than I thought it would be. Really?

623
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:17,680
To me, like if you look at the quality, I don't know that it's thirty five dollar

624
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,320
quality. I you might be right.

625
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,760
How much were the cobblestones in the Esplanade?

626
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,200
Do you remember that?

627
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,440
I don't know.

628
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,200
Outside Disneyland, between the two parks, you notice all the names

629
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,360
and the stones as you're passing back and forth.

630
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,760
And I don't recall.

631
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,440
I'm sure I must have been tempted to ask my parents to do one.

632
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,760
But those I feel like were probably more expensive because those at least look.

633
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,440
I would think a little nicer.

634
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:44,560
It's a little classier and more prime real estate, less likely to go away.

635
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,160
But you know who you know who popped out

636
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,240
at least five sets of thirty five dollars.

637
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,000
I never knew this in sync.

638
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,600
If you know where to look somewhere,

639
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,080
there's like one hundred and fifty thousand faces.

640
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:05,840
But all in a row, five in a row is 1990, 1999 era in sync.

641
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,680
Wow. Yeah, weird, right?

642
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,640
That's interesting. I wonder how many like famous people are on there.

643
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:15,080
I is somewhere in there, they say, in the last Zodiac killer letter.

644
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,760
He says, I bought it.

645
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,040
My face is in here. Find it if you dare.

646
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,440
The solution to the solution to the crime.

647
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,360
Everyone is like, that's too boring.

648
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,280
I don't know why they didn't.

649
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,560
Yeah, it was too boring.

650
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:32,280
And it's also they should have just looked because he was wearing the burlap sack.

651
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,040
So it would have been a dead giveaway.

652
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,680
There we go. Yeah, it's like he has something to hide.

653
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,240
There are some creepily, some people without faces in those,

654
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:45,160
because apparently you can find where people, you know, commemorated them

655
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,720
and their wife or girlfriend or vice versa, and then went back

656
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,640
after the relationship ended and scratched their face up.

657
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,520
That's bleak. Yeah, that's really bleak.

658
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,440
That's a fairly common syndrome there.

659
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,560
Yeah, yeah, pretty dark. So, yeah.

660
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:08,200
So the shards of lost relationships can no longer be viewed outside of Epcot.

661
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,640
We get some dumb booyah trees instead.

662
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,640
But I do a full leave a legacy episode.

663
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,120
I think I was hoping we could skip it by doing it now.

664
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:23,920
That was just a little teaser to a 20, a 20, 23 episode about the leave a legacy.

665
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,200
But I guess the right preview center.

666
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,400
We could do that when you're in Japan, but I think you're going to sleep on it

667
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,480
and get too excited and change your mind.

668
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:36,880
I mean, I did happily, willingly share information about the leave a legacy pillars.

669
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,640
Are they filled?

670
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:43,480
Filled? Is there any room left to leave a legacy?

671
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,920
There's got to be, right?

672
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,080
I don't know.

673
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,480
I don't know if it's still a deal.

674
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:47,960
They shut it down.

675
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,280
They shut down the center where you buy them.

676
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,840
But if we wanted to go crudely etch our own faces in there,

677
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,360
without their permission, it'd be easier to do, especially because they're moving them

678
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,520
to bumfuck outside the park.

679
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,600
So they're putting them where river country is right now.

680
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,040
They're just going to slowly sink into the seven seas.

681
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,960
They're going to try and fill the various sinkholes

682
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,080
scattered throughout the property.

683
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,120
They're going to solve a lot of problems.

684
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,680
Crush a lot of potentially

685
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,400
child eating alligators by dropping them into the lake.

686
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,520
Yeah. All right.

687
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,080
Twenty alligators underneath.

688
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,640
I have to say, I'm excited for this new entryway because it seems like they are going to

689
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,360
restore or do, as they say, in tribute to the original entrance.

690
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:36,320
It looks like the fountain, the clear glass fountain that used to be there.

691
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,960
That's what they mean. Well, now I think in the picture it looks like that.

692
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,320
And I also just think greener like if you just fill Epcot

693
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:50,400
with beautiful lush green trees like that does feel optimistic about the future.

694
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,120
And it will help cut down on the amount of brown,

695
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,640
the brown stone, brown metal just everywhere.

696
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,960
Oh, no, I love my brown metal.

697
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,560
Yeah, that's that's part of it. Or at least like, I mean,

698
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:07,720
I don't think they'll ever fully get rid of it, but just some touches of green.

699
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,440
Because the other thing about all the brown is it can get hot.

700
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,120
It does make it feel a little hotter than usually it is.

701
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,960
So it is a hot area that is grass.

702
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,640
Yes. It is like a big skillet, honestly.

703
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:23,400
If you look at the map, yeah, like a foreman grill, potentially

704
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,360
like our very own future.

705
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,720
Yeah, potentially.

706
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,800
I don't think it's potentially for sure.

707
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,960
Oh, God. Cook alive.

708
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,320
Well, there's more things to dread in the future because, you know,

709
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,680
we just did this interventions episode and I did not put it together

710
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,800
that based on our work, they just put up.

711
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,160
It seems like they're tearing those buildings down.

712
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,800
I think we got no interventions.

713
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,520
Yeah. I'll becoming gardens.

714
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,240
It looks like I heard this sort of stuff on the one that they

715
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,800
Disney, when they do concept art, they use

716
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:58,880
like greenery or like trees in like the distance or the middle distance

717
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,320
of just like, yeah, ignore this and look here like they they.

718
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,200
Oh, that's why it may like it may to touch.

719
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,960
Don't to not distract the eyes in the way that the go away.

720
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,440
Green paint is like, don't look at this.

721
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,240
This isn't important. Look over here.

722
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,000
I see. So the buildings might still be there and we still might be able

723
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,440
to use our fiber optic brushes, see Tybrell and

724
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,680
I guess no longer hear the electronics president's rap.

725
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,200
Sadly, though, if the garden.

726
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,440
So there's a rumor that the guardians queue is going to be filled with retro

727
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,760
Epcot stuff, which fingers crossed, electronic should for sure be in that line.

728
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:45,520
Yeah. With like the buzzy and whatever, like figment and stuff.

729
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:49,600
So I think maybe there's a chance, fingers crossed, we could get electronic.

730
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,440
And I'd like it.

731
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:55,760
I'd like them to update it so he would do raps about the president since.

732
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,160
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

733
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,080
Maybe there's some just off the top of my head, maybe Barack rhymes with like

734
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,560
I did the stilted way that I talk.

735
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,040
Just I'm throwing that out.

736
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,120
That's good for a future president's rep.

737
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,080
I think that's I think that's good.

738
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,000
You could start there.

739
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,240
I did. I'm sorry. I didn't freestyle the entire thing.

740
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,520
I'm no Eminem.

741
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,720
I I call we should.

742
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,280
We call for like scoops a lot.

743
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,160
And if you are an imaginary who listens to us and you are currently

744
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:27,240
working on the guardians queue and you want some more jokes for electronic

745
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,720
to say a rap, please contact us.

746
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,680
We will do this for free, much like we did the street naming at Margaritaville.

747
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,280
Yeah. Which now they think about it.

748
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,360
I don't know if that has come out yet.

749
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,040
The episode we did.

750
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,600
No, it is not perhaps not.

751
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,080
I well, preview of things to come.

752
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,560
And we understand the voice that we're writing for.

753
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,360
We're not going to write mean raps about Trump or George W.

754
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:56,320
Bush. They're going to be the most both sides material.

755
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:01,800
Are you allowed to if can you do satire about Trump's hair?

756
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,960
If he like he makes fun of his hair.

757
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:08,680
So you could maybe do a rap or would he like tweet angry things about electronic

758
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,840
and how he's electronic has been rigged?

759
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,040
I think he would mean tweet about electronic.

760
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,920
The robot is biased because then he would compare it to the other raps

761
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,360
about the other presidents.

762
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,280
Now, I guess if electronic is still doing his rap

763
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:27,960
about how Gerald Ford falls down a lot, then you could say, OK, well, he's roasting,

764
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,720
gently roasting a lot of the presidents.

765
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,720
I feel like he still might say no president has ever been

766
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,880
wrapped about so unfairly as sloppy electronic

767
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:41,680
rapping about the your president, glitchy electronic.

768
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:47,080
Low talent, low talent, least skin of any Disney animatronic.

769
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,120
If you're so if you're so cool, get some skin.

770
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,240
Medium medium talent is so much more devastating, right?

771
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,880
I think medium Trump has definitely gotten under some skins

772
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,120
by calling people medium talent.

773
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,280
I couldn't deal with it.

774
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,200
I feel like Alec would just electronic would just do like a joke about

775
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,760
you're fired or something like, yeah.

776
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,360
Oh, yeah.

777
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,960
I would just be like, I'm very famous for saying you're fired.

778
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,200
Right. It would be very benign and like also be like celebrating his famous

779
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,320
catchphrase, I guess, because he didn't want to get too political

780
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:23,160
because you don't want to you don't want riots in the line for Guardians of the Galaxy.

781
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,960
Yeah, I am so upset about what this defunct

782
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,080
animatronic brought back to rap about a current president said

783
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,880
that I'm going to burn the roller coaster. Yeah, we don't want that.

784
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,400
Maybe we'll know more because they're turning in the Odyssey,

785
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,520
the Odyssey restaurant

786
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:44,520
in the sort of on the border of World Showcase and Future World

787
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,200
into like a preview center.

788
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,760
They sure are. And I'm psyched about that.

789
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,640
Because you talk about your browns.

790
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,520
I love that Odyssey restaurant.

791
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,160
I'm really glad that it's getting used.

792
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:58,240
I work we're going long on all this, but I would just like to point out.

793
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,520
I learned a little bit about the Odyssey restaurant.

794
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:04,000
It's on kind of it's between Future World and World Showcase.

795
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,600
And it's this boring building.

796
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,920
And I would describe the theme of this place as hexagons.

797
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,880
It is a hexagon themed

798
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,720
building that is a restaurant for like three weeks out of the year.

799
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,480
I think at one point it was a full restaurant, the Odyssey restaurant,

800
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,480
in which you could buy these three items.

801
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,200
Odyssey Burger Voyager Hot Dog Discovery Salad.

802
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,040
God damn it.

803
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,920
So when you were bringing it away for putting a preview center in there pay,

804
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,480
you know, so much Epcot retro love is coming back.

805
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,000
It's time to start selling the Discovery Salad again,

806
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,840
which I imagine was lettuce with maybe three cucumbers.

807
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,320
Right. And ranch dressing.

808
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,840
Well, they got a they got to put a nod to that on that space

809
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,120
restaurant they're building. Oh, yeah.

810
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,280
Those items, you've already trademarked these names.

811
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:54,360
Voyager Hot Dog is the perfect hot dog space name.

812
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,760
I I always thought this is the deal with Odyssey.

813
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,520
And I guess it's probably just a conclusion I drew was that they thought,

814
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,040
well, we need to have good.

815
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:08,960
We need to have good food options is a more adult theme park in all areas.

816
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,880
But then World Showcase restaurants were such a big hit

817
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,920
and so quickly that they're like, oh, this place isn't really doing that well,

818
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:22,440
because I feel like there are people like who like the restaurants in the land,

819
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,560
the quick service and then the character,

820
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:29,000
sometimes character buffets, sometimes a garden grill,

821
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,760
whatever it's it's currently serving.

822
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,000
And we're just going to land boat ride and just kind of reach off

823
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,640
when no one's looking and grab food.

824
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,640
A little bell pepper.

825
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:41,280
Yep. That's your Epcot hack for eating for free.

826
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,840
I got an alligator.

827
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:47,200
Bring a little like a shepherd's crook and like, yes, there we go.

828
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:53,000
Pull it or a little like robot claw like you get a dollar store.

829
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,600
My grandmother had one to like get something off a high shelf,

830
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,760
which still doesn't really make sense.

831
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,320
And maybe not the most practical thing.

832
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,600
But that was a fun gimmick to have.

833
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:07,120
If you're already a shepherd or the sandman from Showtime at the Apollo,

834
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:12,080
take that hook into the park, sneak it in in your clothes, like condense it.

835
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:15,960
Yeah. Take it on the boat ride and nip yourself a tomato.

836
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,600
If it's like a selfie stick, but a shepherd's crook where it could extend.

837
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,400
Well, you can't take the selfie sticks and you can probably get a shepherd's crook.

838
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,840
You could buy an extend extendable shepherd's crook.

839
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,000
In Orlando, here's the secret.

840
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,160
Bring in a sheep, but say that it's a therapy sheep.

841
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,000
Oh, yeah. The crook to,

842
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,560
you know, lead it around. Right.

843
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,920
Like a leash. This is a quick side note, but I think I saw on an airplane,

844
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,880
like because we were traveling with a dog and I think you could bring a therapy

845
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:48,160
like horse on a plane or something.

846
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,120
Not a full size like like a dog sized horse, like a dog sized horse.

847
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,800
I'm pretty sure it sounds crazy.

848
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,280
I'll double check that. But it was an animal that you're like, no,

849
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,200
that's a joke. Right.

850
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:02,200
But it was on the Alaska Airlines approved therapy animals.

851
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:06,440
I thought you were going to bring up the more insane shepherd's crook story

852
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:10,200
recently, which is in the connect, which connects to Disney. Yeah.

853
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,800
Which is that PETA? I think it was PETA.

854
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,160
So Toy Story 4. Right.

855
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,800
That's a perfect segue that I didn't mean to make.

856
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:24,200
Bo is back and she's kind of like she's got pants now or pantaloon.

857
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,200
She's got a new outfit, but she's still got the shepherd's crook.

858
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,160
And PETA is like, how could you bring back this character

859
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,160
with that barbaric shepherd's hook?

860
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:37,800
We're of all the things to be mad about now.

861
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,280
I don't locate. I get it. I understand.

862
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,640
I see what they're saying.

863
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,280
And we don't condone cruelty to animals, but of all the things

864
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:49,640
to be upset about in twenty nineteen, one is that a fictional

865
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:55,960
doll who her sheep are porcelain, as is she.

866
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:00,520
She is not using the crook to ensnare real sheep

867
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,640
and grind them up into some machine.

868
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,800
These are toys. She is a toy.

869
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,960
She is a toy.

870
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,560
And also, aren't we all happy that she's not gone forever?

871
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:14,440
I thought I thought it was alluded to that she was just gone forever.

872
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,040
And now she's OK.

873
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,880
She disappeared forever, seemingly never to be heard from again.

874
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,400
Now she is like the basis of Toy Story 4 and is probably going to be

875
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:25,040
a strong female character that is a good new way to bring back

876
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,080
Annie Potts, who's a very good actress.

877
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,680
But we still found a way to be upset.

878
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,360
Yeah, it's a little weird.

879
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,600
But now I sound like my dad or something.

880
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:41,400
My my feeling is like if I thought that like I sometimes there's stuff

881
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,200
where you go like a Wolverine can't smoke a cigar anymore.

882
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,280
And it's like, yeah, or Nick Fury.

883
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,800
He's a big he's like a gruff, dirty man.

884
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,480
It's like, I guess he should be.

885
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,000
But I get it for hire.

886
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,040
But to be fair, I guess I also understand that like a ton of kids see this.

887
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,680
And OK, fine.

888
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,280
Wolverine looks badass smoking a cigar.

889
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,880
We don't want to promote that.

890
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:07,240
I don't think there's a chance that a ton of little kids

891
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:11,880
come out of Toy Story 4 and go, Mommy, Mommy, we have to go get me a shepherd's

892
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,680
crook because I want to use it on a sheep at a farm.

893
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,160
Like, I don't think that's going to happen.

894
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,120
So I could see where you would advocate it if it was like possible.

895
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:24,520
The kids are now going to start just crooking sheep left and right.

896
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,000
But I don't see that happening.

897
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,960
They start with other animals at home.

898
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,960
Yeah, I want to croak the dog.

899
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,440
And he croaked the cat.

900
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,960
Crooking is that a verb?

901
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,360
Is that the crooking?

902
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,000
I hear all the kids are crooking now.

903
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,720
I saw this thing on Fox News.

904
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,040
It's called crooking.

905
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,680
And your children may be doing it behind your back.

906
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,000
They're probably doing it right now.

907
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:46,880
Turn and look at them.

908
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,920
They presumably just hid their crook in the time it took you to turn.

909
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,200
We would, of course, if we were if the crooking was around

910
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,720
when we were kids, we would have not done it because we were too good.

911
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,520
Yeah, boys. No crooks for us.

912
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,800
Anyway, let's get back to the play.

913
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,480
We still haven't talked about the play pavilion.

914
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,560
OK, we what it's OK.

915
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:10,440
So in where the Wonders of Life pavilion once was, you've heard about Buzzy

916
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:13,720
and Cranium Command is also where the body wars attraction was.

917
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,120
It's this dome that's been mostly empty at Epcot Center.

918
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,920
And now they're going to turn it into a new space devoted to playful fun

919
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:24,840
with an innovative city that will come to life with your favorite characters.

920
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:28,040
OK. OK.

921
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:34,040
So, yeah, I I'm hoping so that kind of doesn't mean anything in plain English.

922
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:39,520
Not yet. I am hoping people are speculating this kind of looks like the portals

923
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,920
and Ralph breaks the Internet, which I have not yet seen.

924
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,280
I'm hoping that's not the case.

925
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,440
I feel like that would age really poorly.

926
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:49,360
A tribute to the 2019 Internet.

927
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,280
Yeah, because it kind of looks like a city.

928
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,720
I mean, I'm hoping it is this color scheme.

929
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,560
The interesting theory, and I'm going to shout out theme park insider.

930
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:02,640
Their theory is that this is a Disney Imagineering pavilion

931
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:08,360
where they will show off new technology, show off like smaller scale attractions

932
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,800
that they don't have to scale to huge things.

933
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,040
I think that's a really cool idea.

934
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,880
I think it's very wishful thinking.

935
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,440
I hope that's right.

936
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,280
I mean, I would like it to be that.

937
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:21,800
What I'm afraid of is that it's going to be a lot of shit

938
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:25,160
that you do with the Disney Play app on your phone.

939
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:28,560
And they pass off as interactive because I think the Imagineering pavilion,

940
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:33,080
they would have to be really on the ball with updating it and rotating in new exhibits.

941
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,440
There's a lot of OK.

942
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:37,960
First of all, that's we haven't talked much about Disney Play, the app,

943
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,560
which basically and I don't know how it's been working.

944
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,360
It's been out for a few months now.

945
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:45,960
It's basically a line like time killer.

946
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:48,200
Yeah. And they had a version of it a couple of years ago

947
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,080
where you would answer trivia in line.

948
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,040
And that was kind of funny.

949
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,800
You just answer. It was multiple choice.

950
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,680
You'd answer, I think, out of four or whatever.

951
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,240
And then, oh, you get your score at the end.

952
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,120
And now we killed some time in the line.

953
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:03,080
Now there's a thing and I've only tried it with Space Mountain called Disney Play.

954
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:08,320
And it is an insane pain in the ass.

955
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,320
There's no other way to put it.

956
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:14,760
There are just like tasks where you have to like put little puzzles together.

957
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,160
And if you have to do it with another person and you're just it's like stressful

958
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,400
and you're doing it while you're walking in line.

959
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,040
But it doesn't make noise that would distract people around you.

960
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:26,960
What it absolutely makes noise that are distracting.

961
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,960
And you look over and you go, what are those people doing?

962
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,720
And then there's like a race every 15 minutes that you've.

963
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,080
So basically, like the idea for the Space Mountain one is you have a ship

964
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:39,160
and it levels up after you do tasks correctly.

965
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,200
And the tasks are hard.

966
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,280
But then you're playing against the other people in line.

967
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,360
And if you win, you get to like a fast pass to go to the front of the line.

968
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,000
And the race is hard and confusing.

969
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:52,360
And it doesn't like you can't even control it, really.

970
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:53,480
You're just like hitting a button.

971
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,920
And it's like and by the end.

972
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:57,600
So we did this. It took the whole line.

973
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,800
And we just got to the front of Space Mountain finally.

974
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,400
And we were just like exhausted.

975
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,240
And we were like, what?

976
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:06,840
Because the idea of, oh, fun game when a fast pass is cool.

977
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,200
I like the idea of it.

978
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,160
This was insane.

979
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,280
I don't know if it's still like this.

980
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:16,800
But the concept of this, I hope that this is not tied into like

981
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:22,080
a long, frustrating, complicated game system that you play.

982
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:24,040
I mean, it's the same Disney play.

983
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:27,840
And this is called this is like a salute to play or whatever they say.

984
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:30,000
It doesn't have an official name yet.

985
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:30,840
That's true. That's true.

986
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,520
That's how people are framing it.

987
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:35,960
Like if there's the imagination pavilion, then there's the play pavilion.

988
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,680
The power of play is what I think the press really says.

989
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:43,400
It's like something like more play modern theme park names.

990
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,960
The power play place sound like like

991
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:49,560
John Kerry or Tim Kaine describing fun.

992
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,560
Well, yeah, the power of play.

993
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,760
Yeah, the power of play.

994
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:58,080
So as a child, what would that mean to you?

995
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:59,320
Nothing is a child.

996
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:02,520
Show me a ball pit, at least if you want to talk play.

997
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,960
Get me in some tubes in a ball pit and show me a robot band.

998
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:09,120
We're a massive room full of free Sega Genesis.

999
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,640
Sure. I mean, that is what that's what this looks like to me.

1000
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:16,000
It looks first of all, it looks neon. It looks cool.

1001
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,440
This is no offense to any imagineers.

1002
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,600
I hope I love this thing.

1003
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:24,080
And I love to celebrate the power of play.

1004
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:28,120
But what this looks like to me is like, oh, this is a new intervention.

1005
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:32,200
This is a new end of Spaceship Earth, where there's a bunch of like computers

1006
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:38,000
and kiosks that will age very rapidly after a year or two.

1007
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:42,600
Like Spaceship Earth, where it's like, put your heads on the future family.

1008
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,040
And you're like, oh, that must have been cute for a few months.

1009
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:45,960
And then now you're doing it.

1010
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:49,760
And it's just like designed to keep you inside for a few minutes longer.

1011
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:53,000
So you don't go back out into the park and like fill up the frozen queue.

1012
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,680
I'm awfully worried.

1013
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,400
I think it I agree. It could be great.

1014
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:02,120
I am the Disney precedent of interactive exhibits and stuff.

1015
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:04,440
It's a pretty messy history.

1016
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:08,680
It just never it's just yeah, there might be a couple of things in there,

1017
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:13,440
but it's all it feels like all the things we're talking about.

1018
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:18,280
Like the the stuff in the queue on Haunted Mansion, where it was like,

1019
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:21,200
play a game in the Haunted Mansion queue at Disney World.

1020
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,120
And then it's like, that's gone. No one wants to do that.

1021
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,520
Just enjoy the real line.

1022
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,960
Whatever happened to the old way of passing time?

1023
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,880
The art of polite conversation?

1024
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,200
Yeah, good point.

1025
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:37,880
These kids are the game where they flip their name up on their forehead.

1026
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:41,480
And that drives me crazy when people do that in line.

1027
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,320
It is so. But, you know, I actually did it

1028
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,200
one time with people and I did enjoy it.

1029
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,840
It's not bad. It's a fun game.

1030
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:51,880
Maybe I should try judging it. But I did have fun.

1031
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,840
I assume the pavilion is just like a lot of phones with the names.

1032
00:50:55,840 --> 00:51:00,360
I think I may have been in a queue that is enjoyable,

1033
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:01,880
like the Guardians queue or something,

1034
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:04,200
where I was trying to like figure out what the songs were.

1035
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,800
And then people are like, yeah, yeah.

1036
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,280
President Clinton.

1037
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,600
I think there's fun.

1038
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:14,000
There's fun, probably applications with a phone

1039
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:18,720
and like like queues where it was like you would discover things

1040
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,920
or you're going through big thunder and you discover like

1041
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:26,000
some piece of sea history on the phone and you answer a trivia question.

1042
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
And then like there's got to be something cool.

1043
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:32,320
Well, you're saying you want sea trivia.

1044
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:36,360
You want children to have to learn about the inside

1045
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:41,680
Disney mythology of the explorers who all own nice buildings in the past.

1046
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,000
Yes, I guess that's true. Yes.

1047
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,360
I do think kids should learn about sea.

1048
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,600
What's the right age for a child to learn about sea?

1049
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,440
Yeah, I mean, that's between the parents and the child.

1050
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,800
But my I would think eight, seven or eight.

1051
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:59,080
Then when you explore, introduce the the

1052
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:01,320
Congress in Hightower, that's Harrison.

1053
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,160
This is Barnabas T.

1054
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,240
Bullion. He created the train.

1055
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:07,880
We're going to go on, son. Oh, wow.

1056
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,960
Here's something else you should learn, son.

1057
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,400
You will have no friends as an adult.

1058
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,160
Now that you know this much about Harrison Hightower,

1059
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,160
you got a rough road ahead of you.

1060
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,960
No friends.

1061
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:26,400
Well, you will, but you'll be in your 30s and it'll just take you a minute.

1062
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,800
Yeah, it'll take you a minute.

1063
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,480
Maybe you can start a podcast.

1064
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,400
Yeah, it's all different worlds.

1065
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,480
Podcast. You will have anxiety.

1066
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,120
There's a lot of talk in the press like about characters, so it feels like

1067
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:44,240
like we're going to do all the character greeting stuff here.

1068
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:47,280
It'll be a catch all for that.

1069
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:50,680
So they're going to move wherever the character spots are now here.

1070
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:54,160
People were kind of where's wallowing the concept art on this.

1071
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,440
And you can see, I mean, Mickey came in with a family.

1072
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,440
Mickey gave him a family holding their hands.

1073
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,480
Yeah. You see here he's holding his young

1074
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:07,560
the young child's hand and then kind of on the buildings.

1075
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:11,200
There's sort of kawaii cutesy versions of like Edna mode.

1076
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:14,600
Somewhere in here is joy from inside out.

1077
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,240
She's on the right by the hotel. It says Hotel.

1078
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,040
Oh, yeah. To say Hotel.

1079
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:19,720
Is that a cat?

1080
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:22,160
I think that's Marie from the Aristocat.

1081
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,040
I mean, I like that. That's cool.

1082
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:27,440
You want your theme park destination to hang with Marie

1083
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,840
done in pretty explicitly Hello Kitty style.

1084
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:35,200
Yeah. If you want to help Disney cut into the Sanrio market shares,

1085
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:37,200
this is your place to do it.

1086
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:41,200
I mean, the building that interests us has like the Wedway logo on the top

1087
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:45,360
and then the sort of bottom kind of has a monorail sort of

1088
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,600
pattern to it. Kind of.

1089
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,960
How much do you mean the word interest?

1090
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,720
We like that. You're figuring it out.

1091
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:57,320
There's there's like a kind of a Rubik's cube type building

1092
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:00,040
on the top left here that I might be interested in.

1093
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:02,240
I could be see being interested in it.

1094
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,440
I don't know what's inside.

1095
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,760
Maybe puzzles, perhaps. I love the colors.

1096
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:06,840
I love the blue and purple.

1097
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:09,400
I mean, yeah, I'm hoping it looks like this.

1098
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:12,040
And then there's like it looks like you sit down and perhaps

1099
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,960
there's a show in the middle of you. Did you see that?

1100
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:16,920
Sort of an amphitheater look. But it's like a small area.

1101
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:21,000
So this this feels look, this is much better than

1102
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:24,040
what they have now, I think.

1103
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:27,760
Empty drop ceilings and empty rooms with naked robots.

1104
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,280
Roddy easily stolen.

1105
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,640
Yeah. So I think this will look cool.

1106
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:33,960
Like, look at Epcot. It's got a look cool at night.

1107
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,200
And I think that's what this is going to do.

1108
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,800
Love the colors. This concept art.

1109
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,040
Yeah. Sick colors.

1110
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,440
That has a lot to do with my complaints.

1111
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,240
And it's all in a dome.

1112
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,720
I like that, too. Cool colors and domes.

1113
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:50,080
Neon pinks. Scott's in. Fantastic.

1114
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:53,760
So, yeah, who knows?

1115
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:55,200
We shall see.

1116
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:59,120
But, you know, maybe there's a reason to be optimistic about this

1117
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:01,960
because we have recently had an experience where we've

1118
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:07,280
that was sort of an immersive world of interactive elements and games

1119
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:12,000
that transported you into into another dimension of fun.

1120
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:16,680
And we did find this to be a surprisingly satisfying experience.

1121
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:20,240
And I am referring to Passport to Iron City,

1122
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:26,080
the pseudo main topic after a lot of today's talk of today's episode.

1123
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:29,680
This is this interactive experience that is based on the film

1124
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,040
Alita Battle Angel.

1125
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:34,880
And this is something that's been set up in Los Angeles, in New York

1126
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,160
and in Austin.

1127
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:41,480
And it is a very theme parky thing that I guess, Mike,

1128
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,400
you got curious about and you poked around if we could go visit it.

1129
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,400
And we got the opportunity to visit it.

1130
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,560
Yes. This is this like there's a lot of like movie

1131
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:51,760
promotion stuff that pops up.

1132
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:56,440
But this one was particularly intriguing because it's like kind of downtown.

1133
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:57,720
It's in a weird spot.

1134
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:00,560
And it felt like it was there was much more to it than like

1135
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:03,360
I saw there was like a Lego movie, too, thing

1136
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,520
that was in like a tent on Hollywood Boulevard.

1137
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:09,040
So it felt like getting pissed on every day.

1138
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:12,560
Yeah, this felt like, OK, this seems like they're going a little more.

1139
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,600
They're going a little the extra mile, I guess you would say.

1140
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,600
Yeah. So it was like, let's see.

1141
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:18,520
Yeah, let's poke around.

1142
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:23,120
And also here, you know, let me just not to make people just listen to a video.

1143
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:26,760
But, you know, it is hard to explain what this thing is.

1144
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:31,320
And I discovered that there is a video you can watch where James Cameron

1145
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:35,440
explains what this thing is for the fact that James Cameron is involved

1146
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,880
and does a sort of Michael Eisnery presentation about it.

1147
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,800
That sure legitimizes it, doesn't it?

1148
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,960
Of course, it clears a quick little moment of James Cameron's

1149
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:46,520
part to Iron City is a truly first of its kind immersive experience.

1150
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,680
It fully transports you to the world of Alita Battle Angel.

1151
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:54,200
After you enter, have a drink at the Hunter Warrior Hangout,

1152
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,280
the Kansas Bar, don't mind if I do, or Iron City

1153
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,640
from the marketplace to the Motorball Stadium.

1154
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:02,360
You can even dig through cyborg parts in the scrap yard.

1155
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:06,120
We brought Iron City to life as a 12,000 square foot

1156
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:08,120
high tech living board game.

1157
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,680
Where you are one of the game pieces.

1158
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,960
Where you're one of the game pieces, a living.

1159
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,600
That's a lot of square feet.

1160
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:19,760
There's a bar you can even scrap for parts.

1161
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,200
Weird. James Cameron is telling me about something that I hate.

1162
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:26,840
I don't think I would have like naturally been aware of this.

1163
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:29,920
If you hadn't poked around or are from our friend Charles

1164
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,800
texted me about it, he came along with us.

1165
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:35,440
But so we were like getting curious and circling around this thing.

1166
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,480
And then and then we got to do it.

1167
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:40,040
Yeah, we got to be game pieces.

1168
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,520
What a weird sell, right?

1169
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:45,600
That is. Oh, yeah, that is a funny way to be like, you're a game piece.

1170
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:52,200
So if you ever wanted to be one of the blank color pegs in, sorry.

1171
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:55,960
Yeah, if you want to be a pawn in my game, like that is sort of what he's saying.

1172
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,120
You want a burger?

1173
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:01,760
You can experience what it's like for like a rich man to buy you and

1174
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:04,040
right when we show on his island to be hunted.

1175
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,240
Right. I guess that's just sort of how he thinks.

1176
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:08,520
Because he could do is very rich.

1177
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:10,280
Anybody could hunt humans.

1178
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:11,400
James Cameron would be the guy.

1179
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:14,720
Sure. He obviously he hunts underwater things.

1180
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,320
He doesn't hunt. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1181
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:19,520
He hunts species that have only been discovered by him. Right.

1182
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,040
That's how he goes.

1183
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,200
Yeah. So no one misses them.

1184
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,480
Except the ecosystem.

1185
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:25,840
The ecosystem is.

1186
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:29,800
We'll find various way, various butterfly effect ways that James Cameron is

1187
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:33,120
destroying the ocean species elimination.

1188
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:37,440
Yeah. So I I didn't know a ton about it.

1189
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,240
I just knew there was a lot like seeming seemingly a lot more to it

1190
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:43,240
than a normal kind of walkthrough or whatever.

1191
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:44,440
And you get a T-shirt or something.

1192
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:48,480
It seemed to like a lot more than than a pop up experience

1193
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:49,920
that sort of themed after a thing.

1194
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:53,160
And yeah, were you like maybe you go get some lightly themed

1195
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:55,000
refreshments or whatever.

1196
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,600
And it also you go, well, is it sort of like an escape room?

1197
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,440
And it's not quite that either.

1198
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:05,080
Though it has components of that, it becomes a teamwork scenario.

1199
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:09,320
I mean, my favorite description that I found was that this is a dystopian

1200
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,760
cyberpunk playground.

1201
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,080
Accurate. It's very much like

1202
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:18,120
interactive or immersive theater elements,

1203
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:22,680
because there are a number of actors walking around in character like.

1204
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:27,520
I I well, you'll hear

1205
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:32,360
I said that I met this as a compliment, but like not breaking character,

1206
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:36,400
like they are fully in character once you get into the main

1207
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,800
like room this take place.

1208
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:40,400
And I met that as a compliment when we talked to the guy.

1209
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,960
But I realized it sounded very.

1210
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:44,840
You know, we laughed at your the actors did not break.

1211
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:48,800
But I was admiring their commitment like there is this taxi driver guy

1212
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,880
who I just thought he was delightful.

1213
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,640
I would have I would have just talked to him for half an hour.

1214
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:55,920
Well, and there's things like

1215
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,040
it seems like that would have been possible.

1216
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,760
You could have like broken like you could do whatever you want

1217
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:00,680
when you're in this room.

1218
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:03,520
You could. Yeah, you could have broken rank and just talk to this guy for a while.

1219
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:06,960
There's things like there's people who have to do functional things

1220
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:11,360
such as check you in to an iPad, check in the procedure

1221
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:14,160
and a guy who has to give you beer.

1222
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:17,160
And he stays in character like functional.

1223
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:21,720
Things are all done by people who have to like speak the language of Iron City.

1224
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,840
And I think it's like it's done pretty well.

1225
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:28,560
Yeah, it's like because those jobs, especially the checking you in job

1226
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:32,760
is so hard to do in general because you're a bunch of people going to a new place

1227
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:35,040
and there's a lot of people with them and they have to access things

1228
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,200
on their phone and get a QR code or whatever.

1229
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:39,200
But you have to like stay it.

1230
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:42,840
But you have to like, like, hey, listen up, all you people.

1231
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:46,800
You come in here and you check the QR code and then you get on your phone

1232
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:49,280
and the six of you and you have to scan in and then you go over here

1233
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:51,760
and you get a lanyard and it's like you have to do all of that.

1234
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:55,720
Then you have to troubleshoot people's, oh, the iPad ain't working for you

1235
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:58,360
or whatever. And Mike spent about three minutes

1236
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:01,920
tapping a laptop screen before realizing it was not a touch screen.

1237
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:04,520
It was just a regular old laptop with a mouse.

1238
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:06,240
Hey, you tall idiot.

1239
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,840
It's not an iPad screen. It's a computer.

1240
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:12,600
We don't got this kind of technology here in Iron City.

1241
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:14,280
What do you think this is? Zalem?

1242
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:16,680
Yeah. Keep it moving, screen junkies.

1243
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:19,080
Screen junk.

1244
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:23,280
I, I, when I say Zalem,

1245
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:26,040
I'm referring to some mythology from the movie.

1246
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:30,440
And by the way, so Elite of Battle Angel is a film in theaters now

1247
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:34,720
that is surprisingly well regarded.

1248
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,520
And I have to admit, I have not gone to see this film yet,

1249
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,320
but it seems like people who have have liked it.

1250
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:42,880
It's in that 4DX format that we had so much fun. Oh, yeah.

1251
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:46,600
And it's doing, you know, OK in America.

1252
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:50,080
Because it's weird, new mythology and people distrust it

1253
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:54,360
like they do a Valerian or a speed racer or such things.

1254
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:56,840
I equate it sort of in that genre a little bit,

1255
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,840
but where it's like neat and original.

1256
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:02,480
And if you get in, you're really in not doing OK in America.

1257
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:04,720
Seemingly gangbusters in China.

1258
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:08,640
So Elite of Battle Angel 2, I imagine, is around the corner.

1259
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:11,600
Have you guys seen this film? No, we have.

1260
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:14,920
All right. So I kind of like browsed

1261
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,440
when we were there at the end.

1262
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:22,000
Of course, there is a gift shop, but they they reissued the original manga.

1263
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,320
It's been out of print in America for a long time.

1264
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:28,080
They put out some nice volumes, full collections of that.

1265
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:32,320
I think you can now get they put out a video to they got

1266
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:37,280
Kishiro, the writer, artist, the manga, Ka, who made it

1267
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:40,240
to come to the events and like sat.

1268
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,320
They talked to him in the Kansas bar.

1269
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:45,640
So I can only imagine for him that was a unique experience.

1270
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:50,800
Well, and OK, so what's cool about this is that this is a

1271
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:54,800
this is this experience that's a very committed to trip

1272
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:58,880
into a very specific mythology that is not

1273
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:02,480
super established here in America yet.

1274
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:05,400
And it's like you feel like it'd be a tough sell

1275
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:10,080
to get something like this made like a multi-city immersive experience.

1276
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:13,440
It'd be tough to do it for the Star Wars, probably.

1277
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:18,600
Let alone this sort of like not tested property.

1278
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,920
And we and we got to talk to one of the people

1279
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:23,040
primarily responsible for putting it together.

1280
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:27,240
And it seemed like they really had their their their run of the property

1281
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:30,040
to like to do like they they got to do whatever they wanted.

1282
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:32,920
It's the it's people involved in Avatar.

1283
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:38,280
John Landau, a longtime producer of for James Cameron.

1284
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:43,440
He sort of oversaw it as he did the Avatar stuff in in Florida to some extent.

1285
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:47,640
And I don't know, it seemed like it's an interesting mix of,

1286
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:52,840
well, why not try something and why not promote a movie in a in a in a different way

1287
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:55,520
and in a more full way?

1288
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,840
I don't know. It was cool.

1289
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:01,360
Well, how do we begin to explain this thing?

1290
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:05,920
Like we said, it's like it's it's got escape room components.

1291
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:10,480
It's like you you break off into teams of six and we assemble.

1292
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,560
It was the three of us.

1293
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:16,440
We you pick colors and we were the purple team because the logo was purple.

1294
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,720
Had to get purple.

1295
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:21,240
And our friends, Andrew and Charles and and Lindsay.

1296
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:26,440
And you break off into into groups of six

1297
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:30,840
and you enter a bar and you get drinks, which are apparently custom

1298
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:32,520
made for this thing.

1299
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:35,040
There are it's a custom Alita beer.

1300
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:38,840
We're Battle Angel beer

1301
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:42,200
that was brewed, yeah, brewed for this event.

1302
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:46,360
Yeah. And you're in the Kansas bar, which I'm told if you see the film

1303
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:49,480
has some very exciting events happening in it.

1304
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:51,920
Of course, none of us would know.

1305
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:55,640
Now, OK, have we dropped the ball by none of us seeing this film?

1306
01:04:55,640 --> 01:05:00,120
Perhaps. Maybe. However, one thing that I think is cool about this experience

1307
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:03,280
is that I was I was hoping that I could I would go in

1308
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:06,640
and there'd be this really specific mythology that was so odd

1309
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,960
and confusing to me and I could sort of make fun of it.

1310
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:12,560
And like, what is going on? I'm so confused.

1311
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:16,840
In fact, they have created an experience that does not rely on you

1312
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:22,440
knowing the world of Alita and in fact, just serves to make you curious about it.

1313
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:24,600
Yeah. I guess not curious.

1314
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:28,600
We were each given each team was given a table on that table

1315
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:31,400
was a tablet with different pages.

1316
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:35,040
And that kind of gave you the whole background, everything you need.

1317
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:39,760
And later on, you would get it behooved you to spend five minutes

1318
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:43,560
reading this information because there was like basic trivia stuff,

1319
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:47,000
because the whole thing of this, you're trying to be the team

1320
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,360
with the most credits at the end of it. Yes.

1321
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:55,920
And this is where I feel I let you guys down, because as I said,

1322
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:58,280
like, there's a theme bar. Great.

1323
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,320
I'm just going to chill out and have a beer.

1324
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:03,160
Then I was, I believe, the second person to buy beer.

1325
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:05,560
I got right to it to my chagrin.

1326
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:09,000
The bartender says, hey, you know, that little icon on your badge

1327
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:12,440
is somebody else in this very bar who has the same thing.

1328
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:13,560
If you find them, you're a match.

1329
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:15,280
It can help you get credits in Iron City.

1330
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:16,840
And I'm like, ah, damn it.

1331
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:20,400
I wanted to just wanted to sit and have this beer and talk to the people I came with.

1332
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:24,280
But you are thrust out of your comfort zone with stuff like that.

1333
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:28,200
It's it's you should go interact with other people and get out of your

1334
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:30,040
get out of your comfort zone.

1335
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:34,920
But in addition, I'm just sipping on a beer, not retaining any information.

1336
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:37,960
You get into Iron City and immediately realize,

1337
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:40,680
oh, I should have been listening to all that stuff

1338
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:42,720
because it would it would have helped us play the game.

1339
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:46,200
Well, I think all of us caught little bits and pieces.

1340
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:48,400
And that added up, especially in the trivia.

1341
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,320
We got all of that pretty well.

1342
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:53,160
And there's an introductory speech from,

1343
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:56,040
I believe the young lady's name was Cobra

1344
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:02,560
introduced kind of gave us the rundown of, you know, you're in Iron City.

1345
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,040
This is the year it is.

1346
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:05,440
This is what the deal is.

1347
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:09,480
Everyone wants to get the Salem, the city in the sky, literally a heaven kind of

1348
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:12,520
a very anime city in the sky.

1349
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:14,840
Yeah, yeah.

1350
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:17,960
Which is the funnest thing to talk about, like that's where

1351
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:22,960
it was a lot of fun to go and not knowing the specifics of this world

1352
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:25,640
and to just talking about Zalem and like,

1353
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:28,280
oh, one of these days, man, I'm going to get there.

1354
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:31,200
I've been dreaming of Zalem every night.

1355
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:34,280
I've what does Zalem smell like?

1356
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:38,600
And it was kind of more fun in a way to not know about Zalem

1357
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:42,640
and to read the bizarre little text like you may even earn enough credits

1358
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:44,800
to earn passage to Zalem.

1359
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:46,880
Now, spoiler, you get to the end of it.

1360
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:52,080
I don't know that the winning team, right, which could could have been us

1361
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:53,080
could have been a different team.

1362
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:59,320
But the winning team did not enter some beam and then ascend to some sky city.

1363
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:01,040
No, that did not occur.

1364
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:02,920
It is a cool reward for you.

1365
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:05,880
It would it would be cool if it's like there's a version of Zalem

1366
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:08,200
was a different, cooler bar.

1367
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,200
Hell, yeah. Yeah.

1368
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:12,560
Where the drinks are free, the drinks are free.

1369
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:15,480
And so that was my one complaint.

1370
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:17,720
I do think

1371
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:22,160
that I do think everyone should got one drink ticket with your admission.

1372
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:26,320
I think that would have been because the breweries involved

1373
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:29,280
and the wineries involved in this are getting some free promotion.

1374
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:32,640
I wonder I wonder if there's some weird thing like with a liquor license there.

1375
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:35,320
I mean, that should be a pop up event.

1376
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:38,640
And we should have we should have asked you should have asked that question

1377
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:41,120
in our interview. Yeah.

1378
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:42,520
All right. First thing.

1379
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:44,080
Yeah. First things first.

1380
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:46,280
Oh, I thought you meant asking character to the bartender.

1381
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:48,280
It's like, oh, Mac, can press.

1382
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:51,880
Does it press badge mean anything in this goddamn city?

1383
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:54,640
I don't know what we don't have the press here.

1384
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:57,320
Oh, just the factory, huh?

1385
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:59,280
Just another factory stooge.

1386
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:05,080
The factory doesn't represent podcasts with a, you know, mid to growing fan base.

1387
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:07,920
Is that how it is? Is that how it is?

1388
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:11,200
We should say the factory runs everything in Iron City.

1389
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:12,520
That's true. Yeah. Yes.

1390
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:14,680
And that'll help you in the trivia round.

1391
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:17,000
All of this will help you in the trivia round.

1392
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,920
Yeah. And what I you know, what I'd like to drive to and encourage people to do

1393
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:26,640
is to perform better in the Iron City experience than we did.

1394
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:28,480
At the end, we'll give you our stats.

1395
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:31,680
And if you're encouraged and are in Los Angeles, New York or Austin,

1396
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:34,000
I want to see if you can beat podcasts, the ride

1397
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:36,520
will give you some tips on how to do it.

1398
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:42,800
Yeah. So we were all like everybody in there is like seemed like they were game.

1399
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:47,240
But I was thinking like for a second, I was like, oh, are we all going to have to be

1400
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:49,840
characters? Are we all going to have to be like

1401
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:53,640
and like, I don't know, because I don't know, I was going to make up an alien name,

1402
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:56,840
but it was going to sound stupid like M.E.M.

1403
01:09:56,840 --> 01:10:00,720
Carl or something like cars, like whatever our friend Andrew did.

1404
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:05,160
You have the option to put whatever you want on your name badge.

1405
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:08,840
I didn't I stayed Scott, but I amended it to be iron.

1406
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:14,120
Scott, our friend Andrew made himself for the evening into Amdo.

1407
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:17,160
That's good. I was a big fan of Amdo.

1408
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:18,840
I think we made us do that.

1409
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:19,840
Alita.

1410
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:22,480
Should have just gone with that.

1411
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,040
Then we would have been the hero automatically.

1412
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:29,960
Yeah. But I was like thinking for a second, oh, are we going to have to act?

1413
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:34,240
And now part of me thinking if we go back and do it, maybe we should.

1414
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:38,160
Well, we did kind of because we started getting mad at the taxi driver

1415
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:41,880
when he like did a bit where he was like pickpocket Lindsay.

1416
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:43,800
But I mean, we started yelling at him.

1417
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:46,400
But I mean, like I'm going to go there with an eye patch or something.

1418
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:49,720
I'm going to go there with like a little bit of flair, a little clothing.

1419
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:52,280
And maybe I'll work on a character beforehand.

1420
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:55,200
I think a little bit goes a long way of this thing, because again,

1421
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:57,840
the actors are really good, really into it.

1422
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:03,120
Kudos to the designers for not giving anyone the big eyes

1423
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:07,880
that unnerve me for the promotional material from this that only one character has.

1424
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:11,000
I don't know how it would be possible to get the big eyes in real life.

1425
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:16,160
Or some like there's LED screens in front of all the actors eyes.

1426
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:19,040
Yeah, yeah. And what their real pupils are doing now.

1427
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,920
That's how it would have been an escape room.

1428
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:25,360
If you entered the main room of this thing and everybody had giant eyes,

1429
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,680
we would have all been like, get me out of here.

1430
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:31,280
Yeah. Yeah. And on every door, one of these has to be an emergency exit

1431
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:34,960
poorly labeled in some made up language. Yeah.

1432
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:39,600
So yeah, it was so it was pleasant and funny.

1433
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:44,400
What it ends up being is that although, you know, feel free to just go do it

1434
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:47,720
and not listen to us explain it and find out for yourself.

1435
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:51,520
Skip ahead. But you're you're chilling out in the bar.

1436
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:52,320
You're learning some stuff.

1437
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,760
It's sort of like it's you're getting accustomed to this world.

1438
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:57,080
But then you enter this big

1439
01:11:57,080 --> 01:12:01,880
marketplace slash arena where there's all these different stations

1440
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:07,080
and little rooms that can help you earn credits and that reward teamwork,

1441
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:11,320
but also reward being bold and strategizing and splitting apart

1442
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:14,400
and maximizing your time.

1443
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:18,320
And some games are fun and some are sort of like tedious and time

1444
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:20,440
wasting and probably like eat up time.

1445
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:23,080
You could have been more easily accruing credits.

1446
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:26,160
And it's interesting to get in there

1447
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:30,680
to have had no opportunity to form a battle plan and to just like,

1448
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:34,040
oh, God, we have to like learn the system of this and

1449
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:36,680
work together and figure it out.

1450
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:39,920
It reminded me of not and this is not quite the same thing,

1451
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:42,360
but it reminded me I had a similar feeling that I would have

1452
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:44,920
when I would do field day in elementary school.

1453
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:46,720
Did you guys have field days?

1454
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:48,280
Oh, yeah. Familiar. Yeah.

1455
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:51,920
You did the days I looked forward to the most because it was in school.

1456
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:54,000
Sure. It was just fun. Field day.

1457
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,040
Yeah. You would get a little team together.

1458
01:12:56,040 --> 01:13:00,160
And then at our school, at least you would have like stations basically.

1459
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:02,320
And you a lot of a more physical channel.

1460
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:06,040
You're saying, oh, no, ours was just like it be like, you know,

1461
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:09,480
movie in the morning, lunch from McDonald's.

1462
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:10,760
That's not a field day.

1463
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:12,120
Our long recess.

1464
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:13,960
Did you say 50 minutes field day?

1465
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:15,200
Just outside activities.

1466
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:17,240
Having a field day.

1467
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:20,640
If ours was having a field day, it was like stuff kids like.

1468
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:23,480
So it was like because our field day was like

1469
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:26,960
you would run a mile or run half a mile.

1470
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:28,440
There would be relay races.

1471
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:31,360
There would be like yours is like color wars at like a summer camp

1472
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:34,440
or something. Almost it sounds like I get I've never heard that.

1473
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:36,480
Color wars, I guess.

1474
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:38,200
Maybe they were colors where the teams.

1475
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:39,400
Yeah, the colors were the teams.

1476
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:43,960
So like so we so basically like you would split up at our elementary school.

1477
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:47,720
Like all the one through six would have like you'd be split up.

1478
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:50,040
So you've been teams with sixth graders, first graders

1479
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:53,440
on the uneasy alliances from the different grades.

1480
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:57,600
And then it would be a lot of like physical challenges, throwing a ball far,

1481
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:59,640
like sprinting and stuff.

1482
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:01,560
And you'd all I forget exactly how it would work.

1483
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:05,720
But it was like the most exciting day of the year because it was a big thing.

1484
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,320
You do it with a group of people.

1485
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:09,440
And then you would get points at the end.

1486
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:13,320
So doing this, I would describe it as like the feeling I had with field day

1487
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:15,680
where you would be like, oh, cool group, we're trying to figure this out.

1488
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:17,040
We're going to beat this other team.

1489
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:21,280
And it's like a very fun, like kind of big, like multi-challenge.

1490
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:26,000
But pro, it doesn't involve strenuous physical activity.

1491
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,120
And another pro, it does involve beer.

1492
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:31,520
So it notches up in a couple of ways.

1493
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:36,200
Yeah, it's all adults and everyone's a little buzzed, a little.

1494
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:40,000
Yeah, a little buzzed, even on just like I just had a Mexican Coke.

1495
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,680
But like those bottles so big, I had the caffeine.

1496
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,400
You were you were buzzed.

1497
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:48,880
I mean, I was when we were going down, I was like, I know this is crazy,

1498
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:51,320
but I would kill if I could get a cup of coffee here.

1499
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,280
Like I said that to one of you.

1500
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:57,240
And then we did go into a bar and I was like, hey, Coca Cola, next best thing.

1501
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:59,760
Huh? Yep. Yep. Close.

1502
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:01,760
Yeah. Y'all got coffee in Iron City?

1503
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:06,160
No. Coffee was outlawed in 2472.

1504
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:10,760
Yeah. We all know there's no coffee in the world of Alita.

1505
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,200
That's why everyone's so stressed out. We drink Gojuice.

1506
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:16,720
Like they always have something though, right?

1507
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:19,440
That was like death sticks.

1508
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:23,720
Smoked Gojuice, one go away from GoGojuice.

1509
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:26,960
The drink Honey Boo Boo had on. Well,

1510
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,600
toddlers and tiaras.

1511
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:35,960
GoGojuice. It's a dystopian world where Honey Boo Boo reigns supreme.

1512
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:40,560
We almost play games to win her favor and she rewards us with GoGojuice.

1513
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:44,240
The juice is a mix of Mountain Dew and Country Time Lemonade.

1514
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:46,040
Is that what GoGojuice is?

1515
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:51,000
I think it was like you had a real big Honey Boo Boo kick there for a while.

1516
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,320
Yeah, you watched the show.

1517
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:54,440
Yeah, you were really into the show. Yeah.

1518
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:57,120
Yeah. And then there's some disturbing things came up.

1519
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:01,480
Anyway, most popular reality shows.

1520
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:03,000
I didn't forget about that. Anyway.

1521
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
That's when you moved on to Duck Dynasty.

1522
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,720
Yeah, there was something problematic there.

1523
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:11,280
Yeah. Let's talk about some of the things that challenges.

1524
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:14,320
I think we all enjoyed the music audition.

1525
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:16,080
Yes, the music audition.

1526
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:20,120
I was looking forward to part of me thought you were actually going to be able

1527
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:23,680
to play the piano and I would get to show off my lazy piano skills.

1528
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:25,880
And maybe even lazier.

1529
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:27,440
I thought it was going to be karaoke.

1530
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:30,040
I thought you were just going to do karaoke or something.

1531
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:32,360
Sing the Iron City National Anthem.

1532
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:34,400
No words. Go.

1533
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:36,640
That would be great.

1534
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:40,440
Yeah, it was basically just they had they had like rigged up a bunch of keyboard,

1535
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:46,040
like MIDI keyboards, and then they kind of played the music ish thing,

1536
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:49,840
an approximation of whatever music and people would listen to in the past.

1537
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:51,320
Or Iron City, excuse me.

1538
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:55,920
And then you just like hit a set of keys when they would light up.

1539
01:16:56,120 --> 01:17:00,840
So it was basically like I kind of felt like it was a like my hand was like

1540
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:04,200
a cat's paw trying to get it like a toy.

1541
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,320
So I just like kind of claw at the keys.

1542
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:09,440
One of the would light up for a brief second and I just kind of hit it.

1543
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:11,280
And like it was very stilted.

1544
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:13,240
And I'm like, I was trying to do two at once because they're like,

1545
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:14,920
do as many as you can.

1546
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:17,320
So I had two keyboards in front of me and I was just trying to hit it.

1547
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:18,760
And it's it was quick.

1548
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:19,960
Like it was really quick.

1549
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:22,440
It was like maybe less than a second.

1550
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:24,840
But your chance to pretend that your keyboard cat.

1551
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:27,240
That's a good point. Very exciting.

1552
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:29,440
Yeah, just cans.

1553
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:33,880
You know what a lot of these things felt like was it's almost like it

1554
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:36,320
because there's also then like you put a puzzle together.

1555
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:38,520
They frame it as like it's a propaganda poster.

1556
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:43,000
Right. You got to form the pieces and you together as a team put up a magnetic

1557
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,760
poster. It all feels a little bit like legends of the hidden temple.

1558
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:48,520
I was just going to say that. Yeah.

1559
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:53,360
But without the horrible men that grab you and without the monkey,

1560
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:57,720
that seems so easy, but that everyone messed up so badly.

1561
01:17:57,720 --> 01:17:58,760
Everyone is fine. Can we?

1562
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:01,040
No one scared us. No one scared us in this.

1563
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:03,200
No, I was scared.

1564
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:05,520
I was concerned. Will there be scary stuff?

1565
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:08,640
And then we walked in this beautiful, brightly lit marketplace.

1566
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,800
I was let down.

1567
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:13,160
I was hoping there would be a few scares.

1568
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:16,400
I won't say why, but I was hoping that someone would jump out at us

1569
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:21,240
and that we would that all five of us would leap into your arms at the same time.

1570
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:24,840
Like Scooby Doo. Yeah.

1571
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:25,600
Yeah, I was.

1572
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:29,000
I was hoping there might be a little bit of a scary element, but no, nothing was scary.

1573
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,280
Yeah. So but how legend of hidden temple also.

1574
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:35,080
Yeah. Can we say real quick on legends?

1575
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:39,760
Those men in the temple at the end as a kid,

1576
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:42,840
because as a kid watching those shows, you'd fantasize about doing it.

1577
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:46,360
And that's I was scared of those men for sure.

1578
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:51,520
I would like to sit closer to my parents of like, I know the men are coming.

1579
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:53,680
I don't want to watch them.

1580
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:57,840
And now as an adult, I'm more like, I know that was a non-union gig.

1581
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:01,840
I know they were getting screwed in addition to the real horrors.

1582
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:03,920
Real horrors.

1583
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:06,360
Their faces weren't on camera.

1584
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:08,800
Yeah. Didn't have to be Taft Hartley.

1585
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:15,560
Yeah. So which, by the way, a good idea in general is Legends of the Hidden Temple

1586
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:17,800
for adults. Oh, 100 percent.

1587
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:21,520
What a good idea. They own this property via comms.

1588
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:24,760
Failing. That's a good way to make money.

1589
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:27,480
There's a five and like and they do a double their tour.

1590
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:29,040
Yeah. Yeah.

1591
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:31,240
Imagine little pop up legends in the temples.

1592
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:32,760
At Comic Con.

1593
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:36,880
It's funny to watch the Nickelodeon booth evolve from like shows

1594
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:42,120
current children enjoy to like remember the go go 90s.

1595
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:45,360
Remember, I have a photo with monsters.

1596
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:49,040
I have an old Mac photo, me and Olmec from like two years ago at Comic Con.

1597
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:51,200
And I don't think they brought the show back.

1598
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:53,800
I think they just brought it there to make idiots like me

1599
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:56,960
try to relive their childhood. And I did. Was he cool?

1600
01:19:57,240 --> 01:19:58,960
Yeah, he was cool.

1601
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,720
So down to Earth, I bet.

1602
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:03,440
Yeah, he's really he's chills.

1603
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:04,640
Well, no, they did bring the show back.

1604
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,160
Now I think about it was a different.

1605
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:07,680
There was a film.

1606
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:08,720
It was not a game show.

1607
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:11,480
They made a weird Jumanji light.

1608
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,280
OK, I don't know anything about that.

1609
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:16,280
That the host Kirk Fogg did appear in

1610
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:18,480
acting.

1611
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:20,880
It's yeah, it's odd.

1612
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:23,160
And they were like, so it was like a game show,

1613
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:24,840
so nobody gets to play it.

1614
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:27,240
It was like a narrative film of legend.

1615
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:29,360
All right, you're all getting out near.

1616
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:30,800
I ain't going near that temple.

1617
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:35,040
Had enough of it that he drives off, drives his off road vehicle,

1618
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:36,960
like set up a flare.

1619
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:38,520
Something goes wrong.

1620
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:42,200
It's like they're like Dan Aykroyd leaving the scary house in Casper.

1621
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,120
Yeah. Are you going to call someone else?

1622
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:46,320
Someone else?

1623
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:48,040
The problem is they need waivers.

1624
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:51,520
But the idea that you would go into the legends of the hidden temple bar,

1625
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:56,160
drink two beers and then get thrown into a temple.

1626
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:59,200
Monkey beer, silver, silver monkey.

1627
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:03,800
I get a victory brewing golden golden monkey.

1628
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:06,400
I believe it's one of their most popular.

1629
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:09,000
It's a silver monkey, right on the show.

1630
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:10,440
Or green monkeys.

1631
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:14,600
What's the what's the color in the don't know offhand purple parrots?

1632
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:17,040
I know. OK, I always wanted to be a purple parrot.

1633
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:18,480
Purple parrot pilsners.

1634
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:19,720
OK, great.

1635
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:24,200
At the very least, you could do it because you'd have to have people sign waivers

1636
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,920
if it was an actual physical thing where they have to climb.

1637
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:29,240
But you could just do a haunt.

1638
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:31,520
You can do a legend of the hidden temple haunt.

1639
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:34,920
You're you're only taking out the worst part of it.

1640
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:38,960
You can't like haunts that much that you want the horrible

1641
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:41,240
temple men to jump out at you.

1642
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:42,360
I kind of want.

1643
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:44,640
Well, I'm just trying to think of a way for them to do it,

1644
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:47,520
because it would be hard to get a bunch of drunken adults

1645
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:50,280
in and out signing waivers.

1646
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:52,600
People would be hurting themselves left and right,

1647
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:56,920
crawling like on their hands and knees through like that section.

1648
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:57,720
You know what I'm talking about?

1649
01:21:57,720 --> 01:22:00,400
There's a section where you crawl sections where you climb.

1650
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,760
It'd be too much for for men and women.

1651
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:07,680
There's like jump zones in every abandoned mall across this nation.

1652
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:10,440
I think maybe you take alcohol out of the equation.

1653
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:11,360
You got to pregame it.

1654
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:13,000
They aren't going to officially.

1655
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,760
You have to get a flask in the parking lot and get hammered

1656
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:18,440
before you do your adult legends of the temple.

1657
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:21,000
Hot boxing before going through.

1658
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,960
These competitors are moving very slowly today.

1659
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:28,160
It's funny, there's so many of these game shows now, like the Titan.

1660
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:29,880
Have you seen any of the Titan games?

1661
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:31,520
Oh, no. Oh, yeah.

1662
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:36,040
These giant elaborate sets, which is just like a less.

1663
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:39,760
I mean, they're very they're crazy themed and their scope of them are amazing.

1664
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:42,920
But it does feel it's just a different version of legends of the temple

1665
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:43,800
with strong people.

1666
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:46,280
What's the Ellen's game show at night now to?

1667
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:48,600
I don't know. Game of games.

1668
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:50,320
Here's my question.

1669
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:55,720
Do any of those shows end with a final trivia question of how much money is enough?

1670
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:59,000
Either of those people like when is it?

1671
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:01,480
No. When do you when is it enough?

1672
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,840
What more do you need?

1673
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:08,800
But the thing that's invaluable is having cameras pointed at you

1674
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:12,480
and being able to tell people what to do and fetch you coffee.

1675
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:14,280
Well, wait a minute. They point the cameras at you.

1676
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:15,320
Now you have a.

1677
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:17,160
OK, I think I understand.

1678
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:19,120
The last thing I'll say is that the new

1679
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:23,120
let or not let's make a deal.

1680
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:24,840
The case, what's the stupid case?

1681
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:28,880
You know, the dealer No Deal now shooting live from Orlando,

1682
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:30,920
Florida, Universal Studios. Oh, boy.

1683
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:32,600
So there's got to be.

1684
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:33,560
You got to try to get on it.

1685
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:35,440
Some one of the three of us should get on it.

1686
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:37,880
But they're doing a lot of like public human interest stuff

1687
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:40,600
where they tug at the heartstrings on the episodes.

1688
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:44,320
So we have to find an angle for one of us that makes us look like a sad sack.

1689
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:48,440
So we'll we'll figure that out and get we'll get on it right now.

1690
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:53,040
If we frame Jason's frequent hot dog eating as poverty,

1691
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,280
we just have to tilt the.

1692
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:03,080
Look, just because when I was driving here today, I had the thought,

1693
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:06,080
do I have enough time to stop for a hot dog?

1694
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:07,280
And the answer was no.

1695
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:08,560
At Costco?

1696
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:11,920
No. Well, Mike got me on the 7-Eleven app

1697
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:14,240
and I was trying to see if I had enough points.

1698
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:16,880
But you were going to get a 7-Eleven hot dog.

1699
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:19,480
Yeah. Where else would you stop for a quick?

1700
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:21,120
I guess it could have been a wiener schnitzel.

1701
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:23,120
That is still like that's gross.

1702
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:25,800
Joe, the famous Simpsons, right?

1703
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:27,400
Got booed.

1704
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:31,400
Given Homer, our all day or like weeks at a time.

1705
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:33,320
Never done me dirty. OK.

1706
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:34,240
Never done me wrong.

1707
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:36,040
7-Eleven. You're wrong.

1708
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:37,520
Not only 7-Eleven hot dogs.

1709
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:39,480
Just not often. How many a year?

1710
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:40,840
One, maybe two a year.

1711
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:42,120
I think that's low.

1712
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:43,480
Oh, shoot.

1713
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:44,960
I think I forgot about the cost.

1714
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:48,040
Costco, you're going into a battle in the parking lot.

1715
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:50,920
I guess I guess wiener schnitzel has a drive through.

1716
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:52,040
I mean, I don't even think about that.

1717
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:55,480
Ultimately, I understand the hot dogs are barely edible and it does not matter.

1718
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:59,280
But there is a weird thing in my head about 7-Eleven food in general,

1719
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:02,240
which you don't share, I guess.

1720
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:04,000
No, I'm very curious about the pizzas.

1721
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,920
I heard someone saying the pizza, if you get a whole pie, is pretty good.

1722
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:09,640
You said before we started, before Scott said you heard.

1723
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:11,960
I heard the pizza is better than Little Caesar's.

1724
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:14,960
People online arguing and I like Little Caesar's.

1725
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:19,040
I saw people online arguing saying like 7-Eleven is actually better.

1726
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:21,480
If you're talking a five dollar, six dollar pie.

1727
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:23,480
So I don't know.

1728
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:25,920
Can I? On the six dollar pie.

1729
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:27,520
We're talking price points.

1730
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:28,280
Message board.

1731
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:33,080
But now it's pizza, pizza and Domino's are trying to compete with also

1732
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:36,720
like deals where the pies are hit five or six dollars.

1733
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:39,120
It's a lot, a lot of exciting stuff going on in there.

1734
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:42,880
We have formed that now Jason can go on Deal or No Deal.

1735
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:45,640
Yeah. Forced to subsist on 7-Eleven hot dogs.

1736
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:48,080
I'll go to pocket this discussion for doughboys.

1737
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:51,120
Just copy and paste it.

1738
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:54,920
Well, they'll go over our lines and that saves them some recording time.

1739
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:58,040
Yeah. The thing on Deal or No Deal that they're doing now is that

1740
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:01,480
there was like a guy who worked at the Ford plant his whole life

1741
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:04,840
and didn't get like, oh, well, it might not have been a Ford.

1742
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:06,560
It might have been different car company.

1743
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:10,600
But then like the president of Ford came out and was like, for your service,

1744
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:15,080
here's a plaque and you'll get to sit with us at the executive box

1745
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:17,840
in Detroit at the next baseball game.

1746
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:20,400
And it's like, oh, like they're delaying that on thick.

1747
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:24,280
So for the Jason episode, the CEO of 7-Eleven will come out

1748
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:27,960
and gift you with a year supply of free 7-Eleven hot dogs.

1749
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:30,360
Seven hundred and eleven hot dogs.

1750
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:33,960
All at once, all at once.

1751
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:36,080
Almost to a day, but not quite.

1752
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:40,120
7-Eleven truck pulls up in front.

1753
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:42,840
But a voucher for if you want that second one,

1754
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:46,360
when it's getting into the dregs in December and then for efforts.

1755
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:49,440
And then you will swim in them like Scrooge swims in money.

1756
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:53,560
You will swim in 711 hot dogs

1757
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:57,560
in an old time bathing, a one piece bathing suit.

1758
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:01,360
And say to say that for your for everything is terrible.

1759
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:02,760
That's not where they're.

1760
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:03,840
All right. Fine. All right.

1761
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:06,080
You got to be careful in that hot dog pit that you can

1762
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:08,960
very easily suffocate. Yeah.

1763
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:12,280
Scrooge goes Scrooge like swallows the coins and spits them out.

1764
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:15,000
If you go in for a mouthful of 10 hot dogs.

1765
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:16,920
Yeah. You might not be coming out of the tank.

1766
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:19,360
Jason knows what he's doing.

1767
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:21,960
I know what I'm a man of the people. OK.

1768
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,400
I'll brave 7-Eleven food.

1769
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:31,240
So I think I do every week or even certainly not every day.

1770
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:34,560
Acknowledge that I eat McDonald's a good amount and Taco Bell.

1771
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:38,800
And God knows those probably are not dissimilar in their quality.

1772
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:42,600
But for whatever reason, 7-Eleven, I do feel like the food is sitting there.

1773
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:46,640
So I'm saying I'm saying, yeah, there's a stigma and I'm probably incorrect

1774
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:48,640
about it. And you're more progressive than I am.

1775
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:52,120
All right. And is that good?

1776
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:56,760
It feels like the the morsels of food that they have to scrounge for

1777
01:27:56,760 --> 01:28:01,200
in the poor pockets of Iron City. Yeah, that's right.

1778
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:02,560
We're doing a podcast.

1779
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:05,240
Let's not gag up on Jason Marathado.

1780
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:06,640
Well, you always say the same thing.

1781
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:09,800
Something new comes out about your hot dog eating every week,

1782
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:11,680
and it's hard to not examine it.

1783
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:13,880
You offered information. We can't go here.

1784
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:17,560
We're going to name this episode more about Jason's hot dog eating habits.

1785
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:22,360
Epcot, slash hot dog, slash Aleta Battle Angel

1786
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:25,080
passport to Iron City, the experience. Yeah.

1787
01:28:26,040 --> 01:28:29,680
OK, one thing that we have not gotten to in this episode yet

1788
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:34,360
is that we talked to the people, the person, one of the one of the people

1789
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:39,280
who are responsible for this thing, because this was done by I am eight bit,

1790
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:42,280
which is a very respected art collective.

1791
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:46,200
But they see he was talking the philosophy of making stuff.

1792
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:50,760
They do releases of video game soundtracks on vinyl and they

1793
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:54,400
and you know, and like video game re releases.

1794
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:57,720
And and they've they've got an art gallery here in L.A.

1795
01:28:57,880 --> 01:29:01,480
And they've also like, I guess what happened was they made a

1796
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:06,320
a Resident Evil escape experience that toured the country.

1797
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:10,000
Sounds pretty cool. You love scares.

1798
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,120
Yeah, sure. They give you some scares.

1799
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:15,840
This was apparently this apparently caught the attention of the people

1800
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:18,600
producing Aleta and seeking to promote Aleta.

1801
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:22,080
They reached out way in advance, gave him like a big jump to do something

1802
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:24,240
really cool with the property.

1803
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:26,400
And that's what made this this thing happen.

1804
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:31,080
And we got to go talk to to this guy, John Gibson, the co-owner of I am

1805
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:36,000
eight bit really cool guy, passionate about themed experiences,

1806
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:39,280
as are we and seemingly a big deal in in L.A.

1807
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:42,920
Art world. We got to come to his place and bug him a little bit.

1808
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:46,280
And you're going to hear some of that right now.

1809
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:52,640
All right. We're here with John Gibson, I guess, to start,

1810
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:57,680
just tell us a little about I am eight bit, the company behind Aleta

1811
01:29:57,680 --> 01:30:00,400
passport to Iron City, which we all did and enjoyed.

1812
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:03,640
Sure. Well, thank you. Also, that's that's you had fun.

1813
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:06,600
That's that's the operative word we've been tossing around.

1814
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:08,800
So when that is achieved, we are quite happy.

1815
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:13,880
My name is John Gibson, as you said, I'm the co-owner of I am eight bit.

1816
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:18,880
We've been around for about 14 years and we for all intents and purposes

1817
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:21,360
call ourselves a creative production company.

1818
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:26,080
But that's kind of a bit misleading because everything we do is predicated

1819
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:30,240
on experience in some way. And that's not necessarily traditional experiences.

1820
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:33,040
That's anything from our perspective that you can

1821
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:37,040
tangibly interact with.

1822
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:41,600
So that could be an event that could be a stunt or activation

1823
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:46,320
or anything that really brings something alive in the real world.

1824
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:50,040
And we we really appreciate analog experiences and things.

1825
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:54,600
You know, we come from the era of VHS and laser disks and cassette tapes.

1826
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:59,280
And so we like to combine technologies and analog things

1827
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:03,040
and make experiences that are cool and most of all, fun.

1828
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:08,120
And we we appreciate that because we're, you know, as theme park aficionados,

1829
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:12,160
we're always excited about real tangible experiences

1830
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:14,960
and the anything that's not not a screen ride.

1831
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:16,120
That's one of the big things.

1832
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:19,760
That's one of the big complaints in our world, which you see a lot of these.

1833
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:22,600
Which can also be, look, if you're on a ride, it's still a ride.

1834
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:25,120
Soren is a really fun ride.

1835
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:28,920
Like there's it's a screen ride, but it's you know, you're you're up there.

1836
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:31,560
You're hanging. Your feet are dangling. Right. It's it's fun.

1837
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:34,640
I'm afraid of heights, so also it's exhilarating for that reason.

1838
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:37,440
It's the only way for you to get that experience.

1839
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:40,040
Fake height.

1840
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:42,680
I guess if you could tell us a little bit about how you guys got involved

1841
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:47,120
with with the Alito project and how like how far into them

1842
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:49,680
making the film did you guys come on board?

1843
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:51,720
Because it certainly can't have been an afterthought.

1844
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:53,880
It can't have been like, well, we got to do something to promote it

1845
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:57,520
because this is it's so like it's it's so realistic in the production design

1846
01:31:57,520 --> 01:31:59,200
is is is next level.

1847
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:01,320
So you must have been working with the filmmakers in some regard.

1848
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:02,360
Well, thank you once again.

1849
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:05,840
Absolutely. You've noticed all the things we were hoping people would notice.

1850
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:08,040
OK, yeah, we started

1851
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:12,360
working on this a good 18 months before we went live,

1852
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:16,200
which is super duper rare in the film space.

1853
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:19,240
If you're to approach it from traditional marketing channels,

1854
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:23,760
which we did not like, this was not a venture that Fox Marketing

1855
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:24,960
had anything to do with.

1856
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:27,800
It was produced and financed by our partners at the CELU group.

1857
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:31,320
They came to us one day and said they wanted to change live entertainment

1858
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:35,640
and do something different in the space, but also do something

1859
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:41,080
that didn't cater to typical marketing habits, bad habits, if you will,

1860
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:45,320
where you get called up by a studio two months before a film comes out.

1861
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:47,760
And they say, hey, let's do something cool.

1862
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:50,840
And if you can imagine, two months is not a lot of time

1863
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:52,760
to achieve much of anything,

1864
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:55,640
let alone something of the caliber of passport to Iron City.

1865
01:32:56,360 --> 01:32:58,240
Did they have any ideas for you?

1866
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:01,240
Did they just go hit us with your best stuff?

1867
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:04,240
Do they do you guys present basically to them and then they approve?

1868
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:05,640
Is that sort of how it works?

1869
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:10,920
They were really integral in providing a thing that also isn't very standard

1870
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:14,360
in the film world, which is the reason why we don't usually work in film.

1871
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:17,200
We work in video games, primarily, or TV.

1872
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:22,080
They provided us access and trust in a way that studios

1873
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:25,160
typically would never really allow to happen.

1874
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:29,040
As you can imagine, certain things are under lock and key in the film world.

1875
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:33,480
Alita, when we first read the script, we had to sit in a room

1876
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:35,960
and Amanda and I both gave up our laptops and cell phones

1877
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:38,000
and everything was watermarked on the page.

1878
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,840
And we sat in a conference room for two hours and read the script

1879
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:42,640
18 months ago.

1880
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:45,600
That wouldn't have happened in a traditional environment in the film space.

1881
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:51,720
But it happened because the fine folks at TSG and Lightstorm were buddies.

1882
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:55,560
And Lightstorm trusted us and TSG trusted us.

1883
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:59,800
And they said, hey, read this, watch the movie.

1884
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:03,840
It's in a very infantile, early state at this point,

1885
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:08,280
because there's a lot of CG involved that's not finished or polished yet.

1886
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:12,840
But after that, let's discuss what you guys think would be cool

1887
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:14,880
and different and unique in this space.

1888
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:18,280
So you're saying you saw the movie with normal sized eyes.

1889
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:29,280
I think we actually saw the film before and after the first trailer came out.

1890
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:32,840
And so they actually enlarged the pupils since the first trailer

1891
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:34,840
when complaints came in. Really?

1892
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:37,080
Yeah. You can look it up.

1893
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:38,160
It's kind of amazing.

1894
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:40,280
Like you compared side by side.

1895
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:43,160
James Cameron and Rob Rodriguez got in a conversation and, you know,

1896
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:46,120
they took note that people were complaining,

1897
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:49,280
but they also are visionaries in their own respect.

1898
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:52,600
And they're like, you know, we should we should enlarge the pupils

1899
01:34:52,640 --> 01:34:54,200
to make them more expressive.

1900
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:58,280
Because when you see the film within a minute, that does not bother you anymore.

1901
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:01,640
You are fully invested in this universe.

1902
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:04,560
And like you realize in the context of a trailer, it might be odd.

1903
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:07,640
But it doesn't matter because, you know, films are not trailers.

1904
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:09,560
Films are films. Sure.

1905
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:13,600
Were you guys familiar at all with the original manga that inspired the movie?

1906
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:16,600
Because it was out of print in America for many years.

1907
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:19,200
And Kodansha just put out like new collections of it,

1908
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:21,280
which you can buy at the end of the experience.

1909
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,600
Looks very nice.

1910
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:28,560
But there are 2000 pages of material of like the full run of Alita.

1911
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:33,400
And I read them all as an adolescent when I was a young boy in middle school.

1912
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:38,440
Yeah, yeah. I grew up in Detroit and I used to go to the I think it was

1913
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:41,400
Walden Books or like one of those mall bookstores.

1914
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:45,680
And I would special order the the Viz editions, the trades.

1915
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:48,320
And it would take like a month to get each one.

1916
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:52,840
Oh, sure. I fell in love with the anime and then then realized it was based on a manga.

1917
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:55,400
So I just started special ordering those with allowance money

1918
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:56,760
and eventually got through them all.

1919
01:35:56,760 --> 01:35:59,120
And I still have all the original manga.

1920
01:35:59,160 --> 01:36:04,400
And I got to meet Kishiro, the creator of Battle Angel.

1921
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:08,320
And he signed my first edition copy a couple of weeks ago.

1922
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:12,720
And that was like kind of a little boy, you know, like if I don't know what

1923
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:15,400
my might faint, not sure.

1924
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:16,760
He barely speaks English.

1925
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:20,440
But like all I all I want to do is like like hang out with this guy

1926
01:36:20,440 --> 01:36:22,760
who like really influenced me.

1927
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:25,200
So this comes full circle for me personally, too.

1928
01:36:25,240 --> 01:36:27,640
Wow, that's great. Did he do Iron City?

1929
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:29,800
Did he do passport or you just met him?

1930
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:33,480
Oh, yeah, no, he like we met him at passport times.

1931
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:38,080
Wow, really? He went through and, you know, that was the most terrifying part,

1932
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:42,400
I think, is is to like, you know, in Japanese culture,

1933
01:36:43,080 --> 01:36:45,920
you know, perhaps it's different than American culture, where it's

1934
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:48,120
it's harder to discern expression sometimes.

1935
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:50,040
And it's like, are they having fun?

1936
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:52,080
Like, are they are they nervous?

1937
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:53,280
Like, I don't know what's going on.

1938
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:55,000
Like, I hope he likes this. I hope he's smart.

1939
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,920
And then they had a blast.

1940
01:36:56,920 --> 01:37:01,400
They got into the Turing's lab and started doing those activities

1941
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:03,080
and got on the running pad.

1942
01:37:03,080 --> 01:37:08,200
And like and they loved the Kansas Musicians area with the keyboards.

1943
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:10,600
Like the words were the minute they got in.

1944
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:13,840
I asked them what they wanted to drink and they asked for waters.

1945
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,720
And then I said, well, we have this beer that we made for the experience.

1946
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:19,720
They're like, oh, we don't want to drink.

1947
01:37:19,720 --> 01:37:21,280
Like, we just got off our plane.

1948
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:23,840
And I'm like, but and it's Panzer Kunst.

1949
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:26,840
The fighting technique in the manga and the film.

1950
01:37:27,640 --> 01:37:30,640
And once they saw that it was like a little beer, they're like six.

1951
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:32,720
And they like down them.

1952
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:35,320
And that was the moment where I knew that these guys are having fun.

1953
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:38,360
And a thing I really like to have to give them a lot of credit.

1954
01:37:38,360 --> 01:37:40,560
The actors were all really great.

1955
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:42,960
Like no one broke character.

1956
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:44,560
Like everyone was so committed.

1957
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:46,960
I did. Well, not that I thought they would.

1958
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:49,200
Like the base level.

1959
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:50,360
Yeah, I know. All right.

1960
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:52,760
We'll send you a secret shoppers next time.

1961
01:37:52,760 --> 01:37:54,480
Yeah, yeah. That's good to know.

1962
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:58,280
I mean, the taxi like we spent, we probably could have gotten more credit.

1963
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:01,640
We probably could have gotten one more game in if we hadn't spent like five

1964
01:38:01,640 --> 01:38:03,760
minutes arguing with the taxi driver.

1965
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:06,320
But I was like, no, I want to keep arguing with this guy.

1966
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:07,560
He's really funny.

1967
01:38:07,960 --> 01:38:10,840
And you touch on something really integral to the experience

1968
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:13,640
and something that early on in play tests.

1969
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:16,240
I don't know if you guys are familiar with play tests.

1970
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:17,960
It's akin to a prototype.

1971
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:20,880
You have something that you think works pretty well,

1972
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:26,200
but you just don't know until people get on it and experience it and go through it.

1973
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:29,440
And her play tests are really interesting because a lot of people

1974
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:35,880
criticized initially the fact that you as a player have agency over this experience.

1975
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:37,200
Like it is your choice.

1976
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:41,400
You are a tourist in Iron City and we've created a bustling metropolis

1977
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:44,040
that allows you to do whatever you want to do.

1978
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:45,320
You can't do everything.

1979
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:50,600
And on some of the forums before like, oh man, like you, I just need someone to tell me what to do.

1980
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:54,080
You have domain over this environment that is not your house.

1981
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:58,720
You get to walk around and touch things and experiment and engage in a way that

1982
01:38:58,720 --> 01:39:03,400
like a theme park doesn't necessarily provide you when you're waiting in line for something.

1983
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:04,560
Like it's not as linear.

1984
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:09,680
The thing that we kind of knew all along was the magic in a lot of ways,

1985
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:13,440
because you come out of it having made every decision.

1986
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:15,760
And every decision either got you credits or it didn't.

1987
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:21,920
But you spent time with that taxi driver arguing with him and he was wasting your time,

1988
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:25,760
but you were also wasting your own time having fun talking to him.

1989
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:31,080
So maybe you could earn as many credits as you initially maybe went in wanting to earn,

1990
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:32,080
but it didn't matter.

1991
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:38,280
We talk a lot about specifically the E.T. ride on the show at Universal Studios

1992
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:40,520
because it adds so much to the mythology.

1993
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:44,680
When you're doing something like this that has like new characters or new stuff,

1994
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:47,640
like how much is that you guys?

1995
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:48,640
How much is that?

1996
01:39:48,640 --> 01:39:49,960
It's just a collaboration.

1997
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:51,800
Like, do you have to get a new character?

1998
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:56,560
Do you have to get each character that we interacted with approved as part of the mythology?

1999
01:39:56,560 --> 01:40:00,160
Does James Cameron now acknowledge all those characters are canon?

2000
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:06,000
An actor might just say something that just becomes gospel.

2001
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,080
If you're an actor and you're working on a show,

2002
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:12,280
gospel, if you're an actor and you're working one of these experiences,

2003
01:40:12,280 --> 01:40:18,360
you know, 40 hours a week, like you're going to know a lot more than us after a week

2004
01:40:18,360 --> 01:40:20,680
or even a couple of days because you're just playing that kid.

2005
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:22,960
Like you're specialized in that role.

2006
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:26,840
And it's like we want to hear your feedback and we want you to have enough room to wiggle

2007
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:30,120
and grow as long as you're keeping to the vocabulary and the fiction and the lore.

2008
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:31,640
And you don't break character.

2009
01:40:31,640 --> 01:40:37,720
Don't talk about modern technology or like don't talk about the latest Ariana Grande song you heard.

2010
01:40:37,880 --> 01:40:41,800
There's like simple rules of the fiction because you're 600 years in the future.

2011
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:45,800
Or if you said that Ariana Grande song from 500 years ago.

2012
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:46,800
Exactly.

2013
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:49,320
Just commit to it if you're going to do it.

2014
01:40:49,320 --> 01:40:54,760
The one thing we didn't really want to do, nor anyone else, was retell the story of the movie.

2015
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:55,680
Because like, who cares?

2016
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:57,080
Like, why would you want to do that?

2017
01:40:57,080 --> 01:41:01,520
And it's like the whole idea was how do we expand the universe?

2018
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:05,320
Like, how do we make this something that if you saw the film,

2019
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:09,040
it kind of opens your eyes and lets you explore this universe more thoroughly.

2020
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:16,040
Or if you haven't, you know, it introduces you to this like cool, new, rad, futuristic world

2021
01:41:16,040 --> 01:41:18,280
that's just transportive and neat.

2022
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:24,320
You know, you don't have to ever have seen Mr. Toads or Wind of the Willows, right?

2023
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:27,600
But you can go on Mr. Toads wild ride and still have a blast.

2024
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:31,680
You know, like I think that half the rides at Disneyland, like that stuff is so old

2025
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:33,520
that kids don't even know what it is anymore.

2026
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:36,560
They probably prefer people to not have seen Song of the South,

2027
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:39,120
just go straight to Splash Mountain.

2028
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:42,000
That's where, you know, as we record this, I still have.

2029
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:46,040
I have not seen Alita yet, so I'll be going in reverse order.

2030
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:49,000
Like when I say and it did make me want to see it much more.

2031
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:52,840
But like in the same way, I'm a weirdo who saw who went on Star Tours

2032
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:54,440
before seeing Star Wars.

2033
01:41:54,440 --> 01:41:58,120
So to me, it'll always be those movies in the world of that ride.

2034
01:41:58,440 --> 01:42:00,400
But I guess this will be to me as well.

2035
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:02,280
Well, is a movie of in Iron City?

2036
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:04,520
That's crazy. Like Star Tours before Star Wars.

2037
01:42:04,640 --> 01:42:06,160
Yeah, it's just how it worked out.

2038
01:42:06,160 --> 01:42:09,560
I don't know. But it makes you appreciate the strength of the world, too.

2039
01:42:09,560 --> 01:42:14,560
Like Alita is a brand new IP for 99.9% of people.

2040
01:42:14,640 --> 01:42:16,920
Like you don't see a lot. It's exciting in that regard.

2041
01:42:17,080 --> 01:42:19,760
The manga existed, but like not really in America,

2042
01:42:19,960 --> 01:42:21,640
like not really stateside at all.

2043
01:42:21,640 --> 01:42:24,080
And it was like out of print everywhere for a long time.

2044
01:42:24,120 --> 01:42:27,160
Like even in Japan, it was kind of invisible for a bit.

2045
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:28,640
I guess here's a here's a question.

2046
01:42:28,640 --> 01:42:30,640
Can you often think of like the ultimate,

2047
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:35,600
the mythology you would most want to tap into or explore or a

2048
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:42,040
mythology or a property that would be like a dream to set up something in?

2049
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:46,120
I just get lost and immediately always thinking of Home Alone.

2050
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:48,640
Is that right?

2051
01:42:48,640 --> 01:42:51,160
Like, not that that's realistic or makes any sense.

2052
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:54,040
Well, I'm on board right away.

2053
01:42:54,040 --> 01:42:55,960
But any thoughts as to what that is?

2054
01:42:55,960 --> 01:42:58,960
I just feel like it would be hilarious to like go through a booby

2055
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:00,640
trapped house.

2056
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:03,680
Do you think how you would do it without killing your guests?

2057
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:05,800
But, you know, it sounds fun.

2058
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:08,120
It seems like more of like a Halloween horror night.

2059
01:43:08,120 --> 01:43:10,280
Smey's maybe. Can you imagine?

2060
01:43:10,280 --> 01:43:11,600
I can imagine it.

2061
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:13,920
Paint cans like flying just above your head.

2062
01:43:14,160 --> 01:43:16,840
I mean, there's so many complications to what that experience would be.

2063
01:43:16,840 --> 01:43:19,600
Like, you know, it's half half choking.

2064
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:22,000
But if it became a reality, I'm sure we'd figure it out.

2065
01:43:22,120 --> 01:43:26,040
It'd be complicated to figure out how to give gifts the experience of stepping on a nail

2066
01:43:26,360 --> 01:43:27,600
into their bare foot.

2067
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:29,120
It would have to be like a rubber nail.

2068
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:33,440
And like they'd have to have like reinforced shoes that we give them a check in.

2069
01:43:33,440 --> 01:43:34,800
And it's, you know, legal.

2070
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:36,800
Legal to shut so many things down.

2071
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:38,920
Technology has made great leaps and bounds.

2072
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:42,800
If it could trick me into thinking I was stepping on a nail, I'd be very impressed.

2073
01:43:43,480 --> 01:43:46,600
Do you see the house on like I feel like I do you feel like you

2074
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:50,480
you've watched a movie enough to like know your way around the house.

2075
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:52,360
Like the house is so iconic.

2076
01:43:52,360 --> 01:43:53,440
And he made the map.

2077
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:54,600
I could probably draw the house.

2078
01:43:54,640 --> 01:43:56,520
Yeah, I feel like I know it.

2079
01:43:56,520 --> 01:44:01,320
But but you know, fake nails are like sensations, like technology that would simulate that.

2080
01:44:01,560 --> 01:44:05,520
You know, one of the things that we try to deploy in Passport, Iron City, too,

2081
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:10,720
was things that were high tech, but things that were also super lo fi and like just

2082
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:12,640
tangible, tactile things.

2083
01:44:12,640 --> 01:44:15,360
So it's like the marketplace

2084
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:20,240
relies on that like old Halloween game of like reaching the bag and tell us what you feel.

2085
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:22,480
Yeah. And it uses your senses.

2086
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:26,840
And it like everything is designed very deliberately across the whole experience

2087
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:29,560
to make everyone feel empowered and cool.

2088
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:32,960
Like they've accomplished something and they're valuable in that universe.

2089
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:37,280
Because one thing that not that this is an escape room, but clearly there's escape room

2090
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:41,680
elements, escape rooms can make you feel really crappy.

2091
01:44:42,280 --> 01:44:45,120
If you're not really good at very claustrophobic,

2092
01:44:45,720 --> 01:44:50,000
very insane when you're trying to figure out puzzles and stuff.

2093
01:44:50,240 --> 01:44:53,360
If you're not a very specific kind of person that has a particular kind of brain

2094
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:59,720
that really enjoys that kind of simulation, you can be really polarized by that kind of thing.

2095
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:05,320
I'm not saying all escape rooms are the same, but it's a very particular thing.

2096
01:45:05,320 --> 01:45:07,600
I find them very nerve wracking personally.

2097
01:45:08,640 --> 01:45:13,000
And so it's like, yeah, we have a countdown clock in Passport, Iron City.

2098
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:19,360
We have a dynamic credit system where teams are competing against each other, earning credits.

2099
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:23,320
There's a leaderboard that refreshes like Grand Central Station flipping all the time.

2100
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:29,280
There's elements that would stress you out in theory, but they don't because you're

2101
01:45:29,960 --> 01:45:32,680
having fun and you're distracted by the fun you're having.

2102
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:37,560
So the leaderboard is there and yes, it's competitive and yes, there's a winner.

2103
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:43,240
But that's not the point at the end of the day, because like you realize it's not about winning.

2104
01:45:43,240 --> 01:45:45,280
It's about like creating memories.

2105
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:53,080
Yeah, which I before this, I did not have a memory of arguing with a shifty taxi driver

2106
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:57,680
and half of my friends thinking that he was not to be trusted.

2107
01:45:57,680 --> 01:46:00,640
And we were like literally torn back and forth.

2108
01:46:00,640 --> 01:46:04,240
Like some of us were starting to go one way and like, no, you're coming this way.

2109
01:46:04,240 --> 01:46:05,960
You're with me or you're against me. No, hang on.

2110
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:09,520
I think there's something here like how weird we're around each other all the time.

2111
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:13,640
Now we're in like a weird like marketplace fight together.

2112
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:19,160
Yes, what a strange way to like hang out with friends you see all the time.

2113
01:46:19,160 --> 01:46:21,520
We've gotten some hilarious feedback, too, where some people are like,

2114
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:26,160
hey, one of the actors told me to bet on this this one racer in Motorball and we lost.

2115
01:46:26,160 --> 01:46:28,600
I'm like, well, why did you listen to them?

2116
01:46:28,600 --> 01:46:31,720
Like, well, do you just immediately trust anyone on the street that you're talking to?

2117
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:34,400
Like their job isn't to give you the answers.

2118
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:37,320
It's not that easy in the real world, nor is it that easy in Iron City.

2119
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:39,480
There's a rhyme or reason to everything that happens.

2120
01:46:39,480 --> 01:46:41,480
Like everything has a solution.

2121
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:43,200
There's a bunch of puzzles throughout.

2122
01:46:43,200 --> 01:46:44,840
Motorball is also a puzzle.

2123
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:47,880
You know, you just got to look at the clues and it's like you can discern

2124
01:46:48,360 --> 01:46:51,920
for the most part who is going to win the race and the races rotate.

2125
01:46:51,960 --> 01:46:54,800
Like you're never going to see the same one twice.

2126
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:56,920
But you know, you're still gambling.

2127
01:46:56,920 --> 01:47:01,000
You know, like Vegas doesn't guarantee you winnings, but like you can discern

2128
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:04,800
and deduce pretty logically like who's going to win if you pay attention.

2129
01:47:05,080 --> 01:47:05,880
Much like anything.

2130
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:10,520
And we forgot Slots rules for Vegas, where it's like if you can max

2131
01:47:10,520 --> 01:47:13,760
bet every time because that increases your chances.

2132
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:17,440
That is the one thing that our cast members in Iron City will encourage

2133
01:47:17,440 --> 01:47:21,680
everyone to do, because what started happening early on

2134
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:25,400
in play test was some people would go crazy.

2135
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:28,000
Like they're just like gamblers of heart and they would just bet the max.

2136
01:47:28,240 --> 01:47:31,200
But so many other teams would just bet like a thousand credits

2137
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:33,440
and you can bet up to 50,000 credits.

2138
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:36,640
So like you got to think about it like a weird mix of jeopardy.

2139
01:47:36,680 --> 01:47:38,720
Yeah. Jeopardy and slot machines.

2140
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:42,680
It's like the whole point is that like this is like the group activity

2141
01:47:42,680 --> 01:47:46,480
where you can you can rise up to number one, but you do have to risk something.

2142
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:48,960
But you also have to pay attention to what you got on the leaderboard.

2143
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:51,640
And a thousand credits isn't going to get you anywhere.

2144
01:47:51,880 --> 01:47:54,680
Yeah. This is how neurotic I am.

2145
01:47:54,680 --> 01:47:58,240
I guess that I'm not even willing to risk fake money.

2146
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:01,440
Like I didn't I wouldn't even bet like non-existent

2147
01:48:01,640 --> 01:48:05,880
but like money that I've had fake money that I've only had for 20 minutes.

2148
01:48:06,120 --> 01:48:08,080
I'm like, yeah, but I earned that. I fought for that.

2149
01:48:08,200 --> 01:48:09,280
I pressed a keyboard.

2150
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:11,640
It's real money in Iron City, Scott.

2151
01:48:11,880 --> 01:48:15,440
Yeah. Well, if it's any if it's any consolation and you may like

2152
01:48:15,680 --> 01:48:19,200
sink into like a giant, you know,

2153
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:23,080
pool of just self-doubt now and depression.

2154
01:48:23,080 --> 01:48:27,680
But these credit coins, the actual if you if you're the winning team,

2155
01:48:27,680 --> 01:48:31,800
you get like a full on thousand credit coin that were screen used and minted

2156
01:48:32,440 --> 01:48:37,240
by like like a really awesome old machine in Colorado.

2157
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:39,080
Whoa. Wild. They're like super.

2158
01:48:39,080 --> 01:48:40,120
I don't know if you guys have held these.

2159
01:48:40,120 --> 01:48:42,360
They're like they're really substantial because we lost.

2160
01:48:42,360 --> 01:48:44,320
So they're really substantial coins.

2161
01:48:44,320 --> 01:48:48,080
Yeah, that's it's it's a prize that is neat and cool.

2162
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:51,280
And it's like a little piece of movie proptim, if you will.

2163
01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:55,240
This is very heavy, very detailed, like the etchings on the side.

2164
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,280
This is cooler than I thought the coin was.

2165
01:48:58,280 --> 01:49:00,840
I was a little relieved when I saw people win the coins like,

2166
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:03,120
just some plastic coin. Now it's a cool coin.

2167
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:04,560
It's a very real coin.

2168
01:49:04,600 --> 01:49:05,640
But now they're selling on eBay.

2169
01:49:05,640 --> 01:49:08,600
We saw this thing for like seventy two dollars a couple of days ago.

2170
01:49:08,920 --> 01:49:12,560
Maybe it's gone up. But I'm like, well, I don't think now you can translate

2171
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:14,480
into real money or bitcoins if you're crazy.

2172
01:49:14,600 --> 01:49:17,280
Sure. I got some.

2173
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:21,400
It's down right now. But, you know, so I guess does anybody sort of

2174
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:25,480
have like a wrap up question, you guys, because we talk about how it feels

2175
01:49:25,480 --> 01:49:30,200
like the world is becoming more theme park, like experiences like this

2176
01:49:30,200 --> 01:49:34,240
are popping up more and movies especially are doing promotional things

2177
01:49:34,240 --> 01:49:36,800
where there'll be like a crazy pop up for something.

2178
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:40,800
But like, where do you see the future of this type of entertainment?

2179
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:42,880
Like, do you have a vision for it in a way?

2180
01:49:42,920 --> 01:49:44,600
We hate that word pop up.

2181
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:47,720
OK, some people have paraphrased us as pop up, but we're not.

2182
01:49:47,720 --> 01:49:49,840
What do you think about activation?

2183
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:52,720
Because it sounds a little Manchurian candidate to me.

2184
01:49:53,560 --> 01:49:58,200
Activations is a very like insider baseball term for like agency talk.

2185
01:49:58,680 --> 01:50:00,000
Right. It's an act.

2186
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,360
It's like everywhere a comic.

2187
01:50:01,400 --> 01:50:04,320
I mean, I introduced what I made, but was at the beginning of this.

2188
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:06,400
Like I said, the word activation and stunt.

2189
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:09,000
Stunt is another marketing word.

2190
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:10,880
But this is not an activation or a stunt.

2191
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:15,240
This is like a thing that will exist as long as people want it to.

2192
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:18,800
Like it is something we have, you know, will run for many months.

2193
01:50:19,040 --> 01:50:21,800
We're not going away just because the movie opened already

2194
01:50:21,800 --> 01:50:23,840
and we'll keep extending our lease.

2195
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:27,560
We have lease extensions for as long as people want us to be in these cities.

2196
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:31,200
Yeah, so it's its own standalone business

2197
01:50:32,520 --> 01:50:35,640
and experience, you know, it's just about fulfilling the destiny

2198
01:50:35,640 --> 01:50:39,840
of expanding the universal lore of this place called Iron City

2199
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:42,360
and it'll be a battle angel because you bet your butt

2200
01:50:42,360 --> 01:50:43,800
they want to make sequels to this thing.

2201
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:45,560
Terrible. Absolutely.

2202
01:50:45,560 --> 01:50:46,680
Well, yeah, it's very cool.

2203
01:50:46,680 --> 01:50:47,520
Congrats on it.

2204
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:50,320
And thanks for giving us a passport to Iron City.

2205
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:53,040

And we'll keep on going if people want us.

2214
01:51:19,880 --> 01:51:22,640
Cool. Great. That gives us more time to finish the episode.

2215
01:51:22,840 --> 01:51:23,640
It's good.

2216
01:51:23,640 --> 01:51:25,520
OK, we can drag our feet.

2217
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:26,840
Awesome. Cool. Thanks so much for being here.

2218
01:51:26,840 --> 01:51:28,400
Thank you for having us. Great.

2219
01:51:31,960 --> 01:51:35,160
OK, John Gibson, co-owner of I am eight bits.

2220
01:51:35,600 --> 01:51:36,800
Cool guy. Fun to talk to him.

2221
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:40,720
And he told you a little more about the what this experience was

2222
01:51:40,720 --> 01:51:45,480
and the ultimate goal of getting this this very cool coin,

2223
01:51:45,480 --> 01:51:48,440
which we were disappointed to learn was cool,

2224
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:55,400
especially because, well, we should talk about our results.

2225
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:56,840
OK, yeah, a little bit.

2226
01:51:56,840 --> 01:51:58,680
So we were doing so the multiple challenges.

2227
01:51:58,680 --> 01:52:00,440
So basically, I think we kind of said it.

2228
01:52:00,440 --> 01:52:02,920
But like how it works is there's multiple things to do

2229
01:52:02,920 --> 01:52:06,160
and you kind of run from station to station and you try to do your challenges.

2230
01:52:06,160 --> 01:52:08,560
Like we were saying puzzle or the keyboard thing.

2231
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:10,680
Dr. Chiren's enhancement assessment.

2232
01:52:10,680 --> 01:52:12,120
That's what I meant to say.

2233
01:52:12,120 --> 01:52:15,360
I don't know what that was because we didn't have time to do that.

2234
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:16,720
We didn't know it's a mystery to me.

2235
01:52:16,720 --> 01:52:17,480
Don't know who Dr. Chiren is.

2236
01:52:17,480 --> 01:52:20,200
They tell you you're not going to be able to do everything.

2237
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:21,760
And that turned out to be true.

2238
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:24,080
Yep. And then there's what's the smell one?

2239
01:52:25,080 --> 01:52:26,080
What was that one?

2240
01:52:26,080 --> 01:52:26,480
Marketplace one.

2241
01:52:26,480 --> 01:52:27,400
Marketplace one.

2242
01:52:27,400 --> 01:52:31,000
So like there's one more like a very mysterious person.

2243
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,640
I will give you some smells and you'll say what it is.

2244
01:52:33,640 --> 01:52:34,720
You'll have 30 seconds.

2245
01:52:34,720 --> 01:52:39,120
And like I was so proud of myself, they waved it under my nose and I said chocolate.

2246
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:42,040
And I gave me a good sense of self satisfaction.

2247
01:52:42,040 --> 01:52:43,320
I think we all did pretty well.

2248
01:52:43,320 --> 01:52:45,120
No, I was the first one up.

2249
01:52:45,120 --> 01:52:51,240
And only in a technicality was somebody nice and threw me bell pepper.

2250
01:52:51,240 --> 01:52:52,120
Oh, right, right.

2251
01:52:52,120 --> 01:52:55,480
Because that was the first challenge and I was the first person to do anything.

2252
01:52:55,480 --> 01:52:57,920
And I fucked it up and I felt stupid.

2253
01:52:57,920 --> 01:53:01,680
Well, but that's you know, that's it's a teamwork thing because I had it later

2254
01:53:01,680 --> 01:53:05,320
when there's a challenge where you put your hand in a bag and see what's in there.

2255
01:53:06,200 --> 01:53:07,560
And I was like, it's that thing.

2256
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:10,760
It's like it's like a branch that's in a cocktail.

2257
01:53:10,760 --> 01:53:13,240
And someone was like, not Meg.

2258
01:53:13,240 --> 01:53:16,560
Yeah. So like I was describing it, but somebody it was an assist, you know,

2259
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:18,480
so you shouldn't have felt so bad about that.

2260
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:19,960
Teamwork was part of it. Yeah.

2261
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:21,720
I just didn't like the starting at that point.

2262
01:53:21,720 --> 01:53:27,040
Right. So we were so long story short, we were kicking ass.

2263
01:53:27,280 --> 01:53:28,840
Yeah, we were number.

2264
01:53:28,840 --> 01:53:31,080
There's a leaderboard. So you get that we were running around.

2265
01:53:31,240 --> 01:53:34,640
We were in triple digits, I think, before everyone else was.

2266
01:53:34,640 --> 01:53:36,360
They were still in double digits.

2267
01:53:36,360 --> 01:53:40,240
We all, I think, felt like the smarty pants kids.

2268
01:53:40,240 --> 01:53:43,360
And we were like, we're going to do like that's another thing.

2269
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:46,680
I was flashing back to like an elementary school feeling of like,

2270
01:53:46,680 --> 01:53:49,560
we are the smartest kids here. I cannot believe it.

2271
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:52,480
We're going to beat everybody.

2272
01:53:52,480 --> 01:53:55,160
And so we were doing really well.

2273
01:53:55,160 --> 01:54:00,120
And then there's a final challenge, basically, which is a guess.

2274
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:05,160
Essentially, you're placing a bet on what's the name of the sport?

2275
01:54:05,160 --> 01:54:06,880
Motorball. It's gambling.

2276
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:09,800
Motorball. It's got the risk challenge type.

2277
01:54:10,280 --> 01:54:15,080
Right. It's like horse racing or something, but it's like robots, essentially.

2278
01:54:15,800 --> 01:54:19,080
So they kind of they help you along on all the challenges.

2279
01:54:19,080 --> 01:54:23,680
And the helpful man was like, you know, I would say go with

2280
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,240
the two that have been upgraded recently.

2281
01:54:26,240 --> 01:54:27,960
Some pick between those two.

2282
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:30,840
So you see that there's two characters that have been upgraded.

2283
01:54:31,120 --> 01:54:32,400
And I don't have anything in front of me.

2284
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:36,040
What are the names of the crimson wind and junger not jungler not

2285
01:54:36,520 --> 01:54:37,440
jugger not.

2286
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:40,360
I told you it was dry. What did you see through it?

2287
01:54:40,360 --> 01:54:42,360
And in there, yeah, we're not crazy.

2288
01:54:42,360 --> 01:54:43,280
You said junger not right.

2289
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:46,280
It was junger not and who could to pep.

2290
01:54:46,280 --> 01:54:48,560
OK, I think I just got much better.

2291
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:50,120
OK, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2292
01:54:50,120 --> 01:54:51,480
Juggernaut. Great. That's what I thought.

2293
01:54:51,480 --> 01:54:53,320
All right. So juggernaut and crimson wind.

2294
01:54:53,320 --> 01:54:54,960
And we were looking through.

2295
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:58,240
And then on the iPad or whatever, you could look at like stats

2296
01:54:58,240 --> 01:55:01,840
and crimson wind looked like she had better stats than juggernaut.

2297
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:03,480
And juggernaut looked like a bad guy.

2298
01:55:03,480 --> 01:55:05,320
And juggernaut also looked like a bad guy.

2299
01:55:05,320 --> 01:55:06,640
I didn't care so much about that.

2300
01:55:06,640 --> 01:55:10,080
But I because it's iron city, baby, I can I can support my.

2301
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:12,040
I want to support the winner. I don't care.

2302
01:55:12,600 --> 01:55:15,080
My only allegiance is to money in iron city.

2303
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:18,560
Sweet, sweet credits, sweet, sweet credits.

2304
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:20,840
So I was like, I think crimson wind.

2305
01:55:20,840 --> 01:55:23,920
So this is I don't think we would have won

2306
01:55:24,760 --> 01:55:26,600
because we were still, I think, right at the end,

2307
01:55:26,600 --> 01:55:28,960
we were not in smarty pants first place.

2308
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:31,040
I don't think we might have been second or third.

2309
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:34,240
But the whole thing is that you bet credits, you can bet up to 50.

2310
01:55:34,240 --> 01:55:35,200
So it's like Jeopardy.

2311
01:55:35,200 --> 01:55:38,600
You're sacrificing like you could potentially be sacrificing

2312
01:55:38,600 --> 01:55:40,720
your credits if you lose.

2313
01:55:40,720 --> 01:55:43,320
So we all had like it happened too fast.

2314
01:55:43,320 --> 01:55:45,360
We should have done this earlier, I think.

2315
01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:46,560
We weren't all together.

2316
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:49,120
We weren't making the decision as a group. Right.

2317
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:49,720
Should have been.

2318
01:55:49,720 --> 01:55:52,320
So there was a debate of how many credits to bet.

2319
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:55,400
Is it like Vegas rules where it's like, OK, double or nothing?

2320
01:55:55,440 --> 01:55:57,240
You know, right.

2321
01:55:57,240 --> 01:55:58,960
Which we probably should have leaned more toward

2322
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:01,200
because I like afterwards when we were talking about, we're like, well,

2323
01:56:01,200 --> 01:56:02,840
this is a silly nonsense thing.

2324
01:56:02,840 --> 01:56:05,240
And we weren't going to get to keep this fake money.

2325
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:08,040
And the hints were strong of who you should pick.

2326
01:56:08,040 --> 01:56:11,560
So a lot of people were going to pick the winner and potentially bet more.

2327
01:56:11,720 --> 01:56:14,200
So what do we bet? Ten out of 50? 20.

2328
01:56:14,200 --> 01:56:16,400
20. We bet 20 out of 50. Yeah.

2329
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:21,600
And Crimson Wind beat Juggernaut at the very end.

2330
01:56:22,080 --> 01:56:25,600
Everyone cheered because everyone had picked Crimson Wind, I felt.

2331
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:29,480
And we should say this is not the winner every time.

2332
01:56:29,480 --> 01:56:33,200
Stuff with all of these games change on a regular basis.

2333
01:56:33,200 --> 01:56:34,880
There's multiple variations.

2334
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:38,280
Yes, I don't think you got their goat by knowing it's Crimson Wind.

2335
01:56:38,360 --> 01:56:40,200
Right. Yeah. Sometimes it's Crimson Wind.

2336
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:42,440
Sometimes it's Juggernaut. Sometimes it's Junkernot.

2337
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:45,040
It could be any of the three of the robots.

2338
01:56:45,160 --> 01:56:50,160
OK, well, that's an extra hot dogs to make up for this inadequacy later.

2339
01:56:52,040 --> 01:56:53,160
I told you about the app, though.

2340
01:56:53,160 --> 01:56:55,160
So it's kind of like I treated you to the hot dog.

2341
01:56:55,560 --> 01:56:57,800
Well, we've discussed the hot app.

2342
01:56:57,800 --> 01:57:00,360
This freebies on the app do not include hot dogs.

2343
01:57:00,360 --> 01:57:02,600
And you're right. You got to get more points.

2344
01:57:02,600 --> 01:57:06,320
So we got like second to last place, I think.

2345
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:08,440
Third to last. Third to last.

2346
01:57:08,600 --> 01:57:11,200
OK. But it was very disappointing.

2347
01:57:11,200 --> 01:57:13,720
So now we know we can pass that along to anybody.

2348
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:18,240
And after being first for almost the whole time, we were like the thing you want to have

2349
01:57:18,280 --> 01:57:22,360
when you're down in the gutter in sixth place, you think, well, if I bet it all,

2350
01:57:22,720 --> 01:57:25,920
maybe I could bring down that cocky guy at the top.

2351
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:27,480
And we were the cocky guys at the top.

2352
01:57:27,480 --> 01:57:34,000
Yes. And thus we ended up with a final credit score of not it,

2353
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:37,200
not like in terms of bank credit score, but just within this.

2354
01:57:37,720 --> 01:57:41,000
We'll give you our credit score later in the in Iron City.

2355
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:45,080
Our credit score was one hundred and fifty one thousand five hundred.

2356
01:57:45,280 --> 01:57:50,120
So if you get a group of six to go do this thing, try to beat one hundred

2357
01:57:50,120 --> 01:57:55,440
and fifty one thousand and you will have beaten the Iron City masters here on podcast.

2358
01:57:56,200 --> 01:57:58,480
Honestly, it should be easy. We did so poorly.

2359
01:57:59,320 --> 01:58:03,520
Would you guys like to talk about your assessment results?

2360
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:04,520
Yes.

2361
01:58:05,440 --> 01:58:10,040
I the factory evaluated my performance and determined I will serve as a factory clerk.

2362
01:58:11,320 --> 01:58:16,840
There's little stats that you get based on your performance in the various games.

2363
01:58:16,840 --> 01:58:22,880
And I was on the scale of safe to adventurous all the way down at safe.

2364
01:58:24,200 --> 01:58:28,440
I am I slightly notched barely towards rebellious

2365
01:58:29,440 --> 01:58:32,400
and and I'm way down towards passive.

2366
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:36,000
This is an accurate reflection of life.

2367
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,360
I feel I'm right.

2368
01:58:38,360 --> 01:58:42,120
Sixtieth percentile rebellious, not close to under.

2369
01:58:42,280 --> 01:58:46,000
Yeah. So basically on the chart of like interest risk alignment, compassion,

2370
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:49,320
it's like there's one, two, there's there's eight different boxes.

2371
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:51,160
So you can go through the spectrum.

2372
01:58:51,160 --> 01:58:53,120
So if you're like so.

2373
01:58:53,120 --> 01:58:56,760
So what were you on passive of which box did you check?

2374
01:58:57,400 --> 01:58:58,880
I'm closer to passive.

2375
01:58:58,880 --> 01:59:01,080
Was it three away? Three away.

2376
01:59:02,080 --> 01:59:04,000
I am also three away.

2377
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,240
I was passive and we all have the same.

2378
01:59:06,400 --> 01:59:08,440
I don't know my risk. My I'm safe.

2379
01:59:08,440 --> 01:59:11,320
I'm two away from safe, which just means very safe.

2380
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:13,280
I'm right on safe. I'm right on safe.

2381
01:59:13,280 --> 01:59:15,480
Oh, so I'm a little less safe than you.

2382
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:18,000
Well, because they because they were scanning

2383
01:59:18,680 --> 01:59:21,040
this is because they know this is because they know I like.

2384
01:59:21,040 --> 01:59:22,240
Yeah, they were scanning.

2385
01:59:22,240 --> 01:59:24,280
They heard the podcast.

2386
01:59:24,280 --> 01:59:27,040
So they know I've done like three more hunts and you guys have.

2387
01:59:27,080 --> 01:59:28,720
So I'm a little less safe.

2388
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:30,480
I'm cold.

2389
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:33,160
I'm three away from being most cold.

2390
01:59:33,680 --> 01:59:36,120
I am also that I'm also that.

2391
01:59:36,120 --> 01:59:37,080
All right. We're all safe.

2392
01:59:37,080 --> 01:59:38,080
But what were your guys?

2393
01:59:38,080 --> 01:59:39,680
What's your job in the factory?

2394
01:59:39,680 --> 01:59:41,440
I man.

2395
01:59:41,440 --> 01:59:42,240
What is it?

2396
01:59:42,240 --> 01:59:44,440
Deck man. One word.

2397
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:46,880
Is that a boat? Do they know about your boat stuff?

2398
01:59:47,680 --> 01:59:51,400
All they say is it's Fleet Week and the ships just stopped sailor.

2399
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:54,320
You would be a good deck man.

2400
01:59:54,320 --> 01:59:55,960
Well, all aboard. Wow.

2401
01:59:55,960 --> 01:59:59,120
Mine is not as good as yours.

2402
01:59:59,120 --> 02:00:03,520
Deckman mine is factory farmer, which is like a bad job.

2403
02:00:03,760 --> 02:00:06,120
That's not a thing or thing we like in this world.

2404
02:00:06,920 --> 02:00:09,200
Yeah. Yeah.

2405
02:00:09,200 --> 02:00:13,600
So the factory is it how does the fact is that what is the factory make?

2406
02:00:13,600 --> 02:00:15,720
What do you farm in the factory?

2407
02:00:15,720 --> 02:00:17,720
Do we know credits credits?

2408
02:00:17,720 --> 02:00:19,400
I'm a credit from like a Bitcoin.

2409
02:00:19,400 --> 02:00:21,560
You're you're a credit crooker.

2410
02:00:21,800 --> 02:00:24,120
You take a big shepherd's crook

2411
02:00:24,120 --> 02:00:26,640
and you scrape all the credits around and

2412
02:00:27,680 --> 02:00:30,080
polish them up and get them back onto the street.

2413
02:00:30,120 --> 02:00:31,440
I don't like the sound of that.

2414
02:00:31,440 --> 02:00:34,200
Yeah, sorry. So yes, your life now.

2415
02:00:34,200 --> 02:00:36,800
And the main thing is none of us are on Zalem.

2416
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:39,480
We didn't descend.

2417
02:00:39,480 --> 02:00:44,640
I did notice a green team on here has sixty three thousand, which is so much less.

2418
02:00:45,040 --> 02:00:46,840
So yeah, really bad.

2419
02:00:46,840 --> 02:00:49,080
We can feel superior to somebody.

2420
02:00:49,080 --> 02:00:53,240
Hey, green team at the four o'clock showing several Sundays ago.

2421
02:00:53,240 --> 02:00:54,840
You know who you are. Yeah.

2422
02:00:54,840 --> 02:00:55,760
You fucked up.

2423
02:00:55,760 --> 02:00:58,520
You know, too much in the Kansas bar.

2424
02:00:58,640 --> 02:01:00,040
Yeah, I saw.

2425
02:01:00,040 --> 02:01:03,440
Oh, yeah. Those are those guys who were like, who were tipping over and shouting

2426
02:01:03,440 --> 02:01:04,800
and punching each other.

2427
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:09,640
Hiccup never wiping their eyes like they couldn't believe anything they were seeing.

2428
02:01:09,800 --> 02:01:12,320
You're never going to catch a liter that rate.

2429
02:01:14,120 --> 02:01:15,000
Catch.

2430
02:01:15,960 --> 02:01:17,760
A real quick thing I'll say before

2431
02:01:18,680 --> 02:01:22,440
before we're done with this is that Jason loved this one performer there.

2432
02:01:22,440 --> 02:01:27,360
And you said he was like an older gentleman and he was the one giving the trivia out.

2433
02:01:27,560 --> 02:01:29,920
And he reminded me of I'm trying to think like

2434
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:34,680
a little bit less of a character, Richard Jenkins, maybe.

2435
02:01:34,760 --> 02:01:36,480
Yes, I would say that.

2436
02:01:36,480 --> 02:01:38,720
And you said something like he was he was good.

2437
02:01:38,720 --> 02:01:40,040
Everyone was good.

2438
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:44,040
But you said, I want to be in something with him and I want him to play my dad.

2439
02:01:44,320 --> 02:01:45,760
Yeah. You never think about that.

2440
02:01:45,760 --> 02:01:50,680
Like who would play your family members and movies and like not a biopic movie,

2441
02:01:50,680 --> 02:01:54,840
but like, oh, if I wrote a script, who would you cast as the father?

2442
02:01:54,840 --> 02:01:55,560
Karen, whatever.

2443
02:01:55,560 --> 02:01:58,520
I mean, I guess if we if we're thinking about it, I want Star Trek

2444
02:01:58,520 --> 02:02:01,400
The Next Generation's Jonathan Frakes to play my father in something.

2445
02:02:01,400 --> 02:02:03,840
So I can see what you're saying just off the top of your head.

2446
02:02:03,840 --> 02:02:05,120
Yeah. Jonathan Frakes.

2447
02:02:05,120 --> 02:02:07,480
What about you, Scott? Oh, man.

2448
02:02:08,280 --> 02:02:10,080
I love I.

2449
02:02:10,080 --> 02:02:12,280
Yes. All right. Thanks for giving it to me.

2450
02:02:12,280 --> 02:02:14,560
May sunny boy.

2451
02:02:14,560 --> 02:02:17,160
A special hat for your 30 seconds.

2452
02:02:17,160 --> 02:02:22,080
32 years of good vibration.

2453
02:02:22,080 --> 02:02:26,760
In addition to this man I met once, Richard Jenkins would be like high upon my list.

2454
02:02:26,760 --> 02:02:29,200
Sure. Who but that's the listeners.

2455
02:02:29,440 --> 02:02:33,360
Who would you want to play your dad of all the actors you know?

2456
02:02:33,800 --> 02:02:36,040
Hashtag who's your daddy?

2457
02:02:38,880 --> 02:02:40,200
Maybe who's your hashtag?

2458
02:02:40,200 --> 02:02:41,640
Who's your daddy actor?

2459
02:02:41,640 --> 02:02:45,440
I feel like that was never been used for anything before.

2460
02:02:45,920 --> 02:02:48,080
Yeah, that'll be a clean hashtag for us.

2461
02:02:48,080 --> 02:02:50,520
Yep. We laid claim to that first.

2462
02:02:50,520 --> 02:02:52,760
Yeah. Yeah. Well, I'm looking forward to that.

2463
02:02:53,720 --> 02:02:56,160
But let me say one thing.

2464
02:02:56,240 --> 02:03:00,120
We as we've said, our Iron City stats, not so good.

2465
02:03:00,120 --> 02:03:01,600
Our risk was low.

2466
02:03:01,600 --> 02:03:03,360
We are somewhat cold.

2467
02:03:03,360 --> 02:03:09,160
Yeah. But and we did not walk out of Iron City with the precious metals,

2468
02:03:09,160 --> 02:03:10,600
with the beautiful coin. Right.

2469
02:03:10,600 --> 02:03:14,640
But we did go to IMAPIT and we interviewed John Gibson and he gave us the coins.

2470
02:03:14,640 --> 02:03:15,920
He gave us the coins.

2471
02:03:15,920 --> 02:03:17,480
We won anyway.

2472
02:03:17,480 --> 02:03:20,560
Podcasting. Yeah, we cheated our way.

2473
02:03:20,560 --> 02:03:22,760
We outsmarted everybody in that dumb city.

2474
02:03:22,760 --> 02:03:25,720
Because you don't have to follow the rules in Iron City.

2475
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:29,480
Yeah. Yes, we understood it more than anybody.

2476
02:03:30,480 --> 02:03:35,360
We played the 13th round where you go interview the guy for a podcast later.

2477
02:03:35,360 --> 02:03:36,960
Yes. No, the secret round.

2478
02:03:36,960 --> 02:03:38,440
They didn't know existed. Yeah.

2479
02:03:38,440 --> 02:03:39,880
Yeah. We outsmarted everyone.

2480
02:03:39,880 --> 02:03:44,600
He we were interviewing him and he pulled out what I only can describe as a POG

2481
02:03:44,640 --> 02:03:48,360
holder from over by like where he was sitting.

2482
02:03:48,640 --> 02:03:51,040
And he opened it up and I went, oh, my God, is he of all those coins?

2483
02:03:51,040 --> 02:03:53,000
And there's a little elite of coins.

2484
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:54,200
And like he kind of pulled him out.

2485
02:03:54,200 --> 02:03:56,600
I was like, oh, my God, is he going to give us a coin?

2486
02:03:56,920 --> 02:03:59,720
And he did. He put three to he did like a real cool move.

2487
02:03:59,720 --> 02:04:02,680
Did you see that? Almost like a like a dealer in Vegas.

2488
02:04:02,680 --> 02:04:05,000
He kind of put the three coins out and I was like, oh, my God.

2489
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:06,200
Oh, yeah.

2490
02:04:06,200 --> 02:04:10,160
You never like that magician, like familiarity and slickness to it.

2491
02:04:10,200 --> 02:04:12,240
I wonder if he does magic. We should have asked him.

2492
02:04:12,280 --> 02:04:13,120
Oh, maybe so.

2493
02:04:13,120 --> 02:04:16,600
I was swept up, though, and like, oh, my God, we can get the coin that I was.

2494
02:04:16,600 --> 02:04:17,760
I was starting to wonder.

2495
02:04:17,760 --> 02:04:19,560
I wasn't like banking on it.

2496
02:04:19,560 --> 02:04:23,600
But sure enough, right after we finished recording, he gave us the coins.

2497
02:04:23,760 --> 02:04:26,680
Well, prove it. We'll post a picture so you know that we got the coins.

2498
02:04:26,680 --> 02:04:31,440
We're not faking it. But this is I'm realizing that this is the second coin

2499
02:04:31,440 --> 02:04:35,280
that has been important to us over the course of doing this podcast.

2500
02:04:35,280 --> 02:04:37,560
The first one, of course, being the famous

2501
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:41,880
city walk sector 19 sector 19

2502
02:04:42,360 --> 02:04:46,760
coffee coin, which was the key to the whole thing.

2503
02:04:47,360 --> 02:04:50,120
That was unlocking a key at the end of a long journey.

2504
02:04:50,120 --> 02:04:53,240
And now we have a thousand Zalem bucks.

2505
02:04:53,600 --> 02:04:56,280
I think I like this being we got.

2506
02:04:56,280 --> 02:05:01,280
I think whenever a coin is in play, we got to pursue it to the end of the earth.

2507
02:05:01,560 --> 02:05:04,320
I don't know if there's other good coins around theme park world.

2508
02:05:04,360 --> 02:05:09,280
I mean, I guess you can get a crushed penny at many theme park locations.

2509
02:05:09,280 --> 02:05:10,240
Yeah, we should.

2510
02:05:10,240 --> 02:05:13,360
Maybe we should start our podcast, the ride coin book.

2511
02:05:13,360 --> 02:05:17,680
And then that should like it should be some sort of like the Simpsons

2512
02:05:17,680 --> 02:05:23,440
and the paintings where like the last one of us alive gets the fortune at the end.

2513
02:05:23,480 --> 02:05:26,240
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2514
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:29,120
Sure. Which I'm sure is based on a real thing in literature.

2515
02:05:29,120 --> 02:05:31,640
But I can only think of the Simpsons one because I'm done.

2516
02:05:32,280 --> 02:05:35,240
And we'll try to kill each other when we're a little older to get it.

2517
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,320
Like three years older. Yeah.

2518
02:05:38,320 --> 02:05:39,720
Global warming.

2519
02:05:39,720 --> 02:05:43,280
It starts hitting the fan and we maybe we can like

2520
02:05:43,280 --> 02:05:47,400
Zola like you're like Iron City, sell some of this like scrap metal

2521
02:05:47,600 --> 02:05:51,600
and try to get robot hands because our hands broke off long ago.

2522
02:05:51,600 --> 02:05:53,960
And we're all like knocking down Jason's door

2523
02:05:53,960 --> 02:05:56,880
because he is the only supply of hot dogs left on the earth.

2524
02:05:57,160 --> 02:05:58,520
What's it worth to you?

2525
02:05:58,520 --> 02:06:00,600
Now you're all with hot dogs.

2526
02:06:01,600 --> 02:06:04,880
I seem to recall you mocked me on a weekly basis.

2527
02:06:04,880 --> 02:06:06,800
And look at you now.

2528
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:08,760
These will never go bad.

2529
02:06:08,760 --> 02:06:10,160
And they're all for me.

2530
02:06:10,160 --> 02:06:12,920
711.

2531
02:06:13,400 --> 02:06:15,360
I've gone down to one a day.

2532
02:06:15,360 --> 02:06:20,400
It's been tough, but if it's how I survived, then it is what it is.

2533
02:06:20,440 --> 02:06:21,560
You know what they say.

2534
02:06:21,560 --> 02:06:23,600
The one who lives the longest wins.

2535
02:06:27,120 --> 02:06:29,760
And that is hot dog throne.

2536
02:06:30,040 --> 02:06:32,440
Um, well, well,

2537
02:06:33,560 --> 02:06:37,640
we we survived podcast, the ride, Iron City experience.

2538
02:06:37,640 --> 02:06:40,800
But will we survive this new real world?

2539
02:06:40,920 --> 02:06:44,440
Who will survive the podcast, the ride coin hunt

2540
02:06:44,440 --> 02:06:46,680
that will go for the rest of our lives? Yeah.

2541
02:06:46,680 --> 02:06:48,840
Our gentlemen, the race is on.

2542
02:06:49,560 --> 02:06:51,960
And who will survive the hot dog wars?

2543
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:54,960
I have one guess.

2544
02:06:54,960 --> 02:06:56,320
Yeah, yeah. Jason shared.

2545
02:06:56,320 --> 02:07:00,360
I have a hot dog warrior.

2546
02:07:04,160 --> 02:07:05,520
Something good personas for you.

2547
02:07:05,520 --> 02:07:08,800
They were warrior killers in the were they hunter kill?

2548
02:07:08,840 --> 02:07:09,600
I forget.

2549
02:07:09,600 --> 02:07:12,640
Killers, hunter killers, warriors.

2550
02:07:12,760 --> 02:07:13,680
I forget.

2551
02:07:13,680 --> 02:07:14,680
Enter this.

2552
02:07:14,680 --> 02:07:19,840
Enter the eater killer hot dog area where możeur experience begins.

2553
02:07:20,240 --> 02:07:21,560
Hot dog ball.

2554
02:07:21,560 --> 02:07:23,160
You bet on hot dog.

2555
02:07:23,160 --> 02:07:25,360
When the ships going down, you will have.

2556
02:07:25,400 --> 02:07:28,080
Here's what you do in the apocalyptic future.

2557
02:07:28,080 --> 02:07:32,320
You use all the coins to pay your way into the.

2558
02:07:32,320 --> 02:07:34,920
You've heard there's like a secret vessel where you can survive

2559
02:07:35,120 --> 02:07:38,280
and you're taken all the way down under the sea with only hot dog

2560
02:07:38,280 --> 02:07:39,600
says you're offering.

2561
02:07:39,600 --> 02:07:43,120
And you get to a little sub a little submarine vessel.

2562
02:07:43,120 --> 02:07:47,280
And inside is James Cameron, who is it turns out as a big hot dog fan.

2563
02:07:47,480 --> 02:07:51,400
And it's his submarine is an underwater Oscar

2564
02:07:51,400 --> 02:07:53,800
Meyer Wiener Mobile.

2565
02:07:53,800 --> 02:07:57,400
It's just no wheels, no wheels on the Wiener Mobile aerodynamically,

2566
02:07:57,400 --> 02:07:59,800
actually the perfect submarine vessel.

2567
02:08:00,760 --> 02:08:04,800
And you live in the Oscar Meyer submarine with James Cameron

2568
02:08:04,800 --> 02:08:08,080
showing down on hot dogs while the shit hits the fan up on the surface.

2569
02:08:08,080 --> 02:08:13,080
I would love to be in the Marianas Trench in James Cameron's sub

2570
02:08:13,080 --> 02:08:17,640
toasting toasting hot dogs and laughing knowingly like

2571
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:19,240
we really got them, didn't we?

2572
02:08:19,240 --> 02:08:21,400
James, we really pulled a fast one.

2573
02:08:21,400 --> 02:08:23,960
Then you hook your arms, you eat each other's dogs.

2574
02:08:23,960 --> 02:08:26,360
Like if you were drinking champagne with your new wife,

2575
02:08:26,960 --> 02:08:29,640
you guys eat each other's hot dogs like we did it.

2576
02:08:30,360 --> 02:08:33,080
And little do they know that unobtainium is real

2577
02:08:33,080 --> 02:08:35,800
and it actually keeps you alive for a thousand years.

2578
02:08:36,200 --> 02:08:39,480
Here's another shot of unobtainium, brother.

2579
02:08:41,440 --> 02:08:43,560
And then you somehow end up on Pandora.

2580
02:08:44,400 --> 02:08:46,800
Yeah, yeah, because it is also real.

2581
02:08:46,960 --> 02:08:51,320
Yep. Flying, flying mighty acrons and turning, turning other acrons.

2582
02:08:51,320 --> 02:08:53,480
Into hot dogs. Sure. Sure.

2583
02:08:53,520 --> 02:08:55,240
Well, who's laughing now?

2584
02:08:55,240 --> 02:08:57,800
Jason Jason and James Cameron.

2585
02:08:57,800 --> 02:09:01,080

I don't public public assurance.

2592
02:09:18,880 --> 02:09:20,000
We have shirts. Yeah.

2593
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,960
Public. We want we're not going to have coins.

2594
02:09:22,960 --> 02:09:24,000
That's for damn sure.

2595
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,360
Those are for us. Although we should make coins.

2596
02:09:27,760 --> 02:09:32,160
Oh, yeah. Now that we're famously coin coin boys.

2597
02:09:33,600 --> 02:09:36,440
It's time to acknowledge any anything could put out pins.

2598
02:09:36,440 --> 02:09:38,840
We're going to have coins. Hashtag coin boys.

2599
02:09:38,840 --> 02:09:40,640
Each one will cost us.

2600
02:09:40,640 --> 02:09:43,080
Hashtag is your daddy. Hashtag coin coin boys.

2601
02:09:43,400 --> 02:09:47,000
Each one will cost us five hundred dollars to mint. Yes.

2602
02:09:47,880 --> 02:09:49,440
Limited run, though, of 10.

2603
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:52,000
And you got to get them.

2604
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
You'll have to find us and kill us.

2605
02:09:55,040 --> 02:09:57,040
Good luck. The chase is on.

2606
02:09:57,040 --> 02:09:59,240
