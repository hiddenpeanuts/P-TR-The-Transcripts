1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
Hey everybody, Mike here. Just a quick note before this episode starts. This was recorded before

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:10,400
the self-quarantining began in the world, got turned upside down. So if it sounds like we're

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,800
not talking about that, that's why we're going to be doing a regular Main Feed episode on Friday

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,760
that's going to, you know, check in, address what's going on. So yeah, I just didn't want

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,640
you to think we sounded crazy here, but enjoy the episode.

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:31,440
Five, four, three, two, one.

7
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:53,760
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the second gate. One part of a two-part podcast entity known as Podcast

8
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,960
the Ride, the Escape. I'm Jason Sheridan, joined as always by Mike Carlson.

9
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,920
I am here.

10
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,960
And Scott Kierdner.

11
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,480
So we're rebranding then.

12
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:09,280
Well, yeah, tend to, you know, Podcast the Ride City, it was also on the table, it shifted a lot.

13
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,400
Yeah, what was that about? Why did that happen? That was an odd,

14
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,080
why did they think a universal escape was going to take?

15
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,280
I don't know. I understood it. And we're talking today.

16
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,280
I am the only one.

17
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,400
Wait, how do you, if you understand it.

18
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,400
I understand it anyway, move along.

19
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,160
No, no. All right. So like to get the audience at speed. Today we're talking about the islands

20
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,840
of adventure preview center that occupied a prime piece of real estate in universal studios,

21
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,520
Florida for about two years leading up to the opening of islands of adventure.

22
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,560
And Mike is turning Jason's volume down because he's so excited.

23
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,680
I was actually turning it up.

24
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,960
I wanted to give the audience that juice, that energy Jason's putting out.

25
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:59,200
So, uh, universal studios, the escape, uh, was the escape or just escape universal studios,

26
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,080
escape, hold on. I've got some documents. Um, you've got a backpack.

27
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,360
You're right. You know, it was universal studios.

28
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:15,520
So that was the branding of, uh, the then what we now call the universal studio,

29
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,680
universal Orlando resort of the two parks and city walk.

30
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,960
When the new stuff showed up, when islands of adventure showed up and city walks showed up,

31
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,120
the whole property was not the resort. It was universal studios escape.

32
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,160
Yes.

33
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:39,520
Which to me, were you at the time just like that's attitude that's, uh, it's, it's a refresh.

34
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,880
This isn't your dad's universal from eight years ago.

35
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,520
No, I got that. It was like an umbrella term.

36
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,880
Cause I, so I looked up, there's a chapter on islands of adventure in the, uh,

37
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,280
universal versus Disney book by Sam get away. And it was originally going to be called universal

38
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,640
city, Florida. The whole thing. You mean? Yeah.

39
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,400
Are you getting choked up?

40
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,600
Well, you gave Mike gave me a bunch of surplus McDonald's right before recording.

41
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,640
Yeah, they gave me two. They gave me like double the order because they were confused with my

42
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,800
mobile order that they didn't order just too much food. No, no, no.

43
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,560
No, I had a regular order and then they were confused. And then they, uh,

44
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,680
I think they made it twice and then they just gave it to me. Okay.

45
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,680
And I did not eat all of it.

46
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,800
Mike's regular order of a sausage, McMuffin and two loose pancakes.

47
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,640
Yes. Cause you, it's the cheapest way to do it. Cause if you get a sauce,

48
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,040
cause usually the breakfast items, you know, three 50, three 75, what you can do is you can get

49
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:45,360
just like a sausage, McMuffin for a dollar 50 and a plane, two plain McGriddles for a dollar 50.

50
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,840
So it's a lot of food for $3. What's the cost saving here?

51
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,680
Well, you're getting like sort of double the sandwiches for, you know,

52
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:59,200
three dollars versus maybe a one of the regular sandwiches being three 50, three 75 already.

53
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,000
I see. So it's a, it's a very good, it's a little hack.

54
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,840
I like to think of it as a hack. I mean, I've been excited about realizing

55
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,840
I can spend a dollar at McDonald's or during happier hour, taco bell for iced tea, as opposed to

56
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,240
an unnecessary three 25 or North at Starbucks when it's just out of a carton.

57
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:24,400
Well, you can do a dollar 30 ounce brewed iced tea at Del Taco for a dollar. Now the iced coffee,

58
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,080
there's a deal with McDonald's. I don't want this to come out if it'll still be there for a dollar,

59
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,400
any size you want, any kind. Really?

60
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,640
Yes. I see. So there's a lot of different dollar type drink hacks that I am.

61
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,000
I can't pretend I'm above this, this being excited about the saving.

62
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,160
You can make fun of me if you want, but just knowing your heart that you're also part of it.

63
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,880
Yes. Yeah. That's what I'm, I'm implicit.

64
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,480
Yeah. Anyway, sorry.

65
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,840
So anyway, back to this. So wrap it up guys, wrap it up guys.

66
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,360
We have so much to get to. So much.

67
00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:01,440
So, uh, islands of entry, of course, opened 1999, uh, in Orlando. And I remember being a kid,

68
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,280
like I was so excited to hear there was going to be another universal park. Like, oh my God,

69
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,680
this is, would you say that's the greatest moment of your life hearing that?

70
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,000
Uh, top five.

71
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,360
Wow. Maybe I mean, this, this place today, the preview center, I was so excited for that.

72
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,800
I was so excited. I went through it once. I remember going through it with my family

73
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,840
and then walking outside and walking immediately back inside to do it again,

74
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:39,760
because I don't think anything had come along. Like preview centers, you know, we talk about a

75
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:46,800
lot, but like, I don't think, I think I was like 12, 11 or 12. So I was like the exact right age.

76
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,720
And like that, there was going to be a whole Marvel section of this park.

77
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,880
That's true. Do we talk about preview centers a lot? I feel,

78
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,240
I feel like we owed an explanation of cause they don't pop up that often.

79
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,760
Cause there aren't new parks that often.

80
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,640
I think they come in, in passing, I guess we, in my mind, they get tossed off and

81
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,520
picked cause hard rock park had a big preview center.

82
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,560
Oh, did it really? Yes. Okay. It was on the site, right?

83
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,160
Or nearby.

84
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,120
Or near, it was nearby and then Epcot had a big preview center.

85
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,440
You can like take the monorail over and see. And if you haven't been to everything,

86
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:26,080
preview centers, just kind of this like pop up exhibit showing you, giving you the vibe of what

87
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,320
the park is going to be like, it's probably like a lot of artwork. There's probably some props that

88
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:37,440
they have. If those are available, the blue sky seller, which is it still going now?

89
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,800
I think it's still going.

90
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,600
In California adventure. I didn't see it open.

91
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,520
Okay. Cause that's right by one of your favorite spots, the El Fresco tasting terrace.

92
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,240
That's correct. Yeah. A former wine exhibit. That's right.

93
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,360
And no longer.

94
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,800
Right now AP exclusive, which actually has made it much more busy, which is unfortunate.

95
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,520
I know. Cause it used to be a little secret.

96
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,440
Yeah. How dare they?

97
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,880
Yeah. So blue sky seller.

98
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,240
But yeah, that's an example. And that was especially hoppin. I feel like when the

99
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,040
sort of phase two of California adventure was coming with the cars land and the new Buena

100
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,440
Vista street. So there's like almost two kinds is the ones that are in the park. Like what we're

101
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,360
talking about today. And then sometimes when there isn't a park, they'll just open some like

102
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,960
totally temporary structure. I remember going to the California adventure one,

103
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,760
which was free. They didn't hide it in Disneyland. You could just go to Disneyland

104
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,440
and walk around the California adventure preview center.

105
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,840
How are your memories equally fond as mine of this?

106
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,360
Oh yeah. It was a big deal for sure. Yes.

107
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:45,200
And when you're dreaming of a park that is, you know, could be an equal to islands of adventure,

108
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,280
I don't know. Wow. Look, they got a big orange. It looks like that should be good.

109
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,040
Spider man, big orange.

110
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,680
All your friends will be at one of these parks or another.

111
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,040
All your friends. And they're also, they're also all fun because you,

112
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:04,800
there's like little often little like, you know, you're seeing this idealized version

113
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,120
they're presenting. Yeah. Which in the case of islands of adventure, pretty close.

114
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,240
It's not like there were a bunch of things they scaled back from, but there's like

115
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,480
differences for sure. We'll run into.

116
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:20,400
I was surprised that how much stuff was so close. And then I think one of the most successful

117
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,560
parts of islands of adventure, like the, the Marvel, like the Spider-Man ride and the Hulk ride,

118
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:31,200
that looks like a damn carnival like game booth. Like that looked the chinsiest of them all.

119
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:36,880
Jurassic park seemed like the most fleshed out in this preview center in terms of like

120
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:43,200
greenery and sound and lighting cues and like a big dinosaur statue above you.

121
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,320
Yeah. Because in the case of this, the sounds of adventure preview center, they kind of,

122
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,800
what does this five worlds essentially, and then the port of entry,

123
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,240
the port of adventure. So they kind of created little rooms that are, you know,

124
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,880
in some cases just here's a wall of art and here's kind of the vibe of what it'll be.

125
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,800
And then Jurassic park. Yeah. It's you're walking through tunnels and it's this little

126
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,560
indoor jungle. And I don't know, it's, it's, it, I could see why this would have lit you up.

127
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,880
This, this seems like a lot. This was fun in and of itself, regardless of the park being open.

128
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,720
Oh yeah. I, this, this is the keystone for my, my obsession, my sickness, because I think like,

129
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,600
I knew there was always a little bit of behind the scenes stuff, but this had

130
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:36,720
original videos and McKets and, and big drawings, the Marvel, a lot of the Marvel concept are,

131
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:43,680
they had the Hill, like, the Greg and Tim Hilda brand, these big sci-fi and comics,

132
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,640
like illustrators, they did a lot of Lord of the ring stuff and a lot of star wars stuff.

133
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,800
Like they did a lot of Marvel's trading cards and covers in the nineties and they had them doing

134
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,200
like the, you know, the promotional art for this. So that was a big deal to go like,

135
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,200
Oh, this is the real deal. They've got these guys doing this.

136
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,040
Oh, sure. Okay. I didn't realize that.

137
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,960
Well, and sort of why we're thinking about this recently is like a video just got posted that

138
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:16,960
pretty well documents. It's a long video that shows you kind of every room in depth. Uh,

139
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,160
because I don't know, I feel like before this, there was maybe a quick video on YouTube where

140
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:28,000
people had pictures, but this, this guy, Dave Cobb, who we just realized is the writer of the M&Ms

141
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,400
movie. He posted a video that he had that's that pretty, it takes you through every, it's,

142
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,880
it's a pretty exhaustive tour of this. So if you want to follow along with that on YouTube,

143
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,440
you know, yeah, we'll put a link up on Twitter. I'll put it in the description and

144
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,240
yeah, it's shockingly thorough. Like I had, I think in the deep back of my mind, I was like,

145
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,480
Oh, maybe preview center episode. And then I like early on, I had that thought maybe,

146
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,800
and then forgot about it. Cause I assumed there was not a lot of documentation, which there really

147
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,640
wasn't. And then like, I saw this video go up and theme park university picked it up too. And it's

148
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,040
like, wow, this is like, there's not a lot of videos of this online. So this is great to have.

149
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:15,200
And he took his time going through. So this is, so the discovery in the video is a second of the top

150
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,640
five moments of your life. Uh, it was very exciting to see all of that, to like relive this and see

151
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:27,440
this all recounted and see also like some very like video wall, like the open, the front room with

152
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:34,800
the giant walls of the CRT TVs showing stuff. This did, I wrote down how this made me miss

153
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:42,240
video walls. Now we can have one giant screen that looks very wonderful, but I really like when it

154
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:49,280
just had to be lots of TVs all stacked up. It feels so cafe eighties, uh, back to the future to

155
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:56,240
terminator two, three D is very video wall. It's an excellent video wall in this. What if rise of

156
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:02,080
the resistance had instead of having that incredible hanger screen was just a bunch of TVs.

157
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:09,200
Just all, all with sort of like a, uh, kind of attitudey video starring Kylo Ren, where he,

158
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,520
like at one point he takes over 50 of the TVs and then it's a bunch of small ones. Yes. Changing

159
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:19,360
all the time. That's when it's like max headroom. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of static, a lot of glitch.

160
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:27,440
Um, I, that's when, when those doors open, I would gasp and the rest of the crowd would be silent.

161
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:35,680
Seems dated. That's the view in this space hanger to each his own. That was a thing that kind of

162
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:42,000
struck me as odd comparing the two star wars rides in the land is like Honda and Chewy, like their

163
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:50,160
screen is kind of CRT like kind of like glitchy and stuff. And then the, the pre show room where

164
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:57,680
Poe Dameron talks to you at rise is so crisp. It's so like clear. They have ex, you know, they,

165
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:04,960
despite being underground rebels, they have very clear video feeds. They have these Samsung curve,

166
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:11,600
the TVs. That's why the rest of it's all just lit up with temporary shitty lighting on wires.

167
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:18,720
They wasted so much money on a 4k resolution. Uh, which brings up a funny thing about this video.

168
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,200
Um, I, I was reading the comments on the video and someone's like, Oh, David, were you working

169
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:30,800
for universal at this point? And he's like, no, I was there for like the AA, a I A A P a conference,

170
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:37,280
an industry conference. Uh, and he would go on to work for universal, but he was just there with

171
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:41,280
someone else who did work for universal. And the very, like within the first minute of the video,

172
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:48,800
you hear someone go, now you have to remember, uh, this, there, this was done for like no money.

173
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,920
So, which I think is also pretty impressive what they did get done for like no money.

174
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,440
Well, I thought, well, yeah, when I, when I heard him say that in the video, I was like,

175
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,560
Oh, is this going to look like shit? And it doesn't look like shit. Yeah. So I was like a

176
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:10,320
really good museum exhibit is what it is. Yeah. Cause like, what, what was the standard for those

177
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,440
preview centers? Look, do they usually throw millions of dollars at them? I don't think so.

178
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:22,160
I mean, this is one of the, there haven't been that many. Yeah. Yeah. Um, we technically saw one

179
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,920
the Epcot. Oh yeah. New Epcot. Um, oh, that's an example of that. That's kind of a pre center.

180
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,480
Nice budgeted thing, but I don't think it's a million dollars. No, no, I don't know. It

181
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,040
doesn't make sense to spend a ton of money. Yeah. Um, I've, I've probably said before, but I'm

182
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,880
obsessed with how Disneyland Paris had one of these, they like built this structure that you

183
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:47,280
have to drive out and go see. And then it was taken over and lived in by French vagrant youths

184
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:54,800
in the years past. It's demise. It just became like a place to skate and do drugs and shit.

185
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:00,560
That would be cool if it was like, like some cool French crime fighting teens, like a Ninja Turtles

186
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,720
took over the subway and Ninja Turtles too. If they took over this preview center and made it

187
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,560
their lair. I like the idea of that happening. You're saying they're heroes. Yeah. Yeah. They

188
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,360
smoke their teens and they smoke, but they also fight injustice just because you're a smoking

189
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:21,680
10 year olds. Doesn't mean you're bad. You could be a good smoke. French police. Uh, another version

190
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:27,600
of a lot of these like preview center type things is now D 23. Sure. Yeah. As they show off, you

191
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,760
know, I saw the star wars galaxy's edge models there and they've shown the ride vehicles and

192
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:38,720
it's all the same preview center type stuff. It's always good when they do these kinds of things.

193
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,960
There's, I think it was not, as long as you're saving some secrets. So you've got the thrill

194
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,080
of like, I'm on rise of the resistance and I don't know what's going to happen. As long as you're,

195
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:51,200
if you're like tantalizing, giving away some stuff, it only helps. It gets Instagram and about it and

196
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:56,880
thinking about it and excited about it ahead of time. Well, and it usually fills an empty space.

197
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:03,200
Like the current Epcot preview center is like the little used old Odyssey restaurant space.

198
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,360
A thrill to be back in the Odyssey. Yeah. They're doing something with it. Yeah.

199
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:13,760
Better than nothing, you know? And this was, was a green screen, like, oh, you can insert yourself

200
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:19,200
in a green screen. Oh, this was the space we sort of hit on it with the star Trek universal stuff

201
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:26,160
where you did little like green screen videos, uh, in the captain's uniforms and stuff. And, uh,

202
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:35,200
yeah. So it took over that and now it is lockers for the mummy. I, I believe that's correct. Uh,

203
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:41,680
yeah. That's the other thing about that. This had like prime real estate in this park. This is next.

204
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,960
It was next to King Kong, like one of the most popular rides in the park. It has a giant, like

205
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:55,680
three story, like vertical billboard outside of like coming suit coming in 1999 specifically

206
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:04,160
1999, a word, a phrase you hear said again and again in this, uh, attraction. Oh yeah. So many

207
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:13,920
characters. The guy from the lost continent Merlin, Merlin, you again in 1999. That is my favorite

208
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:19,760
that they had to make original videos. All of them ending with a character saying, check it out in

209
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:29,360
1999. And we'll set sail for the ultimate voyage. Hey, web heads, come back and check it out in 1999.

210
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:36,080
The cat in the hat says it kind of a weird, like not quite puppet, not quite CG cat, which I kind

211
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:44,720
of was into it. You'll have a time. That's fliggity fine. Just come back in 1999. Um, I like the, I

212
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,600
mean, the Seuss room was the first thing you saw. Well, you saw, no, you saw city walk first. Oh

213
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:56,960
yes. Let's not go past that city walk preview center. There was a preview of city work, which

214
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,960
weirdly the camera tilts up and shows you that they were calling it universals city walk. Yeah.

215
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:10,320
Which is nice and clunky. Yeah. And then it's like, it's this like kooky cutout city scape, uh,

216
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,280
with big logos of the stuff that's going to be there. You know, all our favorites,

217
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:20,320
Bob Marley, a tribute to freedom, which I know that we've all gone and prayed at together.

218
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,680
That's right. Pray for the future freedom in our world. Um, the, the, the hard rock cafe,

219
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:30,000
which they say is going to be the largest hard rock cafe. Uh, but then stuff that I don't think

220
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,120
got built, like there's a, there's a big E logo. I don't think there was an E thing. Was there,

221
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:41,520
well, was that the emeralds? No, I think that was the E network. Oh, you're right. I'm pretty sure.

222
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,160
I don't remember anything happening there. I mean, the most heartbreaking thing that didn't get

223
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,440
built that was definitely mentioned in this preview center in the brochures was Marvel

224
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:57,280
Mania Orlando. And a very specific heart is broken by this. Very specific heart was broken. And I,

225
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:03,680
even if I found an Orlando and former like poster old news story saying like there was supposed to

226
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,800
be a Marvel Mania, but the Marvel bankruptcy killed that project for whatever reason.

227
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:13,360
It must've just been a different legal entity that they got it off the ground in Hollywood.

228
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,520
But see what on the draw, I guess. I don't know. Yeah. That's in this thing though. Yeah. You see

229
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:25,440
Marvel Mania on there. Um, and then one that was like, what the hell is it? This didn't get built.

230
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:35,360
Did it Thelonious Monks Jazz? It's like a, I'm sorry, a Thelonious Monk branded restaurant in

231
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:40,800
Orlando. What are you talking about? There's no Google results for this. That's a very interesting.

232
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:46,000
We need to do some digging on that. Cause I'm interested in that. I'm no big jazz head. Does

233
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:53,040
anyone know it was he alive or dead or I don't know. Is he still alive? I don't know. I don't

234
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:58,640
think he is. No, anything about Thelonious Monk. Well, city wall Hollywood had BB Kings for years.

235
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:05,600
Sure. But he's like a guy who'd be like, you know, in a, in a Coke ad, like isn't Thelonious Monk

236
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:12,880
much more serious? Yeah, sure. He's, he died in 1982. Yeah. Okay. He was 64 years old when he died.

237
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:19,040
Why is he opening an Orlando restaurant in 1999? You know, there's a lot, there's a lot of, uh,

238
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:23,280
you know, talk now, a lot of these movies where it's just basically like you're trying to

239
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,240
make a bunch of money off of an artist's catalog, maybe Freddie Mercury, for example.

240
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,000
That thought is a perfect film. Perfect. I, yeah, that was a bad example. If that was,

241
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
if that was a big, weird mess full of lies, then yes, I could see what you're saying.

242
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,000
There's a Netflix show coming out where Elvis fights crime and John Varvatos does his clothing.

243
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:49,200
Uh, I think maybe this is that this era's version of that. If Netflix had existed,

244
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,840
there would have been a full Thelonious Monk fighting crime show. Cause the audience,

245
00:20:53,840 --> 00:21:03,440
the people in Orlando are dying to go. Yeah. Take photos like next to his suits. Like what

246
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:11,040
the monk stay was trying to cash in on the IP of all of the silverware was made out of ivory from

247
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:17,280
the piano. If he was a piano player, which I do not know. Sorry. Anyone who likes jazz.

248
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,760
Of course, famously a piano player and not another instrument. Yeah, you were right. Okay.

249
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,920
I'll edit out the uncertainty in the post. So it'll sound like you really knew what you're

250
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,080
talking about. None of that in there. Thank you. I mean, I think all those outdoor malls were just

251
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:40,160
reaching for whatever like licensing or next planet Hollywood or like the variety being able

252
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:45,440
to pitch that you have, like look at all this stuff right next to each other seemed as important

253
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,400
as the individual, you know, establishments to me. So they got to reach out to, you know,

254
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:56,000
deep cut music fit. They were going to build a restaurant based on Neil Young's trans album,

255
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:06,160
synth experimental, cafe, frisbee golf, some sort of frisbee golf thing, a cigar city walk.

256
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:13,440
Florida did have a cigar bar for a long time. That was very popular with like people getting

257
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:20,080
off their shift at the parks, going over to the cigar bar. Pleasure Island. Yes. Yeah.

258
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:28,480
I think the funny thing to me, the model of like the city walk in this preview center is like,

259
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:34,960
it's chaotic just like city walk is, but it's a different kind of like, it seems like they were

260
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,520
still nailing down parts of this. It's of the whole preview center. They're like,

261
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:45,760
oh, they're still nailing down what this is. Do you think it's possible that the Thelonious Monk

262
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:51,600
was replaced by Margaritaville? Oh, maybe Buffa was more willing to play ball. Yeah.

263
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,680
And they were like, well, let's get a better musician in here. Let's get a better,

264
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:01,840
well, yeah, yeah, better. I thought we, I, we just all, I didn't hear it at first.

265
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:09,120
Yeah. On a second time. I mean, you watch the watch. Okay. Watch the video of lame old Thelonious

266
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:17,520
Monk playing piano, piano, piano, watch Buffett go from D to A to E and then do it again and again

267
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:24,080
and again and again. He doesn't need a lot of chords or notes. He needs a few and he only needs

268
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:31,040
a song about food. He needs it's the chords. He's not playing. Yes. It's like hundreds and Thelonious

269
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,880
Monk didn't have a song where you would put your two hands together on top of your head to act like

270
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,000
they were fins. He didn't have anything fun like that. Right. No audience participation,

271
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,080
no audience participation in his jazz. Thank God they didn't build this stupid cafe because we,

272
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,440
now you would have left you just to be excited about, I don't know what kind of plane. Did

273
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,200
Thelonious Monk even have a plane? Could there have been a plane outside? I don't think so.

274
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:03,920
Did he loan his plane to another to, you know, count Basie and then it got shot at by a different

275
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:11,120
government? It's possible, but I doubt it. You might not be as excited to see if he had any sort

276
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:17,600
of plane. I'm gonna look up Thelonious Monk plane. Mike's Better was like a good Thelonious Monk song.

277
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,360
You hear it once and it just sounds like standard jazz, but if you go back and really listen,

278
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,320
you're going to appreciate it a lot more the second time through. Absolutely. Yeah, of course.

279
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,440
I don't think he had a plane incident. Well, then he should scarcely, he scarcely deserves

280
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:37,840
a restaurant of his own. I agree. Yeah. You're dead to me Thelonious. Anyway, so then you,

281
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,920
so you're walking around the different lands and you're getting a passport stamped. Yes,

282
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:50,880
this passport, prize possession. I knew I had this somewhere. And I knew on your person at all times.

283
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:57,040
Yes. It's not the bullet once. That was the joke I always said it before. You keep it in your breast

284
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:03,280
pocket. Yeah. Here. Did you guys, so you guys, I am the only one who went to this. No, I didn't.

285
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:07,360
Yeah, I never went. If you want to look at the passport, I mean, it's pretty, it was like a cool

286
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:13,600
free keepsake, but you would get it stamped in each room for the land. I mean, it's just amazing.

287
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,320
It's in amazing shape. But the other thing I'd forgotten was that like kept with it is this

288
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:24,240
opening summer park map that I also was shocked because I have a lot of maps and a lot of them

289
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,640
very beat up, but this is like still in pretty good shape. Everything I have from this era is

290
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:34,960
just like decimated. Yeah. By the end of the day. Yeah. I don't even, yeah, I don't know how these

291
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,960
got out of the park, like and back to Pennsylvania and then to California in such great change. Are

292
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,680
these kiss marks? Are you, have you been kissing? Well, look,

293
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:53,600
I also like the, the preview center logo for islands of adventure is very like dashed out

294
00:25:53,600 --> 00:26:00,560
nineties and like, I think the actual logo, very smoochable. I like the actual islands logo and

295
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:04,800
they haven't, they've never really changed it. Yeah. That's great. I mean, that is such a,

296
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:09,920
yeah, I don't know. I'm trying to think top, I mean, Disneyland logo itself, the classic logo.

297
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:16,720
Great. Yeah. Walt Disney world, classic logo, best, but that is very, that is dated, but also

298
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:24,240
still good. Still good. I do have to say like for as like intense as the marketing was this map cover

299
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:32,400
surprisingly restrained like 1999 standards, surprisingly tasteful. That looks, yeah, a little

300
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,680
bit too boring for, for how exciting of a place it was. That looks like a map, but you would find it

301
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:44,080
like a hotel at the Wisconsin Dells for one of the like weird roadside attraction type things

302
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:50,880
you would do there. Yes. I mean, you have some touch it. There's like a heartbeat monitor, like

303
00:26:50,880 --> 00:27:00,960
squiggle very like light along the side islands of adventure. There is like, it says prepare for

304
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,920
departure in a real like music video. Prepare for departure from this life.

305
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,120
Now you, you, this may be forthcoming. I don't mean to jump around too much,

306
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,480
but as I'm flipping through this, cause I'm like, is there anything that didn't get built?

307
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:23,440
And what I'm staring at is the phrase X-Men adventure. Okay. So now that in the map,

308
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:32,000
in very plain black font, it does have times for X-Men. So I think X-Men were relegated to

309
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,880
the street show if memory serves. So that's what X-Men adventure means is that they all come out

310
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:42,720
on mopeds while rock music plays. Do we know that for sure? I mean, there was much more of a show

311
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:48,640
where the X-Men would fight like Magneto in the street when it first opened. So I believe-

312
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,920
Never a big X-Men ride planned, right?

313
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:58,880
Yeah. No, I think the ages like of the people building this, like once I did them of like,

314
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:04,080
well, they would have been in like their thirties to fifties and you got to think about like,

315
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,160
they want to get an international audience. It does make sense. Like, oh, Spider-Man and the

316
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:15,040
Hulk are probably the most easily recognizable of the Marvel characters, but it has always like

317
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:21,040
bugged me that islands opening in 1999 did not have more X-Men because they were just so huge

318
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:26,960
in the nineties. Yeah, it's crazy. I'm looking at the pamphlet. Of course there he is a very

319
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:33,120
young Jimmy Buffett on the page. Yeah. Under the above the phrase, get a nightlife. That's right.

320
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:42,320
Next to next to some ribs and French fries next to Emeril. And then under Jimmy Buffett is Bob

321
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:51,280
Marley. So two great artists. Did I tell you that I discovered an episode of Diners, Drive-Ins and

322
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:58,080
Dives that includes where Guy hangs out with both Sammy Hagar and Mick Fleetwood?

323
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,760
I've seen that one. Would you believe it? All the friends. Is it all in Hawaii?

324
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,600
Cause isn't Mick Fleetwood's restaurant in Hawaii? He has a restaurant. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

325
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:14,960
Um, just the most understandable pairing. And it's funny, like watching, uh, you know, Guy talk to

326
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,680
some chef who's like not quite of his world and, you know, trees trying to inject his attitude.

327
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:24,000
And then Guy and Sammy are just like, it's like they're brothers. It's like they grew up together.

328
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,960
Yeah. Like they speak a twin language and could just do it for like, Hey, it sounds good to me,

329
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,280
brother. All right. Well, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, make sure that one of the rest, let her talk.

330
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:42,880
Uh, old time wrestler talk. Uh, have you seen the clip where Sylvester Stallone brings Al Pacino

331
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:49,680
to meet Guy Fieri and his own Guy Fieri in his own home? Yeah. I've seen it. Okay. You've not seen

332
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:55,280
this. Oh, it's really special. Yeah. And then for Pacino and Guy Fieri meet. Have you watched live

333
00:29:55,280 --> 00:30:00,640
from Darrell's house as well? Have you seen that? Yes. Yeah. Which one? The one with Hagar? No,

334
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:06,720
I've not seen the one with Hagar. Is he a Hawaii guy? I think maybe a waiter or am I? No, no,

335
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,320
Darrell doesn't do it from though. He's like in the middle of the country somewhere. I don't know

336
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,800
where that show to I've seen the John Resnick from Johnny Resnick from Google dolls episode.

337
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:20,720
It's been folds episode where Darrell, I should say this from Hall and Oats, Darrell Hall. Yes.

338
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,080
Has a thing where he brings musicians in. Anyway, that'll be a second gate.

339
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:29,920
Live at Darrell's house. I'm a fan of the show. I don't know why it's no, no, no, it's, uh,

340
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:37,120
it's theme park related. Um, all right here now. Now I have get a light, get a nightlife. Yeah.

341
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:43,120
Yeah. Take a look at the map. I mean, 1999 it's very funny to see like the, the labels for where

342
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:48,880
the, all the telephones are and the little like, uh, on the information page, like here's where to

343
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:56,240
buy international phone cards. Uh, fun look back to the past. Uh, it's like, there's like 19 smoking

344
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:03,360
areas. There's 19 smoking areas. There's smoke areas on the rides. Um, it also has the, um,

345
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:08,240
of course opening summer of the brand new theme park. That's where the nighttime show really like

346
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:16,880
there was a nine 45 nighttime show. And that map also has the, uh, short lived Island skipper, uh,

347
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:22,720
adventures, I believe is the term, but it's the boat that would connect port of entry straight

348
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:29,120
across to the, uh, water. You would get on the boat and get off at the Jurassic park,

349
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:34,720
like the giant visitor center, which was so cool. Cause he would feel like you were coming into

350
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,920
Jurassic park like, like some of the people in the films and the boats were all like junk boats.

351
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:46,000
They all looked like they were salvaged and, uh, yeah, it was really neat. I mean, lost continent

352
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,800
and port of the whole park in general, I think is like that for universal and animal kingdom

353
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:59,600
for Disney were the road maps for like what 20th 21st century parks and lands would be like just

354
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:07,120
very detail rich, very intensive, but like, I think universal after islands open kind of took a step

355
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:13,600
back one because the numbers weren't quite what they were hoping for when this park opened.

356
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:18,880
And then two, there was a big tourism downturn after nine 11, but they also had like, as they

357
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:24,320
were building Island adventure, they were owned by Seagrams and then they were owned by Vivendi

358
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:31,120
and then they were owned by general electric and then Comcast. So they had a lot of changes in

359
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:36,400
ownership. Yeah. Yeah. I, you know, I forgive me as you said the phrase September 11th,

360
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,320
and I'm looking at a picture of Jimmy Buffett. It occurs to me that that September, the events of

361
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:49,360
September 11th were truly a mistake. Maybe the ultimate mistake. I would say, well, I mean,

362
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,120
the discussion I'm thinking we're about to start is probably not going to go anywhere.

363
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:58,480
We don't have to have one. I'm just saying there was a plane involved and I, I will go on record

364
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,360
as saying, I think it was a mistake. Okay. Well that's on record now. That's right. And

365
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:08,000
the question, my thoughts on this, write it down in the Wiki and the podcast, the right Wiki,

366
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:14,720
down in the Wiki. I was going to say, I mean, as a kid, I may ask you, Jason,

367
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,920
Yeah. I think we've talked a little bit about this, but it's been a while. When you went into

368
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:28,320
the Toon Lagoon room, were you thrilled? I was excited. I read the, I loved Rockin' Bowinkle.

369
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,480
Nickelodeon had the Rockin' Bowinkle license for a while. Right. And they would air it.

370
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:37,680
It was one of the things they'd air on Nick and Nick at night. So I watched a lot of it. And then

371
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,720
I would read the funnies every Sunday. So I was happy to see all the King features friends and

372
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:52,960
all the Jay Ward pals. The phrase no one's ever used, the King features friends. I mean, look,

373
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:58,720
that should be a show. Kathy's ice cream parlor, like that's in, that's, you know, still there,

374
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:05,680
still going strong. Well, I guess was that a normal, I mean, I also liked the King's features

375
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:09,760
friends, but I didn't know they were that called that at the time. They were that close. I didn't

376
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,680
know they were that close either, but I was excited too, because I think it was like,

377
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:19,520
is it just our parents were so used to reading the comic strips that they gave that to us?

378
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:25,200
I mean, the one too, I just liked any, anything in comics form. Like I was a sucker for like the

379
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:30,800
comic book Bible. If you remember that, like we would get like snippets of it at church and they

380
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,200
would sell it on infomercial, like anything in comic book form. It was the Bible in comic book

381
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:42,560
form. Yeah. I think it was like Archie Goodwin did it like a big like name, uh, did it. Um,

382
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:48,480
but to have a land to have like Marvel bleed into like Sunday funnies and rock and bow and go,

383
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:53,760
uh, delightful Dr. Seuss on the other side. I mean, everyone liked, I wasn't really thinking

384
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:59,760
about Dr. Seuss that much when I was like 12, 13, but still like, Oh, nice to see the gang is all

385
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:06,160
here. A very good, like a property for a theme park to grab. Yeah, very good. And they,

386
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,840
the stories of that, they had to work like they had to work. It sounded like they had to work as

387
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:18,880
hard to like sell the guys, a widow, uh, as they did for like JK Rowling. Like they had to like

388
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:23,840
have their ducks in a row to go in with that. The saving Mr. Banks is what it was. It was,

389
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:29,120
yeah, it was just like real life. And in the end of the movie, she loved it.

390
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:36,000
She loved what they did. And I mean, the cat in the hat movie. I think we've touched on it a little,

391
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,040
but like the saving Mr. Banks with the cat in the hat movie where then she's at the premiere and

392
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:48,080
like, it's a masterpiece. Yes. They tried that. They tried cause Spielberg consulted on all this.

393
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:53,120
So they're like, Steven, can you talk to Mrs. Geisel? And like, that didn't work. Like they had

394
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:59,120
to get to the book agent first and pitch to her and get the book agent on board to pitch to

395
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:06,160
uh, uh, Mrs. Geisel. So like, and also this is all happening after the cartoon world,

396
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:12,160
the Warner Brothers, like cartoon world project falls apart. And so it's just kind of like,

397
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:19,600
well, they had cat in the hat, they own Jurassic park, uh, DC's out, but they can get the Marvel

398
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:25,840
characters for a song cause they're about to go bankrupt. And then for a song, that's an

399
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:29,520
old timey expression. I was going to say, that was my guess is that you had a very old timey

400
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:35,040
phrase in your head. I, we're talking about rocket bowing, going King features. Can you blame me?

401
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,240
He was starting to go like sort of regress back to the time period in which he was born

402
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:45,120
and which he was truly like part of early 1920s. You're describing being an early

403
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:49,200
teen and being excited, walking into a room that had a big display of Lil Abner in it.

404
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,840
That's right. Yes. Little Abner, Beatle Bailey, you know, really, uh,

405
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,560
he didn't like Beatle Bailey a little too, uh, counterculture.

406
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,680
It's my friends from gasoline alley.

407
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,240
Jeffy, of course. Scott's friend, Jeffy. I do love Jeffy. Oh Jeffy. Sure.

408
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:14,000
From family circus. I'll follow that line. Anyway. Um, yeah. So, uh, I don't know what else,

409
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,760
do we jump around from room to room? Uh, we don't have to have any logic in how we move through this

410
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:28,000
space. I already jumped to Toon Lagoon. I mean, Dr. Seuss was the first room then lost continent,

411
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,880
lost continent. Someone actually on Twitter, you know, asked about dueling dragons lately and

412
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:38,080
they're like, yeah, it is interesting how like a bunch of people who had either been let go or

413
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:46,080
left Disney went on to work on this mythical, uh, part of a park after they had not done anything

414
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:51,600
with their ideas for a mythical part of animal kingdom. It's kind of the theory. Yeah. Yeah.

415
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:56,400
With the animal kingdom logo, which still has mythical creatures in it that aren't represented

416
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,080
anywhere in the public. Yeah. That's the kind of the theory that a lot of that just moved to

417
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:06,240
universal. It is, uh, just from hearing like stray stories here and there, it does seem like the

418
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:12,560
amount of this type of thing that happens, uh, is if it happens frequently is really what I'm saying.

419
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:20,080
And maybe like not documented or like you can't really be on record trashing somebody for bringing

420
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:24,560
an idea from one place to another. Yeah. Yeah. Cause it might happen all the time, but I think,

421
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:30,480
yeah, probably there's gotta be many instances of it. Yeah. I mean, I know it happens in the

422
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,800
comics world. It certainly happens in the wrestling world. Like people just jump from thing to thing

423
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:41,040
or like just steal ideas. Well, yeah. I mean, there's like, you know, it's ants and a bug's

424
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,840
life. It's stuff like that even sometimes too, where it's like, we're just, we're the, we got

425
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:52,160
to beat the other people. We stole this podcast from three other guys. Yeah. Yeah. There's was,

426
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:57,840
there's was called podcast escape. Yeah. And we punched it up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just made it a

427
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:02,160
little more relatable. And then punched them in the face and told them to stay out of podcasting.

428
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,400
You've never heard of them. Yep. Since they're trying still. Mission accomplished. Yeah. Yeah.

429
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:13,280
But we're using certain ways to stifle their promotion. Yeah. And we have a copy of it. No

430
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:18,160
podcast can have the word podcast as the first word ever. I guess if you see one again,

431
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:24,880
report that to us, we got the, we got Paris Hilton's lawyer that did the, it's hot trademark.

432
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,520
So we've been busy. I mean, we also have filed suit against anyone who just calls us the ride.

433
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:37,520
Like scenes to misunderstand all the time. And like, haha, it's a funny misunderstanding. No,

434
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:42,400
it's not. It's not fucking funny. We're branded a certain way for, for a certain reason. So yeah.

435
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:51,680
Yeah. Yeah. Learn the name. Um, this, I have the lost continent area. I like that. I think this is

436
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:57,760
my favorite part of it. And the most like 1997 part of it, does you kind of go into this gate that

437
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:05,520
has two illustrated dragons. It looks like a, I was like, if, if there was like a laser tag that

438
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:13,920
was sort of like a generic attempts to be a, a magic, the gathering themed experience, um,

439
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,240
it just, or it looks like I like a really good setup at like a, like a book fair or something.

440
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:26,000
I hate the vibe of this was just so odd and, and, but fun and like a mini golf. Yes. Yeah.

441
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,160
Very good mini golf. Like painted flats. I mean, it's mostly painted flats. There's a bubbling

442
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:35,440
cauldron. Got to give them credit for the cauldron. Green water. Yeah. There's like

443
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:42,480
stars in the sky. Uh huh. Yeah. And then, and then I mean, my, you know, post fries, as you know,

444
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:49,040
my greatest love, an odd video that only plays in one location where a man, where a man talks to you.

445
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:53,280
And in this case, I, I, the way the video is edited, he's talking for a while and I was like,

446
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,960
who is this? And then until it loops around like the adventures of many who you've heard of, uh,

447
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,760
Poseidon and, and myself, Merlin,

448
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:02,960
Merlin.

449
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:09,360
Merlin would immediately like, they could not have gotten the bulldozers going soon.

450
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,160
Like as soon as they had the Harry Potter license, like Merlin woods gone, you're out.

451
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,120
After that video I hosted for you. Yeah. This whole section. I did the,

452
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:23,680
I did the preview center thing for free. What was there a walk around Merlin?

453
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:29,040
I believe so. There probably was a whole side. I mean, it was divided up into like

454
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:35,920
Atlantis kind of Greek, Greek stuff. And then Merlin and Merlin sort of,

455
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:42,480
and of course Merlin had a presence at city walk Los Angeles in the three story restaurant bar

456
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:47,920
wizards. Yeah. Long partnership between universal and Merlin. Sure. They've ended it,

457
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:53,600
which is unfortunate. That's yeah. After all, after decades and decades of partnership, uh,

458
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:57,840
yeah, it's just throw them to the street. Cause the Harry Potter, some new jackass kid shows

459
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,880
all these other wizards. He's the original wizard. He does back of the house at mythos.

460
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:08,000
Now he does payroll for methods. So sad, but it's so fast for him. Cause he just waves his

461
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:14,560
hands around and then numbers fall into place. Try to have a wizard to your taxes. It's the job

462
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:18,960
to anything. Very easy. Yeah. Pretty detailed concepts are from like a lost continent. I've

463
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:24,480
heard like alternately, like people going, this was the most fun to work on because we had no,

464
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:30,240
we didn't have to stay glued to any intellectual property. But then people also being like,

465
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:35,360
we ran out of money. We couldn't license anything else. Mythic characters are in the public domain.

466
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:41,200
And I'm sure it was like a little bit of both because mythos is very big Poseidon's fury has

467
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:48,320
that massive facade. Like, yeah, you just go, yeah. Is it, I'm trying to think other of major theme

468
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:54,880
park lands. Is this the last like kind of semi original land? Am I wrong? Is there Cal,

469
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:01,680
I guess California adventure? Disney sea. Yeah, that's true. You're right. You've guys been to

470
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:06,480
Disney sea. I've only seen the pictures, but port of entry and lost continent. It does feel like

471
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:14,080
there is some DNA to Disney. What would become Disney sea. Right. Yeah. Um, well the new epic

472
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:18,640
universe, whatever, is that what it's called? I always forget for universal in a couple of years,

473
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:24,320
I guess the monsters land that is pretty much confirmed now, unless they stop building will be

474
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:29,600
the closest like to them getting like some room to breathe. I mean, it is still IP though, but it

475
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:34,400
feels like that's not so tied to like, no one's going to be mad if it, excuse me. No one's going

476
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:40,720
to be mad if it doesn't like follow the original Frankenstein movie to a T or something. Yeah, for

477
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:45,680
sure. Yeah. Yeah. That is very islands of adventure that you're at, like a sort of original.

478
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:52,240
Yeah. It's the closest they can do in 2023 whenever it opens still a property, but not a

479
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:57,040
property from the last 20 years, which is refreshing. Yes. Very. I mean, that's the most

480
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:02,240
exciting part to me of that park. Have you seen the rumor of what that ride system is at the,

481
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:07,040
for the Frankenstein castle? Nope. Is it the move, the room, the elevator kind of room?

482
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:11,280
No, sort of supposedly. So there's going to be real quick. Epic universe is going to have a

483
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,400
couple of lands, Nintendo training, how to train your dragon, Harry Potter, but there's going to

484
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:20,400
have a horror section that's like Frankenstein's castle in town. And it's going to be like spooky.

485
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:25,840
And supposedly the ride is Frankenstein's castle. And it's going to have all the monsters in it.

486
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:32,560
It's like an AA, uh, animate audio animatronic ride with a cook arm, but the new version of the

487
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:38,800
cook arm that's essentially on a roller coaster track. So it's like, I think the cook arm

488
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:45,680
and Harry Potter has to just sort of go on a flat circle. This one can go up and down on a roller

489
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:51,520
coaster track. So you can like, you can do the same stuff Harry Potter, uh, forbidden journey does,

490
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:57,120
but you can also send people hurtling down on roller coaster, like drops and stuff.

491
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,840
So like that's the idea. I think is it's going to be like some crazy e-ticket

492
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:07,200
with all the monsters, which sounds awesome. Anyway, since you bring up that third park,

493
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:12,160
one of the things I came across, like reading about the, the, you know, this preview center

494
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:17,760
and the Genesis of islands of adventure, they had big plan. I mean, the plans were to keep moving

495
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:22,880
like every eight years or so they were going to first off when they're like, of course we're

496
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:29,520
opening islands of adventure and city walk and our first hotel and soon five hotels. It took them

497
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:35,840
years and years to get five hotels open. These third park was slated to open. They were eyeing

498
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:44,400
2007 on that Lockheed, that land they bought from Lockheed Martin sold and then bought a chunk of

499
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:52,880
it back. I believe like they, they had plans, unfortunately, uh, corporate being sold so many

500
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:58,960
times, uh, international events and then just the, the blunder of the marketing.

501
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:04,800
Also this, I was just going to say this stuff, all like world events, they get grand plans. So I'm

502
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,280
like still stressed that they're going to even build this park. Cause I heard Jim Hill was saying

503
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:15,600
that the cost of Chinese steel has skyrocketed and it's an issue now building new big crazy theme

504
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:20,000
park things. I think they've already broken ground though. They ha well they have, but like,

505
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:26,160
apparently it's a scale budget wise. Oh, I see. Budget wise. They only budgeted so much money

506
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:31,840
for the steel and now the steel is more expensive. The marketing guy who apparently came up with the,

507
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:40,480
um, cumbersome universal studios escape branding had the cumbersome name of Edgar Bronfman jr.

508
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:46,720
Well, Bronfman is yeah. Wait, that's like a, isn't that who owned Seagrams or something? I think so.

509
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:53,440
Yeah. I think he was like pretty involved. The son of, I don't know. That name is familiar.

510
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:59,360
But back to the previous, to the lost continent stuff, there's some like good little props and

511
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:05,280
like cool, uh, three dimensional, like scary, what do you call them? Like stone?

512
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:11,200
Gargoyles. Like this is really what they are. And that video is so good. This Merlin video

513
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:17,760
is filmed so close. Yes. Very close. Not be closer to him. I wrote down a couple parts. I like he,

514
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:23,760
his description of the mythos restaurant, which if you don't recall is the restaurant inside the fake

515
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:30,720
rocks. It was in the fake rock final four. Uh, he's that place where ancient mystics and philosophers

516
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:39,760
gather and also mythos sells food. It's very funny. Food. So fine. It rivals the nectar of the gods.

517
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:45,200
I got a cheeseburger there. I pretty good lay out like how it's just good.

518
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:50,880
Definitely. I don't know what God necked your tastes like. So I can't really compare it tastes

519
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:58,640
like a cheeseburger. You know, like a, like an okay cheese, like a fine cheeseburger, not even a good

520
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:03,760
one. I find one, but God still have to hire, you know, just day to day chefs. Like it's not just

521
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:09,520
magic making this stuff. Yeah. So you don't understand getting defensive. I'm sorry. They're

522
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:14,960
following a manual, you know? Um, I, he said also something about when did the time when dragons

523
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:21,840
belched fire belt, yeah, like that a lot. That is good. You would, yeah, you would think it would

524
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:29,120
be less gross, but that's how we said it. Um, yeah, I want more Merlin's content in general.

525
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:35,680
I am interested. I need to look into more of what Merlin was, was doing before they leveled that

526
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:43,840
place. Yeah, I haven't, I wouldn't go back to that like end that often. It's, it's, yeah, it's a sort

527
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:48,960
of a, like a tune town. Cause I only went, wow, I guess I went one, I went right when it opened,

528
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:54,080
but I don't recall that section very well. I think I was so obsessed with Marvel and, uh,

529
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:59,120
Beatle Bailey that I couldn't get to, uh, the lost continent too much. So I don't have much

530
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:03,600
of recollection there. A lot of lost continent has not, for as much as universal loves to bulldoze

531
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:08,800
or history, much of islands of adventure preserved. Right. Yes. For better or ill.

532
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:13,280
Which is, which is crazy because you would think that the tomb lagoon would be gone.

533
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:18,880
Yeah. But I think actually what happened is they got so ambitious in the last couple of years,

534
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:24,640
that's what saved everything. Cause the third park was on the table versus this. Cause at first you

535
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:28,640
would think they would have just like, well, let's gut half of islands of adventure and put new stuff

536
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:33,280
in. But I think they got very ambitious with their plan to take Disney head on again.

537
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:40,160
I think that's right. Yeah. I mean, their thinking was with islands of adventure is like,

538
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:46,960
now they're thinking is like, let's get people to set universal as where they stay as like their

539
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:52,000
base when they come here. At the time in the late nineties, they were like, we just need to shave.

540
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,400
We just want to shave another day off people's Disney. Like we just need a little, we just need

541
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:02,000
to shave a little more. Maybe they would stay here for a night or two, but we just need like,

542
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,760
they kept seeing the phrase like we just need to shave off some of the Disney money.

543
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:10,400
It's a major victory. If they can, I'm certainly thinking about it. Next time I go, I like you to,

544
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:15,360
maybe you just like, you just lift into specific Disney parks and then Lee is a poke. Cause already

545
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:20,960
you're like so spread out around there. So staying on property doesn't necessarily do a ton for you.

546
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,640
Yeah. To being at a universal hotel where you're, you're kind of right there. You're right in the

547
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:31,040
action. That's right. You don't need to escape. Yeah. Cause yeah, so that's, yeah, supposedly

548
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:35,360
that's what, what's the hotel that they're going to charge? This is all Jim Hill information credit

549
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:40,880
to Mr. Jim Hill. What's the endless summer? Is that the one that's going to be like $99 a night?

550
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,920
Half of it's already open. The other half's opening. The idea is to like undercharge people

551
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:51,840
for years just to like reset their vacation clock or vacation brain to be like, well,

552
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,320
we may as well just stay universal and go to Disney for a couple of days.

553
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:59,520
Boy, if that, I don't know, I could see it. That's what they're trying. I mean,

554
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:04,880
if it's three parks and then a water park and a bunch of hotels, yeah. And you go, well,

555
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,680
I guess we'll just go there and then we could go to Disney for a couple of days.

556
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:13,360
Certainly my verdict from our recent trip, the best like day theme park wise definitely was

557
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:18,000
the universal. There's a lot of pack. It's a lot of stuff. I mean, they're packed next to each other.

558
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,800
So it's like you get all your, there's a lot of hits in that. You end up feeling like over

559
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:29,120
way into a lot more like let's park cop Disneyland and California adventure. Yes, for sure.

560
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:34,560
You're not like wasting much time, you know, on transit, although that's not a waste of time to

561
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:40,480
Jason, but you're desiring to be on a bus for. Well, but in terms of accommodations, like the

562
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:47,600
highlight of pop century was the skyliner. The room was very practical. But Cabana Bay,

563
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:52,800
I just found to be such a pleasant hotel and that that is like, they're like value,

564
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,560
one of their value ones. It's styling. The theming is good. The theming is really,

565
00:51:56,560 --> 00:52:01,840
yeah. Everything was very nice there. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, if Disney could sky, if they get,

566
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:06,800
if everything's connected by skyliner and it's like insanely fast now to get everywhere,

567
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:13,360
you can see how that would really improve your overall stay. Yeah. Yeah. But it is still can be

568
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:18,880
a bit of a pain to get from place to place. It's things are still at stake. Definitely. They can

569
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:24,160
absolutely. I think universal could, could become, I think there's still like a decade away or more,

570
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:29,200
but I think they could become the standard bearer. They're still in the thinking of like,

571
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:35,280
let's go hard. I wouldn't be surprised if they were thinking like fourth park by the end of

572
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:41,120
this decade. I mean, I wouldn't be, I mean, like if it's, if they're opening this in 2023,

573
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:48,480
they could go like do more hotels and then another park. Just the room is the issue. Do they have

574
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:53,200
another like expansion? Like another question. I don't know if they, I don't know if they've

575
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:57,920
marked any place, but I think they have land around. This is also, as we say, like, well,

576
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:02,320
everything's all tied together at universal. That third park's going to be down the highway.

577
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:07,920
That is a bit of a bummer. They have to figure that out. But they have talked,

578
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,640
Jim has alluded to, like, they were considering alternative transportation methods, be that some

579
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:19,680
sort of monorail, some sort of gondola system firing you from a cannon. I, I would love to be,

580
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:25,040
yeah. And there's trains coming, Virgin trains going right to, do you know about this? There's

581
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:32,480
a privately owned the Virgin train line in South Florida. Oh, and, and they are building, like,

582
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:40,080
they are working out the kinks to like build a station from Disney to Disney World. So you could

583
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:46,720
do a day trip to Disney World on like a super fast train from like Miami or whatever. Would there be

584
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:52,160
an airport stop or no? I believe that's in the works. Yeah. Cause it would be like, it's even,

585
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:58,240
it would be even quicker to get like maybe what? 10 minutes, five, like less like a straight shot

586
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:02,000
to Disney from the airport. Geez. Wow. Yeah. But I don't know if you,

587
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:08,400
I'm sure they're lobbying. So there's no universal stop. I'm sure. Straight to the heart of. Well,

588
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:14,400
no, wait, because. Oh, I may be wrong. Epic Universe is across from the, the Orlando Convention

589
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:20,000
Center. Oh, okay. So they are lobbying to get a stop as well. Okay. Cause of that. For that new park.

590
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:25,360
Yeah. But that has to be part of it where Disney's trying to stop that. I think the convention is,

591
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:30,480
so I think the convention business is so big. They have to. They have to. Yeah.

592
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:38,480
Interesting. Not perfect. Uh, 1990s era Marvel. Really that room is interesting. That room looks

593
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:45,760
like a carnival. Yeah. Like. Little underwhelming. Very black lady. Yeah. That has an interesting

594
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:53,520
original video where they like, there's a Spider-Man wandering around. I think we could have with the

595
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:59,040
resources at our disposal, we could easily replicate that Spider-Man video. Yes. Oh yeah.

596
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:03,520
In an apartment or a hallway anywhere. But I kind of liked it though. I liked it. It's a little like,

597
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:10,320
like sixties Batman. It was kind of fun and cheapo. It's the guy who I forget the guy's name. He's

598
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:14,800
Greg in the Brady Munch movie. He does a Spider-Man's voice on the cartoon and is doing the voice here.

599
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:22,800
He's cause he's also Prince Eric, I believe. Is he? I think so. It's Christopher something or other.

600
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:29,520
I haven't looked that up. Yeah. Yeah. And he's doing the, I assume he's not under the mask.

601
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:35,040
Uh huh. But maybe I'm wrong. Cause he was Spider-Man in other stuff too. He was Spider-Man in the cartoon

602
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:40,320
in the early nineties or 94. I guess it's not the early. I think I have that in my head that he's also

603
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:47,440
Prince Eric, but I don't quite agree. Uh, Christopher. Yeah. Christopher. No, now I'm going to an ad.

604
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:54,080
Christopher Daniel Barnes. Sir. He is. He is Eric. Yes. Prince Eric. Correct. It's weird that we don't

605
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:58,960
all, that's a pretty major character. That's interesting. That we don't know the name of that guy

606
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:05,040
or that he's Greg from the Brady Munch. And he's good in the movie. I don't think. Spider-Man.

607
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:10,640
The voice actors, besides like, you know, the stuff, it's like Jerry Orbach and Angela Lansbury,

608
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:16,080
like the big names. I feel like the voice actors really did not get a lot of credit in that like

609
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:22,480
second golden age of Disney movies. Not quite enough. Yeah. It becomes more famous people. Yeah.

610
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:29,280
Hey, Scott Weinger, uh, did a great job. Full House is Scott Weinger. He's very good. Isn't that's,

611
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:35,520
that's an underrated performance in general. Yeah. Um, Oh, it looks like he Christopher Daniel Barnes

612
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:41,440
has been electro lately in Spider-Man media. Oh, how about that? Marvel media, Spider-Man's villain

613
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:48,400
Electro. Um, the, the video in the Marvel area uses that if this effect was very popular in 90s

614
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:52,720
promotional comic stuff where it's like the characters are coming off the cover,

615
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:57,280
like they have clearly just peeled it off. My favorite detail of that is they have like kind

616
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:03,440
of a montage of covers and the X-Men cover you can clearly see as the cover to the Marvel index to

617
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:09,280
the X-Men, which were just informational booklets. Like they were sized like comic books and you'd

618
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:14,720
open it up and it was just like an occasional drawing with a lot of very dry text recounting

619
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:21,440
events. Your favorite characters from your favorite indexes will come to life. Indexes,

620
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:28,320
handbooks, like, oh man. The unofficial, the official handbook of the Marvel universe.

621
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:33,200
I have a couple of those collected and all it is is just shows you the character and then what's

622
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:37,520
their name and what's their like powers and stuff. And it's just like a list. It's like a dossier

623
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:42,480
that you would get for whatever reason. I loved those as a kid. Yeah. Sure. Getting to see like,

624
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:46,960
well, this, okay, this is what their powers. That's like, that's liking Disney annual reports.

625
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:52,320
Just like any, it's in my house and there's a picture of a character I like. Yeah. And this

626
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:58,480
would be like, okay, her power is shooting fire and this person's power is shooting water. Just

627
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:04,000
hope you learn it's flashcards. Yeah. It felt, yeah, it felt academic. It felt like you were

628
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,520
learning something. I select that up on the walls in this place that there's

629
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:13,680
these characters and then kind of the, you know, the, the sixties Batman action words

630
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:24,960
and the specific ones are crack KRAK and Krong. That feels like DC had copyrighted all of the

631
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:31,520
basics. Right. The way I'm in Biff and all that's left. This is like the, this, this is like quibi,

632
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:37,120
like looking for what nonsense words aren't already purchased as dot coms yet. What we got

633
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:42,320
crack and we got Krong. What's weird is they didn't use any of the very Marvel specific

634
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:48,960
ones like BAMF B A M F, which is what happens when night crawler teleports and there's a puff of

635
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:56,400
smoke. It's BAMF. Yeah. Spider-Man with his webs is thwip, thwip, T H W I P. And then Wolverine,

636
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:04,480
when he uncheats his claws from his hands is snicked. Yeah. S N I K T. Yeah. So it's weird

637
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:08,480
that they didn't have those. They didn't have any of the Marvel ones in there. This, yeah, there is

638
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:16,560
famous Marvel onomatopoeia. So why not use it? That's very, those are all very good. They actually,

639
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:22,080
they do all describe the sound really well. Yeah. BAMF is my favorite, I think. BAMF. Yeah. BAMF.

640
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:25,840
Is there anyone else? Did I miss any of those are the main three? Those are the big ones. I think

641
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:32,240
somebody has another one. BAMF sounds like some nightmare convention that like Donald Trump Jr.

642
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:39,440
would speak at. Yeah. Donald Trump Jr. half of shark tank. Um, the impractical jokers and the

643
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:46,320
piano guys are there because they're not partisan. Yeah. Okay. Our opinion. Yeah. We'll just say,

644
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:53,040
you know, you convince us. We like all sides. We're open minded. That's what we're. In terms of like,

645
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:58,880
not built stuff, probably the biggest, the biggest piece of concept stuff in this Marvel area,

646
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:05,600
these crazy 3d glasses, these crazy like headsets. Like this is what you would wear. Like an orgasm.

647
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:11,600
He's having lawnmower man sex. He's plugged in. Yeah. We'll post the,

648
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:18,320
take a screenshot of that just so we can remember. Oh, I'm looking at Doc Oxlare. Oh,

649
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:25,920
visor, very big character design in comics in the nineties, these kinds of visor head things,

650
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:31,360
not dissimilar to some of the augmented reality patents we've seen the last couple of years.

651
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:38,400
There was another, oh, in, in Dr. Seuss, this crazy like little tower. Yeah, that's fine. That was

652
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:42,720
just purely, it seemed like it was placemaking. I don't know that that ever got built. The concept

653
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:46,160
art of that Dr. Seuss stuff looks a little sadder than what they built.

654
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:54,400
Yeah. Like scary. Yeah. Like I guess maybe the colors aren't as bright ruins. Yes. Yeah. This

655
01:00:54,400 --> 01:01:00,880
is where the lost Dr. Seuss civilization. Well, the Zachs, the Zachs refuse to get out of each

656
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:06,400
other's way. So civilization fell apart as a, yeah, it remains stubborn. It may happen to us.

657
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:12,720
It may happen to us. We don't know what has happened when this comes out. We have learned

658
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:16,960
nothing. This is out, making everybody worried. I guess you're right. We shouldn't stress everyone

659
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:21,920
out. The, the Marvel concepts are much more ambitious. Like the roller coaster going through

660
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:28,080
Dr. Doon's Fearfall. Yeah, that's would have been fantastic. Yeah. That sort of more idealized

661
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:33,920
version of it. It's funny. Yeah. Sorry. No, no, no, go ahead. I wouldn't make a great point or

662
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:37,360
anything. I, it's just funny when I was, when, when I was there when I was a kid,

663
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:44,320
I wasn't even really like, I was like in unconsciously upset that the Hulk wasn't a real,

664
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:48,560
we talked about this in the Hulk episode, like there was no actual robot Hulk on it, but

665
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:52,800
like in hindsight, it's so clear, like, well, they had money for one cool ride and then the

666
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:58,640
others are just like roller coaster in a drop. But in that art, you just, I like, you get fooled by

667
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:03,680
that art because you're like, holy shit, Dr. Doom. Yeah. Yeah. But especially like, yeah, when you're

668
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:10,720
kid. Well, and I had mostly like the Dr. Doom ride had not been super long. Anytime I've been in the

669
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:14,800
last few years, the wait is not long enough that you have to wrap through the whole queue, but it

670
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:18,400
was open last time we were there. So I was like, Oh, let me just take the main way through instead

671
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:23,600
of single rider. And it is very elaborate. There's a lot of Doom bots everywhere. There's original,

672
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:30,720
there's all the cartoon stuff going. It's like, looks like a dungeon, like a Latvarian dungeon,

673
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:37,520
you know? So like, again, little bits of details here and there, but like the, the promise that

674
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:44,480
you would see in like the Wizarding World of Harry Potter or Galaxy's Edge or Pandora was still a long

675
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:51,200
time off. Yeah. You were saying the fully, fully realized version in our heads was still a ways away

676
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:56,640
for something. The budget of this park was a billion dollars. Sure. And that is how much they

677
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:02,080
spent to build two rise of the resistances. Supposedly. I mean, it might be more honestly,

678
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:07,840
probably more because they had like delays in construction issues and big delays. Yeah. So yeah,

679
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:12,640
that is crazy. I don't know what inflation is. I don't know. I don't quite know. I guess they had to

680
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:21,120
build a water system. So that means the other 1.6 billion went to CityWalk building another parking

681
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:28,240
garage, building an entire interconnected waterway, hard rock, you know, important stuff,

682
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:33,360
important stuff. Yeah. Yeah. And that's, and so Thelonious Monk had to go. So sorry. Don't

683
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:38,400
got money for sorry Thelonious. Should have played piano better. I don't know when they open a new

684
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:43,120
version of CityWalk, maybe they can get that back if they have some of the fun stuff. They had to

685
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:52,080
wait for Shrek 4D for Thelonious to show up. So Thelonious of course, the executioner character

686
01:03:52,080 --> 01:04:03,760
in Shrek. The famous. Jurassic Park, maybe the most elaborate of the little rooms in this.

687
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:13,440
There's a wall that's labeled Raptor Pit. It's a pit. Pit. I love that. Why are they kept in a pit?

688
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,720
And it bangs every once in a while. It bangs constantly seemingly for the video, just like

689
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:23,760
rattling against the wall as if they're trying to get out. And why wouldn't you if you're in a pit?

690
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:32,400
The plan for the Raptors is just like, eh, toss like 40 of them in a pit, which the pit means like

691
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:38,800
it seems like it's designed to throw your enemies in. It doesn't seem like that's a good place for

692
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:43,680
Raptors to live. It feels like, well, that's where a super villain will hit a button under his desk

693
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:50,080
and drop you into. Unless that's actually really kind of a carryover, a crossover from Marvel.

694
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:55,520
That's Dr. Doom is going to throw you in a Raptor pit. They really should have on the borders of

695
01:04:55,520 --> 01:05:01,680
these lands mashed up each property. Oh, absolutely. So you would have, I mean, obviously they're not

696
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:07,360
next to each other, but yes, if Dr. Dooms fear fall was next to Jurassic Park, the fear, the

697
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:12,480
fear fall into the Raptor pit. Oh, that's cool. Or like somewhere in the ride, somewhere on

698
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:21,360
bilge rat barges, Popeye's eaten a big, uh, uh, he, he scrambled up some, uh, pterodactyl eggs.

699
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:26,080
Sure. Great. It doesn't, yeah, it doesn't need to be something crazy, just something very,

700
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:30,480
make that gradient a little smoother. Nothing ever goes away. Maybe that new roller coaster they're

701
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:36,320
building at Jurassic Park, maybe that's the Raptor pit. Well, there, I do know a little bit about

702
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:41,120
supposedly from the rumors at least is there is a, there's, there's the one section with robots is

703
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:45,760
Raptors. Cool. It's not going to be as good as Hagrid's. I don't think I don't. Yeah, I don't

704
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:51,280
think so. But apparently the launch area is like through a Raptor pen. Oh Jesus. So there's Raptors

705
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:55,920
on each side and then you shoot off and it's a fairly normal cool roller coaster. I think.

706
01:05:55,920 --> 01:06:01,200
Scary. Okay. It sounds scary, but it sounds cool. I like it. Yeah. That was the thing I came across

707
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:05,200
reading about this. When this opened, people were excited because there hadn't been a lot of new

708
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:10,320
roller coasters in Florida in a while. Maybe in Tampa, at least in this part of Florida.

709
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:17,120
Not that Tampa's that far away from Orlando, but like, you know, uh, I think whatever other coasters

710
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:22,080
that either closed or nothing new had really come along, but this opening with Dueling Dragons and

711
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:28,880
the Incredible Hulk, that was another sign that like the seat folks, this ain't Disney prepare

712
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:35,440
for departure as the, there'll be three roller coasters then in islands of adventure. I guess

713
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:42,880
this summer, there'll be like three really cool roller coasters for, well, for including rip ride

714
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:51,680
rocket. Well, no, four and three including, oh wait, no, I'm sorry for your, no, you're right.

715
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:56,480
It is three. I forgot they demolished one. They demolished one to build the other. Yeah. And then

716
01:06:56,480 --> 01:07:01,200
if you can't rip ride rocket, which maybe we shouldn't, uh, it's four technically on the,

717
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:06,560
on the premises, I guess mommy, mommy as well as five at this point, I've been advised by

718
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:11,600
multiple people. Like don't go on that. Don't do it. Yeah. Yeah. We've, we've, we, we heard

719
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:15,600
similar warnings. Yeah. We should maybe do that episode. Is it, wait, has anyone been on it? I

720
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:19,760
haven't been on it. You've done it a couple of times. I was going to do it this time, but it was

721
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:23,840
the day that the thing broke down. You didn't do it a few years. I thought we talked about it.

722
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:28,960
I didn't do it because I don't like that lift hill, but now that I've done it, it knots, maybe I'll

723
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:34,400
just, as long as it's open next time I go, I'll do it. It also, you have to do the full take everything

724
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:40,880
out of your pockets, stow your bag. It's such a headache for so much less reward than the Hulk.

725
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:47,680
That 90 degree climb seems terrible. It is really scary. Really stressful. Really the ride itself.

726
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:54,640
Fine. I can handle that now, but that climb is so stressful. Yeah. You feel like you're so pro.

727
01:07:54,640 --> 01:08:00,080
You're going to die. You're so well, that's look, I've, you know, it became a runner, me getting

728
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:06,480
over the launch thing, but it is not yet a runner for me to get over 90 degree lift hills. I'm not

729
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:11,360
going to open up that. You know, there was a great, there was a great idea by I believe Matt Mazani

730
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:17,760
that we had a stretch goal on the Patreon to get you on X2. Early on, I think he was like,

731
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:22,320
oh, you know what you should do. If you hit this amount of money, Scott's got to write X2. Great.

732
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:30,960
When we get 50,000 patrons. I've been warned off that one too. Another one of like, this isn't

733
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:40,320
aging well. Enough people pay the host's money. How much? One of them will risk permanent damage

734
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:45,920
to his body. It was brain probably. Yes. More. Yeah. Most likely psychological damage. How much

735
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:52,800
would the audience pay to torture you to on a roller coaster? Here we go. I mean, we don't have

736
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:57,360
to do an official poll. I'm just wondering what it's worth to the audience. This is where we have to

737
01:08:57,360 --> 01:09:04,880
separate our financials because we do even thirds. And now if my, your money is tied into me going

738
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:09,760
on roller coasters, I don't want to go on. This hardly seems fair. It's a good point. I didn't

739
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:15,440
end up any. I should be getting all of the money and the access money that is only me to make me

740
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:20,240
go on rides and I should be well compensated. I wonder what it is. I wonder what the money is.

741
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:24,640
Or like we said in, I don't know if we did this episode. Yeah. We said in one of the episodes

742
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:29,600
already, or maybe I can't remember what we've released. If, if there's a patron tier where

743
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:36,000
they can arrange for Mike love to go on the ride with you. Oh, sure. Yes. But you know, I know that

744
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,720
came up before and that was a fun idea, but I don't want to endanger this man's life.

745
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:45,280
I want him to be around making great music for decades to come. I don't want the good

746
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:51,520
vibrations to ever end. 120 year old Mike love still rocking. You know, just recently he put

747
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:59,040
out a very essential cover of the Ramones rockaway beach. That's, that's something you want in 2019

748
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:05,520
is a new Mike love Ramones cover, which probably came about because they're conservative like him.

749
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:09,520
Right. I don't know about these punks. You know, they do there. I think they're Trump.

750
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:16,640
It sounds groovy, man. Do you, do you think in 30 years from now, Mike love is hooked up to that

751
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:20,560
thing. The emperor's hooked up in rise of Skywalker to keep them alive and rocking.

752
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:26,400
So the show, like that thing that like moves him around is like what happens at the concert.

753
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:31,360
When, if he comes to me with some plan about a dyad and like, you know, making him live forever,

754
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:38,800
I'm like, cool in whatever you say, grandpa Mike, I'm not resistant. Shit emperor. Mike

755
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:44,960
of emperor Mike grandpa, grandpa, emperor, emperor, grandpa, Mike, emperor, grandpa, Mike,

756
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:52,400
someone draw it please. Anyway, what do we have to wrap this up? I don't know. Yeah.

757
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:56,080
Jurassic park was the last one. Jurassic park had the, in the video has the best,

758
01:10:56,080 --> 01:11:00,960
you can see the example of like the massive, like stamp your passport machines. You would

759
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:07,920
feed this little paper in to get like a quickly fading stamp. Like a parking validation, like a

760
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:15,680
parking valid. Hey, that's right. Yeah, it was great. It was super fun. Plasted a couple of years

761
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:21,200
closed when the park opened, obviously something. What was the other stuff I found out about islands

762
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:26,960
of adventure? I never really realized. Oh, I think it was the first park, first park designed with

763
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:33,440
like stereo sound, like designed from the ground up with stereo sound, because as you go through

764
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:40,720
the lands, the like background music tracks or sound effects kind of evolve. First park with

765
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:45,920
an original soundtrack as well, like composed for the park, for all the different lands.

766
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:54,720
And apparently the, the background music for lost continent was done by a guy named William kid,

767
01:11:54,720 --> 01:12:00,480
who was a protege of John Williams kid also wrote the soundtracks for returned to lonesome dub and

768
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:06,560
the theme song for a low some car, the new adventures of Superman. We all sing that.

769
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:12,880
We all love it. I imagine it was adventurous.

770
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:22,240
Would you say, Jason, if you like, you know, people use VR sometimes is like therapy. If there was a

771
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:27,120
VR, just islands of adventure, would that be the, maybe go to like when you needed to just chill out?

772
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:33,200
Probably. I could see that. Yeah. Or even just the preview center. Or yeah, the preview center,

773
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:42,160
the island skipper, that, that two minute ride across the water. Yeah, that's the thing in the

774
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:49,920
map too. There was something else in there. Oh, there, there was a weird cartoon show in the big,

775
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:54,480
there was a big theater back at tomb lagoon that is mostly used for special events. Now

776
01:12:55,520 --> 01:13:02,480
there was like a cartoon on parade sort of thing where like Rocky and Bo Winkle and like

777
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:08,960
Heathcliff or a little Abner, like, yeah, very weird characters would do a parade. I mean,

778
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:15,120
you can just probably just by looking at the texts go like that was cut. That was cut. When money

779
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:20,400
started to run out, that was cut. Like the boats were cut quickly. That show was cut quickly.

780
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:28,800
The nighttime show features friends parade. Oh, I would love that. If I, if me and Heathcliff

781
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:35,040
could ride the boat, just crisscrossing from port of entry to Jurassic park all day,

782
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:41,680
another Spider-Man is the captain. Someone could make, create a VR, a crude VR program for Jason.

783
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:46,720
Now we're not calling for fan and I'm calling for some of the program of VR scenario, Jason and

784
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:53,760
Heathcliff in a boat together. And we just, just talk about the story, the backstory of port of

785
01:13:53,760 --> 01:14:01,680
entry and you both fish in the sales. We eat the fish with a skeleton wood fired from cone Fisco

786
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:08,320
grill. At the very least somebody could create a 3d art of that. Like a really blocky picks like

787
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:14,400
polygon ish or like dream cast. Let's start with that. But if we can get you in sort of in a,

788
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:21,680
a get out scenario that doesn't require any lives to be disrupted, just with that allows you to live

789
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:28,160
out eternity in the walking through islands of adventure, islands of adventure is like a,

790
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:35,120
you know, it's a bad thing to like so much because like in the theme, like theme part, like, oh,

791
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:41,600
don't get too attached. Everything's always changing or being updated. That's true. 95% of the time

792
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:48,480
except at islands of adventure, which has prevailed like largely. It is a place where characters will

793
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:57,200
always see you in 1999. Oh, perfect. What a perfect note to wrap up. Yeah. Yeah. If you want,

794
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:04,480
it's 1999 forever. It's a wonderful thing. And, uh, and you survive podcast, the ride, uh, escape

795
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:12,560
and, uh, um, uh, yeah, that's fine. Hey, let us know other preview centers you would like us to

796
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:17,200
step through. We'll do all this once we don't know about it is a little interesting thing to,

797
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:20,880
to track. I mean, I was looking at the California adventure one and there are like, you know,

798
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:25,200
there were, they were calling the coaster or something different, stuff like that. We'll

799
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:31,120
talk about that. That'll be great. I love that. I mean, this, the main thing that contract a little,

800
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:36,720
some of the concept art is a little bigger or a little grander, but it really, yeah,

801
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:41,600
it really did not change very much. And then in this video that you watched, they get, they walk

802
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:47,840
you outside and there's the reminder that not only is all this great stuff coming in 1999, but we're

803
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:55,200
just months away from twister, right? Yes. What a time to be at that part of the park and that part

804
01:15:55,200 --> 01:16:01,280
of the state and that part of the country. Oh, a quick walk through the tastefully named gift shop

805
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:09,440
aftermath. And again, who knows what life will be like when this podcast comes out. So there may

806
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:14,400
all re well, or we will all have like survived whatever's going on and there'll be a fun gift

807
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:23,360
shop named after it. Yeah, not aftermath, uh, aftermath, like after cleansed, vaccine,

808
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:30,800
cleanse. I feel like cleansed could open in downtown Disney any moment. That's just like a

809
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:37,600
candle place. It's so no could become, so no could become cleansed. Yeah. Basin was no,

810
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:44,560
but comes could been to come. Yeah. I love it. All right. Uh, well, uh, everybody get cleansed,

811
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:48,960
wash your hands for 20 seconds at least. Yeah. Should I get cloned? And, uh, yeah, talk to you

812
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:49,440
soon.
