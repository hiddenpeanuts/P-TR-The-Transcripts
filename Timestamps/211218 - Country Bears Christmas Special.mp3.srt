1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Well, all good things must come to an end, even Jamba Weeks.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
But first, we rustled up a yule-tied tree, featuring conspiracy theorist Santa

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and the most unusual bear you ever did see.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's the Country Bear Christmas Special on Podcast The Ride.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Grizzly Gate, the one and only original Podcast

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The Ride Country Bear Jamba Week. Coming to a close here on day six, I'm swinging

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Scotty Gertner, joined by Big Car Alson and Jughead Jason Bonnet Sheridan.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Oh, I will miss these clunky, these endless names. We bid them a do as we do so many

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
aspects of this week. We're at the end, fellas.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yeah, I think I am. I can't help but think that my half idea of just, like, if I was

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
doing the intro to call you like Scooch, would have been so much simpler, saved us

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
so much time, and we would have, these episodes would have been a lot more brisk.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Just by virtue of there being much less of a name than suddenly it all tightens.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yeah, like, you're Scooch, Jason's like, let's call him like J, and I'm...

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
J?

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Just call him J, yeah, because his first name starts with a J.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And I'm like, call me like Lean and Lean or something.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Lean and Lean.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Just call me Lean, I think.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Oh, okay, I thought you were saying Lean and Lean and Lean. It was like a big and rich

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
kind of situation, but the same word repeats.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Well, for my country, my new country band, maybe I will call it Lean and Lean and I'll

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
find another taller gentleman to do it with. But yeah, for the, for brisks, for the sake

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
of brevity, Lean, I guess.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
By even discussing this, we've made it all longer.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So brevity's been out the window.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's been, you know, it hasn't been brief. We've done a lot here, but I've enjoyed

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
everything. You think about what we've accomplished this week. We've covered every

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
iteration of the show. We improvised a jamboree with Zach and Jess from Off Book, and we

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
had fun with Guy and Doug, and we unanimously agreed on the pristine quality of a fine

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
overlooked film.

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
That's right, I remember.

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
We all got on board with a new American classic.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I remember.

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's been a blast.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Writers, get the think pieces ready and just make sure to cite your source. That's all

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I have to say.

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Vulture AV Club, sharpen your pencils.

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
That's right.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Just get ahead of the 20th anniversary. Yeah, yeah, please.

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You know who to credit. And that is Scooch, Jay, and Lean and Lean.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
My big question before we dive into the Christmas show, which we close out as we head into the

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Christmas season. I think we did this for you, Mike. This is for you, Mike. You love

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
the show. There was no way, you know, we couldn't just do a basic episode about it.

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I think we had to explore every nook and cranny and experiment and really see our way

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
around the Country Bear Jamboree. And I just want to know now, how do you feel?

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Do you feel good about everything?

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yeah, I do feel good about it. When I initially thought of it, I didn't think of it as a big

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
event, but I'm glad we did it like this. I'm glad we got to hoot and holler to sort of

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
experience what it would be like to do a Jamboree. I don't know. It's like, it feels like,

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
are we ever going to do a Country Bear related episode again? I hope so, but I don't know

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
where it's going to come from. So maybe it's a bit bittersweet on my end as well, because

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
it's like, well, you know, we climbed that hill and doing six episodes about it, it's

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
like, well, what else is there to say? Like, there's other episodes, you know, of big popular

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
rides we've done where I feel like, yeah, we could probably do another episode on it.

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
But like, the bears, we completely exhaust bears. So I feel a little, I feel good, but

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
also sad.

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Bittersweet. Well, can we run a quick checklist? Is there anything that we didn't cover?

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I mean, we talked about these bathrooms. We haven't, I don't know that we talked about,

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I think I came back from Japan with crushed pennies or whatever coin they're called in

61
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Japan with the carry, and we didn't really talk about those. So there's maybe a crushed

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
coin episode in the future.

63
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
As Guy alluded, there's a lot of merch, especially once you factor in Tokyo Disney's bear

64
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,000
offerings. And we only kind of touched on like what bear country used to be, you know,

65
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
the Mile Long Bar, the bath houses.

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And then there's Disney on Parade, which I found in the first episode. And we have to

67
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
go back to that because supposedly there's the Sunbonnet Trio are like doing a trapeze

68
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
act in it. So yeah, I guess you're right. I guess there's more bears. So I shouldn't

69
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
be sad. I should be hopeful and optimistic about the future of bear talk on this podcast.

70
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yeah. The plush episode, the coins episode, the bath house episode. There's country. You

71
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
would think that Country Bird Jambor Week one would exhaust all the big stuff being

72
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
that we're doing the shows. But isn't that a little passe? I think now it's really going

73
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
to free us up in Country Bird Jambor Week two to cover what people really want to hear

74
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
about. Yeah. Yeah. Plush three hours on plush. When I am kept up at night that it's like

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
it wasn't five episodes. It wasn't seven episodes. It was six. It wasn't a full week and it

76
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
wasn't a work week either. Just tossing and turning. Do we need to think of one more then

77
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
to make it? One more. It could be a minute long. We could just like clip something from

78
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
this episode. Just like snip it out and call that its own thing. Tracks in the snow is

79
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
especially good. It's the first one sentence episode. If I guess the right. There's no

80
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
intros. Talk about brevity. It's like a tweet of an episode. That's less of a mile long

81
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000
bar. More of a ruler long bar. You know what it is? It's the, when the chicken, if they

82
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
ever bring back that gosh darn sandwich. The fried tomatoes. Fried green tomatoes. The fried green

83
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
tomato sandwich at Hungry Bear. That's its own episode. Then we finally do Hungry Bear

84
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Restaurant. And we can talk about bears there. There it is. It's the Bear Restaurant. Yep.

85
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,000
But we won't do it until they bring that sandwich back. For now I think this has worked out

86
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
very nicely that we are ending the year with this because we get to close out with the

87
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Christmas iteration of the Country Bridge Embry. Which there's not that many. I feel like

88
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
every year it's like what is our Christmas episode? And there's not that much stuff. Like

89
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
we talk about holiday overlays. But there aren't really a ton of those in theme park

90
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
history. So this is sort of a bigger one in that regard. Yeah. This was the first. I guess

91
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
so. This was the first overlay they said. It's before Haunted Mansion. It's before It's a

92
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Small World. Before Jingle Cruise. Yeah. Before Avatar. Before Flight of Holiday Passage.

93
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Flight of Holiday Passage. Or you throw presents to the Navi. We've got to get to the Navi

94
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Mall. The Hallelujah Mall. Hard times have fallen on the Hallelujah Mall. It's only one

95
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
third occupied. I hope there's a mall in one of these upcoming Avatar movies. I would like to

96
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:44,000
know where do they get their loincloths? Show us James. Show us. I'd like a size 102 please

97
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
they say because they are very large. Right of course. And lean. Yeah. Yeah. So here we are

98
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:58,000
doing one of the bigger Christmas things. And I think it's very nice and charming. And

99
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
almost weird that they don't do this more often with more things. Especially with these show

100
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,000
situations where why not? All the robots are there. Just put sweaters on them. Make them do the

101
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
standards and you're done. It's easy. Yeah. It is. It is. It does seem to me. I mean they did a little

102
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
of that with the Jingle Cruise and I think the first year at Disneyland at least it was a little

103
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
underwhelming. But I think they added some more stuff to it. But it's such just even calling

104
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
anything like the holiday edition and putting a Santa hat on does go a long way. Like C3PO and

105
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Star Tour. Well I guess it's Life Day. And they did Life Day. They did like one day Life Day a couple

106
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
weeks ago at Galaxy's Edge. But they didn't barely do anything. They just had a couple food

107
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
offerings. And some merch. A little bit of merch. And a little bit of merch. You want to see the

108
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
whole land decked out. And it's like it's you know it looks like our holiday decorations but it's a

109
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
little slightly different. So yeah. And plus Life Day season just starts earlier and earlier every

110
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
year. So you can really stretch it out and you can really go to a three moons day which is an

111
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
early January. Of course. It's just getting so commercialized. That's right. Oh terribly. Yeah.

112
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Used to be about the life. And now it's about the credits. But so. Oh yeah go ahead. Oh I was just

113
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
going to say the basic facts of the Country Bears Christmas special. Yeah. You know started in

114
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Disneyland and Disney World in November of 1984 and then opened in Tokyo Disney in November of

115
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,000
1988. Of course still running. Still going strong in Tokyo Disneyland. Yeah. Ended at the Magic

116
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Kingdom only in 2005. I was surprised to find out about that. That it kept going for so long. And

117
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Disneyland the last one was 2000. The ride closed in September 2001. Yeah this is and this is of

118
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
course the only one now that I haven't seen in person. The only version. Oh is that right. Because I

119
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,000
saw the vacation one in Japan and then seen the regular in Florida. So it seems what Guy told us is

120
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
that the big thing you'd be missing out on by just watching a video is how fully rendered it is when

121
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Wendell shoots the lights out. Wendell who is lovingly holding a gun in the show and he blows the

122
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
lights out and you could really feel it. The sound was very good and it really felt like glass was

123
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:22,000
shattering. Squirrel cone. Yeah. He says it's not even loaded. Yeah. And Wendell is so sad in this show.

124
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Can I just say that? He bums me out so much and I'm a big Wendell guy. But I feel like I will say

125
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
overall I think the show half fully like is kind of sad too. There's a lot of sadness in this version.

126
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yeah. You were talking about over the doughboys that we did that might people might have heard earlier

127
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:49,000
this week on their page if I could play a different oh yeah. You have some like holiday melancholy I feel

128
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
like a lot of it. Maybe you're bringing that to the table here. That's true but isn't he's Wendell. Yeah

129
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,000
that's absolutely true that I feel very I get like December the sad sads I get them in December. And

130
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I got the sads again. So yeah. So some of this Christmas songs make you like kind of wistful and you know

131
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
but I think also like Wendell is like stuck out in the cold like he can't get home. It's like so sad. Yeah

132
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
he's like he's really like upset and bummed out like it's not so it's not just on time with with some of

133
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
the songs it's like not just the melancholy Christmas it's like something bad has happened to this

134
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
character and Trixie Trixie can't catch a break in all of these shows. I mean she sings a song called

135
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
the Hibernating Blues about how she was supposed to go ice skating with someone and he was busy sleeping

136
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:46,000
he was busy snoozing and she's introduced as a girl who was sure to break the ice at any skating party

137
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:53,000
which I guess has two meanings. Well yeah yeah it's a little it's mean to Trixie for sure they they're

138
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,000
we have to take them on there we have to take Henry at his word that he only means the one that is about

139
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:06,000
conversation. Do we trust Henry enough to think that this isn't a double entendre? I don't know I mean

140
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Henry's got you know Henry's got his eyes set on swinging Teddy bear up Aura but he seems like he's mean

141
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
to Trixie. I don't know I don't trust this Henry especially in the show I'll say that. It seems like an

142
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
arbitrary picking of favorites because also like if we're being honest if you look at silhouettes of the two

143
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:31,000
of them they look the same. Why is he so hard on one and so in love with the other? Yes I did have that

144
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
same thought where you're like yeah what are we even doing here like what is this these are just bears

145
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:43,000
there's different sized bears what they're both like similarly sized I feel like. Is it confidence?

146
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Is swinging Teddy Barra just more confident? I think you're probably you might be onto something there we're just

147
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
saying that then the shots he's taking at her are uncalled for if he's being selective I don't know he's

148
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:04,000
blinded yes maybe what you're saying he's blinded by Teddy Barra's confidence. Yeah in the process he

149
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:11,000
might hurt Trixie's confidence he might cause the confidence. Of course he is he rejects Trixie she asks to make

150
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:18,000
out with him and he says oh maybe then the bears save him so yes this poor Trixie is just getting like the

151
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:26,000
shaft again. The heads on the wall are all in the Trixie. That's true they're kind of my favorite characters

152
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,000
so I mean if you're gonna get admired by anybody doesn't it make it all the better then that Trixie as portrayed

153
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:43,000
in the film gets this full makeover and is presented as the sexiest bear on earth. That's true I mean I think in bear

154
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:52,000
logistics you would want your mate to be bigger come hibernating season at least because then they're more likely to

155
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:01,000
survive until the spring. That's true a lean bear would struggle might not make it through the end. If I was a bear I would

156
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:11,000
struggle. If you were a bear with your current body yeah you'd be like an alarmingly skinny bear. Yeah that's probably true. I think though if you

157
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:22,000
bearify any of us as Tona bearified us in the work is very confusing not verified bearified. Bearified yeah. In the artwork for the show I mean

158
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:29,000
like we all gain a lot of pounds because we're I think by virtue of like if you become a bear you're just you're not just

159
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:40,000
yourself but with fur I think you also there's 50 pounds minimum. Yeah no that's probably true too so yeah Trixie sad Wendell sad

160
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:49,000
there's another one too would I have written down. Big Al's pretty sad. Oh Big Al's so sad it's sadder than the other one. Big Al's so sad. Yes. In the American version very funny

161
00:14:49,000 --> 00:15:01,000
dressed as baby New Year. Yes very fun I mean it's that's the funniest thing for sure but it is also like he's really like depressed. It's like one of the big finale things

162
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:14,000
of the show is how depressed Big Al is. And then Shaker has turned white and is freezing and he's like like chattering. He turned polar. He turned polar as the bears that we went to

163
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:31,000
visit. That's right. And then Teddy has been in a ski accident. She's hurt. Yeah. Is that why she has the cast on? Yeah she's hurt. I missed it. She is hurt because he says he says like a very easy

164
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:42,000
like as soon as I find a pen I'll be up to sign your cast you know. Yeah she does want to come up and sign my cast. Yeah but in watching the videos a little odd you weren't really like set up to notice the

165
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:58,000
cast. Like it kind of creeps up the longer you're watching it. One of the performers is injured. I mean God bless her for continuing on. Yeah she's like when Dave Grohl broke his leg on stage and you know he just they put him in like a little throne and he continued the

166
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:11,000
tour. You know that's right and by the way here's some there's a type of comment I've noticed lately because I suddenly got in an episode recently I got a little self-conscious about you and I's classic rock talk and yes I do

167
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:40,000
consider Dave Grohl classic rock at this point in time and I just want to say recent feedback has taught me that people are on board with the classic rock talk. All I needed to hear was two people say it so guess what? We're back. Okay. Guess who's getting referenced? The bad finger and the raspberries. You're all in. You're all in again. You're welcome on this theme park podcast. They're all back. Those listeners who were into it would say they're back.

168
00:16:40,000 --> 00:17:07,000
They would say it's a little bit of a reach but they would say it yeah. Yeah okay. They'd see Mike or I and say there goes my hero. That's right. And express that they don't want to be a monkey wrench. Does anything defy this Christmas depression that we're all suddenly feeling from the show? Is anything, does anything

169
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:34,000
brighten it? Sleigh Ride by the Sunbonnets is pretty lively. All three shows the Sunbonnets have such great up tempo like jaunty songs. I think the Five Bear Rug songs, some of them in this tracks in the snow I think is really good and Hungry as a Bear is fun too. When they say if Santa Claus is if he comes down the chimney he might get it. I think that's a good one.

170
00:17:34,000 --> 00:18:03,000
If he comes down the chimney he might get it. Like they rhyme, they stretch the pronunciation of eat to like if I get it and I just thought that was so funny. You know what's a great thing about the show? The Sunbonnet trio is finally decent. They're bundled up. That's right. They're covered up to an appropriate level for their age. No more of these skimpy bikinis. This is finally a modest show.

171
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Non body show. Big like Mrs. Claus style like velvet hoods and outfits. Yes for sure that is true. My awakening was Mrs. Claus. That's my definition of a woman. That's why you found the bonnet outfits too much. Those scandalous bonnets.

172
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Yes I want velvet head to toe. Scott is a Mrs. Claus fetish. Alright took four years of the podcast to get it out of me. That's right. She gets the tough end of the stick. That old Helen test situation. How do you think she feels? She doesn't even have a first name. It probably is Helen.

173
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I don't think so. I guess you're right. Probably named in some Hallmark movie or something but those don't count. There's no official word on this. There's McCarpenter as Mrs. Claus and she was like Janine Claus or something.

174
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:24,000
There's like three movies with the Lori Loughlin. Yes right. Mrs. Claus. Hold on I gotta find out if she has a first name. Mrs. Claus. I'm on Wikipedia. Mrs. Claus also known as Mrs. Santa Claus. Is the legendary wife of Santa Claus.

175
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:46,000
What's the female version of Santa? Santina? Oh maybe. A gender swapped Santa. That's what the movie executives would say. That's like in a saucy 1960 mad magazine spread. Santa is hot now.

176
00:19:46,000 --> 00:20:08,000
And tempting presidential candidate Richard Nixon. Does Mrs. Claus have a first name? Arthur Christmas. What is Arthur Christmas? Is that a new thing? That was in the last 10 years I think. 2011.

177
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:28,000
What's her name? Margaret. Pretty close to Helen. It's gotta be older though for it to be canon in my opinion. It's a pretty nullified name a little bit. She's gotten a raw deal. We could name her now. We could have our own Mrs. Claus first name.

178
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:48,000
What's an appealing name? Rebecca? Rebecca Claus. Gertrude? Scarlet Claus. Scarlet Claus is cool. Great. It's an S. By the way you just launched a franchise too. Scarlet Claus.

179
00:20:48,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Scarlet Claus seems like she's gonna be out for revenge. Yeah she is. I wonder why. Did somebody shoot a reindeer in front of her? Yep that's it. Reindeer was gunned down in front of her. Oh it's just a John Wick scenario. Yeah I'm thinking I'm Mary.

180
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:29,000
There is a reindeer in the show. They added the red nose to one character and I'm blanking on the name. To Max. Max is the Rudolph nose and Melvin has the Christmas lights and his antlers which is very cute. I just wish that was done on more rides.

181
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I guess they would argue it would cost 10 grand to put the red nose on Melvin or Max every year. They would explain to me you might think it's fun but do you understand how much money that costs?

182
00:21:44,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Power? We gotta pay somebody to get up there and do it? That's a ladder that we have to have around? Ladders aren't free. Yeah and I would say make the red nose on Cosmo in the Guardians of the Galaxy queue. On the dog or something. And they would be like that's 15,000. You don't understand that. We have to get a specialized person to open the glass. A glass opener. And then we have to make the nose. And then yeah it's a team of three people.

183
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Haunted Mansion Holiday must cost a fortune. Because you have to cover or remove or hide the original stuff. Then you have to put in the Nightmare Before Christmas stuff and then you have to do it all again a few months later.

184
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Yeah. I mean the numbers for this thing are like Haunted Mansion Holiday costs like $100,000 to do the transformation every year. Something like that. Or more. It is major. It is major. So yeah I get it. But it is just so fun to see little tweaks to existing characters to make them fit into whatever the holiday or whatever the event is.

185
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:55,000
We got Monsters After Dark. Is there a good... I feel like they could easily do a Christmas overlay of Guardians.

186
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Oh and they have that holiday special coming. Oh that's a very good point. To Disney Plus with the whole cast and stuff.

187
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Yeah. What if it's that maybe Santa is trapped in the tower. They're glad he's trapped because he's been hoarding presents. He's been keeping presents away from Rocket and the Guardians. He's determined that they're naughty and not nice.

188
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:26,000
So we gotta go up there and steal Santa's presents. I mean that's a great idea. And leave him up there in the tower to rot.

189
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I would have said yeah like it's Evil Santa or like Planet of the Evil Santas or something. And there's like Santa's Unleashed. You could call it Santa's Unleashed. And it's just like alien Santas.

190
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:49,000
On every floor? A different giant Santa? Oh yeah. Yeah different like grotesque Santas. And then have the same... I mean you could call it Santa's After Dark I guess. Just like Santa's After Dark.

191
00:23:49,000 --> 00:24:03,000
And then use the same basic song. It'll be just as fun. We thought we found a real Santa. It turns out it was a Chitauri disguised as one. Right? Is that the aliens from Avengers? That's the aliens. Yeah.

192
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:15,000
We're gonna find him. We're gonna rescue real Santa. We just gotta get through all these alien ones. Yeah. I mean it's done. Done. There's no notes needed for that. Perfect.

193
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Take this Santa punch. Just take the audio of Jason doing Rocket there and don't even call Bradley Cooper about it. Wolverine Santa. Just kidding. He's not here yet. Sorry. Perfect. Yeah perfect. Again perfect.

194
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:41,000
And also like on Web Slingers they could like have it just be snowing. Oh you're talking even less. I love that. Yeah. Why are we... yeah you don't even have to redo the entire... Yeah absolutely. Yeah.

195
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:54,000
The Spiderbots took his gift to MJ. To Mary Jane. He's gotta get back. I mean that's good too but that's a little more work. Oh okay. You gotta get another Tom Holland. I'm just saying like don't even mention it just like it's snow. There's snow going on.

196
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:10,000
You're just adding another layer in a video editing software of snow in front of the existing like final footage. No you don't need to get Tom Holland. He doesn't have to re-explain and thing. He's working on his dancing. He's gonna be Fred Astaire. I saw that he's gonna be Fred Astaire.

197
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I also saw somewhere in like Fred Astaire like put in it as Will like never make a movie about me. Oh Will Schmills. People can write whatever they want. Doesn't mean anything.

198
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I'm sure he'll do it. I've got a holiday overlay idea. What if the Little Mermaid ride starts and you start trying to go underwater but then you just like hit solid. Yeah. But then like you hear a drill sound. Like there's actually a secret drill in the back of the clams.

199
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:58,000
So now you're burrowing through ice and all the characters don't move anymore because they're all frozen. And then they also just turn the air conditioning way fucking crazy. So you're freezing. Yeah. Extremely unpleasant. It's bitterly cold.

200
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:13,000
And by the way I think I described science where I have it right where all lakes and rivers and bodies of water are all frozen all the way down to the bottom. Yeah. Yeah. I thought so. My science understanding is solid. Yeah.

201
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Scott that reminds me of an interesting I think an interesting detail about their show at least the frozen penguin that is one of the differences between the American and Japanese versions of this show.

202
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Terrence sings Blue Christmas with a penguin and in a mirror in Disneyland Disney World it was frozen in a block of ice and shakes like jingle bells. But in Japan it's a full ass like animatronic who has a conversation with him.

203
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Oh wow. Oh geez. Well again I was with so many things they did more and better in Japan. That's incredible. It is funny watching the Japanese version too. I was it struck me how much the big Alan is.

204
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:18,000
How much the big Alan animatronic moved like it just looked so smooth and right right detailed. I like Gomer is Gomer's outfit a lot. He's like what's Gomer wearing remind me. He's got like a like a silver coat on and he's like got like I would say like he's got like a tinsel kind of like wreath around his neck as well.

205
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:34,000
And then he has sunglasses on. He looks like he's definitely the coolest dressed I think of the of the bears during this holiday one. He's got like a little tree I think I think it's on his piano unless the angles wrong but he's got like a tiny tree on the piano and then a stocking hung on the front.

206
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Like he just has a great looking setup as per usual. I figured this out in the first one. I think I think Gomer is handsome. I think Gomer can get it doesn't wear out as welcome stays quiet while the other ones blabber on and on. And that's why he gets the gentleman's lair.

207
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
If you were to have to go really like to like make compared to another like a rock and roll icon or something I'm trying to think.

208
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I think Brian Ferry. I guess he sings I just think of him as being like a dapper. Yeah. It's a good question. I actually I don't I didn't have one I was just thinking because now that we're full steam ahead back on classic rock talk.

209
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Those two commenters. Hey be careful what you wish for. That's all we needed to hear.

210
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:28,000
We'll we'll say names session musicians besides we just heard. Boy you're in for a treat. Here's so much Lee Rittenour talk from now on.

211
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Twenty twenty two is a whole new ballgame. The differences between Wilco drummer Ken Coomer and Wilco drummer Glenn Cochie.

212
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Get ready. I guess that's class. It's newer but still that's 20 years old at this point. Baby Oscar is cute a little looks a little concerned in this one looks a little more scared and sad.

213
00:28:52,000 --> 00:29:05,000
It's a weird sad winter. It's the sad alarming revolution different. Oh what a pout. Oh this guy. Did you find this sad. Now are you just realizing it now Scott. Jason you thought it thought there was a lot of sadness here right.

214
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I noticed I mean a lot of Christmas songs can be very melancholy. I'll be home for Christmas you know. Yeah. Song in the trenches of World War One and have yourself a merry little Christmas.

215
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Also pretty sad. I mean all the it's so funny all these are so recent but yeah I mean sleigh ride is very up. I love the conclusion of the show. Let it snow into Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer into winter wonderland in America and then in Japan.

216
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Yeah yeah there's difference. I love a music where Q where like one person is singing and then the next line everyone on stage is singing in like joins in with the Bears. You just hear so many voices in that conclusion.

217
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:55,000
There are yeah there's a big yeah they're both I think I don't know what I want to say this is like the best big finale of all the shows but it is it's up it's up there of the three I guess.

218
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Yeah always you know when that big stage rolls out when the five bear rugs move forward and all the little stages open up and all the bears are singing in harmony. I don't care which of the three it's always such a delight.

219
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Yeah like and everybody's just lit up and clapping. It's I think one of in any of the shows in any of the parks I think it's like one of the more joyous vistas that you get to see in anything.

220
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Just everybody's so happy. Out of the context of this podcast calling the country bears singing a joyous Vista is just fantastic.

221
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Most people would say like seeing like a national park is a joyous Vista.

222
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:45,000
No these bear robots in Christmas sweaters is one of the seven wonders of the world does.

223
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
In Japan Big Al sings Auld Lang Syne.

224
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:56,000
The show in Japan too a mix of song song sung in Japanese some in English. Yeah it's interesting the ones that they chose to do that way.

225
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Yeah Santa Claus is Coming to Town is in Japan.

226
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
They still have Rudolph and Winter Wonderland it just instead of Let It Snow it's Santa Claus is Coming to Town.

227
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I don't understand any of these are all the side steps to me.

228
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Yeah it's a good question I mean I don't know if there's anything just like there's a cultural difference or something or that song is more popular in Japan than it is.

229
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:27,000
There probably is something like that. I think Guy was even talking about like for some reason there's not the extensive history of why Let It Snow is playing in America and Santa Claus is Coming to Town.

230
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
For some reason that's not an easily gettable fact on the internet.

231
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
It's not people begging for this information.

232
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
People aren't dying to know what the difference is but it is look I'm interested I'm very interested.

233
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
That would be the most interesting thing I would learn all day if somebody would tell me I bet.

234
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I could be wrong but I bet there's something interesting along the lines of like this song is more popular in this country.

235
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
But Santa Claus is Coming to Town is popular in America too.

236
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Covered by Mr. Classic Rock Bruce Springsteen of course.

237
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
One of the best rock and roll Christmas songs of all time if we're going to go there which we will.

238
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I love the Billy Corgan Smashing Pumpkins like Christmas Time has come that's kind of creepy.

239
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
That's what I'm talking about.

240
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I don't.

241
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Maybe now I don't like that we've let the cat out of the bag on the classic rock.

242
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Because now we're going rock and roll Christmas.

243
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I love simply having a wonderful Christmas time.

244
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Well of course.

245
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I feel like people say or like or the Mariah Carey people are like oh I'm hearing it again.

246
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
It's like yeah these songs are great.

247
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Well I think I think everyone's in support of Mariah but you hear some weird feelings about wonderful Christmas time.

248
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Boy do you and it's not fuddling to me.

249
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
You can say maybe the songs are like a little too long.

250
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
That's the closest thing I would accept as a criticism.

251
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Madness. The ding ding dongs can go on as long as they want.

252
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
That's what I feel too.

253
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I like long versions of every song that I like.

254
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
So I don't want the country where it's done wonderful Christmas time.

255
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
That's that's that's a plus up.

256
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
The Sun but our tricks.

257
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Someone should have done Christmas rapping by the waitresses.

258
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
That's a fun.

259
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
There's a lot of different.

260
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:14,000
As a kid as a kid my favorite Christmas song I think was rocking around the Christmas tree which I guess is a little bit like do what be.

261
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I don't know.

262
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I don't want you guys to get mad at me here but I think it is a little bit of a boom boom boom like Brian Susser.

263
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I'm sure does a version of rocking around the Christmas tree.

264
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
No I bet he does.

265
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Oh I bet it reinvents the wheel.

266
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
He brings so many new ideas to these songs.

267
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
And what if I did it but like the same.

268
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Oh yeah.

269
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Oh yeah.

270
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Another good one Brian.

271
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
The whole orchestra cheers them on.

272
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I found about this show I found a newsprint a framed newsprint ad that someone was selling I believe on eBay and it's advertising bear season starts November 23rd.

273
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,000
The show is new at the time but you can also see in this ad with other musical acts at the bottom.

274
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Wow.

275
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Oh baby.

276
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Yeah.

277
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
New edition.

278
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
New edition.

279
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
New edition.

280
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Hey there's one.

281
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,000
My favorite Christmas song songs album the new edition Christmas EP.

282
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Everybody look it up on Spotify.

283
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,000
By far my favorite Christmas rock or R&B adjacent music.

284
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
They did a whole it's six songs that are original super synthy.

285
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
They don't even really feel that Christmasy.

286
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
It's just like they it's almost like they had demos or something.

287
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:39,000
It's just like they it's almost like they had demos ready to go for regular songs and they just made the lyrics Christmas and they rule weird little monologues like I want to spend Christmas with two girls.

288
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
My mom and of course my candy girl.

289
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
That's great.

290
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Oh that's adorable little speeches.

291
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Check that one.

292
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
That's that's my recommendation.

293
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Also playing around this time I feel like we've namecheck these groups before crash and Papa do run run.

294
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Yeah probably when we talked about Tomorrowland bands.

295
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Yeah I'd imagine.

296
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Yeah.

297
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Papa do run run like a Beach Boys cover but like people who played with them.

298
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
What's the best.

299
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
How many Beach Boys Christmas songs are there.

300
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:19,000
There's a lot because there is a 60s one and I love that album obviously but then there was a rejected 70s one which is a little lazy talking about just Christmasifying song.

301
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:31,000
They had a like not that great song called loop de loop flying in an airplane and they just like all right let's knock out a Christmas album fast loop de loop Santa's got an airplane.

302
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Not even Santa's got a sleigh Santa's got an airplane.

303
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
They kept airplane they were committed to airplane.

304
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Kind of interesting so why doesn't Santa have an airplane.

305
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
It's less magical but probably get more done.

306
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Here's my DC 10 I fill it with presents.

307
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
You can fit more cargo space.

308
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Why not.

309
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Thanks cool.

310
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Great idea.

311
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Thanks cool pilot John Travolta uses less magic a lot more diesel fuel.

312
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
My gift to the air and your lungs.

313
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
How would we use solar what happens when it's cloudy.

314
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Oh no Santa Santa's on one Santa's got theories.

315
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
The earth is flat anyway.

316
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Oh geez wheeze.

317
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I what I would not be who else among you who among you travels around the entire earth.

318
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I've seen it.

319
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
It's flat.

320
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I'm telling you who are you to believe me or your lying eyes.

321
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
How much time have you spent in the sky.

322
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I am into the polls really I live at one.

323
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Here's a photo of me almost falling off the edge.

324
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I did it look at see one leg is teetering I'm making a face.

325
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Oh I'm saying right into space I could have gone.

326
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Here's the ice walls and if you squint you can see the UN soldiers guarding the edge.

327
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I've been read and green pill.

328
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I'm going to the conference next year.

329
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I'm not going to wear Santa clothes.

330
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I'm just going to be playing because I don't want to distract.

331
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I don't want my celebrity to distract from the theories of what the flat earthers have to say.

332
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
The truth.

333
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I'm going to shave.

334
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
You won't even know it's me.

335
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
It'll grow back by Christmas.

336
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,000
That Jim Brewer's really something.

337
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Oh ho ho I say to his comedy.

338
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I was excited to learn because theme park great Thurl Ravenscroft credit it in this show as one of the voices on the wall passed away in 2005.

339
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I learned was doing Tony the Tiger until 2004.

340
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Wow.

341
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
They pick him up in a limo and take him to recording.

342
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Oh that's wonderful.

343
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Oh geez.

344
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
That's so cool to hear.

345
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,000
And even commercials after that have apparently used occasionally used archive audio.

346
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
They still use him as they should.

347
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
There's a new voice.

348
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
There is a new voice.

349
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
But I guess every now and then they would use him.

350
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Oh I almost forgot one of my favorite parts of this show.

351
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Henry at the beginning says the line and coming from the kitchen is the sweet smell of turkey and yeah yeah.

352
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Like he says yams in such an odd way it is up there with puddle in the original.

353
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
What?

354
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Don't recall this at all.

355
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I don't know it either.

356
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Yeah.

357
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Yeah.

358
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Yeah.

359
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Yeah.

360
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Yeah.

361
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Yeah.

362
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Yes.

363
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
That's it.

364
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
That's it.

365
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Yeah.

366
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Like it's kind of a Yaya.

367
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Yeah.

368
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Yums.

369
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I was I was think I was writing something down and I had the video playing and I had to go back.

370
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Hold on.

371
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I got to hear that again.

372
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
It just hit my ear in such a way.

373
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
This is a sequel to Ham in the House.

374
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Yams in the House.

375
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Yams in the House.

376
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Yams in the House.

377
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,000
It's a given that there's ham in the house but this Christmas Jason wants yams in the

378
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
house.

379
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Yeah.

380
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
We usually do have yams with the little marshmallows on top and the ham.

381
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
So you're a yam guy.

382
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I'm a yam guy.

383
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Oh I love a yam.

384
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Sweet potato or yam.

385
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Yeah.

386
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I guess I like them.

387
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I can't tell the difference unless they were both prepared and I eat them back to back.

388
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Well it sounds like something to do in the new year.

389
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Hey.

390
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
And it's something to do an episode about.

391
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
You're not wrong.

392
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
The difference between sweet potatoes and yams.

393
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Yeah.

394
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Yeah.

395
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Well if we don't have anything else I think this might be we might actually be heading

396
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,000
to the the end of this episode and therefore the end of Country Bird Jambor Week.

397
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Geez I think I think we made it.

398
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
This is this is one thing though really quick.

399
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
This is this is rare.

400
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
This might be neither here nor there.

401
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,000
But just funny that we've been doing all this bear talk and then right outside my house

402
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:59,000
like on my doorstep I found this little this little bear this little stuffed bear just

403
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,000
coincidentally which is not it's not my son's I don't know where it came from and I don't

404
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
think anybody's given it to I don't really know the story with it but like it was just

405
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
outside my house.

406
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,000
It's sort of like the little bear that the kid bear in the show holds right like Oscar

407
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Oscar Oscar.

408
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Yeah.

409
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Yeah.

410
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Yeah.

411
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Like he's holding a little teddy bear and it looks it's kind of similar.

412
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I you know I guess there's just bear spirit in the air.

413
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I don't I don't know what it's about exactly but just you know just sort of fun sign of

414
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
the week I guess.

415
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Yeah that's really nice.

416
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
It's pretty cute right.

417
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Do we think it's.

418
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Yeah I think it's very cute.

419
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Yeah.

420
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Is it.

421
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
No.

422
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Something.

423
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Is it moving.

424
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Yeah it looks like it's moving.

425
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Looks like it's moving a little.

426
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Huh.

427
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
What.

428
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
It's like moving on its own.

429
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Is that are you manipulating it with your fingers.

430
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,760
I mean I'm sort of shaking here.

431
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,880
Maybe I'll just put it on the ground and see if it.

432
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,880
Oh my god.

433
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,880
Oh yeah.

434
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,880
Look at that.

435
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,880
Oh my god.

436
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,880
Wait it's moving without me.

437
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,880
Boys boys.

438
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,880
What.

439
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,880
It's speaking.

440
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,880
What was that.

441
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,880
I mean I.

442
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,720
Good tidings to you.

443
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,760
Good tidings to you and all of your friends.

444
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,760
It's the sector keeper.

445
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,760
Oh my god.

446
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,760
Boys.

447
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,760
Yes it's me.

448
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,760
I Trojan.

449
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,760
Bared you Scott.

450
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,760
Wow a Trojan.

451
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,760
You fell for it.

452
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,760
You brought the bear in.

453
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,760
You have a child and you brought the bear in your house.

454
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,760
Jeez.

455
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,760
Oh were you trying to teach him a lesson.

456
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:24,760
I'm trying to teach all of you a lesson.

457
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,760
Boys.

458
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,760
Boys.

459
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,760
You've been bad.

460
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,760
What.

461
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,760
What.

462
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,760
We have.

463
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,760
How.

464
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,760
What do you mean.

465
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:37,960
You did a full week without me.

466
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:44,880
Oh are you saying because I mean we haven't done like a daily thing since the downturn

467
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,880
did like the ones that we've done with you.

468
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,680
Yeah so we did a day we did an episode every day.

469
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,480
But it but I didn't think.

470
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,020
I mean why would you want to be on it.

471
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,020
Why would you want to be on this.

472
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,020
It's about country bears.

473
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,020
What do you have to do.

474
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,020
You're like a mall guy.

475
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,020
Like we're friends.

476
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:00,560
Yeah but I I like bears.

477
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,840
Chicago bears.

478
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,640
Coca Cola bears.

479
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,440
Those type of bears aren't in this show.

480
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,440
They're there.

481
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,440
They don't.

482
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,840
The Chicago Bears aren't singing on stage at Disney World.

483
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,200
Bear naked lady.

484
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,540
Those aren't even bears.

485
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:20,640
I mean they come up all the time but that's a different spelling of bear.

486
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,640
It's not.

487
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:26,240
Look I'm glad you're trying to like free associate and attach to the topic but honestly we just

488
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,760
didn't we just I don't mean to like typecast you but it seems like your thing is shopping

489
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,320
centers next to theme parks.

490
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,640
I just didn't think you cared about this show.

491
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:41,880
I just thought you guys were just kind of like hanging out without me and I don't know

492
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,960
like you didn't want to be friends anymore.

493
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,000
No that's not what I know.

494
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
I've been tweeting.

495
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,680
I've been tweeting a lot.

496
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:52,760
Yeah I've been tweeting a lot about the work stoppage at Cricket Wireless.

497
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:55,640
I know like I've been busy too and.

498
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,600
Is there like a like sort of a union situation.

499
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,200
There's a lot of this in here lately.

500
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:03,400
We're trying to become the first cricket wireless to organize and.

501
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:07,360
Did they turn off your complimentary like cell phone plan.

502
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,480
Is that why you had to possess a stuffed bear.

503
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,440
You couldn't just call Scott on your cricket wireless.

504
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:18,320
They cut my prepaid minutes and we're pushing for just like so we could go home at night

505
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,800
just like pretty basic worker rights.

506
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,840
They're not letting they weren't letting you go home at night.

507
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,360
Fuck you in the store.

508
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:27,360
No they have a clock in policy.

509
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,360
What is that.

510
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,600
What does a clock in policy mean.

511
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,440
You can't clock out.

512
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,440
It's a one way.

513
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,440
A one way policy.

514
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,440
You can only clock in.

515
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,440
Oh my gosh.

516
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,920
Like a haunted mansion or so.

517
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,920
This is awful.

518
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:39,920
Yeah.

519
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:45,080
So anyway I thought maybe because I was working a lot you guys just left me out or something.

520
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:49,040
It doesn't mean just because something happens without you doesn't mean that we're you're

521
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,040
you're not in the crew.

522
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,040
You're always in the crew.

523
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,040
All right.

524
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:56,560
It just doesn't feel that way and I think you guys would take it pretty hard if I ran

525
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,120
away or something.

526
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,120
Oh my god.

527
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:00,640
We wouldn't want to run away.

528
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,640
You want me to pack up my snacks.

529
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:04,640
Is that what you want.

530
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,040
You want me to pack up my snacks in my backpack and run away.

531
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,040
No no of course not.

532
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,040
Of course not.

533
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,040
No we want to be.

534
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,040
Granola bar.

535
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,040
Gushers.

536
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,040
Ring pop.

537
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,040
Twinkies.

538
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:19,040
Well like we'll have you back on sometime when there's like a mall or something like

539
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:24,360
when the thing you know about one of your areas of expertise.

540
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,360
Did you know that.

541
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,720
It doesn't seem like this is enough.

542
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:27,720
Maybe we need to Mike.

543
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:30,360
Maybe we need to put our money where our mouth is.

544
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:35,960
What if I don't want you to feel this way and would it help ease some of these feelings

545
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:46,280
if we promise you that in 2022 next year we will do a new daily adventure with you our

546
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,520
old friend the sector keeper.

547
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,800
Really.

548
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,800
I say yes.

549
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,800
Yes.

550
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,800
I haven't talked about this before but the last thing we would want is to betray your

551
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,680
friendship and have you run away.

552
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,280
So we're willing to make that promise for next year.

553
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,960
Can Jason come.

554
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,440
I mean I hope so.

555
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,440
He'd never miss it.

556
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,960
He wouldn't miss it for the world.

557
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:07,960
He loves it.

558
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:08,960
Can Mike come.

559
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,440
Yes I can come too.

560
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:13,800
But is there anyone else you're curious about coming.

561
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:14,800
Can.

562
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,880
Can Edwin come.

563
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:20,360
Hang on hang on.

564
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,360
You're listing.

565
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:25,040
I'm putting out this offer to you and then you're ignoring me.

566
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,120
Can Scotty come.

567
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,120
OK.

568
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:31,440
Well assuming that means me then yes of course I'll be there.

569
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,600
Oh you're just pulling my chain.

570
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,600
Classic sector keeper.

571
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,320
Well look hey are you in.

572
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:41,080
Does that make you feel better about what happened this week.

573
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,840
Yeah if we can accomplish something.

574
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,280
But you know I'm going to be a little icy until then.

575
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:51,720
I don't know maybe I'll still run away and maybe me running away will set up some sort

576
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:56,840
of hijinks in premise for a future date.

577
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:04,520
And perhaps all of this will be postponed to 2023 because Western countries keep hoarding

578
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:09,600
the vaccine.

579
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:17,000
Well it's up to it's up to America to decide then I guess if we do another saga.

580
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,680
It's not in our hands anymore.

581
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:25,520
This is another benefit of a vaccine patent waiver is that it makes daily podcast series

582
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,640
that much smoother to do.

583
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:28,640
Right.

584
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:29,640
That's right.

585
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:34,200
But in the meantime I only clocked in so I got to get going.

586
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,200
Oh yeah.

587
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,200
Geez.

588
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,200
OK OK.

589
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,200
Yeah we'll go go go make your shift.

590
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,720
By all means we don't want you to be late.

591
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:43,080
I guess we'll see you next year it seems like.

592
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,880
Yes we'll see you next year.

593
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:50,040
My heart's still broken and we've got to mend it and you know there's still some beef and

594
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:57,160
stuff and surely we'll remember all of this stuff a year from now.

595
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,880
I absolutely will.

596
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:05,000
With that you survived podcast the ride country bird jammer week and podcast the ride for

597
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,480
2021.

598
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,960
Thank you for listening all year.

599
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:13,160
Hit the road go remain clocked in and we'll talk to you soon.

600
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:14,160
