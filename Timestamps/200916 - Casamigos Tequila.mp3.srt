1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,200
Salud, amigos, and welcome to Podcast The Ride The Second K.

3
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,640
A very special episode.

4
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,640
My name is Mike Carlson.

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,080
Joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

6
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,960
That's right, I'm here too.

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,800
Jason is here too.

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,400
We, of course, I guess I shouldn't say of course,

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,860
but we're missing one of our hosts today.

10
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,840
Mr. Scott Gairner is gone.

11
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,180
He's not here, and you know what happens

12
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,000
when the cat's away, the mice will play.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yes, so what happened was, you know,

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,520
Scott's doing nothing crazy,

15
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,640
but it's his information to share if he wants,

16
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,040
but he's busy.

17
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,080
So he said, well, if you and Jason have something

18
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,440
you'd like to talk about, you know,

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,520
we did an episode about Marvel Comics,

20
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,840
about the Marvel Mania restaurant.

21
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,420
Scott and I have done an episode about rock and roll.

22
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,280
We're big rock and roll guys.

23
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,560
So I was thinking, yeah, there's probably something,

24
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,060
and then I was thinking, you know, what is it?

25
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,480
Is it more Marvel?

26
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,520
There's gotta be other Marvel things, you know,

27
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,600
storms, what is it, an accelerator, what do you call it?

28
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,240
The storm force accelerator?

29
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,740
Yeah, storm force accelerator.

30
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,840
We could do an episode about that.

31
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,480
That would be fun.

32
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,080
But we sort of did Marvel Mania,

33
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,600
and maybe it's been, maybe wait a little bit longer

34
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,560
to do more Marvel.

35
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,040
And then I thought, hmm, let's really go for it.

36
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,560
Let's really, you know, do something,

37
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,680
because Scott said something that would be very good

38
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,480
for just you and Jason to do.

39
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,040
He said it, he spelled it out.

40
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,160
He basically told us what to do.

41
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,480
He told us what to do.

42
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,240
Yeah, he told us what to do,

43
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,040
and obviously you've probably read the title of this episode

44
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,140
so you know, and if you're a second gate member,

45
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,340
I mean, we'll fill you in

46
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,560
in case this is your first second gate episode,

47
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,920
because you're probably very confused.

48
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,760
But I assume if you're behind the paywall,

49
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,460
you know what's going on today.

50
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,100
We, of course, today then have decided,

51
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,240
with Scott's blessing,

52
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,340
even though he does not know what we're doing,

53
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,880
he does not know the name of this and why,

54
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,840
he knows why, but he doesn't know what we're doing,

55
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,680
we of course are talking about Casamigos tequila,

56
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,520
the tequila created by George Clooney

57
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,480
and Cindy Crawford's husband, Randy Gerber.

58
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,040
That is what we're talking about today.

59
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,320
I believe the first time we talked about this

60
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,560
was the Downtown Disney ordeal with Nick Mundy,

61
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,280
am I correct here?

62
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,040
I was thinking about that right before we were recording to it

63
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,760
and I believe that is the first time it came up, yes.

64
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,760
And I'm not even quite sure how we got there, you know?

65
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,640
I don't remember how we got there either, yes.

66
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,760
I don't remember, you can hear I'm out of breath

67
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,240
because I've done more prepping for this

68
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,320
than I think I've done for a podcast in a while,

69
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,720
maybe since the Downtown Disney ordeal.

70
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,200
There's a lot of moving parts is what I'm saying.

71
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,640
So yeah, we don't exactly know,

72
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,920
all I know is that I started talking about

73
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,200
Cindy Crawford's husband, Randy Gerber's tequila,

74
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,360
and everyone except for Jason got upset with me.

75
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,480
Yeah, because I knew the story about how

76
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,760
not only did they start this tequila brand,

77
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,760
when they sold it for $700 million with a possible 300 million

78
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:39,120
depending on sales performance over the next decade.

79
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,320
I knew that when they did that,

80
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,280
George Clooney invited the boys,

81
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,600
there's about 14 of them, the boys.

82
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,960
And he invited his crew to his house, September 20th, 2013.

83
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,480
A date that will live in infamy.

84
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,000
A date that will live in infamy.

85
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,040
You celebrate that day by getting a briefcase.

86
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,320
I do, yeah.

87
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,080
And then on September 14th,

88
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,040
I returned the briefcase to Joseph A. Bank.

89
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,600
That's fair, yeah.

90
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:13,160
And inside that briefcase in $20 increments

91
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,760
was a million dollars for all the boys.

92
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,960
And he said, I know, you know, there are people,

93
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,280
some of these boys were living paycheck to paycheck.

94
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,440
We're really struggling.

95
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,480
And he said, you don't have to worry about

96
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,560
your kids' college, you don't have to worry about

97
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,480
paying your mortgage, you're all taken care of.

98
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,120
You know, essentially we're all millionaires now.

99
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,680
And Randy Gerber, he's tequila co-founder,

100
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,840
was like, I don't feel good about taking this money.

101
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,880
And George said, there's one rule.

102
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,560
If you don't take it, no one gets it.

103
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,520
And so Randy had to take it.

104
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,760
And you know what else I just learned today?

105
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:51,760
September 13th, 2014, George married them all.

106
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,200
Right.

107
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,520
One year later.

108
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,640
Two significant days.

109
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,960
Two significant days.

110
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,240
On the same day.

111
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,080
Oh, the same day.

112
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,920
A year apart.

113
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,800
So what's funny about this is that you just told this story

114
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,200
and that story you knew, you had that locked away.

115
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,000
You would never share that with me or anyone maybe.

116
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,640
I do have to correct myself.

117
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,120
It's September 27th.

118
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,120
I just got so excited.

119
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,480
I got so excited.

120
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,520
I remember 2013.

121
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,800
People are already upset because they know all of the facts

122
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,520
and information about this topic.

123
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,120
And they're gonna be very upset if we get anything wrong.

124
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,000
So we have to correct ourselves if we do.

125
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,760
So you had that piece of information in your head.

126
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,760
I didn't know that piece of information.

127
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,600
I never heard that story before.

128
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,240
I just knew a couple of years prior,

129
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,120
I saw giant trucks with pictures of George Clooney

130
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,480
and some guy on a motorcycle.

131
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,760
And I thought it was funny.

132
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,960
I was like, what is this?

133
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,120
This is ridiculous.

134
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,720
And it said Casa Migos Tequila.

135
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,640
And I did a little investigating

136
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,240
and found that it was George Clooney

137
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,440
and Randy Gerber's tequila company.

138
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,560
And I have photos.

139
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,160
I proved this on Twitter a month or two ago.

140
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,360
I have photos a couple of years prior

141
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,720
to doing the podcast even.

142
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,440
Maybe one year prior to starting the podcast

143
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,640
of pictures of me and the truck.

144
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,840
And they're on Twitter.

145
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,240
I forget which thread it was.

146
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,400
I was thinking I was posting them to Scott.

147
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,120
So I have been a big fan of the idea of this

148
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,040
for a long time.

149
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,360
And I think if we really break it down,

150
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,240
I am a big fan of celebrity endorsed drinks,

151
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,440
spirits, restaurants.

152
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,040
We just mentioned not too long ago,

153
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,840
there was a restaurant that had Grandpa

154
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,880
from the Munsters on it in Jersey.

155
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,680
It was called Grandpa's apparently.

156
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,120
And Al Lewis, the actor who played Grandpa

157
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,640
did not own this place.

158
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,640
He would just sort of be the greeter

159
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,440
and he made some deal with the owner.

160
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,760
So I love anything like that.

161
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,440
Jimmy Buffett, of course, my personal hero,

162
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,840
did this better than anybody.

163
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,320
So anytime I see it, I think it delights me

164
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,400
for some reason.

165
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,520
I don't know if it's because it's just insane.

166
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,040
If I'm thinking, how much money do you guys need?

167
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,800
Is that like, that might be part of it?

168
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,560
That's probably part of it.

169
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,680
That's probably part of it too.

170
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,560
And I think there's the implicit,

171
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,000
just the endorsement makes it seem like,

172
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,960
well, and these guys know good stuff.

173
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,160
They wouldn't just slap their name on something.

174
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,240
Well, right, of course.

175
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,760
No one would just slap their name on anything like that.

176
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,880
Yes, there's a pretension to all of this

177
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,080
that I really like where the commercials for Customigos,

178
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,880
which we'll get into, the commercials,

179
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,720
George and Randy are out in the fields with the workers

180
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,240
and they're just breaking bread and drinking tequila.

181
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,360
They're just the regular guys.

182
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,840
They're just all in the same tax bracket.

183
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,400
They're all enjoying the same luxuries of life together.

184
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,960
And these just-

185
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,480
They're all on the same level.

186
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,800
And as I'm sure we'll get to,

187
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,800
another character has opted to do the exact same thing.

188
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,320
Yes, I think I know what you're talking about.

189
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,640
We'll get to that person.

190
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,760
But I think real quick first, what we should do,

191
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,400
and now this came out not long ago,

192
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,000
I think on a main, no, I think it was a Patreon episode,

193
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,440
that I had not tried Customigos tequila.

194
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,600
And that sent Scott into a rage.

195
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,480
He was very upset.

196
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,320
Yeah.

197
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,120
Because I think he thought my love of Customigos

198
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,720
had anything to do with the actual tequila, and it doesn't.

199
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,000
Absolutely not, no.

200
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,120
It has nothing to do with it.

201
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,040
And I pulled a U in that instance and I said,

202
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,080
well, anytime I wanted to get it as a bid, I go,

203
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,640
ooh, $45, I don't need this bit that bad.

204
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:02,640
Yeah, I famously, I hate spending money on comedy.

205
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,800
I feel like there are such easy ways to beg, borrow, steal

206
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,800
in comedy, especially when we were coming up at UCB.

207
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,400
It almost guarantees, at a sketch comedy theater,

208
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,200
the more money you spend on a character or a sketch,

209
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,400
the harder it's gonna, if it bombs,

210
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,440
it just stinks so much worse if you spend $100.

211
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,840
I hear what you're saying.

212
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,880
To be fair to this, it's like tequila,

213
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,160
you're not gonna throw the tequila out.

214
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,800
You can actually drink it.

215
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,920
That is true.

216
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,360
You could have a nice, oh, we're having a special night.

217
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,960
Let's crack open the Customigos, darling.

218
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,200
Yes, much more justified.

219
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,760
Yeah, because I came across a bottle

220
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,040
at the hotel gift shop in Vegas, and I was like,

221
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,440
should I, and I'm like, God knows how much the pens

222
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,040
in this gift shop cost a lot of money.

223
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,920
You and I did a show at UCB theater many years ago

224
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,280
that did not get a run, we did it once,

225
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,200
and I bought a giant roach costume

226
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,360
that I still have somewhere.

227
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,520
It's a disgusting roach costume,

228
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,200
and it was very expensive.

229
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,800
Not very expensive, but expensive.

230
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,760
I was hoping that I would get to use it more than once,

231
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,800
and now it's just sitting in a Rubbermaid

232
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,720
in the storage area of the garage.

233
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,560
Yeah, that stings a lot more than all of the Bud Light

234
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,440
Platinum's we bought for Bud Light Platinum-based bits,

235
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,360
when that was at the height of its popularity.

236
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,480
Yes, you and I played Franklin and Bash in a bit

237
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,840
in a show at UCB, and we bought a case of 18

238
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,320
Bud Light Platinum bottles, and wheeled it out

239
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,760
in a Rubbermaid on stage, and did we hand,

240
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,240
I handed them out to the people on stage, I think?

241
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,920
Not the audience, we wouldn't do that.

242
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,360
We gave them to the judges, and I have to say,

243
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,840
I've been in the middle of the desert,

244
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:57,200
no one around for miles, and that was still not as quiet

245
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,640
as that audience reception to seeing Franklin and Bash.

246
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,760
Well, okay, we'll give everyone a little bit of the lore here,

247
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,360
of the friendship lore, and the performance lore.

248
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,640
Yeah, we did a show at UCB, I mean, I still do the show

249
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,320
when shows happen, called The Tournament of Nerds,

250
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,160
which is not unlike other shows.

251
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:20,160
I've done enough debate shows online, in theaters,

252
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,880
that I'm sure everyone is confused,

253
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,040
but the first one I ever did was something called

254
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,040
Tournament of Nerds, where you would compete as a character,

255
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,960
and you would argue and debate why one character

256
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,920
would beat the other, and I had a lot of success

257
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,200
at that show doing what one might call an ironic character.

258
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,800
One of my biggest victories in life was competing

259
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,800
as the character, is the NBC character, The Cape.

260
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,320
The superhero show from a decade ago, called The Cape,

261
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,640
and I basically just got a lot of mileage out of,

262
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,560
and I think this will surprise the listener,

263
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,800
just naming the other characters on The Cape.

264
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,600
Max Malini and his underground carnival of crime,

265
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,800
I believe that's the characters and the name there.

266
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,040
Ruby was a hypnotist, I believe.

267
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,840
Yeah, so anyway, so we were basically like,

268
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,560
oh man, Franklin and Bash is gonna kill,

269
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,520
and you would get a big laugh when you would come out,

270
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,320
and they announce your character, and you know,

271
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,440
if they said like, NBC's The Cape, we'd all, ha ha,

272
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,840
everyone's laughing, clap, they say,

273
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,760
and representing Franklin and Bash, and it's like crickets,

274
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,000
and then you and I come out on stage,

275
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,280
and it's as if no one heard of Franklin and Bash,

276
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:40,120
the hottest USA show at the time, Breckenmire,

277
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,760
and what, Paul Mark Gosseler, is that his name?

278
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,800
Mark Paul Gosseler.

279
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,320
I said his name, I'm sorry.

280
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,720
I sound like an old man now.

281
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,520
But yeah, so we've spent, yeah,

282
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,440
liquor comedy bits different, I think,

283
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,240
because at least you can enjoy some of it.

284
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,960
Yeah, for sure.

285
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,360
So yeah, so I revealed not long ago,

286
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,280
I had never had Casamigos, and Scott was like,

287
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,120
yeah, he was very frustrated because I think he thought

288
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,240
at the very least I must have tried this once,

289
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,200
and I hadn't.

290
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,200
But today, for you, the Patreon paywalled listeners,

291
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,720
Jason and I are going to try Casamigos tequila right now.

292
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,120
Yes.

293
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,200
And give you our first review, first sip review.

294
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,400
Jason was nice enough to go get, now he got tiny bottles.

295
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,480
I got the little airplane-sized bottles.

296
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,040
How much were these tiny bottles, if I may ask?

297
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,680
Well, Mike, the universe was there waiting

298
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,680
for us, knowing it was coming,

299
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,920
because they were all on sale when I went.

300
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,720
So one of these was $5, and one of them was $6.

301
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,120
Wow, pretty good.

302
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,120
Yeah, so we've got the Blanco and we've got the Reposado.

303
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,920
Now, I did a little bit of tequila research

304
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,080
because I always wondered what was the difference.

305
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:09,760
So Blanco is bottled right after fermentation,

306
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,880
or aged at maximum for two months.

307
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,560
Reposado is aged for more than two months,

308
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,720
up to a year maybe.

309
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,080
There is a third variety called Añejo,

310
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:27,080
which is aged much longer, and that they were sold out of.

311
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,680
And I was not going to a second Bevmo.

312
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,480
So I do-

313
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,840
Sorry, which one were they sold out of again?

314
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,320
The Añejo, I believe it's pronounced.

315
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:44,160
My high school Spanish is pretty far behind me,

316
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,720
but I'm trying my best.

317
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,920
Yeah, so now the thing with these tequilas, all of them,

318
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,760
because I was like, oh, do I need to get salt and lime?

319
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,560
And the more I researched,

320
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,920
and right on the Cosmica's homepage it says this,

321
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,520
this is a smooth, they wanted a smooth tequila.

322
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,160
Yes, they didn't want to burn.

323
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,080
This is what I found in my research as well.

324
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,240
No burn, that's what George and Randy wanted.

325
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,720
Yes, the salt and lime are used to cover up

326
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,480
the unpleasant taste,

327
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,240
which I guess is kind of similar to cheap whiskey

328
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,040
being covered up by Coca-Cola or ginger ale.

329
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,600
If you would indulge me,

330
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,640
I'll read what Randy even said about creating the tequila.

331
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,800
I wish you would.

332
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,720
Okay, here we go.

333
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,920
He said, Casamigos was created out of our desire

334
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,560
to drink the best tequila.

335
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,480
At the time, George and I were building homes in Mexico,

336
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,440
and as one does when you spend time in Mexico,

337
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,640
we were drinking a lot of tequila.

338
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,440
We would go to different restaurants and bars,

339
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,520
and bartenders would suggest different tequilas,

340
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,760
some really expensive, some not so expensive,

341
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,800
some good, some not so good.

342
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,080
They all had one thing in common, they burned going down.

343
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,880
With that, George turned to me and said,

344
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,880
why don't we just make our own,

345
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,240
one that's perfect for us?

346
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,880
So we did.

347
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,680
That's straight from Randy Gerber's mouth, folks.

348
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,360
That's the origin story of Casamigos.

349
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,480
And they also, a lot in the press,

350
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,360
if you read a lot of their press on their website,

351
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,560
it's a lot of like, we just were doing it for ourselves.

352
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,640
We didn't even intend to start a business.

353
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,720
Yes, they intended to just have a private label

354
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,400
for themselves and family and friends.

355
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,560
And then I'm sure someone swept in and was like,

356
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,200
you can make some real money on this.

357
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,920
Well, I think you're actually giving them a little too much.

358
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,640
My feeling is that story's bullshit.

359
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,480
That's entirely possible, yeah.

360
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,080
Celebrity restaurants, even more so celebrity liquor.

361
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,840
There's so many people where you're like,

362
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,960
Ryan Reynolds had a liquor company?

363
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,640
Yeah, my guess, and look,

364
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,640
I guess this is maybe sort of insulting George and Randy,

365
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,080
no disrespect.

366
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,760
My guess is the actual story is

367
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,840
they were both pulled into a meeting at CAA,

368
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,400
and they go, all right, here's what's selling.

369
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,080
Tequila, celebrity endorsements.

370
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,600
You guys sign on the dotted line here,

371
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,880
and we can make this happen.

372
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,360
And they go, okay.

373
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,880
I mean, I think it might be closer to that.

374
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,760
I don't know if George or Randy wanna come on podcast,

375
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,560
all right, I'd love it.

376
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,000
And I want them to tell me I'm full of shit,

377
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,960
if that's the case.

378
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,640
Yeah.

379
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,760
But that's the lore, that's the legend of Casamigos,

380
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,200
which I choose to believe.

381
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,360
Sometimes the legend is more important to believe

382
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,840
than the actual truth.

383
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,480
And I think we should believe the legend.

384
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,520
So, we have the tequila in front of us,

385
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,880
and I have two little glasses, and it's sipping.

386
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,000
You can sip it, which, because there's no burn.

387
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,120
Yeah, that's good.

388
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,080
I mean, we've done a number of episodes

389
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,280
where we've either imbibed beforehand or during.

390
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,320
I find I get very exhausted and sluggish,

391
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,880
and I feel bad I'm not being entertaining

392
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,800
to our wonderful listeners.

393
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:04,680
So, there'll be less of that kind of episodes burn,

394
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,440
if you will, and there'll be more just pleasant sipping.

395
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,600
So, I guess let's start with the Blanco.

396
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,560
That's the clear one?

397
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,040
Yeah, that's the clear one.

398
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,200
Because- I'll sip it right here,

399
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,360
and I'm gonna let the listener-

400
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,680
That is the least aged.

401
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,280
I will say now, this episode is coming to you

402
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,040
in binaural audio.

403
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,200
So, you can put on your headphones

404
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,920
and listen to Jason and I drink,

405
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,080
which is one of the greatest sounds you can ever hear

406
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,720
the human mouth make.

407
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,720
Very good, and I've poured some of mine over ice

408
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,760
because I do not particularly enjoy drinking lukewarm.

409
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,400
I mean, I'll drink lukewarm water, you know, if-

410
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,240
All day long.

411
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,960
I have to, I prefer cold beverages.

412
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,600
I do not like lukewarm beverages,

413
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,600
especially lukewarm liquor, so.

414
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,880
Okay, so here we go, here we go, listen up.

415
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:57,800
It is very smooth.

416
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,480
I will say, and I look, I'm not a huge drinker,

417
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,600
but I will say there's a slight tingle,

418
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,800
but it's nothing crazy.

419
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,680
It is- No.

420
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,960
It's not a burn, because he has a normal tequila.

421
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,560
I would be coughing like crazy right now.

422
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,160
Wow.

423
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,120
Wow, cool, you know what?

424
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:24,120
Kudos to George and Randy on fulfilling that promise.

425
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,960
Let's see if the other one does the same thing.

426
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,800
Yeah, and that was like the entry,

427
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,400
like Blanco is the, often mixed with something

428
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,000
because it's usually a cheaper one,

429
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,040
but that was pretty pleasant.

430
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,680
So let's try the middle grade.

431
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,720
All right, listen up.

432
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,720
Also pretty good.

433
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,720
Also the same level of, wow, interesting.

434
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,920
I mean, yeah, it's like, obviously,

435
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,600
you know you're drinking alcohol,

436
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,600
but if I were to straight, and these aren't freezing,

437
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,800
if I were to add a regular tequila,

438
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,640
that would have been crazy.

439
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,440
I would be going nuts right now.

440
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,760
I'd be going wild.

441
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,640
Wow, so they did it, so they did it.

442
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,960
They did it, they did a good job, yeah.

443
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,920
So I'm gonna go with the middle grade.

444
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,760
I'm gonna go with the middle grade.

445
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,840
They did it, they did a good job, yeah.

446
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,560
And one of the facts I like is that,

447
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,560
they have sold the company, as we said,

448
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,840
they've sold the company,

449
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,160
but Randy still goes to the office every day.

450
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,280
They're still involved.

451
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,600
Oh, and they're still all over the website.

452
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,760
Like, you know, when they sold to,

453
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,680
do you know how to pronounce the name of this company

454
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,280
they sold to?

455
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,120
I mean-

456
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,120
You do it.

457
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,280
Well, we'll all probably be working for this company.

458
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,880
I was trying to remember this company came up

459
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,280
on the Downtown Disney or Deal,

460
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,600
because one of the themes for me on that

461
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,920
was just how like, oh yeah,

462
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,200
there's only five companies that own everything.

463
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,280
I don't know if it's Dege-Gio or J-Gio.

464
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,840
It's a massive, oh no, De-A-Gio, I think it's-

465
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,680
De-A-Gio?

466
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,120
I'm gonna guess it's De-A-Gio.

467
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,760
This is a massive beverage concern

468
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,480
that owns like Johnny Walker,

469
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,040
black and white Scotch,

470
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:19,480
Walt Disney, famously loved black and white Scotch.

471
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,600
What else do they own?

472
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:25,600
They own Bullet, and Seagram Seven Crown, and Crown Royal,

473
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,200
Smirnoff, Captain Morgan,

474
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,840
Bailey's, a liquor-

475
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,040
Whoa, a liquor called Sheridan's.

476
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,880
I do not know about this liquor.

477
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,320
Is it spelled like yours?

478
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,800
Yes, it sure is.

479
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,480
Oh my God, do you have a liquor?

480
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,880
I guess so.

481
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,440
Gosh, and that's gonna step all over a bit later.

482
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,520
They also own Don Coolio,

483
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,880
so they already own a tequila.

484
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,520
How did you not know about Sheridan's?

485
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,520
And it's got a bottle that looks like a dick and balls.

486
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,640
Holy shit.

487
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,680
Holy shit.

488
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,360
Do you see this?

489
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,280
Let me see, send it, screen share it.

490
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,360
Holy, whoa, folks, this is an unplanned,

491
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,680
this is the magic of Podcast The Ride, here we go.

492
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,320
Is that not?

493
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,360
Wow, that is,

494
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:25,240
yeah, that is not an aesthetically pleasing bottle.

495
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,600
So it's a coffee layered liqueur,

496
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,440
and it's got two different sides.

497
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,960
It's almost like the ketchup and mustard in the same pack,

498
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,960
or the peanut butter and jelly in the same bottle,

499
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,920
but it's got two separate things,

500
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,560
and it's got, I assume, vanilla on the top,

501
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,560
and that would be the top of the penis shaft.

502
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,840
And then the bottom, where the scrotum is,

503
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,680
is full of coffee.

504
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,280
The jug's full of coffee layered liqueur.

505
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,920
Yeah, sorry.

506
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,480
And still has a foreskin.

507
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,680
Let's be clear, this bottle is not circumcised.

508
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:09,680
Okay, so Sheridan's coffee layered liqueur

509
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,080
is a bottle that has a vanilla top coffee cream shaft,

510
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,200
a coffee scrotum, and a coffee foreskin.

511
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:26,280
This is a shocking and unpleasant discovery.

512
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,560
This is the greatest thing to happen to the podcast

513
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,240
in a long time, I feel.

514
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,200
Maybe since the Downtown Disney ordeal.

515
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,480
I guess everyone's getting a bottle of Sheridan's

516
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,120
for Christmas.

517
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:36,960
I do-

518
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,400
How do you not know about this?

519
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,400
I don't know.

520
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,640
I guess I just need to Google my name.

521
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,880
I just keep getting, like, anytime I've gotten

522
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,080
a Google alert for my name recently,

523
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,560
it's just been about this guy who runs gyms in England,

524
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,520
who's like, I sure hope I can reopen gyms soon.

525
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:59,200
But there's no discourse around Sheridan's

526
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,280
coffee layered liqueur.

527
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,120
Oh, wow.

528
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,880
You need to be a spokesman for this.

529
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,720
Yeah, I mean, I wonder if it's good in,

530
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,320
I do like a splash of like Amaretto or Jameson in my coffee.

531
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,480
So when you take off the foreskin, the coffee foreskin,

532
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,120
I wonder, yeah, how does it, how, what does it look,

533
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,280
let me look, let me find it.

534
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,520
Let me look what it looks like without the foreskin

535
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,600
or when it's fully engorged.

536
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,800
I think that foreskin is important though.

537
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,440
I think it comes out.

538
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,280
I think it comes out.

539
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,280
Oh yeah, you're right.

540
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,520
Look it, I got a picture here.

541
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,360
See it here?

542
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,840
Yeah, twists.

543
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,640
I think they have that cap on,

544
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,840
so you get both simultaneously.

545
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,080
Okay, so the foreskin twists

546
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:53,080
and then you can get a good blend of the coffee and vanilla.

547
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:57,520
Wow, it's got a scrotum reservoir.

548
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,680
This is insane.

549
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,880
Why wouldn't it just be the same?

550
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,160
Why wouldn't it be symmetrical?

551
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,600
This is like we're back in Europe for you

552
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,600
except we're in the highlands of Jalisco, Mexico.

553
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,440
I reverted back last week, but now I'm back.

554
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,720
Seeing this penis bottle with your name on it

555
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,400
has got me really excited.

556
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,320
Wow, look, I guess it's obviously, it's more coffee based

557
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,760
because that's, you want more of that in the drink

558
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,360
than you want the cream or the vanilla, whatever it is.

559
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,520
Yeah, but you don't see it like Bailey's

560
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,320
is just a regular bottle, you know?

561
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,280
Right.

562
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,920
God, are there commercials where it's like,

563
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,240
hi, hello, I'm Jason Sheridan.

564
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,240
I created Sheridan's.

565
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,880
I molded the bottle after a certain appendage.

566
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,040
Someone, there is a video of the pouring.

567
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,280
Someone did record the pouring.

568
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,920
Wow, well, we have to figure out

569
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,000
what to do with this information.

570
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,640
Yeah. I don't know.

571
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,920
This is really throwing me for a loop

572
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,120
because I had a whole plan here

573
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,920
and this is actually so exciting.

574
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,000
You know?

575
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,960
But yeah, all right, well, we'll come back.

576
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,160
We'll do the research and come back to this

577
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,360
at a different time.

578
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,640
Well, sir, go back.

579
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,880
The other surprising thing to learn about this beverage,

580
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,960
like massive beverage company,

581
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:24,240
they also own Guinness and Harp.

582
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,880
Like they own beers, too.

583
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,360
They own so many and I forget.

584
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,560
InBev is one of the other big beverage conglomerates,

585
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:37,000
but yeah, everyone owns,

586
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,640
everything is owned by something nowadays.

587
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,200
InBev sounds like a Skynet type company.

588
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,040
Yeah.

589
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,240
InBev and the bottles will come to life.

590
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,080
Yeah, so they're owned by that company,

591
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:55,080
but George and Randy still taste every batch.

592
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,880
Oh.

593
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,720
That's what I read.

594
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,600
That's what they say.

595
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,760
I don't know how that works.

596
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,720
I don't know how big the batch is.

597
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,720
I assume pretty big.

598
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,120
You wouldn't think that they,

599
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,760
that George and Randy took a little swig

600
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,200
of each of these little bottles before we got to them.

601
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,240
And then they put the cap back on and then-

602
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,560
They put the cap back on.

603
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,960
Put the plastic.

604
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,080
Randy Gerber like took his tongue and just like,

605
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,880
licked the outside of the bottle

606
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,000
and then screwed it back on and put it in the Bevmo?

607
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,240
I did see, you know,

608
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,320
I think we went into the Mexico Pavilion real quick

609
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,560
when we were in Epcot last fall.

610
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:34,680
And I got an avocado margarita to go,

611
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,160
cause I mean, they make really good margaritas there.

612
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:42,160
And then they do have the Casa Amigos varieties

613
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,880
on the menu,

614
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,320
but not in any mixed drinks

615
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,200
because they're sipping tequila.

616
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:53,200
So you're not gonna bury it in a mixed drink?

617
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:57,120
We had the mixed drinks there at Epcot last time,

618
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,480
which I was a little,

619
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,040
it's easier to go to the bar.

620
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:00,880
If you don't know what we're talking about,

621
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,840
there's a tequila bar in the Mexico Pavilion

622
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,120
and Epcot Center in the World Showcase.

623
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,760
And it's the greatest,

624
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:10,400
it's still I think my favorite pavilion probably.

625
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,600
I mean, just being able to be like transported

626
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,040
to like a night market in the sky.

627
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,840
There's the restaurant there.

628
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,720
There's of course the Mexico Boat Ride,

629
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,880
Scott's name for it.

630
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,960
There's a lot of like great,

631
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,120
like artisanal toys and neat stuff.

632
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,680
And then there's also, yeah,

633
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,880
there's this little tequila bar,

634
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,400
which is a nice little hole in the wall,

635
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,680
which is what you kind of want.

636
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:38,240
Like the stuff that we kind of pine for,

637
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,680
I think at these theme parks and stuff,

638
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,600
I'm gonna do a little theme park talk here,

639
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,880
is like things like that,

640
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,200
that feel kind of special,

641
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,320
like Abracadabra over on the boardwalk.

642
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,880
It's like, it's tiny, it's small.

643
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,440
It feels like this is a little thing you found.

644
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,400
And that's the same way that the tequila bar

645
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,800
in the Mexico Pavilion is.

646
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,920
But it's hard to get a seat in there,

647
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,000
because it's so small.

648
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,480
So we only did, they only give you like the mixed drinks

649
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,120
when you're just walking up to the bar

650
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,800
to order and then leave, which is what we were doing.

651
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,440
But yes, I would have loved to sip Casamigos

652
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,800
sitting in there.

653
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,760
Yes, I believe we guzzled that down,

654
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,800
left the building, or like I was in the process

655
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,320
of guzzling it down or eating like,

656
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,360
eating something from a food stand.

657
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,680
And Scott and Eric right shortly thereafter were like,

658
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,760
we're having a baby.

659
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,920
And I was like, oh, oh wow.

660
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,640
Mouthful.

661
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,800
Mouthful of avocado or raclette or something.

662
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,280
Mm-hmm.

663
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:46,680
That is, yeah, that is like right outside that pavilion

664
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,320
is where we found out.

665
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,160
Yeah.

666
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,120
Last year.

667
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,480
So we will always remember that spot.

668
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,960
Mere yards away from where I saw the Baja Men.

669
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,800
Yeah.

670
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,480
I mean, hundreds of, maybe hundreds of yards,

671
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,640
but not far.

672
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:07,240
Casamigos, the Baja Men, the miracle of life,

673
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,200
everything happens at Epcot.

674
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,040
The World Showcase,

675
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,880
I've said this probably on the show before,

676
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,920
the World Showcase is the one thing from Disney World

677
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:20,160
that I would trade a lot from Disneyland for.

678
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,920
I think that's fair.

679
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,720
As an adult, obviously,

680
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,400
to be able to have like a World Showcase,

681
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,880
obviously they were gonna do a version of it with Westcott,

682
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,240
which didn't get built.

683
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:35,760
But that is the one thing I go, oh man,

684
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,640
I really, I would trade, I would trade big for that.

685
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,120
I think.

686
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,640
Would I trade, let me see, let me think about this.

687
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,280
Would I trade in Credit Coaster?

688
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,880
Okay, what would be the fair trade?

689
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,440
I would trade in Credit Coaster, Sorin,

690
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,640
the whole pier, Toy Story, Midway Mania.

691
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,520
These are all rides I like a lot.

692
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,480
I don't wanna give up Guardians.

693
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,760
So that'll be the only E-ticket there.

694
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,080
They can have the Quinjet.

695
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,600
They can have the newly installed Quinjet

696
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,320
that they finished before they finished Sidewalks.

697
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,440
Yes, I saw that.

698
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,720
Well, it's harder to get a giant jet up there

699
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,080
than it is to pave some sidewalks.

700
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,840
I think I would be okay with the trade-off.

701
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,520
Bye-bye in Credit Coaster, bye-bye Sorin,

702
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:33,520
bye-bye Midway Mania, bye-bye Raft Ride.

703
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,480
And then the whole pier, if you could put in

704
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:41,080
at least like 75% of a World Showcase.

705
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:41,920
Yeah.

706
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,960
There'll still be one or two rides in there too,

707
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,600
but the space is not gonna have it.

708
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,360
It's not gonna be able to be like a giant in Credit Coaster.

709
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,920
I think that's fair.

710
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,000
Maybe I'm crazy.

711
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,840
I think that's fair.

712
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:57,280
I mean, you definitely, you gotta give away a lot.

713
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,080
You gotta back the truck up, you know,

714
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,360
cause you're doing it.

715
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:04,200
It's like when you would trade like five superhero cards,

716
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,160
like five trading cards for one card that like,

717
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,400
I really want this one, you know?

718
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:13,640
Yeah, you gotta make it so you can't turn the deal down.

719
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,480
Yeah.

720
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,360
You have to make the deal undeniable.

721
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,040
So yeah, I think that's, yeah, with World Showcase.

722
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,480
All right, stop the theme park talk.

723
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,320
Back to celebrity tequila.

724
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,760
So yeah, so we're having this.

725
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,840
I will say as I'm drinking it,

726
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,760
I think the Blanco is better.

727
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,840
Yeah, I'm surprised.

728
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,160
I think it's a little smoother.

729
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,720
To me, it feels like there's less,

730
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,400
it is smoother, the Blanco.

731
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,000
I think some of them as their age

732
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,960
are aged in bourbon barrels,

733
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:50,120
which I don't really like bourbon anymore.

734
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,280
Like I think that's what I drank.

735
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,120
I drank Jack and Coke a lot when I first started,

736
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,440
like became like 21 and I just didn't,

737
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,800
it was just so sweet.

738
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,360
And now I like, I like like rye or scotch,

739
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,760
but I really haven't drank that much during quarantine.

740
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,680
We were drinking White Claws a lot at the start.

741
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,120
Yeah, I was drinking some White Claws at the start.

742
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,880
I haven't in a while.

743
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,440
I had been drinking like sparkling water and vodka,

744
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,640
but then I realized it was like bubbling my stomach

745
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,400
up too much, I think.

746
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,480
That is a pro, you can give yourself a stomach ache

747
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,080
with too much seltzer, yeah.

748
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,560
Cause like I'm stressed.

749
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,280
It's not so much probably even the alcohol.

750
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:30,040
It's just that like I go downstairs to like stress drink,

751
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:33,640
like diet cola or sparkling water.

752
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,040
Like I think there's a,

753
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,360
I'm trying to like nervously do something.

754
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,240
Oh, sure, yeah.

755
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,200
So I kind of stopped, well, I'm at once in a while,

756
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,040
but yeah, rye, I like rye.

757
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,200
I like that bullet rye a lot.

758
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,040
I like that a lot.

759
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:54,800
I like it on the rocks with a twist of lemon.

760
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:59,440
So then that's a little tip, a little complicated

761
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,480
cause then you got to keep lemon in the house,

762
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,480
which I do something nice to have lemon in your water,

763
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,960
you know, change it up.

764
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,280
Good antioxidants.

765
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,480
Nice to have lemon in the house, I think.

766
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,320
Not that expensive.

767
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,720
Lemon's not that expensive.

768
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,560
No.

769
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,320
Yeah, so I am finding the Blanco better.

770
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,160
The other one's good too though.

771
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,520
I will say I would actually probably be fine drinking

772
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,680
this Lukewarm as well.

773
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,520
Yeah.

774
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,640
Cause it's getting there.

775
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,080
Do we want to talk about the third man a little bit?

776
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,560
I guess we should.

777
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,480
So I know everyone's thinking,

778
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,360
it's George Clooney or Annie Gerber, case closed.

779
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:39,920
Well, not so easy, not so fast, okay?

780
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:43,880
Cause there's a third partner and that person's name is,

781
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,680
is it Michael Meldman?

782
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,640
Yes, it's Michael Meldman.

783
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:52,640
So I started to look up Michael Meldman

784
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,560
cause I knew there was kind of like a third

785
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,280
less prominent partner.

786
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,840
And the first thing I came across was a Wall Street

787
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,600
journal article with the headline,

788
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,760
real estate party boy.

789
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,600
And I was like, okay, gotta shut this down

790
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,320
cause God knows what sort of sinister craps in this article.

791
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,720
Well, you didn't read it.

792
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,320
I read a lot of it and it's not,

793
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,200
they're not gonna put anything that bad in there.

794
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,440
Now for people that know, for people that watch the show,

795
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,640
Real Housewives, I know there's many versions,

796
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,920
this man was married to Brandy Glanville.

797
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,760
Oh, okay.

798
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,000
So that's a big connection for,

799
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,120
I think a big section of the,

800
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,280
I mean, a lot of people watch that show.

801
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,440
I don't watch, I've seen it.

802
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,960
I know some of the names.

803
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,960
I know people are mad at Denise Richards right now.

804
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,840
I know Lisa Rinna is mad at Denise Richards.

805
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,560
Do you know that?

806
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,040
Is that a familiar thing to you?

807
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,120
I did not know that.

808
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,160
Okay.

809
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,720
I'm not sure exactly why.

810
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,240
I just sort of absorbed this like via people

811
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:55,160
or if I've CTMC, if I'm like going by and I see TMZ.

812
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,960
So yes, she's not married to this Michael Meldman anymore,

813
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:02,080
but he is, I'll tell you what, he's a notorious party boy.

814
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,640
And he is somebody who claims to be

815
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,800
one of the best beer pong players in the world.

816
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,400
Oh, he's too old to be claiming that.

817
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,320
He's probably almost 60, I think.

818
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,160
Yeah.

819
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,800
That's not, yeah, that's not,

820
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,600
that's not a game our parents enjoyed.

821
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,880
No, I don't, I feel like at most,

822
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,320
maybe they played quarters.

823
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,760
I am not even sure of the rules of quarters.

824
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,720
Yeah, beer pong, I mean,

825
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,520
I was first introduced to it in college.

826
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:37,200
It's a gross game, first of all.

827
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,760
I immediately, like at 18, I was like, oh, this is gross.

828
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,240
Oh, everyone just shared.

829
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,320
In case the kids today, I know we have a big,

830
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,120
of course, youthful audience, I assume.

831
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,920
It's a game where you put, I think is it six cups out,

832
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,800
almost like it's their bowling pins,

833
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,760
six red solo cups,

834
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,240
and you fill them with a little bit of beer,

835
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,320
and you throw, basically, there's the same configuration

836
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,760
on each side of a table.

837
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,360
And then you take turns throwing ping pong balls

838
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,680
across the table to try to get them in every beer

839
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,880
so your opponent has to drink each beer.

840
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,160
Yes, and there's two cups of water, rinse cups.

841
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,480
And there's two rinse cups, because we know that really,

842
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,160
so you take the ball out of one of the beers

843
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,040
and you rinse it, and that really cleans it.

844
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,880
That sterilizes it immediately.

845
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,520
It's amazing this game did not cause a pandemic

846
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,480
before the current pandemic, you know?

847
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,320
That's true.

848
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,960
I assume, though, it's helping the current pandemic along.

849
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,840
Now the colleges are open, though.

850
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:40,000
Oh, yeah, it's helping them open for two weeks and go,

851
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,480
all right, we are immediately going back to online classes.

852
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,560
Everyone has three days to move out of their dorm rooms

853
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,840
before they are charged.

854
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,800
Yeah, I think that if the CDC would do

855
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,440
some more investigating, they would see that ping pong balls

856
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,200
carry COVID-19 very successfully.

857
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,400
One time I was at a place called O'Shea's in Las Vegas,

858
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:05,000
and they've rebranded O'Shea's, I forget in which hotel,

859
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,120
but it was just on the strip and it was a real shithole.

860
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
And they had beer pong in the back by the subway,

861
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,480
by the restaurant, the subway.

862
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,560
I was like, who's doing this here?

863
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:23,520
That's my favorite trick of the Vegas establishments.

864
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,560
I mean, they're all in a tough spot right now.

865
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,280
I think a lot of them are opened.

866
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,160
I think they opened with a lot of offerings

867
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:32,920
and have scaled back, similar to the way LA

868
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,280
kind of scaled back.

869
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,960
But even like, I think Caesar's is a pretty nice,

870
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,320
it's not the nicest casino anymore,

871
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,200
but I think it's pretty nice.

872
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,800
I guess it's very big.

873
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,600
That's the big defining thing of Caesar's now.

874
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,560
It's got like six towers.

875
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:52,480
But the ones, most casinos,

876
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,200
hotel casino resorts have a food court in them

877
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,560
that is just truly like feed your id.

878
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:04,560
Like here's a Krispy Kreme, here's a like a Sbarro's

879
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,120
and at like the nicer casinos,

880
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:12,120
it's like pizza by the slice by Buddy Velasco,

881
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,640
the cake boss, you know?

882
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,920
I have a photo of you and a giant cake boss, right?

883
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,320
Or no, no, I have you and Emeril maybe.

884
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,560
I think so because we stayed at the Venetian once

885
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,440
for a bachelor party and they had massive,

886
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:31,000
like two story murals of like the Bouchon guy.

887
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,680
You and cake boss and you and Emeril,

888
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,240
I think I have a photo of.

889
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,360
I should find those.

890
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,200
I think so.

891
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,920
And then there was a real like acclaimed

892
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,080
Michelin star chef next to them.

893
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,000
But of course everyone went to pictures by the TV people.

894
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,760
Yeah, with Bam, the Bam band.

895
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,280
Bam, yeah.

896
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,440
Yes, in Vegas, Lindsay and I were in Vegas,

897
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,480
when was it, last August?

898
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,200
And we were trying to get something to eat so quickly

899
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,840
and we were like right before a show,

900
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,080
maybe it was before Copperfield.

901
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:02,160
And it was like, are we gonna go to this

902
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,520
like Philly cheesesteak place

903
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,280
that's in this like mall looking?

904
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,920
And then we're like, ah, this looks like shit.

905
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,480
And then we're like, well, what about this pizza

906
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,040
at the place that's not even Sabaro level?

907
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,280
And then we like got in and we're like,

908
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,800
God, this like, this all sucks.

909
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,720
This is all really bad.

910
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:23,120
I mean, that's the innovation of putting an Italy in Vegas

911
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,120
is that like, if you're in a pinch,

912
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,560
you just go into Italy and walk right up to anything

913
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,680
and it's delicious.

914
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,440
Like. Oh, Italy.

915
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,280
It's very good.

916
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,840
That's the Park MGM is like the last one to open.

917
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,520
Yeah. Still closed.

918
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,760
I long for that Park MGM cause I went twice.

919
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,720
I was stayed there twice last year

920
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,720
and probably would have stayed there again in May

921
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,160
for when there was another wrestling pay-per-view.

922
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,680
I, we, yeah, we, I had such a great time.

923
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,720
We had such a great time in February when we were there.

924
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:54,760
And I was like, we're coming back in the spring.

925
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,840
Like.

926
00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:00,320
I like the idea of like gracefully going into my old age,

927
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:04,240
having like, well, that's the hotel we go to, the Park MGM.

928
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,720
That's the hotel we stay at.

929
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,720
And like, if somebody were to maybe suggest like,

930
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,840
oh, you know, there's a new hotel

931
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,480
they recently fixed up X Hotel.

932
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,640
I would be like, thank you for the suggestion,

933
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,880
but we don't stay there.

934
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,160
We stay at Park MGM.

935
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,320
That's what we do, which is a thing I see in old folks.

936
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,720
So I'm happy that that might be where I'm headed.

937
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,720
Yeah. I feel like my family,

938
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,440
I feel like I've already been doing that

939
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,800
for a good portion of my life.

940
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,000
I feel like my family has primed me for that.

941
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,760
I feel we were a family who did that sort of thing.

942
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:38,400
I'm a little curious by like the other, there's like Vidara.

943
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,880
Some of the ones that are like,

944
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,720
oh, there's no casino in this hotel.

945
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,920
It's just a nice hotel.

946
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,400
I'm like, oh, that could be a nice change of pace.

947
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,440
Sure.

948
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,280
I mean, you seem to be like,

949
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,160
you're still actually more flexible.

950
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,000
You'll take a suggestion.

951
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,520
I mean, I think, didn't you go to Park MGM?

952
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,640
Cause I said, I stayed there and I liked it.

953
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,520
Well, and we had comps from those Vegas games.

954
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,360
Right.

955
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,040
So, and yes, you recommended that one.

956
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,440
And I think Jane had looked up that one.

957
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,760
It was like, this looks pretty nice.

958
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,320
And it's the most recently redone.

959
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,920
And yeah.

960
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,760
Yeah.

961
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,760
We had a nice time at the pool.

962
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,640
Anyway, it's not a Las Vegas podcast.

963
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:16,240
It's about celebrity tequila.

964
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,120
That's what we're doing here.

965
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,440
So Michael Meldman, he's a silent third partner.

966
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:27,120
He is a guy who builds like developments.

967
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,920
And I looked, look, I really struggled too to be like,

968
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,840
oh my God, I'm gonna find such a good tie-in

969
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:35,480
for theme parks and this topic.

970
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,520
And I go, oh, Michael Meldman, he develops things.

971
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,640
Surely he is involved with a theme park.

972
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,920
I don't think that's the case.

973
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,760
I think he just builds like big housing developments

974
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,400
for rich people and golf courses.

975
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,440
I think that's all he does.

976
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,280
Sure.

977
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,800
And that article is all about like,

978
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,280
oh, he's building another home.

979
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,360
All these fuckers are building like eight homes.

980
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,240
And it's like, oh, he built like a party barn.

981
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,800
And that's not verbatim what it says in the article,

982
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,400
but it's along those lines of like,

983
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,440
well, he likes the party and he bought a barn

984
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,320
that would be able to be converted into a rave space.

985
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:14,480
And if you wanted to have a host a foam party in the barn,

986
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,560
Michael Meldman would be able to do it.

987
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,520
If you got a little bit of funny money,

988
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:23,720
you build a man cave and then you build a she shed.

989
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:28,040
But if you really got money, you build a party barn.

990
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:28,880
Right.

991
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,040
A party barn, I think is a thing I guess.

992
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,080
I think we should coin that.

993
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,920
We should trademark that.

994
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,440
Cause I don't think that's a thing.

995
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,000
Yeah, I have to agree.

996
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:45,560
Podcast the Ride, well, we host a podcast about theme parks.

997
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,040
And of course we go on auditions.

998
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,040
We're also the leading purveyor of party barns.

999
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,040
We're in the party barn business.

1000
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,720
Sharks, listen, okay.

1001
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:57,640
So this is, you can use this for as a livery stable

1002
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:01,200
or keep your tractor in here when the elements are bad.

1003
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,120
But what if you just need to relax?

1004
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,680
You can use it for that too.

1005
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,320
Are you tired of just having horses in here?

1006
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,960
Horses are boring.

1007
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:11,800
Yeah.

1008
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,400
Why don't you replace those horses

1009
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,840
with industrial sized foam machines?

1010
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:20,240
Why don't you pump out a hundred gallons of foam

1011
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,520
per 30 minutes in this party barn?

1012
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,880
Let's get it going.

1013
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,360
Let's get, look, I mean, we're gonna get to,

1014
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,360
I'm teasing a little bit.

1015
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,640
We're gonna get to some pitches later,

1016
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,320
but let's get some investors in on this as well.

1017
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:39,560
Cause party barn, I don't know why I think Scott Storch

1018
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:42,760
should invest music producer Scott Storch.

1019
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:43,680
I don't know.

1020
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,560
Maybe it's just because I was looking at his Instagram

1021
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,720
year, hours ago.

1022
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,480
You know, you know all these guys.

1023
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:52,520
You're a big Scooter Braun defender.

1024
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:55,080
I'm a big fan of Scooter Braun.

1025
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,720
I think that he's got a lot of good ideas.

1026
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:02,000
I am, yes, I am fascinated with the elite world

1027
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,440
of celebrity and I guess really if we get to the core

1028
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:10,440
of it, like side celebrities, like Randy Gerber.

1029
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,400
Yeah.

1030
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,320
Who no one knows who that is when I say it.

1031
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:17,080
Yeah, he's like one of the richest men in America.

1032
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,640
He wields insane power.

1033
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,960
He, look, he's part of the Gerber group.

1034
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,200
We haven't even gotten there yet.

1035
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,600
He's part of the Gerber group that he owns

1036
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,840
with his brothers, Scott and Ken with two N's.

1037
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,720
That is true.

1038
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:34,080
Randy is spelled with an E and not a Y

1039
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:37,080
and Ken is spelled with two N's and not one N.

1040
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,040
I, you know, the Gerbers, they do,

1041
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:42,160
they do whatever they want.

1042
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,600
They do whatever they want.

1043
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,680
Scott is the one who I think, Scott Gerber,

1044
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:48,560
not Scott Gerber, Scott Gerber.

1045
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:52,000
Scott, do you think Scott Gerber maybe is the Scott Gerber

1046
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,600
of the Gerber group?

1047
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,120
Oh, maybe.

1048
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,240
What is the Gerber group?

1049
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,400
What is their line?

1050
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,240
What is their business?

1051
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,640
They do, okay, I have some more information about,

1052
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:04,800
well, I'll say they are in the hotel bar business.

1053
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,840
They started by making a bar called The Whiskey,

1054
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,240
which I believe was in New York

1055
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,480
and I should double check that.

1056
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,320
Not The Whiskey at GoGo, but a whiskey in like 1991.

1057
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:18,240
And they've basically made their like life's mission,

1058
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:22,080
putting fancy cocktail bars in hotels.

1059
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,200
That's what they do.

1060
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,320
That is funny because the prices are already

1061
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,800
so inflated at hotel bars.

1062
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,240
So then to inflate them further with like muddling,

1063
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,600
that's pretty funny.

1064
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,680
What's also funny about this to me is that

1065
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,560
when you're on vacation or when you're on a business trip

1066
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,440
and you're just like, I need a fucking drink

1067
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,120
because I'm on vacation or I'm on a business trip,

1068
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:49,040
you'll go to any garbage bar in a hotel.

1069
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,480
Like this is the easiest business you could possibly be in.

1070
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,440
Yeah.

1071
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:57,520
You and I could design a bar in five minutes right now.

1072
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,400
They could plug it into a big hotel

1073
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,240
that a lot of people go to and they'd be like,

1074
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,600
wow, that bar is really successful.

1075
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:04,600
It's like, well, yeah, no shit.

1076
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,200
It's a bar in a hotel.

1077
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:12,240
Yeah, a lot of like lights you can angle towards the liquor

1078
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,680
or like you light the liquor from below.

1079
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,520
There's a lot of black wood and black metal.

1080
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:20,800
Like just all the tricks, all the crap they did

1081
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,680
to like Johnny Rockets at CityWalk where you're like,

1082
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:28,320
oh, this is just a weird lifeless husk now.

1083
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,200
Now, yes.

1084
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,200
And now I'm not talking about the off the record bar

1085
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,800
slash club at the Park MGM in Vegas.

1086
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:36,800
That's a whole different story.

1087
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:37,960
I love that place.

1088
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:38,880
No, that was pretty fun.

1089
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,000
A little claustrophobic for my tastes.

1090
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,200
Definitely not going to be opening anytime soon.

1091
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,920
Did you go to the secret, did you go to the speakeasy room?

1092
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,360
Yes, because I had free drinks.

1093
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,720
I had free drinks to claim.

1094
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:55,280
And that was the bar that was the least crowded.

1095
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,120
Right.

1096
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:00,120
When we were in there, yeah, it was pretty crowded

1097
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:04,800
when we were in there in May and we saw a wrestler in there

1098
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:09,600
who kind of snubbed us, but I won't even get into who that was.

1099
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,520
No one that we ever have ever had on the podcast.

1100
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:15,560
So that's a whole different story.

1101
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:20,480
So yeah, but the Gerber group,

1102
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:25,560
they're like the podcast, the ride of Hotel Bars.

1103
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,520
So there's three of them.

1104
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:27,600
They're obviously all brothers.

1105
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,200
We are not brothers, but it's very similar.

1106
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:35,080
I feel like maybe Scott Gerber is a Scott Gardner.

1107
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:37,360
I feel like, look, and don't take this the wrong way.

1108
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:41,920
I think I'm the Randy Gerber of the group.

1109
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,760
Randy seems like the big picture guy.

1110
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,200
You're the big picture guy.

1111
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,480
And I do think that.

1112
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,480
But I look, I think this is a cop.

1113
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,400
You're the Ken.

1114
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:53,360
You're the Ken, Ken Gerber.

1115
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:54,200
I'll take it.

1116
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,040
Of the group.

1117
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:55,880
And Ken is successful as well.

1118
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:59,760
I believe there's the least information about him online,

1119
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,280
but I don't think that's bad.

1120
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,560
No.

1121
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,800
He's just, yeah, he's just sort of involved, you know,

1122
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,040
a little bit more in the shadows.

1123
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,760
He's not sort of the front.

1124
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,560
So I think that makes a lot of sense.

1125
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,920
I think that that lines up perfectly really.

1126
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,640
So yeah, that's where, so Randy, by the way,

1127
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,800
Randy was a model in the eighties.

1128
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:20,680
Oh.

1129
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,200
So that's how he got his start.

1130
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,440
I mean, his wife, Sidney Crawford, of course,

1131
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:27,240
probably the most famous supermodel of all time.

1132
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,240
There's been some drama with her kids.

1133
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,720
I don't think we need to get into it.

1134
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,960
There's been a dating Pete Davidson type

1135
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,720
of a situation going on.

1136
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,560
Uh-oh.

1137
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,480
You could read, you can read all about that in the TMZ.

1138
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:46,800
So yeah, but they, but George and Randy still involved

1139
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:50,960
and they're still very excited about Casamigos, I find,

1140
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,760
when I'm reading these interviews now,

1141
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:56,440
are all these interviews on the official Casamigos website?

1142
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:57,280
Yes.

1143
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,480
Yes, yes.

1144
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,600
And that's where I spent most of my time.

1145
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,680
And let's be clear, the Casamigos website,

1146
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,880
when you first open it,

1147
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,320
when you have to do the age check

1148
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,720
that you have to do for like liquor websites,

1149
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,120
you get a preview of what's coming.

1150
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:19,400
And that's George and Randy drinking in the field

1151
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,840
with their workers.

1152
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:21,680
Right.

1153
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,800
Just, you know, they're just one of the guys.

1154
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,240
I'm sure they're helping out.

1155
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:31,120
And then when you successfully enter that you are over 21,

1156
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,920
then you get the full website

1157
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,800
and the full picture is revealed.

1158
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,000
It becomes video, they're laughing,

1159
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,560
they're riding the bike, they're on the motorcycles,

1160
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:43,400
you know, they're having a good time.

1161
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,840
They're really haphazardly pouring drinks for people.

1162
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:51,000
Like that's a thing that I get really anxious about

1163
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,080
on these celebrity liquor websites

1164
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:55,440
where they're just like, yeah, pour a little,

1165
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,040
pour and they're spilling it.

1166
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,280
And it's like, guys, it's a premium product.

1167
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,720
Let's not waste it, come on.

1168
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,920
Well, of course, you know,

1169
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:06,200
you're from the school of John Taffer.

1170
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,800
And if you ever watched Bar Rescue,

1171
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:11,360
John Taffer is so concerned with overpouring.

1172
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,280
You know, when you do a regular drink,

1173
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,920
you're supposed to pour a sort of one shot worth,

1174
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,960
one shot's worth of alcohol in.

1175
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:20,120
Yeah, you do a, I think it's a four count.

1176
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,960
If you have the skills and you have the right,

1177
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,960
you know, lid funnel kind of thing,

1178
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:31,040
you can count to four and then you like do an arm movement

1179
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,240
and the air bubble stops the pour.

1180
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:34,280
Right.

1181
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:36,120
So yes, you're from that school

1182
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,960
and you just don't wanna see it go to waste.

1183
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:41,160
And also John Taffer of course says that, you know,

1184
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,640
if you start overpouring,

1185
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,120
people start getting too drunk

1186
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:45,400
and you start to get a situation

1187
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:47,280
where maybe people are acting crazy

1188
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,120
and you don't want that in your bar.

1189
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,360
That's a real liability.

1190
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:54,000
Then the bar's on the hook if someone gets, you know,

1191
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,600
over served or if someone starts a fight in the bar.

1192
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:00,560
And of course he would explain that by screaming it,

1193
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:02,920
which is what we love about John Taffer.

1194
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:03,760
Yes.

1195
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,920
Does he, did he probably vote for Trump?

1196
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,200
Yeah, sure he did.

1197
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,800
But other than that.

1198
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:15,040
Pretty much, and there are sharks on shark town,

1199
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:18,080
any business TV show person, it's just like,

1200
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,200
well, if they didn't vote for him,

1201
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,280
they're at least heavily benefiting

1202
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,320
from Donald Trump's policies.

1203
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:24,640
Yes.

1204
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:28,120
But yes, so overpouring is happening

1205
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:30,880
in those Casamigos ads.

1206
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:35,240
But you know what, let's get to some of the ads.

1207
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,200
Did you see these ads?

1208
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,000
The commercial? Have you seen these ads?

1209
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,400
Like the press, cause this website, wait,

1210
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,320
the press section, the House of Friends section,

1211
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:46,360
what are you talking about?

1212
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,480
Or like the advertisement section.

1213
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,560
I just looked on YouTube for Casamigos.

1214
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:53,760
What is House of Friends is loosely the translation

1215
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,480
for Casamigos, of course.

1216
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:59,480
Yes, and well the House of Friends tab gets you to see

1217
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:02,440
pictures of all the events that Casamigos sponsored

1218
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,680
and all of the brands friends.

1219
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,360
And there's an interesting thing,

1220
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:08,400
but let's stick to the press.

1221
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:09,240
Sure, you're right.

1222
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,320
I'm getting too excited about the topic.

1223
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:12,160
You're getting too excited.

1224
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,000
Let's go.

1225
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:17,840
So I just grabbed a couple of press clip-ics

1226
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,760
that I enjoyed.

1227
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:24,080
One is, do you know about the collaboration

1228
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,000
with the Omega watch brand?

1229
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,400
Oh, I don't actually.

1230
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,880
Thank you. Please enlighten me.

1231
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:29,960
I will. All right.

1232
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,760
I'm gonna share this screen with you.

1233
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:36,400
So Omega is a high end watch brand.

1234
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:39,720
And they did a collaboration with Casamigos.

1235
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,560
I'm sharing it with you now.

1236
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:43,880
It's a pretty standard,

1237
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:47,400
it's a Seamaster Planet Ocean watch.

1238
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,800
It's a pretty standard, like, you know,

1239
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,280
are they called chronometer?

1240
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:54,400
It's like a nice looking watch.

1241
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,080
You know, it's a nice kind of-

1242
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:56,920
Of course.

1243
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:01,680
Watch that someone on a boat or a pilot might have.

1244
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:06,600
Do you want to take a guess at what this watch,

1245
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:09,840
which by the way, has touches of turquoise,

1246
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:14,840
like the Casamigos brand, the Casamigos bottle.

1247
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,680
You can see Omega in turquoise

1248
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,720
and some other turquoise touches on the face.

1249
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:23,440
Can you guess what this watch retails at?

1250
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:29,520
I have to imagine it's very expensive.

1251
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,520
I keep, yes, okay.

1252
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,200
What is your definition for very expensive?

1253
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:37,000
Well, when we're dealing with the elites,

1254
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,520
when the world of your Randy's and your George's

1255
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:43,240
and the price point of their tequila already,

1256
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:46,120
which is not maybe necessarily for the common man,

1257
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:52,000
I would say this watch is $750.

1258
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:00,400
Okay, well by price is right rules, you did not go over.

1259
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,120
This watch retails for $11,600.

1260
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:04,960
What?

1261
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:05,800
Yeah.

1262
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,600
What does it do?

1263
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:08,880
It tells time.

1264
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:11,840
That's it?

1265
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:14,720
It's not even like a spy watch where you could kill a man

1266
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,520
with some piano wire inside?

1267
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,280
I mean, presumably it's very solidly made.

1268
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:23,920
So you can maybe, with force, it's like a blunt instrument.

1269
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,960
Okay, but there's nothing special

1270
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:28,720
other than it's got like the Casamigos logo on it?

1271
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:30,400
That's correct.

1272
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,240
It doesn't even have that.

1273
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:34,400
It just has touches of the Casamigos turquoise.

1274
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,240
Interesting.

1275
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:38,640
Can you still buy that?

1276
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:39,480
Do you know?

1277
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:44,400
I think you can, there are like resale websites

1278
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,000
and secondhand websites.

1279
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:50,040
Someone had a funny thread on Twitter

1280
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:55,040
where they talked about working an event at Oakley stores.

1281
00:55:55,880 --> 00:56:00,880
And they were like, I think it was Alex Q. Arbuckle.

1282
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:04,880
And he said, the people who collect Oakley sunglasses

1283
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,400
are very particular type of guy.

1284
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:12,400
And vintage Oakley sunglasses go for like $200 to $500.

1285
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,720
And that already seems like a lot

1286
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:17,920
to have the sunglasses Tom Cruise wore

1287
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,120
at the start of Mission Impossible 2.

1288
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:22,080
The style, not the authentic ones.

1289
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:24,480
I'm sure the authentic ones go for a lot.

1290
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:25,840
I hate to sidetrack.

1291
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,480
Did you see the stunt that they're planning

1292
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:29,440
for Mission Impossible 7?

1293
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,560
What is it?

1294
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:32,560
Oh, should I spoil it here?

1295
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,440
All right, here, let me give everyone

1296
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,360
like five seconds here to get out.

1297
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,320
Can I spoil it for you?

1298
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:39,720
Yeah, is this the space?

1299
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:40,560
This is not space.

1300
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:41,400
No, they're not going to space.

1301
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,240
That's a different movie apparently.

1302
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,440
That's a different movie.

1303
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,440
He's very interested in going to space.

1304
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:50,440
Elon Musk involved, which means bye-bye Tom.

1305
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:54,080
So Mission Impossible 7.

1306
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:55,720
All right, I'm going to give you everyone,

1307
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:56,880
if you don't want to hear the spoiler,

1308
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,720
I'm going to give you five seconds

1309
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:00,840
and then I'm going to start talking.

1310
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:03,880
One, two, three, four, five.

1311
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,800
So on the side of a cliff,

1312
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:08,040
there's a giant like evil Knievel ramp.

1313
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:10,040
Apparently Tom Cruise is going to motorcycle

1314
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:12,480
off the ramp and skydive off of it.

1315
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,720
There's photos online on Twitter.

1316
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,220
That's great.

1317
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:20,320
Yeah, I think he may also have be like attached

1318
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:23,400
to a helicopter, but I'm not sure if that's just for safety

1319
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,520
and they'll take that out later

1320
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:25,960
or that's part of it as well.

1321
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:28,480
Ace, he's got to recover from seeing Tenet

1322
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,520
in a movie theater first.

1323
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,640
If you have not seen the Tom Cruise video

1324
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,320
of him seeing Tenet in like England or something,

1325
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,680
highly recommended.

1326
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,520
He's like, oh, back to the movies.

1327
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,240
And then he's like very serious about it

1328
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,960
as if he's like making some sort of statement.

1329
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,320
Like he's wearing a mask and then somebody goes,

1330
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:47,320
so Tom, did you like the movie?

1331
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:48,560
And he goes, loved it.

1332
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,560
Like very sincere.

1333
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,040
Nothing he does is insincere.

1334
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:55,560
Anyway, it's interesting.

1335
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:59,640
Tom Cruise does not have a celebrity liquor.

1336
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:03,040
Well, I think Scientology does pride itself

1337
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:04,920
on a little on cleaner living.

1338
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:07,600
So I guess that's right.

1339
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:12,600
That was the woman who plays Veronica's mother on Riverdale.

1340
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,680
The story came out about her,

1341
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:19,520
about how she has like helped the FBI

1342
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,800
in like actual sex trafficking cases,

1343
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:24,000
like go undercover and stuff.

1344
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:24,840
Wow.

1345
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:27,560
But very like the last,

1346
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:32,160
and she volunteers, she has her own organization,

1347
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,440
volunteers her time.

1348
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,240
And either the last paragraph

1349
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,800
or second to last paragraph said,

1350
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:42,000
now she is a Scientologist and she says,

1351
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,320
the rumors about abuse in that organization

1352
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,320
are totally unfounded.

1353
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:47,160
Okay.

1354
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:49,000
Well, if she said it.

1355
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,360
She said it, you know.

1356
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,320
Hey, but you know,

1357
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:54,640
that's what I like about these celebrity liquor companies.

1358
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:57,400
You know, it's very richy, bougie,

1359
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,600
pretty harmless, you know, overall

1360
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:04,520
of like what rich people can do with their time and money.

1361
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:06,320
Yes, I agree.

1362
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:07,400
I mean, let me, you know what?

1363
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,000
I'm gonna call an audible here

1364
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,080
and I'm gonna give you a quiz.

1365
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:11,920
Would that be okay?

1366
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,560
It's not Potato or Jason.

1367
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:14,400
Okay, sure.

1368
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:15,320
Don't worry about that.

1369
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,440
That's for only for Marissa.

1370
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:17,280
That's fine.

1371
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:18,200
Yeah.

1372
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,880
I'm gonna give you a quiz.

1373
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:22,800
Is this a real celebrity liquor?

1374
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:23,640
Okay.

1375
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:26,560
Let me put my feet up like Randy is here.

1376
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:27,400
Oh my God.

1377
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:28,680
See, Randy plays a guitar too.

1378
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:29,680
Can you imagine?

1379
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:31,880
Can you imagine what it sounds like

1380
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:34,480
when Randy Gerber plays an A minor?

1381
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,080
Oh, I wonder what song he played for the reporters

1382
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:40,920
and photographer from Los Angeles Confidential Magazine

1383
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:43,720
where he's playing the guitar with his feet up.

1384
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:45,120
Okay, let's get to the quiz.

1385
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:47,880
You know, what's funny about this is that

1386
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:50,880
when you do this, I can't look at my notes.

1387
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:51,720
Oh, okay.

1388
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:54,760
So, okay, great.

1389
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:57,440
Okay, so we'll do a few of these here.

1390
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,040
So these are, you have to tell me

1391
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,400
if this is a real celebrity liquor

1392
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,440
or a fake celebrity liquor, all right?

1393
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:05,280
Okay.

1394
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,100
So very simple.

1395
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:06,940
We don't even have one.

1396
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:07,780
You're not playing against anyone,

1397
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:08,600
so it doesn't really matter,

1398
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,040
but everyone can play at home.

1399
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,160
Okay.

1400
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:15,960
Is it true that Bob Dylan has a celebrity liquor

1401
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:18,120
called Heaven's Door Whiskey?

1402
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,720
Is that true or false?

1403
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:25,500
I think that's true.

1404
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:27,720
You are correct.

1405
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:32,720
Bob Dylan does have a liquor called Heaven's Door Whiskey.

1406
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:35,160
Okay.

1407
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:37,660
All right, question number two.

1408
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:43,800
Does Billy Gibbons from ZZ Top

1409
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:46,920
have a liquor called Pura Vida?

1410
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:53,480
I think that one sounds a little too perfect.

1411
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:54,760
I'm gonna say false.

1412
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:56,960
That is true.

1413
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:00,080
Billy Gibbons does have a liquor called Pura Vida,

1414
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:03,480
which I did not write down what kind of liquor it is.

1415
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:04,300
Okay.

1416
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:08,380
Does, question three.

1417
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:13,380
Does Sting, the musician Sting, not the wrestler,

1418
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:18,460
have a brand of champagne called Champagne in a Bottle?

1419
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:23,940
False.

1420
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:26,380
That is correct.

1421
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:27,500
That is not real.

1422
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:28,340
That is made up.

1423
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:29,980
I made that up.

1424
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:32,940
Here, we'll do a couple more here.

1425
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:35,700
Does, question four.

1426
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:40,480
Does Marilyn Manson have his own brand of absinthe

1427
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,040
called Mansonth?

1428
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:46,540
That's gotta be true, right?

1429
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:47,500
That is true.

1430
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:48,420
Okay. Yes.

1431
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:53,540
Okay, let's do one more.

1432
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:55,980
Okay, question five.

1433
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:59,380
Does Judge Larry from the Anna Nicole Smith trial

1434
01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:04,380
have his own brand of gin called The Verdict Gin?

1435
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:08,140
Now, Judge Larry is still alive.

1436
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:09,540
Judge Wapner is dead.

1437
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:10,380
Is that correct?

1438
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:12,220
Judge Wapner is dead.

1439
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:14,180
Judge Larry, I believe, is still alive.

1440
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:15,500
I honestly did not check.

1441
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:21,780
I'll say that's false.

1442
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:22,620
You are correct.

1443
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:23,440
That is false.

1444
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,640
Judge Larry does not have his own liquor.

1445
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:29,460
Now, okay, so the game could go on and on.

1446
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:31,860
I formulated, or I tabulated,

1447
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:33,340
I don't know what you would say,

1448
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:38,340
a list of 40 different celebrity, real celebrity liquors.

1449
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:42,580
Martha Stewart, Chris Noth,

1450
01:02:42,580 --> 01:02:46,260
the Mr. Big from Sex and the City has a tequila.

1451
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:48,500
Luke Bryan has a lager,

1452
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:51,360
the Tulane American Golden Lager.

1453
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:54,540
Kenny Chesney has Blue Chair Bay Rum.

1454
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:57,900
George Strait has Codigo Tequila.

1455
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:00,940
Ludacris, of course, has Conjured Cognac.

1456
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:06,860
Robert De Niro, VDK, A, 6100.

1457
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:08,580
And then, of course,

1458
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:10,060
you know what I should have done in the quiz?

1459
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:12,140
I really should have prepared it better.

1460
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:16,740
Billy Bush has a whiskey called Beach Whiskey.

1461
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:18,060
Oh.

1462
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:21,620
Yes, the famous, grab them by the you know what,

1463
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:23,660
Billy Bush.

1464
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:24,660
Billy Bush.

1465
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:28,500
Has his own brand of whiskey called Beach Whiskey.

1466
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:29,580
So that's fun.

1467
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:31,100
Go and look all of those up.

1468
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:33,940
Of course, I think it'll come out later,

1469
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:38,020
but I mentioned John Bon Jovi's new rosé,

1470
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:39,880
which is called Hampton Water.

1471
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:44,740
Which is very, you know, look,

1472
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:46,300
the more the better, I say.

1473
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:50,420
Post Malone has Maison Number Nine.

1474
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:53,260
Did we know what that is?

1475
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:54,900
I have to look it up.

1476
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:56,620
And you sent me the Snoop Dogg,

1477
01:03:56,620 --> 01:03:59,520
Snoop Dogg rolling out his own line of gin.

1478
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,940
Right, and he's already been affiliated with other liquors,

1479
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:06,540
but now yes, who knows gin better than Mr. Gin and Juice?

1480
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:10,900
Post Malone's is a rosé as well.

1481
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:12,100
Okay, yeah.

1482
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:16,440
And I believe the fat Jewish, he has a rosé.

1483
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:17,600
Does he really?

1484
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:19,020
Yeah.

1485
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:22,660
Called like, I forget what it's called.

1486
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:25,340
There's a place out in Los Angeles called Howlin' Rays,

1487
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:26,860
which is hot chicken.

1488
01:04:26,860 --> 01:04:30,780
And just by happenstance, two friends of mine,

1489
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:33,020
well, I guess a friend of the show, Evan Susser,

1490
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:35,500
we had the Ghost Malone,

1491
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:39,900
which was a special Post Malone created sandwich.

1492
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:40,820
Oh.

1493
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:42,940
Which had a good ghost pepper cheese.

1494
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:45,260
So I have sampled some of his food.

1495
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:46,100
Some of his wares.

1496
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:47,300
Items before, yeah.

1497
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:51,340
I like that sunflower song he did for the Spider-Man movie.

1498
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:53,300
They did a cool video for it.

1499
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:55,780
I don't think I know what you're talking about.

1500
01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:56,620
It was a big hit.

1501
01:04:57,380 --> 01:05:01,540
Just in the dust, like a sunflower.

1502
01:05:01,540 --> 01:05:02,820
There was like a music video

1503
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:04,620
with like comic panels and stuff.

1504
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:05,460
It's good.

1505
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:06,280
Yeah.

1506
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:07,620
I don't know anything about this.

1507
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:08,820
Well, you have to send this to me.

1508
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:09,660
Yeah.

1509
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:13,220
So yeah, so I'm, the more the better.

1510
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:15,380
Of course, The Rock has Tear-A-Mana tequila,

1511
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:16,300
which I have a bottle of.

1512
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:17,660
I have not cracked it open.

1513
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:22,100
But I'm saving that for maybe a special occasion.

1514
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:25,060
Now, The Rock is the other guy

1515
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:27,860
who when you open the Tear-A-Mana website,

1516
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:31,100
it is exactly like the Cosmogor's website.

1517
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:32,620
He is in the field.

1518
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:34,540
He's drinking with the workers.

1519
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:36,100
He's drinking at a picnic table.

1520
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:39,260
He's like really pouring, really heavy pours.

1521
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:42,020
Yes, that's true.

1522
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:44,900
And I think that is a winning strategy.

1523
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:46,060
I have a few more things to say,

1524
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:49,140
and then we'll talk about strategy in a second.

1525
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:49,980
Yeah.

1526
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:54,580
I will say, somebody pointed out to me on our Facebook group

1527
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:57,940
and it was a post by Christopher Arrearilio,

1528
01:05:57,940 --> 01:05:59,020
I think is your name.

1529
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:02,380
I apologize if it's not, if I got that wrong,

1530
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:04,060
that in Dumb and Dumber 2,

1531
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:08,300
there is brand product placement

1532
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:10,740
for Cosmogor's in the background.

1533
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:11,580
Ha ha ha.

1534
01:06:14,420 --> 01:06:15,980
And I just want to mention that,

1535
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:17,700
like obviously the brand is getting out there.

1536
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:20,380
People are becoming more aware of it.

1537
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:23,460
That was a worldwide smash, I assume, Dumb and Dumber 2.

1538
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:28,340
Yeah, well, not to get too morbid,

1539
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:31,420
but as we learned this week, very sad,

1540
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:34,660
The Rock and his family were fighting coronavirus.

1541
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:37,740
But as you and I were simultaneously working

1542
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:39,740
on this episode, it caught my eye

1543
01:06:39,740 --> 01:06:42,820
that he was wearing his TerraMana tequila hoodie.

1544
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:45,980
And there was three picture perfect bottles

1545
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:48,860
of TerraMana tequila in the background,

1546
01:06:48,860 --> 01:06:51,780
right in a perfect view of the camera.

1547
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:55,980
Okay, so I like, look, I'm a big wrestling fan.

1548
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:57,780
I was a big wrestling fan when The Rock,

1549
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:58,980
it was The Rock's heyday.

1550
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:03,300
I remember seeing The Rock at the Allstate Arena,

1551
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:05,740
then probably the Rosemont Horizon.

1552
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:10,060
I've never heard any person or group

1553
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:12,020
get the reaction The Rock would get,

1554
01:07:12,020 --> 01:07:13,380
like when he would come out.

1555
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:16,420
So I'm just saying I'm a big fan of The Rock.

1556
01:07:16,420 --> 01:07:19,020
So I follow him on Instagram now.

1557
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:23,700
And one of the things I like is he posts his cheat meals.

1558
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:26,540
Yeah, he goes nuts with those cheat meals.

1559
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:27,660
Like he really cuts loose.

1560
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:29,740
Yeah, for a while it was sushi.

1561
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:31,140
He would go like, he would literally eat

1562
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:34,940
like 70 pieces of sushi or a hundred pieces of sushi.

1563
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:39,700
And then lately he's been making like giant pancakes

1564
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:43,260
with just the most insane spread of peanut butter on them.

1565
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:46,020
Like just insane amounts.

1566
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:47,780
Like you would think it would be like half the jar

1567
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:50,060
would be on these pancakes.

1568
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:51,180
So I like following that.

1569
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:54,540
Now I've noticed since the tequila,

1570
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:56,460
it's always got, there's always a glass

1571
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:59,660
and a perfectly placed bottle of Terra Mana tequila

1572
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:01,060
in those shots.

1573
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:03,540
So now he's posting like, you know what, I take it back.

1574
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:05,340
It's pancakes, but it's also French toast.

1575
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:07,660
I think that's actually what he's been doing lately.

1576
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:09,500
He's doing this specific French toast.

1577
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:12,700
And you'll always see a bottle of Terra Mana and a glass.

1578
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:14,500
And there's always a little ad there.

1579
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:16,580
He's always hustling.

1580
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:17,740
You gotta respect the hustle.

1581
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:20,660
As Rivers Cuomo said, you can't knock the hustle

1582
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:22,940
in one of his famous songs.

1583
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:27,660
So I have noticed that yes, product placement has crept in

1584
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:32,580
to the formerly pure posts about cheat meals.

1585
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:35,500
A lot of carbs, heavy on the carbs, those cheat meals.

1586
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:38,020
Right. And believe me, I've seen those sushi pictures

1587
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:41,460
and gone and gotten sushi because of it.

1588
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:43,660
Like it gets me hungry for sushi.

1589
01:08:43,660 --> 01:08:46,140
So I get what he's doing.

1590
01:08:46,180 --> 01:08:48,780
Because like I ended up with a bottle of Terra Mana

1591
01:08:48,780 --> 01:08:51,580
and that was just sort of like I willed it into existence.

1592
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:53,700
Yeah. Like that just happened.

1593
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:54,740
That just came about.

1594
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:56,940
So let's, so yeah.

1595
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:58,300
Oh, so let's get through.

1596
01:08:58,300 --> 01:08:59,740
Do you have anything else you want to add

1597
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:03,620
about Casa Amigos as a brand as the Gerbers, George Clooney?

1598
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:04,780
You know what I'll say here

1599
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:07,140
that we didn't get to the commercial real quick.

1600
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:08,700
So there's a big famous story.

1601
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:11,780
This is another thing I like about celebrity endorsed

1602
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:14,340
anything is there's a lot of myth-making.

1603
01:09:14,340 --> 01:09:18,700
There's a lot of like one story you tell on press junkets.

1604
01:09:20,140 --> 01:09:23,540
And the story they love to tell on press junkets

1605
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:26,580
is that George and Randy were out for the night.

1606
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:30,980
They were tying one on and they both came back and George,

1607
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:33,220
you know, or George and Randy both were, you know

1608
01:09:33,220 --> 01:09:34,820
three sheets to the wind.

1609
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:37,700
So Randy said that he usually goes to the guest room

1610
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:41,420
not to wake Cindy up when he comes back late like that.

1611
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:44,940
In this instance, George went to the guest room.

1612
01:09:44,940 --> 01:09:46,580
So George got into the bed

1613
01:09:46,580 --> 01:09:48,140
because he wasn't going to drive home

1614
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:49,980
and it was too far, whatever.

1615
01:09:49,980 --> 01:09:52,020
And Cindy came in at 3 a.m.

1616
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:55,020
and she went over and thought Randy was in the bed.

1617
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:59,420
So she got in the bed with George thinking it was Randy.

1618
01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:03,500
Now, what a cool, what a crazy situation this was.

1619
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:04,980
They all had a good laugh.

1620
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:07,020
It wasn't Randy, it was George.

1621
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:10,300
I've seen this story written about

1622
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:15,140
in I think at least five pieces of press from this website.

1623
01:10:15,140 --> 01:10:19,500
And now what a big, oh, imagine waking up with George Clooney

1624
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:21,980
but it's not so bad to wake up with Cindy Crawford.

1625
01:10:21,980 --> 01:10:24,620
Like this is the narrative over and over again.

1626
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:26,020
Isn't this funny?

1627
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:29,860
I will also say side note that all of the press

1628
01:10:29,860 --> 01:10:32,540
for any of this stuff is all bought and paid for.

1629
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:35,500
There's not a critical sentence involved

1630
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:38,180
in any writing about anything here.

1631
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:40,900
There's just no one has done any research.

1632
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:43,860
It's just literally they spent a ton of money

1633
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:47,300
on a Forbes article or their publicist did something.

1634
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:49,460
Anyway, I mean, maybe you know,

1635
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:51,020
the tequila we do know is perfect.

1636
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:53,060
So maybe there's no reason to dig or anything.

1637
01:10:53,060 --> 01:10:54,700
Maybe there's no reason, yeah.

1638
01:10:55,820 --> 01:10:58,620
So, sorry, sorry, to cut you off real quick.

1639
01:10:58,620 --> 01:11:02,060
So this story, did you read this story?

1640
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:03,380
If you're going to talk about the story,

1641
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:04,340
I'll allow what you're about to say.

1642
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:06,900
No, no, no, go ahead.

1643
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:11,180
The only other story I found was how their line of mixers

1644
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:14,700
and barware was through William Sonoma.

1645
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:16,460
And it's like, oh, that's where I hit up

1646
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:19,060
for my drink mixers, William Sonoma.

1647
01:11:20,660 --> 01:11:23,100
So you see this here, this YouTube link?

1648
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:23,940
Yeah, yeah.

1649
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:28,940
So this is 2013 and you hear the sexy music.

1650
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:30,580
Randy Gerber goes in this commercial.

1651
01:11:30,580 --> 01:11:33,100
He opens up the door and Cindy Crawford,

1652
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:36,260
his wife is in bed with George Clooney.

1653
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:40,860
And they don't know, this is crazy.

1654
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:41,700
Can you imagine?

1655
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:45,500
Then they see a big glamour shot of Casamigos, the bottle.

1656
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:46,980
And it says Casamigos tequila.

1657
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:48,740
Now wait, that's not all.

1658
01:11:48,740 --> 01:11:50,660
Now George walks in.

1659
01:11:50,660 --> 01:11:53,980
He sees his then girlfriend, former WWE wrestler,

1660
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:57,020
Stacey Keebler in bed with Cindy Crawford.

1661
01:11:57,020 --> 01:11:58,460
Can you believe this?

1662
01:12:00,220 --> 01:12:01,460
And George gives a huh.

1663
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:06,420
And now we see another shot of Casamigos tequila.

1664
01:12:07,980 --> 01:12:09,380
But wait, there's more.

1665
01:12:09,380 --> 01:12:10,340
There's one more scene.

1666
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:11,460
Here comes Cindy.

1667
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:15,780
And now Randy and George are in the bed together.

1668
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:17,940
Can you believe this?

1669
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:21,900
And there's Stacey Keebler, George's then girlfriend,

1670
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:23,340
former WWE wrestler.

1671
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:30,620
This is crazy.

1672
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:32,180
Jason, can you believe this?

1673
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:33,020
Can you believe this?

1674
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:34,580
This is crazy.

1675
01:12:34,580 --> 01:12:35,420
Perfect.

1676
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:36,260
Can you believe this?

1677
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:37,740
Jason, I don't know if you knew this,

1678
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:40,300
Randy and George are boys.

1679
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:44,620
Hi, it's like a perfect improv show.

1680
01:12:44,620 --> 01:12:47,780
It's everything you want.

1681
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:48,860
Very crazy.

1682
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:50,860
So there's a couple other commercials.

1683
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:54,420
There's like a more standard, like what you would imagine.

1684
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:56,420
Sorry, I'll share this one more time.

1685
01:12:56,860 --> 01:13:00,140
What you would imagine a sort of commercial

1686
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:02,420
for a high-end liquor is.

1687
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:09,300
We owe great times to good friends.

1688
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:12,500
To the glasses that spark conversation.

1689
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:16,380
To the ideas that then pour out.

1690
01:13:18,860 --> 01:13:21,500
Hours came from a night like that.

1691
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:22,620
And somehow,

1692
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:24,220
George and Randy are by the bath.

1693
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:29,020
To make our own tequila.

1694
01:13:30,620 --> 01:13:32,580
Won't we be proud to pass around?

1695
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:34,700
Yeah, so they're in the fields now talking.

1696
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:36,580
Wasn't meant to leave our house.

1697
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:40,420
But since we made this for friends,

1698
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:42,700
we thought it wouldn't hurt to make a few more.

1699
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:44,580
Oh, they're all laughing.

1700
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:45,420
They're all friends.

1701
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:46,980
Have a glass, amigo.

1702
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:48,860
Our tequila is your tequila.

1703
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:52,180
Our casa is your casa.

1704
01:13:53,980 --> 01:13:55,140
Oh my gosh.

1705
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:57,740
That's all you want, right?

1706
01:13:57,740 --> 01:14:02,660
I just want to just run, drive through those fields.

1707
01:14:02,660 --> 01:14:05,420
Top speed on a motorcycle, no helmet.

1708
01:14:06,820 --> 01:14:09,660
Well, I mean, look.

1709
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:11,660
I think we might have an opportunity

1710
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:15,900
to do something like that, you know?

1711
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:17,060
With like friends?

1712
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:20,580
Like friends like say, this guy?

1713
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:23,220
Or these two?

1714
01:14:24,180 --> 01:14:27,460
Jason is showing me pictures from the official PR

1715
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:29,020
of Casa Amigos.

1716
01:14:29,020 --> 01:14:30,740
There's a picture here of Bono,

1717
01:14:30,740 --> 01:14:33,500
Randy Gerber and George Clooney all together.

1718
01:14:34,380 --> 01:14:37,420
Oh, is that William H. Mason and Felicity Huffman?

1719
01:14:37,420 --> 01:14:39,540
William H. Mason and Felicity Huffman.

1720
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:40,660
And then on the house.

1721
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:41,500
Oh man.

1722
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:42,660
Oh, okay, it's good.

1723
01:14:42,660 --> 01:14:44,740
On the house of friends section on the website,

1724
01:14:44,740 --> 01:14:46,380
you can see the,

1725
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:49,900
there's Vin Diesel with a drink at the Blood Shop premiere.

1726
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:53,020
Kate Bosworth's birthday party.

1727
01:14:53,860 --> 01:14:54,900
Paris Hilton's birthday.

1728
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:56,860
Lauren Conrad's birthday.

1729
01:14:56,860 --> 01:14:59,500
Which kind of fulfills my thesis

1730
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:01,980
that the death of culture,

1731
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:05,100
there has been no new celebrities since 2003.

1732
01:15:07,220 --> 01:15:08,380
That's possible.

1733
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:09,220
Yeah.

1734
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:12,540
But I mean, Pete Davidson's newer.

1735
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:13,380
That's true.

1736
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:15,060
And Post Malone is on that page.

1737
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:17,340
So I guess you've got a couples.

1738
01:15:17,340 --> 01:15:18,180
There's a couple.

1739
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:19,000
You've got a couple.

1740
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:19,840
Not as many.

1741
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:22,860
I agree with the majority of your hypothesis.

1742
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:24,540
Yeah, so you'll find these photos

1743
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:27,620
of completely candid moments.

1744
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:29,540
Just so candid.

1745
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:31,300
William H. Macy, Felicity Huffman

1746
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:34,260
with three different bottles of Casamigos

1747
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:37,540
in front of them on the table as they're cheersing.

1748
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:38,380
That's candid.

1749
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:39,820
There's no way that was set up.

1750
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:41,980
Sure.

1751
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:43,340
The Bono, Bono was holding a bottle

1752
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:46,060
that does not look like it's been opened.

1753
01:15:46,060 --> 01:15:47,740
That picture with Bono looks like

1754
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:50,700
they could have Photoshopped that into his hand as well.

1755
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:52,180
It's very possible.

1756
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:55,600
George's head too looks like maybe that was a stand-in.

1757
01:15:56,700 --> 01:15:59,100
And they Photoshopped George's face.

1758
01:16:00,140 --> 01:16:02,100
Yeah, I don't know if I trust that photo.

1759
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:03,700
This photo looks odd to me.

1760
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:06,180
That photo was from TMZ.

1761
01:16:06,180 --> 01:16:07,740
Hmm.

1762
01:16:07,740 --> 01:16:10,500
Well, let's get Harvey on the line

1763
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:13,340
and let's see if Harvey can verify that this is authentic.

1764
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:16,020
So yeah, so there's all this.

1765
01:16:16,020 --> 01:16:17,980
I mean, look, go to the Casamigos website.

1766
01:16:17,980 --> 01:16:20,060
We'll post some of this on Twitter

1767
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:22,940
if you wanna enjoy all of this fun

1768
01:16:22,940 --> 01:16:26,220
with these fun celebrities.

1769
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:28,900
Jason, do you have any more from the website

1770
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:29,940
you wanted to talk about?

1771
01:16:29,940 --> 01:16:33,060
I think that's pretty much it.

1772
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:35,700
Again, they got a brand partnership with Williams & Nova

1773
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:40,700
where you go to get your glasses or your mixers.

1774
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:46,460
I think that's, but that's kind of the meat of what I had.

1775
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:48,260
Yeah, I just spent a lot of time on that website

1776
01:16:48,260 --> 01:16:51,220
watching those fun videos on a loop.

1777
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:54,300
Right, yeah, so you can enjoy this

1778
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:58,620
just like Jason and I did at your own leisure.

1779
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:01,220
Whatever, at your own leisure.

1780
01:17:01,220 --> 01:17:03,260
Just enjoy it at your own leisure is what I'm saying.

1781
01:17:03,260 --> 01:17:04,180
Yeah.

1782
01:17:04,180 --> 01:17:06,020
But here's what I'm thinking.

1783
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:07,500
And we talked about this a little bit.

1784
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:12,500
And full disclosure, my father had a thought,

1785
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:14,780
cause he listens to the show.

1786
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:18,140
And he's heard all the Randy Gerber talk.

1787
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:20,980
I don't think he necessarily knew who Randy was.

1788
01:17:20,980 --> 01:17:22,660
But my father said to me,

1789
01:17:23,580 --> 01:17:27,820
why doesn't podcast the ride have their own tequila?

1790
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:32,260
And I said, that is a good question.

1791
01:17:33,420 --> 01:17:35,940
I love the sound of that.

1792
01:17:35,940 --> 01:17:38,300
And I share this idea with you.

1793
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:39,140
Yeah.

1794
01:17:39,140 --> 01:17:40,740
And you were just as enthusiastic.

1795
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:43,540
We're very excited about it.

1796
01:17:43,540 --> 01:17:44,380
Sure.

1797
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:46,580
We're doing a little brainstorming.

1798
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:50,180
And I think we've come up with what I'll say right now

1799
01:17:50,180 --> 01:17:51,620
is a good pitch.

1800
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:55,820
You know, we don't have the full funding yet.

1801
01:17:55,820 --> 01:17:58,180
Maybe we need to find our Michael Meldman.

1802
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:02,540
And I'll say this, right now only you and I

1803
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:04,100
are involved in this.

1804
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:04,940
Yeah.

1805
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:06,980
Scott does, Scott Gerber does not know about this.

1806
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:09,700
And we would like to officially extend the possibility

1807
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:12,260
of him being part of our new endeavor,

1808
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:13,900
but he doesn't have to.

1809
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:16,020
I understand if he's busy and he doesn't want

1810
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:19,340
to be part of this, we would love him to be there.

1811
01:18:19,340 --> 01:18:21,740
But we're gonna sort of give you a little bit

1812
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:22,780
of a taste right now.

1813
01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:25,060
And we're gonna roll out some of the images online

1814
01:18:25,060 --> 01:18:28,740
on Twitter to try to get investors,

1815
01:18:28,740 --> 01:18:31,500
a Michael Meldman type involved.

1816
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:36,860
And we of course thought the perfect name

1817
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:41,220
for a podcast the ride related to tequila would be

1818
01:18:41,220 --> 01:18:43,340
Buenos Chicos Tequila.

1819
01:18:44,020 --> 01:18:48,260
Roughly translated, good boy tequila.

1820
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:49,380
Okay.

1821
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:50,900
Good boy tequila.

1822
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:51,740
Think about that.

1823
01:18:51,740 --> 01:18:53,100
Think about.

1824
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:54,100
Is that the name?

1825
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:56,340
Is that the name we said?

1826
01:18:56,340 --> 01:18:58,340
Did I say a different name?

1827
01:18:58,340 --> 01:18:59,380
Possibly.

1828
01:18:59,380 --> 01:19:00,220
What was the name?

1829
01:19:00,220 --> 01:19:01,620
What was the name we actually agreed on?

1830
01:19:01,620 --> 01:19:03,660
Buenos Ninos.

1831
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:04,860
You know, you're right.

1832
01:19:05,860 --> 01:19:06,700
You know, you're right.

1833
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:08,820
I've actually gotten the name wrong already.

1834
01:19:08,820 --> 01:19:13,820
When I hurriedly wrote this part of the bit on my notes,

1835
01:19:15,740 --> 01:19:18,060
I wrote the wrong thing.

1836
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:19,780
Jason is of course correct.

1837
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:23,420
And look, there's gonna be hiccups in all startups.

1838
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:29,260
So the official name is Buenos Ninos Tequila.

1839
01:19:30,820 --> 01:19:33,020
Good boys tequila.

1840
01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:33,860
Okay.

1841
01:19:33,860 --> 01:19:35,060
And I want to give everyone a little taste

1842
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:39,780
of what maybe an ad campaign for this would look like.

1843
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:42,300
And now before anyone comes out with us,

1844
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:47,300
yes, we checked with someone who's Spanish is better.

1845
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:51,380
The grammatical term is Ninos Buenos.

1846
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:53,100
Ninos should come first.

1847
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:56,340
But for selling liquor, it's probably not best

1848
01:19:56,340 --> 01:20:01,340
if the first part of your name is children, you know, or boys.

1849
01:20:01,660 --> 01:20:04,980
So we're having a little fun, just like Casamigos

1850
01:20:05,940 --> 01:20:06,780
just made a portmanteau.

1851
01:20:06,780 --> 01:20:08,820
They mushed up House of Friends.

1852
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:10,740
They mushed up Casa and Amigo.

1853
01:20:10,740 --> 01:20:11,580
Right.

1854
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:12,900
We're mushing up words.

1855
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:15,420
That's the fun of Buenos Ninos Tequila.

1856
01:20:15,420 --> 01:20:16,580
Yeah.

1857
01:20:16,580 --> 01:20:19,620
So here, this is sort of like, imagine in your mind,

1858
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:22,620
you're seeing like, you know, a guave.

1859
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:25,700
You're seeing Jason and I on bikes

1860
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:28,060
and we're going through fields.

1861
01:20:28,060 --> 01:20:30,420
And it's a beautiful, like beautiful cinematography,

1862
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:33,940
like, you know, Roger Deakins style cinematography.

1863
01:20:33,940 --> 01:20:35,700
Okay. And then you hear this.

1864
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:44,780
Buenos Ninos Tequila.

1865
01:20:44,780 --> 01:20:47,740
What does it mean to be a good boy?

1866
01:20:48,660 --> 01:20:51,740
Is being a good boy something you learn?

1867
01:20:51,740 --> 01:20:54,660
Or is it just something you are?

1868
01:20:54,660 --> 01:20:56,580
Is there a wizard in the hospital nursery

1869
01:20:56,580 --> 01:20:59,580
that grants special good boy status to newborn babies?

1870
01:21:00,580 --> 01:21:02,500
It's hard to say really.

1871
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:03,780
We don't know.

1872
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:06,140
And we probably never will.

1873
01:21:06,140 --> 01:21:08,060
But there is one thing that the family

1874
01:21:08,060 --> 01:21:10,860
of Buenos Ninos Tequila does know.

1875
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:13,660
Great tasting spirits made from the finest guave

1876
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:15,460
in the most unique recipe.

1877
01:21:15,460 --> 01:21:17,380
Our patented bottle of tequila

1878
01:21:17,380 --> 01:21:19,020
mixes half of George Clooney

1879
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:21,460
and Randy Gerber's Casa Amigos Tequila

1880
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:24,060
with half of the Rocks Terra Mana Tequila

1881
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:27,780
to create a very special, very unique blend.

1882
01:21:27,780 --> 01:21:31,660
It's literally so unique, there's no way to reproduce it.

1883
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:33,740
So here's to those wild nights.

1884
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:36,460
And those slow mornings when yeah,

1885
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:41,460
you might not be perfect, but you'll certainly be good.

1886
01:21:41,740 --> 01:21:44,180
Buenos Ninos Tequila.

1887
01:21:44,180 --> 01:21:45,260
Invest today.

1888
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:50,900
So that's just a little bit of what

1889
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:53,060
like an ad campaign would be like.

1890
01:21:53,940 --> 01:21:55,900
Okay. If I could give you

1891
01:21:55,900 --> 01:21:58,020
a little constructive criticism start,

1892
01:21:58,020 --> 01:22:00,500
we've been collaborating on this for a few days now.

1893
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:02,460
We've been messaging back and forth.

1894
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:05,860
That Black Keys song was so oppressively loud.

1895
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:08,340
I have no idea what you said.

1896
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:09,780
So. Okay.

1897
01:22:09,780 --> 01:22:11,940
Well, you'll have to hear the episode then I guess.

1898
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:13,140
Okay.

1899
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:15,620
Are you gonna be able to lower the levels on the song?

1900
01:22:15,620 --> 01:22:17,220
Oh, the levels will be fine, yeah.

1901
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:18,140
Oh, okay, great.

1902
01:22:18,140 --> 01:22:19,780
Well, I'll listen back to the episode.

1903
01:22:19,780 --> 01:22:21,940
Yeah, believe me, whatever it was, it was very good.

1904
01:22:21,940 --> 01:22:25,180
Yeah, because I could tell it was very smooth.

1905
01:22:25,180 --> 01:22:28,300
Just like a smooth tequila where you remember

1906
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:30,660
and you cherish the night before, you know?

1907
01:22:30,660 --> 01:22:32,780
There's no hangover.

1908
01:22:32,780 --> 01:22:36,940
Yeah, and yeah, we're going to, I think,

1909
01:22:36,940 --> 01:22:39,500
try to conquer the tequila market here.

1910
01:22:40,340 --> 01:22:41,700
Yeah. And I think, yeah,

1911
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:46,700
we're gonna bring our goodness to this avenue, you know?

1912
01:22:47,540 --> 01:22:49,700
I think that Podcast Survive for Too Long

1913
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:54,100
has not been able to share our brand of goodness.

1914
01:22:55,540 --> 01:22:57,100
And that's what we're gonna be doing here.

1915
01:22:57,100 --> 01:22:59,980
And that's what I'm very, very excited about.

1916
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:00,820
Yeah.

1917
01:23:00,820 --> 01:23:03,700
And as I said in the commercial,

1918
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:07,900
our special blend of half of Casamigos tequila

1919
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:12,900
and half of Terra Mana tequila is very delicious

1920
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:15,500
when you split them half and half.

1921
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:17,380
It's like a perfect mix.

1922
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:19,100
Oh, it's terrific.

1923
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:19,940
Yeah.

1924
01:23:19,940 --> 01:23:23,660
So if, look, if you out there in listener land,

1925
01:23:23,660 --> 01:23:26,740
if you know someone who has a distillery,

1926
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:28,940
if you know someone who's into a guave,

1927
01:23:28,940 --> 01:23:30,820
if you know a Michael Melman type,

1928
01:23:30,820 --> 01:23:34,020
if you know a Randy Gerber type, hit us up

1929
01:23:34,020 --> 01:23:36,780
because we want to make this a reality.

1930
01:23:36,780 --> 01:23:38,180
Yeah. It's time.

1931
01:23:39,260 --> 01:23:40,860
It's time for this to happen.

1932
01:23:40,860 --> 01:23:42,300
I mean, yeah, we have shirts.

1933
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:43,900
We, you can have a button.

1934
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:46,100
You can make like a pillow sham.

1935
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:48,380
I don't know what you can do on T-Public,

1936
01:23:48,380 --> 01:23:50,820
but I think like, like,

1937
01:23:50,820 --> 01:23:52,140
I think the listeners will let us know,

1938
01:23:52,140 --> 01:23:56,300
would you be interested in Buenos Ninos tequila?

1939
01:23:57,300 --> 01:23:58,860
I think the answer is yes.

1940
01:23:59,740 --> 01:24:03,140
And again, let me officially say,

1941
01:24:03,140 --> 01:24:07,940
Scott Garner, Jason Sheridan, and Michael Carlson

1942
01:24:07,940 --> 01:24:12,620
formally invite you to be an equal one third.

1943
01:24:12,620 --> 01:24:13,860
Okay, well, you know what?

1944
01:24:15,940 --> 01:24:20,940
Let's, okay, you and I will have a slightly bigger stake

1945
01:24:21,780 --> 01:24:23,140
in this because we came up with it.

1946
01:24:23,140 --> 01:24:25,220
I'd actually, I don't think this is unfair.

1947
01:24:25,220 --> 01:24:28,740
I think that we should have, let's figure this out.

1948
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:32,300
You and I will have 40% of the company each

1949
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:34,500
and Scott will have 20 because he didn't come up with this.

1950
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:36,940
So we formally invite Scott Garner

1951
01:24:36,940 --> 01:24:41,460
to have 20% of this new tequila venture.

1952
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:42,300
You think that?

1953
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:43,380
I think that's fair.

1954
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:46,020
I think that's fair, but then if you and I share 40,

1955
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:47,940
don't then we also have 20%?

1956
01:24:49,940 --> 01:24:51,100
Excuse me, I misspoke.

1957
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:54,340
You have 40, I have 40, Scott has 20.

1958
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:55,540
Okay.

1959
01:24:55,540 --> 01:24:58,460
I think it's only fair because we put so much work

1960
01:24:59,020 --> 01:24:59,940
into this pitch.

1961
01:24:59,940 --> 01:25:00,940
I think so.

1962
01:25:00,940 --> 01:25:05,940
I mean, we've been illegally crossing the border

1963
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:09,940
at Tijuana, getting to the highlands of Jalisco

1964
01:25:09,940 --> 01:25:11,820
to visit the Agave fields.

1965
01:25:11,820 --> 01:25:15,860
Yes, and we've been breaking bread with the workers as well.

1966
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:20,300
You'll see some of these photos on release day

1967
01:25:21,020 --> 01:25:22,580
and you'll be very excited.

1968
01:25:22,580 --> 01:25:24,980
And I think you'll get just as excited as we are.

1969
01:25:24,980 --> 01:25:27,620
So yeah, that's what we're thinking next.

1970
01:25:27,620 --> 01:25:28,780
That's what's next for the podcast.

1971
01:25:28,780 --> 01:25:30,460
Right, I know you were all thinking it too.

1972
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:32,460
You were saying, when are they gonna do their own liquor?

1973
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:34,740
And we're here, we're at that point.

1974
01:25:37,220 --> 01:25:39,420
We can't really do live shows.

1975
01:25:39,420 --> 01:25:43,260
I was really looking forward to going back to Orlando

1976
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:44,940
or somewhere like that this year

1977
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:48,060
and live venues kind of on pause at the moment.

1978
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:53,060
So how can we share our love of good times

1979
01:25:53,460 --> 01:25:56,900
with the listeners, besides just the podcast

1980
01:25:56,900 --> 01:25:58,860
with a premium tequila?

1981
01:25:58,860 --> 01:26:01,180
Right, and I think, yes, as far as premium,

1982
01:26:01,180 --> 01:26:03,260
I think we're gonna go for the highest end.

1983
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:08,180
I think a price point of $99.99 a bottle.

1984
01:26:09,220 --> 01:26:11,100
That's good, yeah, that's good.

1985
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:15,220
Because people see, you see it's under 100.

1986
01:26:15,220 --> 01:26:18,900
It's under 100, so you don't think, oh no, three digits.

1987
01:26:18,900 --> 01:26:19,900
It's still two.

1988
01:26:20,940 --> 01:26:22,380
And yeah, that's what we're going after.

1989
01:26:22,380 --> 01:26:26,060
So if you're excited, just keep letting us know.

1990
01:26:26,060 --> 01:26:27,780
Please give us that feedback.

1991
01:26:27,780 --> 01:26:29,820
If you wanna even maybe tweet at Randy Gerber

1992
01:26:29,820 --> 01:26:32,220
or Michael Meldman and let them know,

1993
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:33,260
maybe they would be involved.

1994
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:36,300
I know Randy, he doesn't wanna get spread too thin.

1995
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:37,940
But he's an entrepreneur,

1996
01:26:37,940 --> 01:26:40,700
and if he sees a brand like podcast The Ride,

1997
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:42,900
I think he'd be very excited about it.

1998
01:26:42,900 --> 01:26:44,020
Yeah.

1999
01:26:44,020 --> 01:26:47,060
So, gosh, I mean, I'm exhausted.

2000
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:48,780
I'm sweating.

2001
01:26:48,780 --> 01:26:51,420
It got dark while we were doing this.

2002
01:26:51,420 --> 01:26:53,700
Well, it was, I mean, we started happy hour.

2003
01:26:53,740 --> 01:26:57,060
We started at six o'clock on Friday night.

2004
01:26:58,980 --> 01:27:01,980
So I guess, you know, you've all survived podcast The Ride,

2005
01:27:03,860 --> 01:27:07,460
but you have yet to experience Buenos Niño.

2006
01:27:08,420 --> 01:27:11,340
Buenos, is it Buenos Niño or Buenos Niños?

2007
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:13,340
Niños, probably, that's plural.

2008
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:15,140
Buenos Niños Tequila.

2009
01:27:16,540 --> 01:27:18,900
So prepare for that.

2010
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:20,860
So thank you for listening.

2011
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:22,940
Thank you for enjoying.

2012
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:25,780
And stay thirst, our new catchphrase,

2013
01:27:25,780 --> 01:27:27,780
stay thirsty, my friends. Stay thirsty.

2014
01:27:27,780 --> 01:27:32,780
It's fine, they can't copyright that, it's generic words.

2015
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:34,060
Generic words.
