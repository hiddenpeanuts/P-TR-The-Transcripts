1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
When your town has let you down

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
When your port has fallen short

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
When you're too worn out to run

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And need some ribs or a Cinnabon

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You need a place, a place for rock

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
A place for roll, a place where Oakland Raiders merch is sold

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
A sublime hot topic and billabong

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
A place where you can purchase a candy thong

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So let's go take a walk

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Let's all go to City Walk

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Tonight

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Podcast The Ride presents The City Walk Saga, a daily 19 part, extremely necessary series exploring the stores, restaurants, and wonderful magic that make up universal City Walk Hollywood.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Hello, welcome to Podcast The Ride The City Walk Saga, Sector 10.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's like a Super Size Me, but with zero points.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Joining us as always, the increasingly beleaguered me, Scott Gardner, Mike Carlson.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm feeling good.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Oh, great.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Congrats.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Let's try to take some of your luster and Jason Sheridan.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I feel good because this is now we're a little over halfway done.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Right? 19 sectors.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yes.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Oh, that's exactly right.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We crossed the boundary at nine and a half.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Yeah.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yeah.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's like a marathon now where we know we've hit the midpoint in the marathon and now you know, well, I did this many.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Surely I can do the same amount.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So like, I'm feeling good.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It seems like Scott has hit the part in the marathon where he went, I don't want to finish the marathon.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Well, I might have hit it in sector two.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Okay, fair enough.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I might have.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Maybe I'm a quitter.

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And yeah, you're right about looking at distance, but I'm looking ahead to when we inevitably do City Walk Orlando.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yes.

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Downtown Disney.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yes.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Anaheim.

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Downtown Disney.

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And then like Orlando.

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And then like the Outranks.

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Disney Springs.

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Disney Springs we did, but like, oh, sorry.

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Oh, I thought Disney.

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm getting them all confused.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
There's too many malls clattering around in my brain.

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yeah.

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Disney Village is the Paris one, but that's we covered that plenty.

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I also heard that they were going to redo Disney Village soon.

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Maybe that's like part of the plans.

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
That's right.

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So much money going into that park.

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We'll have to do that again.

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But somebody, oh yeah.

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
All right.

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Well, pack your bags to France, everybody.

60
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
We're just visiting them.

61
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

62
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
He's here.

63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The sector keeper's back.

64
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Boys, don't go to France.

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Oh no, why?

66
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Because I need you.

67
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Oh yeah.

68
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You're halfway there.

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You're halfway there.

70
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You're right.

71
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
We have to focus on one set of sectors at a time.

72
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You're looking so much better, sector keeper.

73
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Thank you.

74
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yes, my color's filling in and I've put on some weight.

75
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You were a little emaciated before, so I'm not going to say that's a bad thing.

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Will you give me strength and you fill the void that was my soul.

77
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Cool.

78
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I have a sector assignment.

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Please discuss sector 10.

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Of course.

81
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Menchies, flip-flop shop, Cinnabon, lids.

82
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Okay.

83
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Interesting.

84
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Another wall heavy one.

85
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Here's a quick thing, sector keeper.

86
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
We have a future guest coming up, Nick Mundy.

87
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Do you know Nick Mundy?

88
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Have you heard?

89
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You can't watch the internet or anything.

90
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
No, I've heard of him.

91
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Oh, you've heard of him.

92
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Okay, well that's great.

93
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
He's coming on the show soon and he actually asked me if we can just move lids to sector

94
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
11.

95
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Whoa.

96
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So we're going to move.

97
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What?

98
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What?

99
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
He was just saying he wanted to talk about lids because he had a sort of affection and

100
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
he said it would be great if they were both in the same.

101
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Is that okay?

102
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The sector keeper is looking for ways to make this okay, but I can tell right away it's

103
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
not okay with him.

104
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
He looks upset and I am indignant.

105
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Okay.

106
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Hang on.

107
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Okay.

108
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So he's trying to annex it into his sector?

109
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,440
Nick Mundy texted me and he said, can we do lids and, because he wants to do the Raider

110
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,000
image, which is also part of sector 11.

111
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And he just said, can't they both?

112
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Why they're so close to each other?

113
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
He said, first of all, why is he communicating with both of us separately?

114
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I gave him the list and I, and he said, I'd be into Raider store or lids, the word or

115
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,440
I sent him the list and he said, how about Raider store?

116
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,720
And now suddenly he's pulling another one.

117
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,480
Nick, Nick Mundy has plenty of avenues to talk about hats.

118
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,680
He does not need to pull his hat obsession.

119
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,680
I agree.

120
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,680
Double up.

121
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,680
Yes.

122
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,280
Does Nick Mundy want my soul in hell?

123
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,000
I probably, evidently.

124
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,440
I don't know this kind of cowboy around might work on Tiger town or whatever his show is

125
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,760
called, but that, that Texas cowboy stuff doesn't fly here.

126
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,240
That doesn't fly in the walk.

127
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,440
For one thing, there's a gap between the lids and the Bucatabepo.

128
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,440
There's an entryway.

129
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,440
There's not even stores there.

130
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,440
There's a taxi stand.

131
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,440
Yeah.

132
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,440
Yeah.

133
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,440
Are we now saying that-

134
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,440
This is an America Samoa.

135
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,440
Could he, yeah.

136
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:29,080
Well, he's still got the spirit of the, of the Texans that were, they were robbing the

137
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,080
land from different.

138
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,080
They were part of Mexico.

139
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,480
I don't know the history.

140
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,040
Some of Texas got stolen.

141
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,040
Yeah.

142
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,440
And Mundy's, uh, Mundy's operating with that level of, uh, callousness.

143
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,440
All right.

144
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,440
So, I mean, what am I going to do?

145
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,640
Am I going to tell him no?

146
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:51,000
You're going to tell him that there is a special boy who has laid down ground rules and that

147
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,560
no guest has required any changing of the rules.

148
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,180
Everyone has fallen in line.

149
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,440
And why is he special enough?

150
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,400
Look, he's a nice guy.

151
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,360
He was the best man at my wedding.

152
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,960
I, I look, he's fine, but that doesn't give him God powers.

153
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,960
Bad man.

154
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,960
Bad man.

155
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,960
Okay.

156
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,960
All right.

157
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:21,360
Well, I'm glad there is at least three way agreement, but I guess the choice isn't yours,

158
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:28,160
Mike, but I, how can you really in the face of this?

159
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,260
I didn't think it was a big deal, but if, look, I don't want to put a ghost boy into

160
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,720
an earlier grave.

161
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,720
Into a different type of eternal grave.

162
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,840
The sector keepers rules are laws.

163
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,900
And I'm assuming he got that plain snapback hat.

164
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:49,420
He's wearing the one that's like kind of darkish blue, but it doesn't have any logo on it.

165
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:54,440
It's like a character wears in a movie where they're trying to lay low and you're like,

166
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,360
where did they just find that plain baseball cap that fits them perfectly?

167
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,960
He's been wearing one of those this whole time.

168
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,880
Did you get that at Lids?

169
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,800
He's like the sparkies of earth.

170
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,800
Oh no.

171
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,140
You're equating Nick Mundy.

172
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:15,200
He's now one of the biggest villains of this 19 part series.

173
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,200
Okay.

174
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,280
Well, look, I don't disagree.

175
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,920
I hate to throw the guy under the bus.

176
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:27,120
As I said, a lot of good Marys, a good guest before, but I don't like making demands.

177
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,800
Here's what I'll say.

178
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,320
We will do everything we can to stop him from talking about Lids.

179
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:39,240
We will do our best to stop him from talking about Lids.

180
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,320
He is a wild man.

181
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:45,920
If he starts talking, I don't know what will happen, but we will do our best.

182
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,480
I think a little of what's happening.

183
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,480
He was on the show.

184
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,840
If you didn't hear his episode, he talked about Astroworld.

185
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,720
There was a lot of back and forth about whether or not he's a bully, he's defending himself

186
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,040
against charges of being a bully.

187
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:04,960
I feel like he is bullying this series and he's bullying the poor little sick, dying

188
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,960
sector killer.

189
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,960
I'm already dead.

190
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,960
Oh, that's right.

191
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,960
Dying more and more.

192
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,960
Dying more.

193
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:14,600
That sounds like that unstoppable force that is Nick Mundy has not yet worked.

194
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,600
He has met him.

195
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,880
I've met him, but he hasn't yet met the immovable object that is Jason Sheridan in City Walk.

196
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,560
Did you call yourself the immovable object?

197
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,560
Yeah.

198
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,560
Wow.

199
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,560
Like the blob or the junkernut.

200
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:33,720
If we're talking X-Men rules, I mean.

201
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,200
The blob, Jason Sheridan is the blob or the juggernaut.

202
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,200
Man.

203
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:43,000
Andy's Shoto, the Ready Player One key chain.

204
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Do you remember a week ago?

205
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,840
Shoto is whispering in my ear right now and it is such a string of foul-mouthed vulgarity.

206
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,520
I don't even want to repeat it.

207
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,520
Shoto is peering.

208
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,480
Let's not put him on mic.

209
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,540
So here's what we're going to do.

210
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,860
We are going to talk about lids.

211
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:08,280
If Nick Mundy is successfully able to shush us and get in a good, I don't know, like now

212
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,480
I'm worried he's going to tie us all up or something, take the mics, go into another

213
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,680
room in your apartment and do his lids material.

214
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,360
I'm looking through the sacred scrolls that you showed me before we started recording

215
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,480
today, that say the sectors on them.

216
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,160
And now I'm reading sort of the language after.

217
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,600
They're written on Popcornopolis wrappers.

218
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,600
Yes, exactly.

219
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,200
The scrolls have been written on the Popcornopolis wrappers.

220
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:37,600
And it says that he who talks about sectors out of order or stores that are in different

221
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:45,120
sectors add length, ad nauseum can destroy the order of the sectors and throw them into

222
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:53,080
disarray, creating new sectors that would reformat CityWalk in a totally different

223
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,080
way.

224
00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:01,600
Skewing the space-time continuum, the specter-time, sector-time continuum into an alternate tangent

225
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,320
where corrupt leaders run rampant.

226
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,320
He's a biff.

227
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,320
He's a biff.

228
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,640
He's a biff-tan and we got to stand up to him tomorrow and get the almanac back.

229
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,400
Right, because God knows what would happen.

230
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,120
All of a sudden a sector is margaritaville and it's sugar.

231
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,120
They're not even anywhere close to each other.

232
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,120
No.

233
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:27,200
Or you would break up the sector order where the Hard Rock Cafe retail store is in a different

234
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,720
sector than the Hard Rock Cafe, which is very important because those are the numbers that

235
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,880
the official CityWalk map gave us.

236
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,600
You can't have the Hard Rock Cafe and the Hard Rock Cafe store together.

237
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,600
Yes.

238
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,600
Is Mundy insane?

239
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,600
He might be insane.

240
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,640
The lines were drawn with my blood.

241
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,640
Oh, God.

242
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,640
We're going to do our very best.

243
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,640
God, harden the blood, please.

244
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,720
We're going to do our very best to stand up to this bad man.

245
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,320
I had a choice.

246
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,120
Be a donor or draw the maps.

247
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,880
At least your blood was given to something useful.

248
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,880
Yes.

249
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,880
That's true.

250
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,880
Not to some guy who would have wasted it.

251
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,880
Please, boys, do your best.

252
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,880
Okay.

253
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,840
Well, the best thing that we can do is to do our lids material right now.

254
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,280
Here's what's in my list.

255
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,420
The hats on the outside of the lids glow.

256
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:16,720
That's the end of my lids material.

257
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,760
Mine just says a lot of hats.

258
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,760
So I'm tapped.

259
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,760
Lot of hats.

260
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,760
Let's move on.

261
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,760
Mike, you got anything quick?

262
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,160
I'd love to tell you guys that I bought 10 hats and wore them to various events.

263
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,160
I did not.

264
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,040
I walked in, I said, a lot of hats here, and I was done.

265
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,040
All right.

266
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,040
I'm going to leave this done.

267
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,040
Moving on.

268
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,600
If Monday has more to say, he better keep it to his fucking self and his cats.

269
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,320
Your gravity gave me strength.

270
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,240
He can do it on his Tiger Town podcast or whatever.

271
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,240
Yeah.

272
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,920
Do your Patreon only lids spectacle, but not here.

273
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,080
We also, by the way, we already did locker room by lids.

274
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,080
Yes.

275
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,280
Yeah, which is a different store.

276
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:59,040
And in a different sector, locker room by lids is in sector nine.

277
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,040
Covered in Uncle Drew.

278
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,920
And lids is in sector 10.

279
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:13,880
I think you should post a screenshot of the text and so that our fans can look at it and

280
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,600
see the forceful, frightening language.

281
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,560
I can provide a JPEG.

282
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,560
Oh, wow.

283
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,840
OK, thank you so much.

284
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,840
Thanks.

285
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,640
You can do the power of a phone screenshot.

286
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,640
Yes.

287
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,640
Wow.

288
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,640
You're certainly magical.

289
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,040
God, some people just want to watch the world burn.

290
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:34,560
Well, when things are heating up, you got to cool down with some delicious menchies.

291
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,560
Yes.

292
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,560
Menchies.

293
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,400
Sector keeper, is that a favorite of yours?

294
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,400
I love menchies.

295
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,400
So there's a menchie boy on the front.

296
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,160
There's like another kind of fun kid type character.

297
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,160
This one's a little more fantastical.

298
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,640
He feels like a candy person from like Candyland or something.

299
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,640
Brother.

300
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,640
Oh, really?

301
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:57,560
He is your literal brother, just sort of like a guy that you like pal around with and is

302
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,360
like a best friend of yours.

303
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,000
A literal brother, yes.

304
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,480
He was my brother.

305
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,480
Yes.

306
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,480
Menchie was.

307
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,480
Menchie is still alive.

308
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,480
The boy.

309
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,480
The boy Menchie is still alive.

310
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,480
Yes.

311
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,480
The boy who lived, Menchie.

312
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,480
Yes, the boy who lived.

313
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,480
In your family's lineology.

314
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,480
Yes.

315
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,480
Lineage.

316
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,320
And Menchie is generally, because there's a lot of Menchies around here.

317
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,440
There was a frozen yogurt by Craze in Los Angeles.

318
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,160
I feel like it started by Pinkberry a little bit.

319
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,160
And then Menchie's kind of emerged as maybe the more popular one.

320
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,280
There used to be a yogurt land.

321
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,960
Is that the same space?

322
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,960
Same space.

323
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,400
Yogurt land gave way to Menchie.

324
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:41,120
And if that special little boy can rise and reign triumphant, then so can you, Sector

325
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,120
Keeper.

326
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,120
Oh, thank you.

327
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,120
Yeah.

328
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,120
I believe in you.

329
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,960
And the Menchie, as I said, there's like a boy character and it's like his full body.

330
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:52,120
Most of the Menchies just have his head in like when the locations are on Los Angeles,

331
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,120
but this is a full body.

332
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,680
But a very small interior location.

333
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,940
So a great nice kind of out, excuse me, exterior of the building.

334
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:05,040
But again, a very limiting small area for you to actually go around, get frozen yogurt

335
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,760
and get your toppings.

336
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,960
Yeah.

337
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:12,520
One thing I noticed about this place, and I think this is actually most Menchies have

338
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:17,480
this available, but especially this one, it felt like they were really pushing it.

339
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,960
And I think I know why.

340
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,000
And I sent it to you guys.

341
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:27,280
There is like a giant floor to ceiling window decal that says pineapple Dole Whip Sorbet

342
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,280
slash float.

343
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,280
Oh, that's right.

344
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,760
And it's on the website too.

345
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:37,200
But I mean, in a theme park adjacent setting, that shot's fired.

346
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,960
I mean, come on, that's shots fired at Disney, right?

347
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,280
Like the one of the homes of the Dole Whip.

348
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:49,200
I believe they used to advertise Dole Whip is like, you can only get it at the Dole Plantation

349
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,160
or Disney World or Disneyland.

350
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,080
Now it's everywhere.

351
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:58,240
I don't know what exclusivity or licensing change, but like Dole Whip is everywhere.

352
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:04,800
But it was a little drawing for me to see like a Dole Whip advertisement at Universal,

353
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,800
you know?

354
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,120
So it's upsetting you a little bit.

355
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,120
I suppose.

356
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,400
It would be like seeing like a Butterbeer at Disney.

357
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,400
Oh, at Disney?

358
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,400
Yeah.

359
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,400
If it was like, what would they call it?

360
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,440
What would Disney's version of it be?

361
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,360
Like, it's just a cream soda basically.

362
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,360
Woody Sweet Sarsaparilla.

363
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,360
Oh, that's good.

364
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,360
Right?

365
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,040
I don't have a complaint if that showed up.

366
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,040
Hey, pretty good.

367
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,040
Yeah, that's good.

368
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,040
All right.

369
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,040
Yeah.

370
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,040
We're putting each other off.

371
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,040
I got no problem.

372
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,040
Man, that's pretty, yeah.

373
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,040
We should go to you for more ideas for like drinks and treats.

374
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,040
They should.

375
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,040
That's a mayor thing.

376
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,040
They should consult.

377
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,040
I would love an expensive consulting fee for minimal work.

378
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,280
That would be a good mayor thing though, is the mayor gets to name all the treats and

379
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,840
he has like his ideas get to be brought into the world.

380
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,160
Would you settle for being the mayor of CityWalk if Disney doesn't work out?

381
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,600
And I think it will, but.

382
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,600
I think so.

383
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,360
I think I would take that on.

384
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,360
They're good people there.

385
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,360
You know, they need a strong leader.

386
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,880
And you tell them, you know, the sector keeper when you're in.

387
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,880
Well, sure.

388
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,880
I'm happy to put a good word in.

389
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,880
Oh, I mean, that's a big endorsement coming from you, sector keeper.

390
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,880
Sure, sure.

391
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,240
Letter of recommendation written in your blood.

392
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,240
Absolutely.

393
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,240
If there's some left, yes.

394
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,000
Just a quick trip, I hope.

395
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,360
My last thought on Menchies is that I don't like do it yourself frozen yogurt.

396
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,880
I don't like putting the toppings on myself.

397
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,360
I want them to do it for me.

398
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,320
Out of laziness or out of you don't trust yourself?

399
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,520
I trust myself, but I feel that it's more fun when I get handed a thing that's been

400
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,280
sort of constructed versus something that I put together.

401
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,280
Because it always like, it looks worse.

402
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,720
I don't have the technique that someone working there might have.

403
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,400
Jason's looking at me very suspiciously.

404
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,560
No, you are wrong.

405
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,560
Yeah.

406
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,560
OK.

407
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,560
Because frozen yogurt is nothing more than a topping delivery mechanism.

408
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,560
Right?

409
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,760
I disagree with that.

410
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,760
That's a crazy statement to say.

411
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:02,000
I mean, I like frozen yogurt, but I'm never like, oh, I just want some plain frozen yogurt.

412
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,600
I want the toppings, baby.

413
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,600
That's crazy.

414
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,600
I want it to get real.

415
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,600
I want a lot of toppings.

416
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,600
Come on.

417
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,600
What do you mean come on?

418
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,600
Come on.

419
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,600
You would have just a regular frozen yogurt.

420
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:17,360
I mean, if you're at a TCBY in 1994, but nowadays it's a topping world, baby.

421
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,360
I like toppings.

422
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,600
I like putting toppings on frozen yogurt, but it's crazy to say that no one would want

423
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,080
the regular frozen yogurt.

424
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:29,160
I want I was going to say loaded up, but again, I'm conscious that it's per weight pricing.

425
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,160
I want it loaded up.

426
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,320
You bring your own personal scale to make sure before you get to the front.

427
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,320
And mine is rigged.

428
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,320
Trust me.

429
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,600
That doesn't make sense because it would fuck you over.

430
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,200
No, it's rigged to be.

431
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,200
Never mind.

432
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,520
I see it's higher.

433
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,240
So you trick yourself with it.

434
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,240
I see.

435
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,240
I see.

436
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,560
Shaves off the bottom of the bowl, like the little extra paper part, which saves you,

437
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,480
which gives you like three cents off.

438
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,280
And you attach a tiny balloon as you put it on the scale.

439
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:59,360
So it's just a little scale, but I'm loaded up with toppings and I want it to.

440
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,360
I want it.

441
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,360
I want a soup.

442
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,360
It's melt and you frozen yogurt.

443
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,860
I find melts quickly.

444
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,280
So it becomes topping soup pretty quickly.

445
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,280
It does.

446
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,280
I agree with that.

447
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,720
But it's just toppings and you don't want the yogurt to be good.

448
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,920
No, I want the yogurt to be good too, but I'm there for the toppings.

449
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,840
Why is it either or?

450
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,840
It's somewhere in the middle.

451
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,840
I didn't say it's either or.

452
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,840
I said it's in the middle.

453
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,640
I'm just saying what he's saying is crazy.

454
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:26,120
He's calling me crazy for not wanting to do it myself, which I don't think is crazy because

455
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,880
I like a pink, even though pink berry has its problems.

456
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,040
I like somebody giving me a nice, like sort of constructed little dessert.

457
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,280
It's aesthetically pleasing to me.

458
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,440
I can't argue with the aesthetics.

459
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,440
Well that's all I was.

460
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,440
I like that too.

461
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,440
So all right.

462
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,440
You got to, I don't know what.

463
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:47,360
You control your own ratio though with, you know, you can get things in weird if I, and

464
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:53,680
if like I want just two gummy worms also, because when I don't ever buy a bag of gummy

465
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,800
worms, here's just a little, a little extra treat.

466
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:02,640
Like almost like a fortune cookie unrelated to the meal, but a nice little aftermath.

467
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,640
I like to load it up.

468
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,040
I mean, probably because I mean, it's hard to mess up frozen yogurt, but make design

469
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,640
your own burger is kind of, it can be a disaster.

470
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,640
What do you put on it?

471
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,920
What is your, what do I put on it?

472
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,920
Okay.

473
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,760
So, you know, I like the crushed up like cone pieces.

474
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,760
Like an ice cream cone.

475
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,760
Yeah.

476
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,760
Yeah.

477
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,760
I like a rainbow sprinkles.

478
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:27,560
Got to go for like a fudge, a little fudge, a little caramel, maybe some peanut butter

479
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,600
cups.

480
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,620
The cookie dough and brownie bites are always disappointing.

481
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,720
Maybe a little bit of fruit, but.

482
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,720
No, no.

483
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,720
No.

484
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,720
Fuck that.

485
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,080
Every now and then I like to get one or two of like the boba or the lychee, like, cause

486
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:45,760
I don't get those a lot, but I don't want a lot of them.

487
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,920
The boba I can't do after that mini monster.

488
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,920
I know you're still scared.

489
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,840
I don't think I'm ever going to do boba again.

490
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,160
Can you guess the weight at Menchie's?

491
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,160
I forget.

492
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,160
Wait, what do you mean?

493
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,320
If you guess the weight on the scale before you put it on, sometimes you get a discount

494
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,320
over.

495
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,320
Really?

496
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,400
I've never seen that either.

497
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,680
I certainly don't think a theme park one where the prices are already going to be inflated

498
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,440
a little would have that.

499
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,840
I thought you were asking Jason if just by holding it in his hand, he would know the

500
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,840
exact weight.

501
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,840
Sometimes I come pretty close.

502
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,880
Sometimes I more like the dollars.

503
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,640
Sometimes I'm like, I bet this is going to be like 250.

504
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,760
What is your ideal weight for a Menchie's bowl?

505
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,040
I guess that depends on what the price point is going to be.

506
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,040
Okay.

507
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,320
So you check the price point before you go into the Menchie's to know how much you're

508
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,320
loading up.

509
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,320
I try to be cognizant of it.

510
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,920
I'm not sure what the conversion rates these days.

511
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,920
Yeah.

512
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,920
What is the yogurt conversion?

513
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,920
Check the stocks app on the phone.

514
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,920
Let me check.

515
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,920
Has Nikkei opened yet?

516
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,920
No, too late.

517
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,920
On this coast.

518
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,320
Like a card counter at a casino.

519
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,920
They ask you to leave, but it's not illegal.

520
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,920
Not illegal?

521
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,480
What am I doing wrong?

522
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:58,080
But the winner stands to gain five extra peanut butter cups.

523
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:03,000
Whoa, that's a jackpot, those peanut butter cups are heavy.

524
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,040
A dollar and 10 cents of added value.

525
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,040
Oh, oh, oh, all right.

526
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,040
Really?

527
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,040
Were you getting tired of that?

528
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,040
Oh, um.

529
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,040
Smackdown.

530
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,040
You're tall.

531
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,040
Is that your keeper?

532
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,040
Which way we going next?

533
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,840
I need you boys to venture into Flip Flop Shop.

534
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,040
The Flip Flop Shop made famous on the Flex Watches episode of The Prophet.

535
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,040
Yeah.

536
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,040
Yeah.

537
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,040
The Prophet Town.

538
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,040
Yeah.

539
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,040
It culminates.

540
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:40,360
That's like the big grand arena, like the final place where those brothers who lost

541
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,160
their mom do battle.

542
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,160
Right?

543
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,160
They do like a presentation.

544
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:49,320
They do a presentation with a display case of their watches where each different design

545
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,320
represents a different proceeds go to a different charity.

546
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,320
That's right.

547
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,320
Yes.

548
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,320
And that's different charitable causes.

549
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:02,120
And if you know, if you go into the Flip Flop Shop today, do you see this display?

550
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,120
No.

551
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,120
Wow.

552
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,120
Geez.

553
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,120
It was an old flex.

554
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,120
That was a season one.

555
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,120
Yeah, that was an older one.

556
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:13,000
Flex Watches still in business, seem to be doing well, judging by their online store.

557
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,040
But I did not see a Flex Watches display in this Flip Flop Shop.

558
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,040
It's very small.

559
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,120
It's a very small Flip Flop Shop.

560
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,520
To even get retail space within the Flip Flop Shop.

561
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,800
Yeah, there's almost nothing to work with.

562
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:30,200
I feel like maybe businesses should avoid city walk altogether.

563
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,040
In a lot of cases, I think you aren't...

564
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,880
You know, I was just with my friend up there and he proposed the idea in general that maybe

565
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:44,240
Sephora, like that Sephora is probably not the location making the most money of all

566
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:49,880
the Sephoras, but it serves as a big ad for the other Sephoras that's seen by everybody

567
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,840
going into the theme park.

568
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:57,480
So maybe all of these stores are fronts in a way and advertising for the other stores

569
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,960
that people are more likely to actually go to.

570
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,960
That's fair.

571
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,720
I mean, a portion of the people at City Walk are tourists.

572
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,120
So like, I think it is good to have some...

573
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,120
Not just locals doing podcasts.

574
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:12,720
Not just locals doing podcasts as they slowly crack up.

575
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,640
I think it is like a hat shop, Flip Flops.

576
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,480
If you're out of town or you're staying at the Hilton or the Sheridan, oh, I forgot.

577
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,480
It's so sunny here.

578
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,080
I forgot a hat or I forgot Flip Flops.

579
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:31,720
Let me walk across the busy uphill street all the way to the end of City Walk opposite

580
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:39,040
of the hotels, the furthest away and pay $15 more than I would pay if I took a shuttle

581
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,520
to the CVS down the street.

582
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,880
Potentially, but you don't know the layout of Studio City adjacent areas.

583
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:50,560
Yeah, and I like you, you've outed yourself as living in this neck of the woods, which

584
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,840
narrows it down for stalkers to find you.

585
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,840
Please murder me.

586
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,760
Drink them of any podcast toast.

587
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,760
Oh my.

588
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,520
And no, I made it.

589
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,800
I was murdered by a stalker.

590
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:07,160
I do think Sephora, and there's probably a lot of truth to the fact that just having

591
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:12,720
a nice big store is a nice ad for it, but I do think Sephora is a practical thing that

592
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,560
plenty of people walk by and go, oh, I need something in there.

593
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,560
That makes a lot of sense.

594
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,880
There are stores that make less sense to me.

595
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,520
The guest store makes less sense to me being there because it's kind of like high end shopping

596
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,840
and it's like- Minimal inventory too.

597
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,840
Right.

598
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,840
It's minimal.

599
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,840
What are you doing in there?

600
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,440
Sephora actually seems a lot more practical of like, I do need something in there.

601
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,160
I forgot it on the trip or I ran out of something.

602
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,520
And people love it.

603
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:43,840
Sephora and Starbucks, the only two locations I think that are at City Walk and Downtown

604
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,840
Disney.

605
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,840
Oh yeah, yeah.

606
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,840
Is that right?

607
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,440
Because my girlfriend, Lindsay, goes in that Sephora every time we're in Downtown Disney.

608
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,040
She loves that Sephora.

609
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:58,480
I have been in like, I'll be like, I'll be at D Street and you'll be in Sephora.

610
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,640
Like sorry, mom.

611
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,160
I'll be over in the place where they have the superheroes and Star Wars stuff while you

612
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,680
look for stupid makeup.

613
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:12,080
I'll be doing the full void VR experience as soon as you just quickly pop in to get

614
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,080
some eyeshadow.

615
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,080
You know what?

616
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:20,080
You're on your way to, you're at that Sephora on your way to the parks.

617
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,000
You get one of those, you get like a sample makeover.

618
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,200
They do a makeover in the store and now you look your best for donkey in the park.

619
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,280
Where Maryland, if you run into, you know, a star.

620
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:40,320
If you got some competition, then you know, like if you're trying to be the prettiest

621
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,000
gal in the park, prettier than Marilyn.

622
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,680
Or the man that's from New York.

623
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,280
Yeah, the New York tenement couple who yell at you.

624
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,360
Yes, on the second floor, yes.

625
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:55,640
If you look your best post makeover, you're less likely to get razed by the Brooklyn couple

626
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,320
in the window that yells at you.

627
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,520
Oh, Marone, where are you from, idiot?

628
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,560
I don't think they're legally allowed to call you an idiot.

629
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,560
No, they're not.

630
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,480
I think they have to be like silly guy or something.

631
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,440
Yeah, that might be the worst thing they can they can call you.

632
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,440
Pittsburgh Pirates hat.

633
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,440
They're not going to be my Yankees.

634
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,440
That's pretty good.

635
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,440
That's pretty good.

636
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,920
Yeah, I'd love to do some work for those guys.

637
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,920
Where were we?

638
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,920
Flip flop shops.

639
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:28,040
Oh, Fallen Brothers flip flop shops was used to be the wound and wound toy company.

640
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,040
Oh, yeah.

641
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,080
It was a Melrose Avenue.

642
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,320
Melrose and Avenue were Boulevard Melrose place in.

643
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,320
Who cares?

644
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:41,080
It was on Melrose and then they moved it to City Walk Avenue.

645
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,080
Avenue Avenue.

646
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,280
The little wind up shop was a local spot.

647
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,280
I think so.

648
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,280
How about that?

649
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,840
I'm not sure if it's still there, but very poorly reviewed on Yelp.

650
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,840
Oh, I bought someone a little music box there once.

651
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,840
They liked it.

652
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,840
Yeah.

653
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,800
I forget the City Walk one kind of poorly reviewed as well.

654
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:05,080
But there was a review that had a great beginning, which I will read from very quickly.

655
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:09,400
The Rolling Stones once sang that you had to start them up.

656
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,400
It's true.

657
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,400
All great things need a bit of a wind up.

658
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,400
Incredible review.

659
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,400
Wow.

660
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,840
You had to start them up.

661
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,200
Webster's Dictionary defines wind as.

662
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:27,800
Also, Mick Jagger, he sings start me up, not start us up.

663
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,920
And he's speaking for himself.

664
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:34,000
I don't know if Charlie Watts needs to be started up.

665
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,040
Charlie Watts seems like he's always asleep.

666
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:39,200
So maybe he I don't think he would like to be started up in any context.

667
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,640
Yeah, he looks annoyed to be still playing the drums.

668
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,400
But I figured out something else by now.

669
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,600
And Mick is singing to like arouse him, right?

670
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,160
That's the start me up means.

671
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,160
I guess.

672
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,160
Yes.

673
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,160
Start me up.

674
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,160
I never stop.

675
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,160
Boy, that was a rock lyric.

676
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,160
Make me a lot of messages.

677
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:58,080
Make me horny and I'll be horny forever is what he's saying.

678
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,080
For a long time.

679
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,440
I mean, that's what all of it's about.

680
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,560
You think any wind up toys ever made anybody horny?

681
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,720
Well, Sector Keep, I guess I can't ask you.

682
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,720
You're a child.

683
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,720
That's inappropriate.

684
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,200
That's a illegal question to answer, I feel.

685
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,200
Just abstain.

686
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,640
Just abstain, please.

687
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,640
Don't humor.

688
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,840
Oh, you know what I missed?

689
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,840
Also Fallen Brothers.

690
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:28,320
I missed about Lids that it was once something called Shimoni Sterling Silver Jewelry, which

691
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:36,220
is still open to this day at the Planet Hollywood Shops Mall in Las Vegas, the scariest shopping

692
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,120
center on the strip.

693
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:43,520
It has two and a half stars and the pictures of the merchandise look shoddy at best.

694
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,120
Man, do you remember?

695
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,840
Sorry, Sector Keep, there you go.

696
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:51,360
If Nick Mundy speaks equal time about that shop, I will allow him to talk about Lids

697
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,360
as well.

698
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:57,240
Oh, that'll kind of balance it out by doing by bringing history into it.

699
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,240
Yes, yes.

700
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,720
But he has to know about it.

701
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,680
Yes, the scales must be balanced.

702
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:08,320
OK, so we'll ask him if he knows what store was there under it originally.

703
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,840
And that'll that'll set the universe back in balance.

704
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,840
50-50 he knows.

705
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,660
I think it's a good shot.

706
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,160
That only leaves Cinnabon.

707
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,320
Also, very poorly reviewed on Yelp.

708
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,920
A lot of one star people are mad at this Cinnabon in particular.

709
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,240
And I saw people calling out.

710
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,760
You talk about the City Walk Markups.

711
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:32,120
I saw a tell of eight dollar Cinnabons that don't look aesthetically pleasing from their

712
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,660
photos.

713
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,680
Get out of here to them.

714
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,160
To that price point.

715
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,160
Oh, OK.

716
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,160
Yeah, I don't know.

717
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,160
That's worse than Spark.

718
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,760
I mean, nothing's worse than Sparky's.

719
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:49,080
But Cinnabon's thrive on Markups as they are in airports and expensive locations.

720
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:54,640
But I think a Cinnabon also to put on my profit helmet, I think a Cinnabon probably costs

721
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,320
about 22 cents to manufacture.

722
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,720
Great margins on that.

723
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,720
Great margins.

724
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,720
Very good margins.

725
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,640
I think this this sector might be in the running again.

726
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:10,320
I know I mentioned others, but like this is the is this the most mall mall sector, mally

727
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,320
sector?

728
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,320
Pretty boring.

729
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,840
There's a food court of the city.

730
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,600
City food, though, is, of course, like a food court upstairs.

731
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:20,760
So that's pretty mall to that's true, which is unique.

732
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,520
A bad restaurant terrible.

733
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,160
Now made me ill before that.

734
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,520
Pics, pigs, not the poke place.

735
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,400
OK, this is the city.

736
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,640
The Cinnabon is one of the first things like the main entrance to City Walk.

737
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,440
If you're like being dropped off there by a Lyft or an Uber, this is one of the main

738
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,600
like things when you walk in.

739
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,120
It's like here's the Cinnabon.

740
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,760
Like that's the icon of the park if you're just walking in for the first time on Lyft.

741
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,680
I believe now they've built in if you're picking up or dropping off there.

742
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,120
There's like the Universal Studios stop.

743
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,280
And then this is like the City Universal East stop.

744
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,280
Yes.

745
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,280
Oh, different entry points.

746
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,280
Drop offs.

747
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,280
Yeah.

748
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,280
Well, I did this.

749
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:07,800
Oh, my friend Ryan, who I went up with the other day, he I was explaining the City Walk

750
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,200
19 part saga to him.

751
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:15,720
And to get up to have the bill that we walked from the base of the he actually went to the

752
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,920
taxi stop here.

753
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:21,920
He flagged a taxi down like in New York City and hopped in it and sped away when you were

754
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,880
done explaining it.

755
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:33,520
This person is a graduate of Harvard Law, Yale Law, and is now a on track to be a tenured

756
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:37,280
law professor at a university in Hong Kong.

757
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,640
So he's happy his old buddy Scott's doing great.

758
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,640
Just like you guys.

759
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,240
We have been to downtown Disney.

760
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,920
We have been to City Walk.

761
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:52,280
I think we're we've got a pretty impressive list of credits.

762
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,280
We do.

763
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:56,800
So we say stuff like this mall was bad and this mall was good.

764
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:00,240
This that's the Cinnabon price point is unacceptable.

765
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,800
A dollar fifty for extra icing.

766
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,800
No way.

767
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:10,120
So trying to deal with the myriad of like other past City Walk establishments is probably

768
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:15,560
as confusing and frustrating as dealing with the mainland Chinese government as dealing

769
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,840
with Chinese human rights law.

770
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,840
Yes.

771
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,840
Yeah.

772
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,400
I think we're providing relationship they have with Hong Kong.

773
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,400
Yes.

774
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,400
Yeah.

775
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,800
Just as important of a service.

776
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,460
Anyway, I described the series to him and then the first thing you see walking it up

777
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:35,440
to that point is like two neon Cinnabons, which I like.

778
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,360
I like those neon Cinnabons.

779
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,480
That's one of the best thing I can say about the Cinnabon is that I like the fun neon cinnamon

780
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,760
buns.

781
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:52,080
He was he maybe struggled to see how discussion of these things would sustain 19 episodes.

782
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:57,240
But all Ryan, if you're listening, hey, you're you're waiting in it.

783
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:04,520
Proofs in the pudding, proofs in the Cinnabon frosting, 19 parts going down real smooth.

784
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,200
So oh, oh, more fallen brothers.

785
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:12,120
Cinnabon used to be something called Bonitas Frites.

786
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:17,560
And this was a location specifically for Belgian fries.

787
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,800
And that is all that they had Belgian fries.

788
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,240
And this place sounded pretty good.

789
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,520
I screenshot it a little.

790
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:31,320
It was written about in a book and you could get malt vinegar, red wine vinegar, even catsup,

791
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:34,000
salt, pepper, cayenne, mustard.

792
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
This is interesting.

793
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,120
For a few extra cents.

794
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,600
So Jason's out.

795
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:45,600
You could get remoulade sauce spiked with tarragon, a creamy, did I say it right?

796
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,600
I don't know what it is.

797
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,040
Dijon mustard dip.

798
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,440
This place sounds much better than Cinnabon.

799
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,440
Jason, they sat up.

800
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,120
Jason's more color in his face.

801
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:03,440
Remoulade, often found on a po'boy sandwich, found in New Orleans.

802
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,440
Delicious sauce.

803
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,920
Preach, Jason, preach.

804
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:10,200
You had me, I mean, I was halfway out the door when you said a few extra cents.

805
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:14,400
But once you got tarragon in there, that's a bad herb.

806
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,000
I am not a tarragon fan.

807
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,280
I'm a time boy.

808
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,520
I love the taste of time.

809
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,800
Tarragon, no thank you, sir.

810
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,240
That is already delicious.

811
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,080
It does not need any pesky tarragon in it.

812
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,200
Laying down the law.

813
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,040
Wow, testify.

814
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:37,760
This is reminding me, like we mentioned on the crepe cafe, going really in on those fries

815
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,200
with lots of dipping sauce.

816
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,320
Well, it's just more, which is very European.

817
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,880
That's the cultured way to eat your fries.

818
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:49,680
Also from this book, apparently I screen shotted.

819
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:53,160
A fall of empire.

820
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:56,880
Same book in America.

821
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,120
So quote the author, not myself.

822
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,600
This is the author talking.

823
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,600
David McCullough?

824
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,960
I think so, probably.

825
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:11,240
Something called a sauce andalouse, which no Spaniard would recognize, is basically

826
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,720
the garlic mayonnaise tinted pink with peppers.

827
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:20,400
So I want to challenge this if you're listening and you're a Spaniard and you recognize sauce

828
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,960
andalouse before it was defined, let us know.

829
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:28,240
Hashtag Spaniards know.

830
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,640
Prove this author wrong.

831
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,640
Prove David.

832
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,640
David McCullough.

833
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,560
Prove David McCullough wrong.

834
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:38,600
There's a reason they wouldn't recognize it because it wasn't named after the region of

835
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,600
Spain.

836
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,960
It was named after the pixie song.

837
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,400
And the Andalusia moon.

838
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,400
Right.

839
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,200
Like we can on the loop.

840
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,400
Is that what the name of the song is?

841
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:57,640
The movie, the short experimental film is when Chen Andalu and and there is a song based

842
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,640
on that.

843
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,640
I don't know.

844
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,440
We get what comes out of the eyeball when it's cut open on.

845
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,920
I think that's what this is supposed to be.

846
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,640
It's like a cut open can of.

847
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,360
Frank Black's favorite sauce.

848
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,360
Cut the ribbon.

849
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,440
Good on you, Frank.

850
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,440
DeBaser is the song.

851
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,440
DeBaser.

852
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,440
OK, all right.

853
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,440
I'm sorry.

854
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,440
I know DeBaser.

855
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,480
Does this kind of take us to the end portion of the.

856
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,480
I think so.

857
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,480
Sector 10.

858
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,040
You've given me great strength, boys.

859
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,720
I hear it.

860
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,720
Boys, come close.

861
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,720
Yes, of course.

862
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,720
Come close.

863
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,720
Yes.

864
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,920
I want to give you the sector 10 stone.

865
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,920
Go ahead.

866
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,600
There you go.

867
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,600
Wow.

868
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,600
Spit it out.

869
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,600
It looks like a little flip flop.

870
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,600
Yeah, it's from.

871
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,600
Yes.

872
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:53,160
Its origins are from deep beneath the flip flop shop.

873
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:57,600
And the flip flop has a little fit, fit it, brim hat.

874
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,600
Yes.

875
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,680
And it's it says sector 10.

876
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,680
Sector 10.

877
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,680
Yes.

878
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,680
It knows it belongs there.

879
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,760
It knows that Lids belongs in sector 10.

880
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,760
That's right.

881
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,760
Yes.

882
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,760
Enjoy, boys.

883
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,760
Enjoy.

884
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,760
We love.

885
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,760
OK, we will.

886
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,120
I love getting these customized stones.

887
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,120
Yeah.

888
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,160
It makes me really proud every time we get one.

889
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,680
It's going to be quite a collection.

890
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,120
We'll take a picture, right, and put it up on the social media.

891
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,120
Yeah.

892
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,120
Yeah.

893
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,120
I'm sure for all of them.

894
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,120
Yeah.

895
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,120
That's no problem.

896
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,120
So up on film, we might have to.

897
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,120
Oh, that might be an issue.

898
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,120
They are.

899
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,120
They are supernatural.

900
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,120
They are sparkling magically.

901
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:34,960
Light seems to either be absorbed by them or sharply reflected off them.

902
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:41,880
So so this gets us this gets us to the end and tomorrow's episode is with Nick Mundy

903
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:48,440
and let's just say if you think man, man, man, man, and if he thinks he's going to come

904
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:54,200
around these parts and talk about a story that has been fully covered, we have said

905
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,640
everything there is to say about Lids.

906
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,080
Listen up tomorrow and listen to us.

907
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:06,680
Give this bully a piece of our mind if he dares cross the sector keeper.

908
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,920
We're waiting for you, Mundy.

909
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,560
Sharpening your sword, skirt your loins and prepare for war.

910
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,560
Right, gentlemen?

911
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,560
Right.

912
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,560
Absolutely.

913
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,560
Right.

914
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,560
Jason, AKA, Shoto.

915
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,120
May I make one last request?

916
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,120
A reminder.

917
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,120
Yes.

918
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:29,040
That not only your your journeys give me strength, but it helps me greatly when listeners

919
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,080
like and subscribe and leave a review.

920
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,080
Oh, yeah.

921
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,080
For us.

922
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,080
Yeah.

923
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:38,000

It makes me strong and it keeps me out of hell.

928
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,640
Yeah.

929
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,880
I mean, it seems like you get wiser as these sectors go on.

930
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,880
I'm learning.

931
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,800
You didn't even know David McCullough.

932
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,800
I know.

933
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,800
Or you wouldn't even known something like that early on and you just came out of nowhere

934
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,800
a few minutes ago.

935
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,800
Smooth, smooth, smooth.

936
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,800
This is by Rob Thomas.

937
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,800
It just came to me.

938
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:08,480
Whoa, you're having visions of pop culture without even.

939
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,640
Well, that's a sign.

940
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:15,560
And I think that you that doesn't happen to you without the power of good reviews on iTunes.

941
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:20,560
So we want to see those iTunes reviews and we want them to say sector keeper sent me.

942
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,280
Let's start seeing those pop up in the store.

943
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,280
Thank you.

944
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,280
All right.

945
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,400
Well, we'll see you tomorrow.

946
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,080
Oh, boy.

947
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,560
This is it's going to be test.

948
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,560
Stay tuned, everybody.

949
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,560
It's going to be tough.

950
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,560
Come for the king.

951
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:38,640
