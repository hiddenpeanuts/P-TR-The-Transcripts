1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,560
I'm gonna play some bets that is the way Will they announce Pandora at DCA?

2
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:34,360
I'm gonna guess what Josh Demarro's gonna say, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it.

3
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,120
Uh, some Sky Garner, yeah, how about that?

4
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,440
Do you recognize the song offhand?

5
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,560
Do you know what that song is?

6
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,800
No, I wasn't sure if it was an original.

7
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,720
No, oh I wish, if only, no, that is from High School Musical 2 with amended lyrics.

8
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:58,760
That's sort of, that's Troy slash Zac Efron's song of torment which he performs solo on a golf course.

9
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,320
Wow.

10
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,240
I don't really know the rest of the movie or the, oh but it's great, he like looks at his reflection

11
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:10,440
in a golf course pond and does a bunch of kicks and it's, I don't know, I assume it really carries

12
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:15,640
the weight of the movie, again I wouldn't know, I've only seen that, it was exciting to sing that.

13
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,360
I'm not gonna stop, not gonna stop till I get my shot, that's who I am, that is my plan,

14
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,160
gonna end up on top, uh, recommended, good clip.

15
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,040
That's good, yeah.

16
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,560
So, but I sang that because we are gonna bet on it.

17
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:35,400
What's it, you ask, the D23 Expo Disney Experiences Showcase.

18
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,320
By the way, I'm Sky Garner, that's Mike Carlson.

19
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:37,960
Hello.

20
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,160
And there's Jason Sheridan.

21
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:39,660
Hi.

22
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,520
And we're all gonna, we're all gonna bet on it.

23
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:48,280
Let me do some dry explanations of things, feel free to interrupt and goof, but just to

24
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,400
clarify some basics.

25
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:59,240
As you're hearing this, this upcoming weekend is D23 Expo, the ultimate Disney fan event.

26
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,960
This is occurring as it does every two years, correct?

27
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:07,560
There's also these Destination D23s, but this big one is this big event in Anaheim,

28
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,360
very close to Disneyland, it is happening on August 9th, 10th, and 11th.

29
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,440
And we are doing a little bit of programming around D23, and specifically what we're gonna

30
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:24,600
find out at the Disney Experiences Showcase, which is the boring title for the thing where

31
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,120
they announce park shit.

32
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,440
That's what we call it in our hearts, is the park shit panel.

33
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,280
So, a couple of sort of related episodes.

34
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,840
This Friday, the 9th, on the main feed, we will finally be doing the episode Fixing Tomorrowland.

35
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:47,080
We will reveal our plans, low budget, mid budget, and blue sky, big budget, of how we

36
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,360
would fix Tomorrowland in anticipation of any announcements involving the real Tomorrowland

37
00:02:52,360 --> 00:03:00,920
and the real plans that we could be getting at Horizons, the Disney Experiences Showcase, correct?

38
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,640
Okay, I might be missing some colons or some dashes or something.

39
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:14,200
That event, however, is happening on Saturday night the 10th, 7pm, a nice inconvenient time,

40
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,920
especially for the East Coast, an inconvenient time for stuff we wanted to do, like do we

41
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,760
look extreme right after, what do we do?

42
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,040
Here's what we have landed on.

43
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:28,360
We are gonna record together as early as we can on Sunday, and then post an episode as

44
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,160
soon as we can on the main feed, instead of our usual episode that Friday.

45
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:38,760
So instead of a Friday episode five days early, you're gonna be getting on the main feed

46
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:44,200
for the first time our reactions to the D23, hopefully, news.

47
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,600
Hopefully, good news.

48
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,960
Or else we have really put a lot of stock, which would be a perfect fall for us to take.

49
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,800
Change is the only constant, you know?

50
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,960
It's the only thing you can count on, and you can count on that and count on, like,

51
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:08,280
we've got some ideas that we're not ready to share yet, but the sky is blue.

52
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,920
I'd say you could count on that more than you can count on change.

53
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,040
That's the problem.

54
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,120
I'm worried there's not gonna be enough change.

55
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,360
Change should be on the ballot.

56
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,400
I agree.

57
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:17,960
Sure.

58
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:23,160
I mean, I would love it if they did a D23 presentation, like the last few,

59
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,520
but they have the Honda Center packed.

60
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,720
Yeah, that's the thing.

61
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,960
This panel is not happening in a big ballroom in a convention center.

62
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:38,760
It is happening in a hockey arena, and the size of this implies you would think

63
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:46,120
that we are finally going to get some big good news, something worthy of filling an arena with,

64
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:53,000
and it sort of feels like this is the last chance for them to stop pulling the shit they have been

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,800
pulling of, well, there's something we could be, there's something we've been kind of starting

66
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,680
to wonder about thinking about, dreaming about, maybe for 10 years from now.

67
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,280
Right?

68
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:10,520
I mean, like, again, we might be in Charlie Brown football territory yet again,

69
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,960
but it does seem like this is do or die.

70
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,720
I've seen Jimmy Buffett at the Honda Center, I've seen Bruce Springsteen at the Honda Center,

71
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,160
and now Josh DeMoro is going to take the stage.

72
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,080
The three greatest of all time.

73
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,040
At the Honda Center.

74
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,320
And the Honda Center is the venue that used to be called The Pond.

75
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,800
Yes, the Pond in Anaheim.

76
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,800
So the hubris for booking that venue and then calling it Horizons, I've said this a couple

77
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,680
times on the show already, that is wild to me.

78
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,400
That is taunting the average Disney fan to get your expectations sky high.

79
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:54,200
And they've got the money, they just did another round of layoffs, 140 people in the television

80
00:05:54,200 --> 00:06:02,840
division, so they, what's like 40,000 times 140, like they can afford some rides.

81
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,320
They can finally afford some rides, yes, because of these layoffs, which we were worried about.

82
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,400
Glad we got rid of.

83
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,720
We hate layoffs unless it causes a new ride.

84
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,200
That's our stance here on the show.

85
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:20,360
Yeah, it's like, I don't know, it's really a make or break moment and I can't help but

86
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:25,880
equate it to kind of a different make or break moment that's been occurring in the recent

87
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,080
past and this is not, this does not exactly line up, I think you'll find that it does

88
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:36,440
not line up morally, but the fact that Disney is kind of set in its old ways and not recognizing

89
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:41,880
the threat on the doorstep, in this case that being Epic Universe, it kind of reminds me

90
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:49,240
of another stodgy institution that starts with a D, the DNC, not realizing that the

91
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:54,520
threat of a second Donald Trump presidency is very real.

92
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,680
Now I hate to equate Trump and Epic Universe, that's not right.

93
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,720
I'm very excited about Epic Universe and I'm way more excited about a second Trump presidency.

94
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:12,760
I'm just saying, it seems like in the recent past, metaphorically, Disney has been more

95
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:18,760
than willing to run Biden, to stick with the plan, he says he wants to do it, he says that

96
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:22,520
he's fine, so let's get him out there and that's what we're going to do.

97
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:31,720
No way, no way, it's Brad Summer and the Kamala campaign quickly adopted that, so we're going

98
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,200
nuts. This is what we're waiting to find out is, is it Brad Summer? Are they going to make a big

99
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:42,920
change that energizes the base and that recognizes what's coming and what they're up against?

100
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:50,840
Do they get us all excited in an arena or do they trot out an old man who's kind of the equivalent

101
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:57,480
of saying, we're in a blue sky, we're blue sky and we're doing Coatino, we got Coatino,

102
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,360
come on. Look, I think Disney is coconut-pilled, I think we're doing this,

103
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:08,200
I think we're doing it, I think we're doing it. Is it cornhole or is it coconut? What is the future

104
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,920
of the Disney company? Let's do it. Yeah, well, we'll find out how coconut-pilled they are.

105
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:19,880
So we'll see, doesn't it feel like that's how, can we come out of this and feel like the tide

106
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:25,640
turned and that it's Disney's game again? Here's what I'll say overall, I think there's going to

107
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:33,400
be a lot more concrete announcements than in years past. I still don't think it's going to blow away

108
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:41,000
everybody like we want it to. I think it'll be like, well, that was a lot better than last year,

109
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,640
but I don't know, I don't think we're getting, maybe we're just getting right into it. I don't

110
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:52,920
think we're getting concrete Disneyland forward information. I think we're going to get maybe

111
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,640
teases of lands, but I do not think we're getting, and they're going here, this is going here,

112
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:03,240
here's the map of it. I think that is only sort of going to be lightly teased. I think it's too

113
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:10,760
early and I don't think they know themselves. Right, because to me that's what, for us at least,

114
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:15,400
on this coast, that's the big stuff we want. What is Disneyland forward? What does that look like?

115
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:21,800
Yeah, we've got the biggest expansion pad we've ever had. I mean, I guess not

116
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,960
DCA itself, but you know what I mean, a really big one. I hope I'm wrong about that,

117
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:30,120
but I feel like there will be a lot of good stuff. I don't know if there's going to be

118
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:36,680
anything blow away like Galaxy's Edge was many years ago. That's my feeling in general. We'll

119
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:44,600
see though. Well, here's what we're doing to make this more interesting on ourselves, is that as

120
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:49,960
we've declared we want it to do, we are actually doing it. This episode is all about betting on

121
00:09:50,680 --> 00:10:01,640
what's going to occur at the D23 Horizons Disney experiences panel when Josh Demaro comes out.

122
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:06,600
By the way, I hope that we're, I'm assuming that there's like a YouTube feed of this or else a lot

123
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:12,520
of our plans fall apart, but presumably as we've had in the past, there is some sort of live stream

124
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:19,080
that lets us be there, lets us experience the magic from our homes because we are not going,

125
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:24,200
we did not get tickets to this event. There's a chance I'm going, but I don't know yet.

126
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:30,600
Oh really? Wow, wow, wow. Okay. Interesting. Well, then you'll have to tell us how thunderous

127
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,520
the reaction to some of these things. I hope you can make it through an episode the next day

128
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:40,360
without a massive hangover because I know you're going to be doing shots that whole time.

129
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:46,920
Oh yeah, I have a flask on the floor. I'll come back to the seat like at a basketball game. I

130
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:52,360
have a big like a thing with a hot dog in it and a big beer, like sitting front row waiting

131
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,440
for Mr. Demaro to tell me what I'm going to ride in seven years. Yeah, it sounds great.

132
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,360
I guess I am curious about that is if it is the regular consent. Yeah. If you wanted to,

133
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:06,120
without bringing it yourself, can you get drunk at the experiences panel?

134
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,440
Yeah. Well, don't they sell, we've been, did you go to D23? I think they sell beer on the

135
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,600
convention floor at D23. There are a ton of drink stands around the convention center.

136
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:20,760
So I think you can get pretty lit up. Can beer, can wine, can cocktails. You can really party.

137
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:25,960
Yeah. So it would be chaos if they had that on the floor at San Diego, I feel like.

138
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:30,920
Yeah, yes and no. I mean, I think San Diego is, I don't know, we can debate how drunk everybody

139
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:36,360
would be at San Diego, but I think it would be okay, but it's very crowded there. It would be

140
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,120
fun. More crowded. Sure. Well, sure. Yeah. So yeah.

141
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:48,440
So we, and we're still kind of figuring out our plans here, but we have like general areas,

142
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:54,280
right? That we think like very, very possible announcements, things that we think are riskier

143
00:11:54,280 --> 00:12:02,440
bets. And, but what the intention here is to actually make bets with our own money against

144
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:09,880
each other and see who comes out on top in terms of getting this panel correct. Does anybody want

145
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:15,000
to assess their own level of confidence here? I don't know that I feel the most confident to

146
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,400
be honest, and I shouldn't like put those cards on the table, but I'm just not on the rumor.

147
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,960
Yeah, you don't do this as much as I do. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think Mike is the guy to beat.

148
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:31,800
Yeah. Mike, I think is guy to beat. I had to look up some of the recent stuff. I feel like so much

149
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:37,640
is like floated, like a balloon, like a test balloon. Like I was like, wait, did they announce

150
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:44,120
the tropical? Okay. They didn't announce the tropical Americas redo for dino land and animal

151
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:49,720
kingdom, but there's not a lot of specifics. Yeah. Like that's happening. The Indiana Jones

152
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,840
thing, a redo of dinosaur is happening pretty much. That's the feeling I'm getting where it's like,

153
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,840
there's permits have been filed. But there's not a name yet. Right. There's not, there's not a name.

154
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:07,880
I guess that's, that's what the other, the concrete thing is. I don't know much about how I feel about

155
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:13,560
the rumors, but I love gambling. It is a problem. It could be a real problem. Well, you've looked,

156
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:18,280
you've talked about it on the show before. I love gambling for very low stakes. You're Mr. Penny,

157
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,880
you're Mr. Penny Sluts. I was about to say you love gambling, but yes, but on Penny Sluts.

158
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:26,760
Do it now. Would you like this to be a one cent operation? Right? No, I well, that's the foolhardy

159
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:32,280
thing of Penny Slots. You're really 50 cents slots. That is foolhardy. Yes. You're right.

160
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:37,320
Why won't they let you just bet one single penny? I think Vegas is fucked the morality there. Just

161
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:43,720
blow it up. I say, I believe when you revealed your borderline addiction to penny slots on the

162
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:48,520
Vegas episode last year, I think I made some sort of comment and you said, Michael, it's becoming,

163
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:53,480
it could become a problem or something. You were very sincere about that. I could be down 79 cents.

164
00:13:53,480 --> 00:14:01,880
My man. I did play the little shop machine down from $195 to $7. Sure. So, but some of that was,

165
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:07,080
but some of this was an episode with Gabris where he's like, I lost $5,000.

166
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:14,360
You and me, buddy, we're in the same boat here. Boy, the gamble heads,

167
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,000
they're going to bury us naked because we bet all our clothes.

168
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:22,600
But it was still, I could have gotten a nice meal for us. Sure. But you were having fun.

169
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,320
Yeah, I was having fun. You're going to have fun today as I take you for all your worth.

170
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,520
I'm going to sucker you into so many bets today. You're going to be wearing that barrel with the

171
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:39,080
straps, pal. But he's been dreaming of that since he first heard the reference. No, he's trying. I

172
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:47,880
wore the barrel with the straps in today. So can I do, here's what I think is a sure bet. Can I start

173
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:55,080
us? Yeah, sure. Yeah. I think they'll announce the name of the Indiana Jones redo. Okay. I believe,

174
00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:00,360
I agree with you. Okay. Well, that's not, see, there should be some disagreement here.

175
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:06,920
I guess, well, this is what we're going to bump into if we don't get, well, all right, this is

176
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:11,160
the kind of thing maybe we can take like specific. Also what, all right, we also have to establish,

177
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,720
what is it, what, what amount of money are you betting on that, Jason? I, we, we were talking

178
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:22,280
about like, uh, what's the entry level five, five dollars. I'll go five. Let's go five. Sure. Yeah.

179
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,760
Yeah. I'm not taking this back, but yeah, five, they're going to announce that. I think that's

180
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:31,320
coming. You think we're getting name? I think so. Cause that's, that's so far along. That's why I

181
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:37,400
think like that's for sure happening. Work permits filed dinosaur is closing. Okay. Well then here,

182
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:44,120
all right. Here's how I, maybe here's a way to make it. I will, I will take like an, I will amend it

183
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:51,880
and say, I think we'll get specific. I think they will officially say out loud that it's Indiana

184
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:58,120
Jones and inconto, and we will not get names thrown out because isn't that, that's a way we

185
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,840
could do this is like, I like, we agree with each other. However, I think we're only getting concept

186
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:07,400
art. We're only getting like vagaries. So let's just to, just to start us off with something,

187
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:12,920
I will say no name confirmation, but no name. And you say name. Yeah, I say name. Okay.

188
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,800
So that's the, I guess the bet is on there. Really name versus no name. Great. Okay. It's

189
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:23,240
long shot bet. Does Harrison Ford come in? Well, I have that written down is Harrison Ford on stage

190
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,800
for this announcement. Now, if you want to do a little detective work, like I like to do,

191
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:32,520
he is a Disney legend this year. He is being named a legend. That being said,

192
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:39,560
you shouldn't have said that. That being said, the ceremony is the day after, not the same day.

193
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,800
Yeah. I don't know if they're getting two appearances out of the,

194
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,960
I don't know. And they also just had him at a comic con. He was at a comic con. He's goofing

195
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:50,200
around. He, did you see that? He was goofing around as the Hulk made a face. Yeah. He likes,

196
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:55,080
he's also, again, we it's he's fake. He's cranky and stuff. He doesn't bubble. He looks guy likes

197
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:59,960
to have fun. This guy enjoys being around. They can get, they could get them down to Anaheim,

198
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:05,240
put them in a hotel. And if he's already there, and if he's already there, they do like to bring

199
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,400
people out. They brought Dick Van Dyke out for the Mary Poppins thing that they never built.

200
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,760
A couple of years ago. So they would like to have Harrison on stage there. And it would be really

201
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:21,960
cool if they announced that it will be Harrison's voice on the ride, like it wasn't. Yeah. In

202
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:29,880
Disneyland. Yes. So I kind of think Harrison's coming out on stage during this part of the show.

203
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,040
Let's see yours. That's so convincing. I don't know if I want. You don't have to take it. I'm

204
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:38,120
just saying this is what I'm, this is what I'm guessing. This is a guess because he's going to

205
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:46,280
be there. And it seems like in the new modern Disney company, a big effort is made to make sure

206
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:52,280
that the stars of said movies are represented on the rides. Yeah. Yeah. Which reminds me,

207
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:57,080
there was just the Epic universe announcement of like, and you'll join Harry and Hermione.

208
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:01,000
I'm confused by that. What is that going to be? I have no idea. I don't think Daniel Radcliffe's

209
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:09,800
shown up to de-age himself. No, he's 40 years old. Yeah. What incentive is there? And they all,

210
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:17,080
not all of them, I like how many of them seem to have problems with the creator of said franchise.

211
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:23,320
Sure. Yeah. So, yeah. Don't take me out. All right. Here's what I, all right. I will go,

212
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:28,520
all right. A hundred dollars that Daniel Radcliffe's on stage at D23. Okay. I would take you up on that

213
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:35,080
if that's a serious bet. Wait, no, wait. No, pull it. Oh, he's nightcrawler now. Sorry. Harrison.

214
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:42,280
I mean, how much is that worth to you? That's worth two dollars. I'll do a two, but I was going

215
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,360
to say if you were going to do that bigger, I wouldn't do it because it does seem right,

216
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,680
but I'll do it. I'll do a cheapo. Sure. Two. You and I on for two and Harrison showing up on the

217
00:18:50,680 --> 00:19:00,200
panel. And my voice will be on the ride and it's Indiana Jones. We should guess on what the title

218
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:08,120
of the ride is. Indiana Jones and the dinosaur dilemma, which is what I've said for a while.

219
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,600
I want them to keep the dinosaurs on the ride and just throw Indiana Jones in there. I don't think

220
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:17,400
they're going to do that, but I have heard it's an original ride. It's not our ride. It's not the

221
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:22,600
Tokyo Disney version. It's going to be a new story with Indiana Jones. Indiana Jones and the

222
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:30,600
chalice of adventure. What word soup can we get? Who the hell is Chester and Hester?

223
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:39,960
So yes, okay. I do think we'll see, I think we'll see more stars as well if it fits.

224
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:48,360
Stars, voice actors and such. Yeah, yeah. Let me throw out, I believe we'll get

225
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:55,800
an Avengers name and I will also, an Avengers e-ticket name. I don't know if we'll get a lot

226
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:01,400
more information about what that is going to be. I'm talking about the DCA ride, but I think we

227
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:06,520
will get a name and I will further specify my bet to say it is mealy-mouthed and I don't know what

228
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,440
the hell it means. Okay. I think that I would not take that, but I agree with you. I think we'll

229
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:16,920
get a title for that. That has to be coming. They've already downgraded the ride and

230
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:22,440
impressiveness. Of course, the initial version seemed crazy and seemed very expensive and then

231
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,680
Chapec slashed the budget on it. Now it seems more like an Omni-mover. I've heard tell that

232
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:33,400
it's the technology that's very much like the Spider-Man Transformers ride that they're using

233
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:39,080
on the Peter Pan ride at the newly opened Fantasy Springs, which is a lot of screens,

234
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:44,920
but I think it's cool. It's an impressive use of it, but that's what the newer Avengers ride is.

235
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:49,960
I don't, and this is some of my pan bias. Go ahead. I look at that ride and I'm like,

236
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:58,040
yeah, I guess so, but I don't know. Maybe my mind would be blown if I were on it. I saw people

237
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:04,120
saying similar things about just watching a video of the Zootopia Shanghai attraction,

238
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:08,840
which Jackie's was raving about, and that one communicates to me more. I watched that ride

239
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:14,680
through and I see how it's better than the pan doesn't feel like anything truly mind blowing.

240
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:19,160
I could see how it's fun, but I don't know that it's very good. I don't know that it feels like,

241
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:23,320
oh my God, and maybe the way they have it now, because I could see on some,

242
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,680
from just the YouTube video, some of the show scenes, you have more of your field of vision

243
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:34,600
blocked kind of, so it really, I feel like maybe makes the screen feel like even more immersive

244
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:40,200
in a way. I don't know if there's like crates and stuff stacked up over here and then you're

245
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:46,520
looking at the actual movement on the screen. Your focus is drawn a little more. Yeah, but I

246
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,280
don't know. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. Does that mean do we all believe then that we get

247
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:59,000
Avengers e-ticket name? I believe that, yes. Jason. Yeah, see, I was going back and forth if

248
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:08,040
there is more of a fire under their ass with all the announcements of Dr. Doom,

249
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:16,440
the Russo is coming back, but I feel like that would be too fast to lock down details of the ride.

250
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:22,760
Oh, and maybe they want to kind of hedge their bets and wait to see what would be in our best

251
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:29,560
interest to base a ride around the new stuff, around Doom and such. Yeah, so I think maybe a

252
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:37,800
generic, like, Avengers defend Wakanda or something. Well, King Thanos is the villain. They

253
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:43,720
announced the villain last time. But they also announced a king and it's not king anymore. Well,

254
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,600
that's true. So we could change the- It could be changed. I just think that's unlikely because

255
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:53,320
they've said King Thanos and people like Thanos and they know who he is. I'm guessing it's full

256
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,240
steam ahead. We can figure out a bet here, but I'm guessing it's full steam ahead on whatever

257
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,160
version they have. But we all agree we think we're going to name. I think so. Wow. Yeah.

258
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:05,640
Nobody wants to take the no just to make it interesting. I'll make that a two. I'll make

259
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,880
that a nobody wants two bucks. Here's a bet. Yeah. We'll see if anybody disagrees with me.

260
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:18,360
Deadpool on stage. I wrote it down. I wrote it down on stage. Deadpool is now in the parks. We

261
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:24,120
haven't talked about this yet on the show. This just happened. He is making innuendo jokes. Body.

262
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:31,240
Body jokes in California Adventure. My. And I'm like, well, this is like the most, and I

263
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,320
shouldn't say thrilling. It's not thrilling, but this is the most, whoa, like we lose our country

264
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:41,480
bear bodiness. But I'm like, Deadpool is saying body for a Disney park. Like my head was spinning.

265
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:47,720
Splash Mountain jokes. References to Grindr. He made a Grindr joke. He made a joke about

266
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:54,280
Wolverine being a bottom. Wow. I was like, whoa. It's all happening. All right. Then I'll put money

267
00:23:54,280 --> 00:24:01,560
that Mike goes to D23 to try to assassinate body Deadpool. Right. Cause I don't like it. Yeah. Yeah.

268
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:05,720
Put an end to this forever. I hope that show lasts. Cause I think we, I think story time with

269
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,640
Deadpool episode next month or this month. No. Yeah. This one is that the name of what they're

270
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,600
doing? Yes. Cause he sits there with a little book and he like reads a story to everybody.

271
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:17,560
The Wolverine comes out and they goof around. They make it sort of like a faux bell kind of

272
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:21,640
the four kids thing that is not for kids. And he gets to be topical. He gets to be taught like

273
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:27,000
topical. Yeah. This is a thing fully called by, maybe you could say the show in general,

274
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,720
but I feel like especially you, I think you really, you're calling it. Andrew Grissom saw

275
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:37,560
the show yesterday or two days ago. Said it was good. The audience liked it. You might like this

276
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:42,840
version of Deadpool better than the on screen version. The one in the film. The performer seems

277
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:47,160
like he's having a fun time. I am all caught up. Well, I haven't seen the new one, but I watched

278
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:51,240
the first two Deadpools. I have not seen the third one. Well, that's not all caught up then. I'm all

279
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:57,480
caught up on the archival. Okay. So, so the archival the Deadpool vaults the Deadpool vault.

280
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:02,280
I like them. I thought they're pretty funny. Uh, okay. We all kind of, I think agree maybe

281
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:07,400
Deadpool on stage with, with Kevin Feige or and Josh tomorrow, maybe. Yeah, that feels too. That's

282
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,600
exactly the kind of thing they've been doing. Right. He's across the street. Now let's ask.

283
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:17,400
Now let me ask you this question. Deadpool makes some reference to Josh tomorrow being attractive.

284
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:22,760
That's exactly what I had too, Mike. I can't go against you. What do you think? Yes, we both agree.

285
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:26,120
Jason, what do you think? Do you think Deadpool says anything like, Hey, good looking or like

286
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:31,560
anything, anything resembling like kind of a comment on this guy's hotter than Ryan Reynolds?

287
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:41,080
Uh, I'm going to say no. Okay. I want to take a long shot bet that Deadpool makes a joke

288
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:49,240
about other d23 announcements in the past that the parks panel being lackluster. Okay. So the

289
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:56,040
bet is now, do you get comments on attractiveness or do you get, do you get like a comment about how

290
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:00,040
the panel last year, like blue, like behind big thunder mountain, we didn't really see what was

291
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:04,520
behind there last time or, or it was nothing. Like it was. Okay. Here's what I'm going to do.

292
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:10,120
Uh, do we just like kind of put a pool, the Deadpool? Okay. Do we call this a five? Sure.

293
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,120
Actually kind of the origin of his name in the movie. It's from a pool. Well, it's from,

294
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,680
yeah, it's a betting pool. It's a betting. Oh, yeah. And he's going to die.

295
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:22,840
Eastwood mercenary is going to die. Oh, gotcha. Because I liked that as a joke, Mike, but I actually

296
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,640
don't, I don't think it's actually going to happen because I think the attractiveness of

297
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:31,320
Josh tomorrow is a pretty, that's pretty online only thing. So I, I, I'm not actually going to put,

298
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:37,400
I'll bet on it. Okay. Uh, um, so Mike bets attractive. We all think Deadpool on stage.

299
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:44,680
Uh, I think, uh, uh, okay. Mike thinks tomorrow is attractive comment. Jason thinks roasting previous

300
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:49,320
D 23s. I think neither of those and it's more bland, but we do get Deadpool. Is that fair? Yeah.

301
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,080
Yeah. So we all take a different, this is the way to do it. I think, because we're going to agree

302
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:59,400
too much. So if we find little, little wedges, I think that's great. And then what happens if we,

303
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:04,680
uh, and if we're, if we're all wrong, then we all have to take a $5 bill and burn it.

304
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:11,560
We have to, yes, destroy it because we donate it to something. No, no. Yeah. Take it out of, yeah.

305
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:18,360
Take it out and burn it off to circulation. Um, in the true spirit of theme park attractions,

306
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:25,560
what they should have is Deadpool at the very beginning should hijack the panel and stuff

307
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:30,680
starts going wrong throughout the past stage going wrong. Do you think there's any odds of that

308
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:36,200
happening? It's a good idea. No, it's too fun. Too interesting. It's too fun. Too interesting.

309
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,760
Here's, here's another one of these where we might get some micro differ. There might be ways to

310
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:45,800
like break off the bed. It, one of the things that's feels a little obvious and ready and

311
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:52,200
there they've been like doing those pseudo teases here and there is avatar that avatar is coming to

312
00:27:52,200 --> 00:28:01,800
the Disneyland resort, but where here's the, is anybody up for a location based bet? And let me,

313
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:07,320
here's, here's why. And if you haven't heard this online speculation, um, there's strong rumors,

314
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:13,160
strong enough that maybe I should listen to it. They should, that avatar's going in Hollywood

315
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:19,960
land. They're blowing up monster zinc, all of those sound stages and the bus area, which will be

316
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:28,680
moved across Harbor. Um, so that also, so the park expands into what is currently a bus area. Yeah.

317
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:36,360
Um, I, I am going to say, I don't think that I, if to me, avatar feels tailor made for, uh,

318
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:44,280
Disneyland forward for like blue sky blank online rumors or no, I think, well, there's a couple

319
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:51,000
bets here, but I'd say my bet would be avatar is going in Disneyland forward. If anybody wants to

320
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,520
bet, they say DCA, but they don't say more. They say it is replacing Hollywood land. Does anybody

321
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:02,680
have thoughts on what you might want to grab in terms of avatar? I don't, the, the rumor that,

322
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:07,560
that the avatar land is going in Hollywood land is insane to me. It doesn't make sense.

323
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:11,720
Really? Yeah. Okay. I, all right. Why would that make sense? It's already like,

324
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,320
they've got Marvel on one side. Then you got old Hollywood in the other. And then there's just in

325
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:21,400
the middle of it. You're on Pandora. Yeah, that's my, that's my thing. And I saw some video that

326
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:26,680
pointed out that they, they do not want to move those monorail tracks and monorails exactly there.

327
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:33,720
Now I like the idea by the way, because if I fantasize about avatar goes there or avatar goes

328
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:40,600
in like, it's not going to be utopia cause they're doubling down on utopia, but uh, uh, subs,

329
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:46,920
whatever that, that monorail, I like the idea that like monorail goes in and out of unrelated

330
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:53,480
property. I just don't think that's how they think anymore. Right. I think that's a very 60s Disney

331
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:58,680
vibe. So, uh, so maybe this is not a bet that you're going to do. Not a bet I'm going to do.

332
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:03,400
Do you have any, is there anything you want to throw down avatar wise? I think they will show

333
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:09,720
more concept art for avatar. Okay. And I think maybe even a hint of what the ride is,

334
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:16,920
which I've heard rumors of it being the Shanghai pirates type ride, like a wifi boat ride.

335
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:23,880
But I don't think, maybe they will say it's going in Disneyland forward,

336
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:29,400
but I don't think we're getting location. I just think we're going to get more art. I think we'll

337
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:37,800
get, they'll talk about it. I'll, I'll say that they say DCA. I don't want to limit it because

338
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,400
maybe they do say a specific location, but I will roughly say that they say California adventure,

339
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:48,200
but that could mean Hollywood could mean across the street, Disneyland forward expansion of DCA.

340
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:53,160
Jason, any thoughts on avatar? I don't think I have strong feelings either. I mean, I think

341
00:30:54,040 --> 00:31:01,160
it makes sense in a real estate perspective that it would take over a Hollywood. Now the thing that

342
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:06,840
there's no transitions. I'm upset. No, there's no transitions. And then I think I just have a very

343
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:12,120
low opinion of like, yeah, just bulldoze at all. Make a band to wear out. I don't know. The thing

344
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:18,040
that makes more sense would just be to wrap Marvel around more. Of course. Yeah, absolutely. I think

345
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:21,960
so. Yeah. Just, and you could probably take some of those structures and just paint them

346
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:28,440
more Marvel-y and get more Marvel stuff in there. A new rumor I've heard is that's going to be

347
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:35,720
Zootopia. Oh, and that makes sense. Any odds of that being said now? No, not a bit. Well,

348
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:41,000
well, it depends because Zootopia probably has a, there's like a, usually windows of exclusivity.

349
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:47,480
So perhaps if they say in five years or something, there's a chance, but it's, I just heard this

350
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:52,200
rumor. So I wonder if that like coincides with the fact that it's just sort of a newer idea.

351
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:57,560
I think Shanghai's too new and they wouldn't. That's what I think. Yeah. So I don't know that

352
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:02,280
they'd even want to tease it. I'd like to throw out the notion that, because I think one area

353
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:08,200
that we've limited ourselves with the little challenges is that like, you know, the bet has

354
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:15,800
to be on, right? I think we could do things where like, I'm only putting in $1 here, but if I'm

355
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:21,800
right, I get 50. I think if there's anything like that. Oh. Where there's no punishment for being

356
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:26,520
wrong, but it's like, I was trying to think of an equivalent, which is like, you know, if you,

357
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:32,520
I'm only putting $1 into an Oscar pool right now, but it's on twisters. I'm betting that

358
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:37,720
twisters is going to be the best picture of the year and next year's Oscars and that that's a

359
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:44,280
thousand to one odds. Is that a thing we can do? I will take a dollar bet on Avatar. What do you

360
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:50,920
mean? That H shows up at DCA. Yeah. That's where I'm at. That's where Scott agrees. Oh, that's where

361
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:56,440
well, wait, are we against Mike here? I was proposing that as a, like, do you, if you were

362
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:06,120
wanted to say, if I'm way weird, right about the Zootopia. Oh, um, uh, oh, Zootopia. Yeah. I,

363
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:11,080
I don't feel as strongly about that. I'll, I'll take it though that they announced Zootopia for

364
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:15,480
that area. Okay. Yeah, I'll do that. Okay. I'll take that. What do you want to free for if you're

365
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,640
right? Uh, $10. Just 10. Okay. That's very generous. Yeah. I don't need it. I don't need it.

366
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:24,760
We can start building these amounts. All right. How about this? Yeah. Open the flood gates,

367
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:31,480
all characters in Star Wars land. Oh, we're doing it. Okay. We're breaking the glass. C3PO,

368
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:36,840
all your friends. Yeah. Uh, 25 year old that looks vaguely like Mark Hamill. Luke Skywalker can be

369
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:42,440
there. Everybody in galaxy's edge. No, I'm saying no. I'm saying no. I'll do that bet with you. And

370
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:48,360
I, because, uh, here and here's, and it's less because, uh, of any annoyance I have with the,

371
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:56,600
my friends aren't there thing, which is strong. However, I think that they, uh, they like to like

372
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:01,240
take their time. They like to say, I think if they're going to do it, they're going to say

373
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:07,160
Han Solo is coming the end. And then six months from now, you hear another one flood gates,

374
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:14,840
no way flood gates. Okay. So yes. So in my scenario, they have to say the get like the

375
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:20,280
world of galaxy's edge is expanding. And now just around the corner, you can meet any sort of care.

376
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:25,560
Like if there's sort of a vague idea of opening the flood gates, do I still win in the sense that

377
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:30,200
like they are saying now they're not going to say that like, we're, we're throwing out the old

378
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:35,240
rule book of like, it has to be in one spot in the timeline. If they just say, they say,

379
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:41,560
you know, we're open, like, uh, unlimited amount of stories now can be told in galaxy's edge. And

380
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:47,160
here's a few of the characters you'll be able to meet. Only if I will, I would only agree to that

381
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:56,200
if it is clearly the one character is not or shapes even from, uh, original trilogy,

382
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:02,520
because that could so easily mean TV show stuff. Sure. Uh, I like this, this bet to me is only if

383
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:08,120
it's characters from the seventies and eighties. So if it's Vader, that counts. Yeah. So if they

384
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:11,720
literally just say, we're going to tell more stories and then they say, and now Darth Vader

385
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:15,800
will be roaming the streets. Then you get, then I get it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Some of these

386
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:20,920
might require parsing. Sure. Of course. And we'll do that. We like to parse. What's the number in

387
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:27,240
your head there? Um, uh, five bucks. I don't know. You don't want to go higher on that. Oh,

388
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:33,800
it depends on your level of, uh, how far do you want to take it? Jason, are you in on that? Are

389
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:39,160
you, uh, you think I'm wrong? I think you're wrong. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I think, then I think,

390
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:44,600
I think Jason and I are aligned. We're splitting then on avatar and on, uh, got it. I know. Yes.

391
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:52,280
Okay. I toss out a galaxy's edge thing. Yeah, go ahead. I am putting five bucks on no galaxy's

392
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:59,160
edge. No mention of galaxy's edge. Maybe a mention of like, and the story, you know,

393
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:06,600
just like, and it's still open. Then maybe that, but they bring Scotch Roebers. You say, yes,

394
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:11,720
you've heard rumors. Galaxy that just not closed. You're not closing it. I don't think there's an,

395
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:18,200
I am putting $5 no galaxy's edge. I'm not willing to go against you on that. Cause I,

396
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,240
I just don't think it's like a priority. I think there's other stuff they got to do.

397
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:27,320
It's not a priority or so you're, yeah, you're going, um, yeah. I mean, I'll take you up on that.

398
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:32,920
Obviously if I think this bet, so I'll take you, I'll take you up on that bet. $5. Okay. I think

399
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:39,880
that what I think is going to happen is there's going to be a lot of little stuff, which is kind

400
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:45,080
of why I'm thinking about stuff that is not so expensive. That might be kind of exciting.

401
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,760
I mean, that sounds like the modern Disney company. Right. And I still, I think they're

402
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:53,400
going to be a couple of big things, but I think stuff like galaxy's edge characters

403
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:59,000
is something you can get a big pop from in the Honda center. If you say C three PO is there.

404
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:05,400
I, I agree with you on little stuff. I just think they're still just trying to milk like,

405
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:10,120
look, it's the Mandalorian and grow. That's my feeling. I know they're going to parse it out.

406
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:16,520
But if they bring, if they, but, but with this bet, if they say, oh, you can meet, uh, the skeleton

407
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:23,000
crew or whatever that new show is, then I win that bet. I disagree. I'm only giving it. I'm

408
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,240
only giving it to you. If it's original trilogy new shows, they've already been doing this bet.

409
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,360
Jason's talking about, sorry. Yeah. The Jason, where he said there's not going to mention it

410
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:37,080
at all. Got it. I win. Okay. Yes. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Great. Okay. I'm not giving it to you on C

411
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:40,280
three PO because C three PO is in the new ones. And our two D two is already there. That's a little

412
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:45,400
bit of C three PO is not in this. You don't get anything for C three PO, but he's, the suit is

413
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:51,560
already there. If they say we're opening it up, if they just say, now you can meet C three PO,

414
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:57,800
I agree with you. I don't win the bet. But if they do some flowery language about expanding the

415
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,800
amount of characters you can meet and we're starting with C three PO, I still think I win.

416
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:06,840
I will do, let me do a, I'll do a sliding scale here. I don't think I'm not giving you the full

417
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:13,800
amount for that, but the full amount is, uh, original trilogy, but then, and I'm not putting

418
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,720
C three PO. All right. Well, we can parse. We can, we can debate that depending on what the language

419
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:21,960
of there might, you might have to hear an episode in the future. That's that just turns into fighting

420
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:28,200
and give me my damn money. Yeah, that might be Star Wars. If it wasn't complicated and unclear,

421
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:34,120
what was going on? I have something similar to what you just threw out, Jason, which is a bet

422
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:39,160
on a lack. I'm putting a little riskier because we're, you know, it feels like they've been edging

423
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:43,400
towards it. It's what we're talking about. I'm putting $10 on no tomorrow land.

424
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:53,240
Well, I'm putting money on the final announcement for the whole show. Whoa. Tomorrowland. Okay.

425
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:59,560
In Disneyland. Is this the same bet or is some, is it somehow, do you get a bonus if it's the final?

426
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:04,680
That's I, we could be the same bet. I don't know if it's a bonus. I, okay. So, so

427
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:10,040
how about it's like, you know, you, I give you a tip if it's the bonus. Sure. Sure. Okay. That's

428
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:15,480
fine. You can be a tip. Okay. Cause here's my logic. Here's my logic with this is they like to give

429
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:20,760
a big exciting announcement to the hometown crowd because those are Disneyland often. Like most of

430
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:25,000
them are Disney, like Disneyland people. Uh, there are people that travel, but generally speaking,

431
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:31,480
I think they like to send that crowd home happy. I don't know other than announcing the full

432
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:37,000
Disneyland forward or what they're doing or a third park or whatever that is. I don't know

433
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:43,720
what else they could do that feels big. Well, the answer is nothing that feels big. Right.

434
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:49,800
That's true. But if they've hyped it up Honda center coming other than a Zootopia or I guess

435
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:56,040
avatar in Hollywood land, I don't know what's on the table that would make the audience go nuts.

436
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:02,920
The only thing I can think of Disneyland wise is a new tomorrow land. Yeah. So I kind of feel like

437
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:09,320
that's the last announcement during the panel. I agree with you as excitement in a show. I just

438
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,840
don't think we've heard. I don't think we've gotten anything. And yeah, we've, you know,

439
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:17,560
we've been doing this show for seven years now wherever, like every three years, it's like,

440
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:22,680
I saw an Imagineer on the tomorrow on the people mover track. That's not anything. That's not

441
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:27,560
anything to me. I don't think we're getting it. Here's what I think. And this is maybe the

442
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:32,920
riskiest bet I'll make, but I'm going, I'm interested in making it. I think, and this is

443
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:38,600
unrelated to what I'll say about what I want my tomorrow and redo to be, but what I think

444
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:44,280
is going to happen is that we're going to get a tomorrow and redo space mountain stays the same.

445
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:49,640
Maybe there'll be some like overlay type thing on it or they'll like refresh it. They'll be,

446
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:55,880
they're going to replace Buzz Lightyear with something. Star tour stays. And I think

447
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:03,720
maybe new sort of people mover. Wow. That's like this year we're getting people. I think that's

448
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:11,080
the only thing they could do Disneyland wise right now that even seems possible to make people

449
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:16,520
excited because there's no forward is taking a long time. We ain't getting that for 10 years.

450
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:23,080
And I say, that's fine. Let's get it right. We're sure. Fine. But what else other than the Marvel,

451
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,720
the vendors ride, but I don't think that's going to be the show closer.

452
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:32,200
But remember there have been these shows where there is no closer, but they just sing a song

453
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:37,880
about wonder and then we're done. And I wouldn't put it past them to, I mean, it's going to be

454
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:42,920
more exciting than previous years. And by the way, I hope you're right. I really hope you're

455
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,840
right. Cause there's nothing I want more than a new tomorrow. And I'm cynical. I'm hardened. I

456
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:52,760
hear you. I don't believe it. But in two, in another decade, what is actually on the table

457
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:57,480
at Disneyland? It's the Avengers ride. It's whatever's going in Hollywood land, which I'm

458
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:02,360
still sure will take a while. And it's tomorrow. Land tomorrow. Land has, I think it has to get

459
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:08,600
done before Disneyland forward. So, and then what would be exciting to announce in tomorrow land,

460
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,960
unless they're completely gutting it, which they're not going to, cause that's very expensive.

461
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:17,400
There has to be some, when you announce new tomorrow land, there has to be something in there

462
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:23,320
that's new. Something has to be fun other than just like, Oh, we're painting it and whatever.

463
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:28,600
Buzz Lightyear is going to be a different IP or something now. So the only thing I can think of,

464
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:34,120
and I've, there's, I've heard little rumblings of this, but I don't nothing, nothing I'm sure of

465
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:41,560
like Indiana Jones. The only thing you could do is figure out some kind of people mover that you

466
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:47,160
could maybe rebuild around the land somewhere. And I know that's a risky bet. I think tomorrow

467
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,600
land for sure is final, but that's the only thing I can think of that you can do. I feel like there's

468
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:55,480
bets within this bet, because what I proposed was my it's $10 to me. If there's no mention of

469
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:01,240
tomorrow land whatsoever, you, uh, you get 10 with a tip. If it's the closer, do you, are you willing

470
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:07,800
to do something else about people mover? Yes. Okay. Uh, this is high risk, high risk, high

471
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,480
rewards. Well, you want to throw another five on it? I'll put a five on it, but you both owe me,

472
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:18,760
uh, a grand each if they announce a people mover, a grand. No, the five was for people mover.

473
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:25,960
All right. All right. Fine. Fine. Fine. I don't think it's that crazy. I just, this,

474
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:30,040
Mr. Gamble over here doesn't seem to want to actually, well, a thousand pennies.

475
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:37,880
Yeah. I have a risky bet. Do we agree on yours? Yeah. No, no, no. And does Jason want in on any

476
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:41,800
of what Mike is saying? Yeah. I do want to get in on this. What do you think? I would mean no

477
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:47,000
tomorrow. I agree with Scott. I know tomorrow. I think no tomorrow. That's insane. There's

478
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,120
there tomorrow. And we're in high risk. I don't believe it. Have you not been alive for these last

479
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:59,320
25 years? I know, but they, it has, something has to happen. It has to be, unless you know the confines

480
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:02,680
of corporate culture and spending. There's nothing else to talk about. And you're thinking about

481
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:10,200
structuring a show and sending the crowd home happy. And I agree with you. Yeah. But just hearing

482
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:16,520
like, oh, there was a bunch of stuff cut at the very last minute before last year's thing. I'm

483
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:21,720
just worried. I've just worried they're going to do it again this year. So I want to take the

484
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:26,760
risky bet. They can't do it. I mean, they can cut something, but they can't. So we're now splitting

485
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:31,160
unless we're going separate thing. No, I guess that doesn't make sense. Okay. So it's Jason and

486
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:37,640
you are, you're also doing the people mover on top of it. I'm going to say that's wait.

487
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:42,280
He's saying no tomorrow. I mentioned it all. I said no tomorrow in reference at all. And on top

488
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:47,160
of that, there's an extra five, not an extra thousand for people mover. So you'll take both

489
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:51,720
the bets is what you're saying. I will take both no bets. I will take the same bets as Scott. Great.

490
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:56,680
Wow. I, Jason, I feel bad for ourselves that we're at this point. I want to be a dreamer

491
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:03,320
like Mike is a dreamer, but I just, they've, you know, they've watered down my ability to dream.

492
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:10,680
I'm hoping he's right, but I like a long shot. You know? Sure. If Mike is right, the joy I will

493
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:16,200
feel handing the money over in case we don't do this in a way that is cash. This I will do with

494
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:20,680
cash and I'll do it with a smile on my face because your bet has led to something that'll

495
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:25,400
make me happy in this world. What do you think of the closer of the show is? Do you guys have

496
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:35,640
any ideas? Okay. I have my risky bet. Okay. Okay. My logic is they have to at least show some

497
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:42,840
resistance, something offering in Florida at Disney world to compete with Epic universe.

498
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:49,160
So I'm betting that they do give more concrete details about the villain's land. Okay. Well,

499
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:52,040
they haven't even announced that yet, but you're saying an announcement is coming.

500
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:58,040
Yeah. I think they're officially announcing it. I have that on my list, so I'm not going to take

501
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:02,680
that bet. I'll go against it. I don't think it feels right. What's it? What amount do you think?

502
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:11,400
Well, I got creative with this. Okay. If I am wrong, I will take you both to Baskin Robbins

503
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:20,680
and buy you each a single scoop, cup or cone, your choice. Can I have sprinkles on mine?

504
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:27,160
Sure. There should be some other, we'll deal with sprinkles in a second. That's a perfect

505
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:33,160
little micro bet. Okay. But the seriousness of this bet, I am not allowed to get anything.

506
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:38,040
Oh my God. You have to watch us eat ice cream? I have to watch you eat. I mean,

507
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:45,880
I'm allowed to get a bottle of water if I'm dehydrated. If I win, you two have to take

508
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:51,240
me to Baskin Robbins and get me a double scoop, cup or cone. I don't know what I'll prefer that

509
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:59,080
day. I am not a double scoop guy, so this is indulgent for me. Are we allowed to buy ourselves

510
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:05,800
something? Yeah, sure. Whatever. Sounds like it's fine. Yeah. I don't know. Isn't it better though

511
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:09,400
if we can't eat ice cream? It does seem more. You know what? I'm going to put that in there.

512
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:14,200
I think Jason has to- I get double scoop, you guys don't get anything. Yeah. I think this has

513
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:19,400
to be a no because the torture of watching somebody eat ice cream. All right. I'm in on this.

514
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:28,280
Let's deal with sprinkles. Can sprinkles or other topping be if they get location specific with a

515
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:34,520
villain's land? If they say we're going to do it, but no location, then that's just the regular bet.

516
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:40,600
But if they say it's going behind Big Thunder, if they say it's some weird, some entire other land,

517
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:47,480
yeah, you don't even have to commit to where, but if they give us a specific location, is that the

518
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:55,000
sprinkle on top? So location he gets a sprinkle, no location he doesn't. Yeah. Correct. Sure. Great.

519
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,960
Okay. Okay. Because this could work out very well for you that you get a double scoop with sprinkles.

520
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:07,080
Right. If they say. Because do we think that's a Big Thunder thing? Do we actually have-

521
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:11,800
That's what they teased last time, a couple of years ago. They teased it behind Big Thunder.

522
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,360
They said, well, we don't know what lies behind it. And then they were like teasing different

523
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:19,320
ideas. And they did tease the villains for that. So that is the logical place for it to go.

524
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:25,080
They tease some other movies. Well, do we want to go, do we want to do another Deadpool and we,

525
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:32,680
and we guess what's, what they say about beyond Big Thunder because I sort of like the sound of

526
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:39,560
Coco because that feels like a kind of realistic, like not so villain. I think villain

527
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:47,720
world is like too exciting. That's been a dream on the internet for so many decades. And it feels,

528
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:50,280
and while I do think they'll come up with something really great for Coco,

529
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:56,840
that just feels like more kind of realistic to me. So let's say, so if, if there's anything

530
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:01,480
about beyond Big Thunder, I will say that it's Coco. Jason, do you want to say that's villain?

531
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:06,600
Oh yeah. I would say it's villain. Mike, is there anything else? Well, there's the rumor that it's

532
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:12,760
like a not as themed radiator Springs over there too. Some people say no, but then some people were

533
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:16,920
speculating. Do you have any desire to go in on that? Not to feel strongly enough? Not really.

534
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:24,120
Make this a small one, make it a two. Okay. All right. Sure. All right. Let's do that.

535
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:29,880
But I think they're going to reveal something for beyond Big Thunder for sure. I think that's for

536
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:34,760
sure something, whether it's that it's Coco or villains or both. Okay. I think that's happening

537
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:39,080
because they, that was the end of their last presentation two years ago. So I feel like

538
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:43,320
that's another thing that's maybe farther along. I'll throw out one.

539
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:52,440
This, this, I mean, I'm going to do go in a really specific lane here, which is a, a tease that

540
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:59,800
inside out is coming to the parks in some way without committing to what that's going to be

541
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:04,920
so that they have, and you know, here, I'll get even more specific. Inside out is coming to Epcot

542
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:12,760
that way either, well, it could be that or this, if they don't say it, then that leaves it open to

543
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:19,000
be former wonders of life, to be some imagination. Like we're, we're friends with figment joy and

544
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:24,920
everybody all hangs, all hang out with figment because I think that move, the smash success of

545
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:30,360
inside out too, it feels like they want to just like foot in the door, declare, don't worry guys,

546
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:36,280
we're doing something about inside out. So, so that's my, that's my guess is inside out coming

547
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:42,200
to Epcot and they don't say any more. The bet is off if they say more that I'll call it a $5.

548
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:48,840
Anybody want to go in? I think they'll say more. Hmm. Interesting. They'll say more. Wow. Wow. I

549
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:52,040
don't know where that would go necessarily, but I think they'll say more. I will take you up on,

550
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:55,720
I think they'll say more. Okay. But I do think inside out has been something they've been looking

551
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:59,960
at for a while. And does Jason want to get in on a, they don't say inside out at all. Yes. Okay.

552
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:03,640
This is a good one. This is a very good one. I do. Anything where there's three opinions,

553
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:11,160
I think is a great area. I do because that inside out imagination has been rumor for years

554
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:17,560
and striking while the iron is hot. Well, that movie is like the second highest grossing animated

555
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:23,640
movie of all time. Yes. That absolutely makes sense. However, they went out of their way

556
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:33,960
recently to say the redo of Epcot is finished. Good point. And that was so specific and also so

557
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:39,480
weird. Why would you do that? After with, with no satisfaction. No satisfaction. Other than

558
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:46,600
guardians being a big hit. Yeah. And, and so I think with that and the fact that test track is

559
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:54,360
down and they're redoing that, I think Epcot, my feeling, Epcot is similar to galaxy's edge. Like

560
00:51:54,360 --> 00:52:01,160
you're not going to get much mention besides like, well, and it's done. Like, you know, check it out.

561
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:05,080
Yeah. Yeah. That does feel like, well, this is a good one. I think we're, yeah, we got a good

562
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:11,160
specific. I think they have calling it horizons. There has to be a big Epcot thing, whether it's,

563
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:15,080
and I haven't even thought through what I would, that bet would be, but like there has to be like,

564
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:20,440
redo a spaceship or this back on, or we're actually putting something where horizons was like,

565
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:25,160
well, you want to throw one out? Yeah, maybe you want to get a specific. It's a good question

566
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:28,840
because it's so confused. Like they, they're in such a tough spot with figment because figment

567
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:34,760
sells so much merchandise and they don't want to spend money on a new figment ride solely figment.

568
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:39,960
I could see them forcing figment on an inside out ride. Like he, I guess he makes sense with like

569
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:44,440
other emotions and stuff to some degree. And he's in the movie. It's an Easter. He's in the first

570
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:49,720
one. They could probably expand that ride track. Could they knock down the theater?

571
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,040
I don't think it's going to be the space your birth is back on the table though.

572
00:52:55,320 --> 00:53:00,680
Yeah. Are you, do you want to put money on something at Epcot that we've never even thought

573
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:07,720
about yet? Is that too vague? It's pretty vague. What about it? Do you want to quantify it as an

574
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:14,520
Epcot E ticket? Would you dare go that far? Or do you want to step that down? D ticket and above.

575
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:22,280
I'm trying to think how to turn this into a tangible item. I know it's new. When does the

576
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:29,000
new fireworks show at Epcot start? Mike, it's been open for months. Okay, great. Do people like it?

577
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:35,960
What is it? It's not harmonious, is it? Luminous Symphony of Us. Oh, you mean that one? Luminous.

578
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:41,560
What is it called? Luminous. And people like it? I never get it right. I think it's fine.

579
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:46,280
Okay, because people didn't like harmonious. I liked harmonious. Gene liked harmonious.

580
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:51,080
Yeah, but you're a freak. What are you talking about? They took down all the barges. That was

581
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:54,360
the big thing. He's a freak for other reasons. He's a freak for other reasons. I know, I know.

582
00:53:55,480 --> 00:54:00,920
He's a harmonious freak. Hey, look, freak like me needs company. She matched my freak, you know?

583
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:05,400
Joe Rohde on stage during an Animal Kingdom announcement.

584
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:11,080
Rohde back. What do you think? I agree with that too much. Okay. Jason, what do you think?

585
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:16,120
I think no. You say no. I say yes. Well, you guys do it. What do you want? A dollar? Five dollars?

586
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:21,640
Yeah, a dollar. All right, we're doing a dollar. It's kind of a dollar. Yeah, whatever. Yeah.

587
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:28,520
Not to, yeah, it's a hard one to be like, absolutely not. Never. Rock and Rollercoaster

588
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:35,080
replacement. Is that strongly rumored? They're going away. They've already lost the rights to

589
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:41,640
sell Aerosmith merch in the gift shop. That's news to me. I believe that's a couple months old already

590
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:45,880
and I think that right now they're just trying to figure out what is going to replace it. Well,

591
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:50,520
that's why Disney laid all those people off. They're not getting that Aerosmith merch money

592
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:58,280
in 2024. So I think it might be too soon, but I think within the next couple years it's happening.

593
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:03,960
I don't think they're saying it at this. Okay. I don't think so either. That ride was just down

594
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:11,880
for a number of months and apparently that was due to, I think it's a Vencoma coaster and there

595
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:19,000
is something in the contract where every 20, 25 years they do required maintenance and that likely

596
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,240
was why it was down for a few months. That is why it was down. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not saying they were

597
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:28,440
doing it. It wasn't due to wokeness. They weren't testing different. They're getting rid of our hero

598
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:34,920
who did absolutely nothing. They were not a good, upstanding man his whole life and in every decade

599
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:42,120
of the last six decades. They weren't testing different old men, rock and rollers on the ride,

600
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:46,920
I think. Bob Dylan was just- But they could have been. Yeah. He was up there, you know.

601
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:51,400
Oh my God. Bob Dylan Rock and Roller Coaster? Wow. That would be awesome.

602
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:56,360
Look, he was at the Hollywood Bowl last night. Yeah, that's right. If he was at the Hollywood

603
00:55:56,360 --> 00:56:00,200
Bowl, then surely they'll make a roller coaster after his music. He's just riding the roller

604
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:05,480
coaster. Maybe we're just spiffing it up for a few months. He went electric, so certainly.

605
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:12,840
You know how I feel about my fans. Same exact thing. I wonder if we all get in a stretch limousine.

606
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:19,160
That is of course too coherent of a way he would say that.

607
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:24,520
He would really, the real thing would be like they're in the recording studio. He's like sitting

608
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:30,600
in a chair, sternly looking at everybody and then like a handler would have to explain everything.

609
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:35,240
Oh, just some, all the exposition is in somebody's- Right. Ken Marino.

610
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:41,560
So you have Ken Marino the lion's like, oh well then your fans all have VIP wristbands,

611
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:45,080
but now it's a matter of getting them to the concert on time. Do you think that we should put

612
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:48,120
them in a super fast stretch limo to get them on the concert on time, Bob?

613
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:54,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. All right, you heard the man. So let's go, all right,

614
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:58,120
head into the next room and we're ready to rock and roll. Isn't that right, Bob?

615
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:06,920
I would love- I hope Bob Dylan is on the red carpet for the Timothy Chalamet biopic.

616
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:09,720
I bet he will be. And I hope he gets cornered by like,

617
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:15,560
hey, it's letterboxed. What are your top four movies? And he's like, I don't watch a lot of movies.

618
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:19,240
Mr. Dylan, do you agree that it's Brat Summer?

619
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:22,680
What? It's full now.

620
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:29,640
Mike, you've been talking about this. Oh wait, do we, do we get to a bit?

621
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,800
I'll say a dollar, that new rock and roller coaster.

622
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:32,920
That makes zero. I don't think we're getting it.

623
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:35,080
Zero, yeah. All right, I want 50 cents.

624
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:38,680
Those are little ones, yeah. You've been talking about this Walt

625
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:40,040
robot. You think we're getting it? Yes.

626
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,800
All right. I think that's coming.

627
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,760
You think we're getting it this year? You think we're getting it? We're a few days

628
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:49,560
away from a Walt robot. This ties into another bet I have.

629
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:54,120
I think yes, Walt robot. And how many times do we think Josh

630
00:57:54,120 --> 00:58:01,000
Tamaro says the phrase platinum celebration, if at all, for Disneyland's 70th anniversary?

631
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,080
Because the 70th anniversary is platinum. Right.

632
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:07,400
So in theory. Right.

633
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,720
Is this like Price is Right, like without going over?

634
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:14,440
Well, Willie, do you both agree he's going to say platinum celebration?

635
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:15,880
I do think so. Okay.

636
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:21,400
Do you think that platinum celebration, I believe platinum celebration will be said

637
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:29,480
10 times in the whole presentation. I'm going to go more realistic and say four.

638
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:32,920
Okay. Jason. I'm going to go in between and say eight.

639
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:37,160
Okay. Yeah. Okay.

640
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:37,960
How much is this one?

641
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,600
Two dollars. Two.

642
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:43,960
That sounds like a two. Okay.

643
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:48,040
Great. Okay. But then yes, Walt robot in Lincoln.

644
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:52,200
It's another thing where things have been filed. There's paperwork that suggests something's

645
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:57,400
in there. And chances are it's either Walt robot or Walt projection thing. I think robot.

646
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:00,440
I'll do low stakes. No, I don't think, I don't know.

647
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,120
You don't think robot, you don't think anything at all?

648
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:05,480
I think it might happen. I don't know if we're going to get it this week.

649
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:09,000
I think this is the 70th anniversary. This is the big, this is one of the big things.

650
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,480
Like I'll just do, I'll do a low stakes two again.

651
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:14,920
Okay. Two. Jason, what are you thinking? Different character than Walt.

652
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,400
No, I don't think different.

653
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,080
Hades from Hercules is going in.

654
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:25,960
I think it is going in. I think it's a robot. I think it's going in Lincoln.

655
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:28,200
No, it is going in Lincoln.

656
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:29,960
But do you think we're getting an announcement?

657
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:30,840
Yeah, that's what we're saying.

658
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:32,840
It's not going in Pirates of the Caribbean.

659
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:33,960
You think we're getting it?

660
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,080
So now I'm against both of you.

661
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:35,880
Yeah, you're against both of us.

662
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:38,440
Okay. Yeah. All right. Well, it gives me a buck.

663
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,600
I mean, you're talking about platinum celebration.

664
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:46,840
I could get down there and buy some of that 69 merchandise.

665
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:48,920
Oh yeah. They still got that. I got to go. We're going next.

666
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:53,800
To go back to a few minutes ago, that's why Jason's a freak.

667
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:54,760
Yeah, that's right.

668
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:55,240
Yeah. Yeah.

669
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:56,280
I am black now for all of July though.

670
00:59:56,280 --> 01:00:01,880
Every day is the 69th anniversary when it's, when you're head to toe in Disneyland's 69 merchandise.

671
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:04,040
Jason, sweatshirt, sweatpants.

672
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:11,080
XXL, XXL. I just, it looks like you're pushing a cot in a wheelchair.

673
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:14,680
Like it's, it's looked like you're pushing a twin bed.

674
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:17,960
They're like, is there a person in there? Is that just sheets?

675
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:21,080
Deadpool should wear that merch while he's doing his show.

676
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:23,560
Oh, Deadpool should totally wear that merch.

677
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:25,720
Oh, just over his suit.

678
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:30,760
Yeah, he should wear an oversized t-shirt and he should point at it and not make it easy.

679
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:35,880
Huh? Huh? And there's no joke. And then they move on to the show.

680
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,400
I do like, I like that. I like that.

681
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:41,720
This kind of goes against, we're already talking about, is there any galaxy's edge or anything?

682
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:45,720
Do you think there's any discussion of what we're going to do with the Galactic Star Cruiser?

683
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:46,280
No.

684
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:46,760
No.

685
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:52,200
No. I guess I don't feel enough like, but hey, how about, all right,

686
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:56,680
Buck that they say we're dreaming up new things for Galactic Star Cruiser.

687
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:58,280
I say no. I say no mention.

688
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:59,560
I say yes.

689
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:00,040
You say that.

690
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:01,320
So you're with Scott.

691
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:04,760
Yeah, I'll take a bet. I'll take a $1, a vague like-

692
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:08,360
But that goes against your previous Galaxy's Edge, no mention.

693
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:09,480
Right. You were contradicting yourself.

694
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:12,440
Galactic Star Cruiser is not Galaxy's Edge.

695
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:12,920
I disagree.

696
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:16,040
You think they're just going to mention Galactic Star Cruiser, not Galaxy's Edge?

697
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:20,600
It also would clearly be, maybe not clearly, I think it would be some kind of expansion of,

698
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:23,960
it'd be like a buy-on experience. I don't think there's a way you could say that

699
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:25,320
without saying Galaxy's Edge.

700
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:29,720
All right. I don't want to undo my earlier bet, so I won't take that bet.

701
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:33,560
Okay. So the bet has become no mention of Galactic Star Cruiser,

702
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,160
and I'm the only one going for yes?

703
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:39,000
I don't think that they'll ever say the words Galactic Star Cruiser.

704
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:43,160
If they were repurposing the building, I kind of feel like they would say,

705
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:46,040
we have a new whatever experience and it's this.

706
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,120
I don't know that they want to talk about the failed-

707
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:50,760
Because maybe it gets like a laugh at the-

708
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:57,720
Yeah. So if we can clearly tell that that's what it is, that's how we would,

709
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:59,240
like I'll still give it to you if they just,

710
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:01,480
if it's pretty clear they're repurposing the hotel for something.

711
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:02,760
Might have to be litigated more.

712
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,120
It'll have to be litigated more, but-

713
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:08,120
Okay. Well, then the stakes are low, so I'll say that one.

714
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:08,760
Right. I say no, I say nothing.

715
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:11,240
A new experience or something?

716
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:15,480
Right. But I'm saying like, it wouldn't be like, well, you know, we were so sad to see

717
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:18,920
the Galactic Star Cruiser close. They probably don't want to say that,

718
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:23,320
but maybe they say whatever. I don't know what they're going to do with that building.

719
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:28,920
I know they're thinking about stuff, but it's a tough spot to be in because they have,

720
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:34,040
it's a small place with hotel rooms and there's, I don't know, I'm not sure.

721
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:35,240
I think though, anyway-

722
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:37,640
Do you think that we, is there anything in the area of,

723
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:41,320
we just get more info about the test track thing that's already been said?

724
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:41,880
Yes.

725
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:43,000
Yeah. Do you agree?

726
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:43,720
I think so.

727
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:47,560
An amount of minutes, a concept, or what is the, is there a way to bet on this one?

728
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:51,240
Some sort of a auto executive coming on stage that we've never heard of.

729
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:56,280
That's good. And what is it? Is it Chevrolet? What is the, yeah.

730
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:57,480
Chevrolet, yeah.

731
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:00,680
Do we get a Chevrolet or maybe we all just agree on it?

732
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:05,400
If a Chevrolet executive comes out, then we all shake hands and smile.

733
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:06,040
That's fine. Yeah.

734
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:10,280
Okay. Actually, and that brings me to maybe some stuff about the show itself.

735
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:16,520
Okay. Well, here's one. I texted you guys this.

736
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:25,240
I think that in the last, say 15 minutes, a musical performance by a singer who is named,

737
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:31,960
who I have never heard of. And I have to be honest about what I've heard of and haven't.

738
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:36,280
But I think it's safe to say I won't have heard of them.

739
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:36,760
Okay.

740
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:40,840
Does anyone want to go against that? Or does it feel too accurate?

741
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:44,520
It does feel accurate. There's also the possibility that

742
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:47,960
Mack McAnally plays somewhere in here.

743
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,880
Or it could be somewhere else on the convention and the show as well.

744
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:55,960
Was there some bet then that's music prediction? But I think it's going to be at this.

745
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:57,000
I think it's going to be at this.

746
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,880
It's going to be on this thing. Well, there's play in the arena.

747
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:04,600
Is the bet you say Mack McAnally and I say singer I've never heard of?

748
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:05,640
Yes.

749
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:06,360
Okay.

750
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:13,160
Yeah. Because there's a chance, the rumors are that maybe a Pecos Bills in Disney World goes away

751
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:18,120
and we get a country bear themed restaurant there as well. Because we're getting more

752
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:25,000
country bears out here in the hungry bear space. And we got the country bear like statue in Grizzly

753
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:30,760
Peak. So there's also now rumor that maybe there's a barbecue jamboree coming to Pecos Bills.

754
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:31,400
Oh, interesting.

755
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:32,600
Interesting.

756
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:38,120
So perhaps there's more bear related stuff. I feel that feels like early in the presentation.

757
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:39,960
That's a little bit on the lighter side.

758
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:40,680
Yeah, yeah.

759
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:43,240
But that's the time where you would maybe want

760
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:51,240
to bring down the house with a music performer who everyone in the building knows Mack McAnally.

761
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:55,080
Right. Now, obviously maybe we'd be backing up the other singers from that, but

762
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:58,760
possibly. Oh, and that, well, that's confusing because some of them are singers I've never heard

763
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:00,360
of. Oh, that's true.

764
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:03,960
We get into a dicey area. Either way you want to make that like a two.

765
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:04,760
Yeah. Great.

766
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:12,360
Okay. Should I just be firm about the amount of minutes? What I wrote down is eight minutes

767
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:19,800
devoted to cruise ships. Am I so willing to say the exact amount? That just feels right to me.

768
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:23,720
You know what? Does anyone want to say a different amount of minutes?

769
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:28,120
How do we bet on amount of time devoted to cruise ships?

770
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:33,000
They talk about, I mean, the three of us don't have a ton of interest in those cruise ships,

771
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:37,640
even though people that go on it swear by them. So I, we're in the wrong potentially

772
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:39,320
for not being that excited about it.

773
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:42,680
I like watching videos and reading about them sometimes.

774
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:44,120
Okay, that's true, but you don't.

775
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:46,680
That's different than going for an entire week.

776
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:50,840
Yeah, exactly. Can I go a slightly higher and say 12?

777
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:53,480
Yeah, let's do it that way. Mike, anything different you want to do?

778
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:58,520
Well, they just did another round of announcements about like a Cruella de Vil lounge on one of

779
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:06,200
these cruises. And I don't know, like releasing that stuff right before D23 is interesting to me

780
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:10,440
because do they have more crew stuff or are they getting some of this crew stuff out of the way

781
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,360
so they don't have to highlight it on the show? Same thing with Country Bear

782
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:17,400
barbecue jamboree. I'm like, well, why didn't they save this for two weeks?

783
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:21,080
Unless it's so jam packed. So either they-

784
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:25,480
Yeah, don't you want to make an arena scream when you say there's a new bear barbecue coming?

785
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:33,640
Yeah, yes. So I think five minutes. I think there's less crew stuff to announce.

786
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:35,320
This is good. Closest to that going over?

787
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:35,820
Yeah.

788
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:39,480
All right. And let's, hey, let's, can I make that a five? Yeah.

789
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:39,980
Sure.

790
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:45,640
A bigger one. Okay. Yeah. So wait, five, eight, 12. Okay. Good.

791
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:50,840
New bride in Disneyland Haunted Mansion.

792
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:53,320
New bride. Is that something-

793
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:56,520
That's a rumor. That's not, I'm not making that up. That's what I've heard. I've heard it.

794
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:57,880
I think that might be a safe-

795
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:58,840
I'd like that.

796
01:06:58,840 --> 01:06:59,340
Bet.

797
01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:00,040
I don't like that bride.

798
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:04,760
That after Jack goes away, we'll have a new bride in the mansion because that's

799
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:10,520
sort of the most glaring weird effect left over from that. What is it at this point? 25 year old?

800
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:14,280
To that. Was it for the 50th anniversary?

801
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:18,200
Yeah, maybe. But a new bride, new thing up there.

802
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:19,560
I don't have a strong feeling.

803
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:25,560
That feels to me, that's sort of my hypothesis of where there's going to be a lot of little,

804
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:30,440
that is fun. That's cool for Disneyland heads. Oh, cool. New bride. There's going to be new

805
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:34,680
bride here. There's going to be this. Characters. Again, it's not a new big ride at Disneyland,

806
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:39,960
but it feels like, oh, cool. You're adding to the lore. You're sprucing up the legendary ride.

807
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:43,560
They've done a lot of sprucing up of the queue. There was a new-

808
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:47,640
They've been doing a lot of work in there. That's also part of what people are saying.

809
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:52,840
The gift shop, the leotards on the way out, and then people are saying there's going to

810
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:58,360
be some new stuff in the mansion, and the biggest rumor is bride, is new bride.

811
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:02,120
I have no strong feelings about this. I don't have strong feelings either.

812
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:04,600
It sounds like that's, we're all on board with that.

813
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:10,120
Pass, yeah, whatever, fine. I mean, I'm almost out of big stuff, really.

814
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:17,720
I can't tell how to deal with this. Another in that, how much do we do it, is Cotino.

815
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:19,560
Oh, I know. Story Living by Disney.

816
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:28,280
In terms of bland people on stage, let me just throw that in. Neither big nor small. Just a middle

817
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:35,880
three. I get $3 if somebody from Shea Holmes or Davidson Communities, the company's building

818
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:40,680
Cotino, is on stage. I think no Cotino.

819
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:45,240
I would like there to be no Cotino. I think no Cotino.

820
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:53,160
Yeah, yeah. Yes, I could easily see it, but again, it feels like, again, they would normally pad out

821
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:58,120
presentations with barbecue jamboree. In the past, that feels like they were like,

822
01:08:58,120 --> 01:09:03,720
oh, thank God we can burn four minutes, three minutes on this chunk. We show some art of a

823
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:09,480
new painting of Big Al, and we say we're playing old music, and these dopes will cheer for anything,

824
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:12,200
these little piggies. These rubes.

825
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:18,360
And feed at the trough. But they announced it early. There's just stuff they've been announcing

826
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:22,040
beforehand, so I think they have a lot. If they really are going to burn a bunch of stuff off on

827
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:27,320
Cotino, I think it's silly. But I think presentations is where now you have to,

828
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:31,320
this is something that's been agreed to in a boring room, and they don't realize how boring

829
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:34,120
that's going to play on stage. It's part of the deal.

830
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:37,400
It could be a contractual thing, you're right.

831
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:42,040
I get the logic of it, but I say no Cotino. No story living by Disney.

832
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:47,720
What if there is Cotino, but not someone from Shea Holmes or Davidson communities on stage?

833
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:56,520
I'll take that. If he goes no, and you go someone, and I say no someone.

834
01:09:56,520 --> 01:10:01,160
Okay, that's great, that's great. No Cotino, no someone, and I get, okay.

835
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:04,520
Now here's the one, I don't want to put any, this is like one of the thousand to ones I was

836
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:09,960
talking about. Let's call it a thousand. I'm only putting in one dollar on this, but I get

837
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:16,760
a thousand dollars if not only is there Cotino, but also the big finale, the what are we going

838
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:22,920
to give to these people on the way out the door, is a special musical performance devoted to Cotino.

839
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:29,160
And if that then is not a singer we haven't heard of, but a singer we have heard of

840
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:37,080
doing a song of the summer customized, if Sabrina Carpenter is paid to do a D23 original parody

841
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:41,320
called Cotino. That's that me Cotino.

842
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,000
Well if you'd like to hear. Oh please yeah.

843
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:49,480
Oh great, excuse me for jumping ahead. I think I did some of this as a Twitter joke,

844
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:56,520
but here's, here now is the full thing. Say you can sleep, baby I know, such a relaxing condo.

845
01:10:57,080 --> 01:11:04,120
Single family, beautiful homes, that's that me Cotino. Mid-century oasis, oh we're gonna

846
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:09,960
buy land in Rancho. Story living, built by Shay Holmes, that's that me Cotino.

847
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:16,120
If it happens in the middle of the show you don't get the money though.

848
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:20,040
Yeah if exactly that happens and they got the idea from this,

849
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:26,520
yeah no then I get nothing. I say please please please don't prove them right like our other hit

850
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:35,480
song. I'll take that, I will give you a thousand dollars if that happens. Rancho Mirage got me

851
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:40,440
talking. What if three out of four, like what if she's there singing but it's not that song,

852
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:45,720
but it is about Cotino and then it's the second to last thing. Oh boy then it's, I don't know.

853
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:49,560
You don't get the money but it would be pretty wild. Yeah yeah just give me something, I don't

854
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:53,320
know is that worth an ice cream scoop? Might be worth an ice cream scoop. At least an ice cream

855
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:57,000
if we're gonna be going anyway. Yeah. I like that a trip to Baskin Robbins is in our future.

856
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:01,160
Is actually inevitable. That's the kind of thing we should do more after the show or before the

857
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:06,040
show or on a day where we aren't doing the show, it's just the boys go to Baskin Robbins. That's

858
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:12,920
really the biggest victory that comes from this. I have an idea for, what if let's just, hey screw

859
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:21,400
it. I'm proposing this is a $20 if you guys are in and this is pretty random I think. This is just,

860
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:26,440
I don't know, this just go with your instinct but this is kind of like a big pool that requires us

861
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:32,120
to play, I'm sorry to pay extra attention to the show because now we're gonna have to do a count

862
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:41,880
and the count is this. We all have to choose a Disney word and we have to count how many times

863
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:50,200
it is said during the show and whatever word is said the most. Oh. The winner gets $20 for that.

864
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:53,480
This could be the big, and you know I think listeners should go in on this too if there's

865
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:57,960
somebody you listen to the show with. This seems like a fun one for everybody to go in on. Yeah.

866
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:02,120
You know just in your own private, we can't really do a bet with all of the audience.

867
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:09,800
But the, let me just, just a spark idea. Spark is one you could choose. Yeah that is good.

868
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:17,640
But I would say that the big contenders here are Wish, Dream, Magic, Adventure. That's probably

869
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:24,520
not all of them. I Wonder could be in there. Yeah. I'd say, the trouble is if one of them is like

870
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:29,800
the name of it, they refer to the ship. Yeah. And then, but you know that's the risk you take

871
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:35,720
because a lot of them are ship names. I could see my way around Adventure but, oh wait,

872
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:39,720
sorry that was in the list. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Then Adventure. But I think those are the

873
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:44,280
ones to beat. Let's say, all right, Wish, Dream, Magic, Adventure, Wonder, and I'll let you guys

874
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:53,400
pick first. Can I go Dream? And it has to be one of those? No. Can I pick Imagination? Oh damn. Oh

875
01:13:53,400 --> 01:14:01,320
damn. This guy's coming in with Imagination. Oh shit. All right. Yeah. Good thinking. Mike gets

876
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:09,400
Imagination. So do I go Magic? Yeah. I'll go Magic. Yeah. I mean, that's it. Yeah. That's good.

877
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:13,560
And if we're, boy, we might be hearing a lot of Wish and then going like shit. Yeah. Really?

878
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:20,520
Well, we screwed this. Well, that movie is still such a big part of the zeitgeist, you know. That's

879
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:26,840
true. We're all talking about it every day. Yes. How is Wish coming to the party? Well, is that

880
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:32,520
going to go out on? That feels like a lot there. I think so. Yeah. You know what? Listeners,

881
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:36,840
do it yourselves if there's an area that we missed. If you hear this and you have one to suggest to

882
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:42,760
us and we feel passionate about it, enough to put it in our list. But otherwise, we're going to have

883
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:47,000
to do some spreadsheets and figure out what the hell we just said and get specific about it

884
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:53,080
so that we can hopefully have the results when we do this, you know, pulled together as fast as we

885
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:57,640
can episode the next day, Sunday. Yeah. There's other stuff. I mean, we're done with betting,

886
01:14:57,640 --> 01:15:03,480
I suppose, but like there's big stuff like Lion King Land and the Paris parks. There's all these

887
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:09,000
other rumors and stuff. I do have a question though. What do you think will be the biggest

888
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:13,880
announcements, I guess, probably ticket wise for Disneyland and Disney World?

889
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:20,680
Coming out of the show where you go, holy shit. I mean, if I'm saying people mover, that's what I

890
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:26,440
think for Disneyland. But what like what do you think actually will be? Oh my God, that's crazy.

891
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:31,480
I guess Villains Land in Florida, if that's what you think. I do. I think my Disneyland answer is

892
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:37,960
a cop out. And that's an exact date for the Tiana version. You think that's the biggest

893
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:43,080
announcement? Yeah, I know. God, that's so depressing. That's the most depressing thing

894
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:49,880
I've ever heard. I don't want it to be the case. But no, that's a ride that's opening in a month.

895
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:56,120
Yeah, I know. But they haven't given the day yet. But that this is this is the grim. I

896
01:15:56,120 --> 01:16:00,680
I understand. I don't quite but I understand the grim thinking that brought them to it.

897
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:05,400
I'm not happy. But if they announce Walt Robot, that's bigger than the opening day for a ride

898
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:09,880
that we've already seen. You think Walt Robot is an e-ticket? Well, I'm just saying it's more

899
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:16,120
exciting than a date of those. It is more exciting. I said e-ticket or a big announcement type thing.

900
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:21,480
Are you talking like what is our personal? What do you think just predicting wise coming out,

901
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:26,440
you go, well, the most excited thing I am for Disneyland is this. For me, it's Avatar. It's

902
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:32,040
Pandora here. If we get anything more on that, I'm happy. Excited for, I think it's definitely

903
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:39,560
whatever the Avatar quote unquote experience is. Yeah. And mine is just if Deadpool hits

904
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:43,720
Josh Demar on the butt or something with his hand. I'm telling you, Deadpool should be like

905
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:49,240
Swedish chef in Muppet Vision 3D. I agree with you. He should appear in a different part of the

906
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:57,320
arena. He should sabotage stuff. He should start opening fire at the stage. He does not have,

907
01:16:57,320 --> 01:17:01,000
he has Chimichung where his holsters are in Disneyland. That's funny. He does not have his

908
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:05,960
guns. I know in Paris he has baguettes and that's pretty clever. Pretty good, yeah. Well, yeah,

909
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:12,520
I like your Muppet Vision suggestion where like Josh is talking and then his spotlight moves and

910
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:16,600
he's got to go over here and then like back over here, whoop. And then like, sorry guys, we're

911
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:20,520
having a little bit of trouble. Maybe it has something to do with our lighting director,

912
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:25,240
Deadpool. Deadpool. And then you get, and then you have a shot way up in the rafters.

913
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:29,800
It's, that's a thing in professional wrestling too. When the wrestlers come through the crowd,

914
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:34,600
I feel like everyone loses it. Everyone gets excited. And then unfortunately, I just don't,

915
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:38,680
I haven't watched some of the films like you, Jason, so I don't know the character enough. So

916
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:43,000
I'm just spit balling here that it would be like, Josh, sorry, I didn't really have eyes on the

917
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:48,840
spotlight. I was busy masturbating. Does that seem like something Deadpool would say? Deadpool

918
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:55,400
actually is occasionally more subtle than you think. Deadpool, don't come on the crowd. Deadpool,

919
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:59,560
I know you're way up in the rafters, but these people paid money to be here. Don't come in their

920
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:05,640
popcorn. You know, what would be great is if they brought Wolverine, the costume Wolverine out on

921
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:12,120
the stage, took off the mask and it's Jackman. They just stole the bit from Comic-Con. Yeah,

922
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:15,880
they could do that. I'm not sure. And he just says, thank you for seeing the movie and leaves.

923
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:21,560
During the parks panel? Yeah, sure. Yeah. Why not? And then Deadpool shoots in his face.

924
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:29,640
And then Deadpool comes. Even Deadpool, they do the wraparound arms and eat the chimichangas.

925
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:34,600
Okay. Well, that'd be very romantic. So wait, it's not Ryan Reynolds. It's the Disneyland

926
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:41,240
Deadpool with real Jackman who just says, thank you for coming to the movie and then he leaves.

927
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:45,320
Well, I think it's the more unexpected choice. You would think it would be Ryan Reynolds.

928
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:50,360
Or maybe it's both. Maybe it's both. It could be both. What if it's all about this?

929
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:54,520
Deadpool's up on stage. He's doing his normal antics. He pulls the mask off. It's Bob Iger.

930
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:00,680
And then he comes. Oh, okay.

931
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:06,600
Okay. That would be unexpected. And he could also say thank you for seeing the movie because

932
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:11,000
he made a lot of money off of it. Yeah. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to come on all of you.

933
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:16,120

937
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:33,880
said anything close to what we're suggesting, even in the low budget version. I hope that we're

938
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:40,840
wrong. And then Sunday after Parks Panel or whatever their name for it is. Yeah. Post-Horizon

939
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:45,560
Sunday. We're going to nurse a post-Horizon hangover, get an episode out as soon as we can,

940
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:52,120
and tally up whoever made or didn't make money from everything you just heard. Very exciting.

941
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:59,960
Wow.
