1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,980
Warning the following podcast contains lurid details of a kitschy California sex hotel,

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,740
a fictional scenario where a disgusting businessman is the president of the United States,

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:15,220
a mouth-watering discussion of a crazy scientist's chicken restaurant, and a time-spanning

4
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:19,640
conversation about the Universal Studios attraction Back to the Future The Ride.

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,440
Great Scott! It's Podcast The Ride.

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:48,200
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the podcast that's an 8.3 on the Richter scale,

7
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:55,700
but a 10 on the scale of fun. That's a line from a Universal Studios brochure that I brought

8
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:02,480
to talk about our topic today, but I think it's accurate. That's about earthquake, the big one,

9
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,800
but I think it applies to our podcast as well. Maybe not so much the Richter part.

10
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,900
Yeah, a lot of people say our podcast is like an earthquake, a horrible natural disaster.

11
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,480
I was gonna say it's...

12
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,860
It feels a lot longer than it actually is.

13
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:20,540
It's like a 10 because we're all dimes, right? We're all 10, right boys?

14
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,960
You and this like slang...

15
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,000
Look, I'm just trying to stay youthful, you know?

16
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,040
Yeah, wait, yeah, thirsty. Thirsty is new slang that I don't know.

17
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,520
And then dime you're throwing at old timey slang.

18
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,460
Like someone's a 10.

19
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,120
You use like snack, you say snack a lot I noticed.

20
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,260
I'll say snack every now and then.

21
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,500
Which is a thing where like it's an attractive man or woman, is that correct?

22
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,500
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, you look like snack.

23
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,140
We should probably introduce ourselves.

24
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:51,200
Yeah, well you could get your Mac on in any era. Get your snack on or your Mac on.

25
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,500
And the guy I'm talking about is Jason Sheridan.

26
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:58,500
And the guy who disagrees and objects to some of this is Mike Carlson.

27
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,720
Hello, and I'm upset.

28
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,960
Now Mike, you and I were actually, we were at a very romantic spot over the weekend.

29
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:06,720
That's true.

30
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,820
Separately, we were attending a wedding at the Madonna Inn.

31
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:12,580
That's correct, up in San Luis Obispo.

32
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:16,160
San Luis Obispo, about three, four hours north of Los Angeles.

33
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:22,560
If you aren't in California and haven't driven along the five to discover it, it's one of the,

34
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:27,980
it's as a lot of things in our culture are, mainly known as the basis of a Simpsons joke.

35
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:33,540
The Simpsons Hotel, that's where there's like a caveman room and then ultimately the utility room.

36
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,020
So it's this themed room hotel.

37
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,760
It was a very grand campus and very Disneyland-ish.

38
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,080
A couple people came up and was like, this seems like it's right up your alley, right?

39
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,340
And I was like, yeah, yeah, kitschy old bullshit.

40
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,440
Like, yes, of course.

41
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:54,600
And theming and we were in the showboat room, which since I was not paying like a ton of money,

42
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,660
was not that elaborate.

43
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:01,740
It just kind of had pictures of like our posters from the movie showboat or the musical.

44
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:09,440
And then there were a couple like very Neverland Ranch style, like cherub statues in the room.

45
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,640
And like a lighting fixture of like a little angel boy holding like a candle or something.

46
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,320
Cherubs everywhere at this place.

47
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,720
It's themes all over the map.

48
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:25,180
There's like kind of Danish stuff, storybook stuff, but also, yeah, Roman, Grecian columns

49
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,600
and little romantic babies.

50
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,860
There are tons of romantic babies everywhere.

51
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,980
Like the Love Is Babies from that comic strip.

52
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,960
Sure, yeah.

53
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,740
You know what I'm talking about?

54
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,600
The naked babies.

55
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,760
Which is another Simpsons joke.

56
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,240
Which is another Simpsons joke.

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,520
Side note, we were talking a couple episodes ago about Toon Lagoon.

58
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:50,480
Do the Love Is Babies from here or angels?

59
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,520
They're not in there?

60
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,840
I don't think the Love Is.

61
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,220
They are not part of like that particular syndicate.

62
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,440
What is the name of the it's like Kings, no, Kings World is what?

63
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:01,700
King Features.

64
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:04,980
Syndicate signature.

65
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:06,800
That's wrong.

66
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,420
But yeah, wherever all the comics come from in Universal's Toon Lagoon, the Love Is Babies

67
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,320
don't factor in.

68
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:12,760
That sucks.

69
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,420
Love Is, they're in weird magazines though.

70
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,020
They're not always in straight up, I feel like they're not in the main comic section.

71
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,360
So they're in the Penny Saver.

72
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,620
When I grew up though.

73
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,180
Or like the Enquirers.

74
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,060
Things like that too.

75
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:29,480
I believe the Sun Times, the Chicago Sun Times had Love Is at the very least, if not both

76
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,480
Tribune and Sun Times.

77
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,820
But was it with the other comics or was it in like the game?

78
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,880
Yes, it was with the other comics.

79
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,820
It was not in its own featured Love Is page or in a weird like sandwich.

80
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,140
So this is yeah, we got to look this up.

81
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,580
Listeners, let us know where your love is.

82
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,500
Are the Lockharts or Andy Cap?

83
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,460
All right, we can't get into this now.

84
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:48,960
Toon Lagoon.

85
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,980
We can't.

86
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,380
You're langing it up right now.

87
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,060
Andy Cap is I think, but I don't know about the Lockharts.

88
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,420
I think they're in there too somewhere.

89
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,520
But anyway, Madonna Inn is great.

90
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,760
What was your theme Scott?

91
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:06,440
I was in the cabin still room, which was like an old moonshine distillery kind of place

92
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:14,120
where the like the sink mechanisms in the shower were all a bunch of crazy Curly Q doodads

93
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,320
like you were making moonshine in a tub.

94
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,140
Wow, that's great.

95
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,320
With a pull chain toilet, which I think I talked about in the last episode being a feature

96
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,980
of Club 33 at Disneyland.

97
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,340
Yeah, I was very delighted to do a pull chain toilet.

98
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,400
Although the pull chain toilet didn't work.

99
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:34,580
There are a couple of floaters left around not to reveal too much information about myself

100
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,460
on the podcast, but pull chains.

101
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,340
I can see why they replaced pull chain toilets.

102
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,720
That's good news that I was not in that room because at 9 a.m.

103
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,420
Sunday morning I threw up.

104
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,820
Ah, I was like I lost track of you.

105
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,260
I was wondering what if you took a health dive?

106
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,520
No, I didn't.

107
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,440
It was 9 a.m.

108
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,620
So it wasn't even a health dive.

109
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:57,520
It was just that there were it's got weird like curfew rules at this place like at 12

110
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:57,920
a.m.

111
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,420
It's like no one can be in another room like you unless you're supposed to be in your own

112
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,660
room, but then like other suites.

113
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,620
It's like a choir trip or something.

114
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,920
Yeah, even if you're trying to smash.

115
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,460
Smash is another young person's term.

116
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,380
Good work, Jason.

117
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,340
Good work.

118
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,600
Jason was not at the wedding.

119
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,340
I'm not at the wedding.

120
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,900
What's known as in the casino industry as a cooler is bad luck.

121
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,900
It's the casino industry.

122
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,060
Yeah, casino industry.

123
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,200
Yeah, there's a William H. Mason.

124
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,400
There's a movie where William H. Mason is a cooler.

125
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:34,000
So if you were around when the garter belt was tossed to see which next eligible man

126
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,280
would get married, it would freeze in midair and shatter as if the as if the garter had

127
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,420
been shot by Mr. Freeze's freeze ray.

128
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,420
Yes, that's right.

129
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:42,840
Wow.

130
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,900
Cooler in multiple versions.

131
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:49,300
That's a lot of harsh thing to put on you, but you might not.

132
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,560
Look, that's my life.

133
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,620
You don't have your your cooling abilities are not such that they're magic.

134
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,180
No, here's another young person term that this intro for this episode is wild.

135
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,260
All over the map.

136
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,540
We're all over the place.

137
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,880
Well, when you've been to a magical pastoral land, like the Madonna Inn changes, you want

138
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,720
to talk about it?

139
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:11,980
Yeah.

140
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:17,620
I hope it didn't change me in terms of higher venereal content in my body.

141
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,940
But there's a shady place.

142
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:25,180
You get the sense if you ran a black light over the rock walls and in some of these rooms

143
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,820
that you might find a couple of spots.

144
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:32,960
There's a weird mix of puritanicalness to it because of like the 12 a.m. curfew.

145
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,740
And I went to a gift.

146
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:39,400
I went to the gift shop and was looking around and really expected it to be just like lube

147
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,060
city, like different sex things in there.

148
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,320
But there was none of that.

149
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,880
There was like a very, very small amount of any.

150
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,860
It was just like Trojan condoms.

151
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,960
It's a tiny little thing toward the corner.

152
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:54,300
So like I expected that Madonna and yes, was like a sex haven, which it has to be.

153
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:58,900
But they weren't sort of advertising that and they weren't promoting it in these like

154
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,000
very like romantic looking gift shops.

155
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,040
So but wait, the Madonna now I've never been there.

156
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,760
It's kind of in the middle of like nowhere.

157
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,220
Right.

158
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,920
Like it's not in the middle of there's not city streets.

159
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,760
There's not like a lot of pedestrian traffic.

160
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:14,320
No, not quite.

161
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,740
The late night McDonald's runs that were done at this wedding were, I think, kind of a slow

162
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,240
struggle.

163
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,700
They took a while.

164
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,660
A lot of up townships.

165
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,760
Because that's what I associate like hotel, like all guests must be registered or whatever.

166
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:32,200
I associate that more with where like lots of people walking around or passing through

167
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,040
public lobbies sort of thing.

168
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:38,000
Just drifters and mountain lions, I think is what they have to worry about.

169
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:38,800
Maybe that's what it is.

170
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,980
Maybe there's a lot of mountain lions in disguise.

171
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,940
They're concerned about guests getting bald.

172
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,680
Knowing that with all the theming going on, reality is already askew.

173
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:48,440
Well, that's true.

174
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,780
If you have a mountain lion barged in, you would get to bat an eye.

175
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,280
Yeah, it's a fun place.

176
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:58,760
But did you, we were popping around to a couple of the other, I got to see a couple of the

177
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,380
other theme rooms.

178
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:06,160
Did you find any of it like romantic or sensual to any degree?

179
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,840
What does that mean though?

180
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,680
What theme would be a turn on?

181
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,800
To me, yeah.

182
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,980
What do I find sensual or romantic?

183
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:19,700
I'm not saying I don't, but I'm so, I don't know, closed off.

184
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:21,780
Like I don't even know.

185
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:26,840
Yeah, it's like I'm not going to find a heart shaped bed with satin red sheets like, oh

186
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,380
baby, here we go.

187
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,900
I don't know if it's like that's too on the nose.

188
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:38,440
I think only like an 18 year old getting married in Kansas, like the most virginal person,

189
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,360
that would be their sexual fantasy.

190
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:40,940
Yeah.

191
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,500
Yeah, the heart shaped bed and satin.

192
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,120
Rotating bed.

193
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:51,000
There was a time where I assumed that my first time having sex would involve like flapping

194
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,820
curtains and breeze.

195
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,440
I think I did picture like the romance, the Harlequin novel.

196
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:02,880
Well, you did grow up in Southern California and the Santa Ana winds are a regular occurrence.

197
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,560
I got really congested in my first time.

198
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,260
Natural phenomenon that happens out here in Southern California.

199
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,440
A lot of dust in the nostrils.

200
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,780
Yeah, there was a place, I don't remember the name of it, but it would be on local TV

201
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,220
when I was growing up in Chicago, the Chicago area.

202
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,700
And it was not hiding the fact that it was just like, come here to fuck.

203
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,500
Like that's it.

204
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,960
There's hot tubs in the room.

205
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,480
There was just, you know, people getting paid probably no money to be in this ad.

206
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,620
And it was on for years.

207
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,520
That's my commercial actor talking.

208
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,440
I knew that they just got like some shitty buyout and get a sag scale, right?

209
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,600
But my mom used to go, yeah.

210
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,040
My mom used to be like, oh, it's like she would make a noise when the commercial would come on,

211
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,740
but never explain it to me.

212
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,480
I got a lot of that telling people I was going to the Madonna and a little,

213
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,260
people discussed, although I found it to be a blast.

214
00:10:51,460 --> 00:11:00,780
I feel in good health in the men's bathroom, a waterfall urinal that I felt like the male

215
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:04,680
spa experience to be peeing straight into a waterfall.

216
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,300
Oh wait, you're talking about the one downstairs?

217
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:06,740
Yes.

218
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,040
Yeah.

219
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,460
All right.

220
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:11,500
So this was hyped to me that there's a waterfall urinal downstairs.

221
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,300
And I had first went, that's weird, but okay.

222
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,300
That sounds cool.

223
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:21,080
But when I went in there, it seemed more like you were going into a weird, like high school shower

224
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:26,080
and that like the waterfall, which I imagined some like very immaculate,

225
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:32,480
like flowing water constantly was just like sort of a thin layer of water that would drip down

226
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,740
once in a while to just wash away some drunk people's urine.

227
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:42,100
Like if someone had a tiny waterfall attached to a koi pond they didn't take good care of?

228
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,480
An empty koi pond.

229
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:49,700
The amount of water in the LA river, that kind of an empty storm dream.

230
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,320
Yeah, that was a little bit of a letdown.

231
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:52,740
I don't know.

232
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:56,820
I think I just, look, as a lifelong Disney fan, I love fake rocks.

233
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,140
Yeah, that's true.

234
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,840
There was a little streaming down them and I thought they did a good job.

235
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,760
But yes, it is true.

236
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:07,900
It required some very active working of the sensor to get the little bit of waterfall drip drop on.

237
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,200
And yeah, it was kind of a creepy little drain down there.

238
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,420
And like you could see the drains and the drains really just looked like

239
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:19,640
like a shower from like an YMCA or something like it, just like a floor that you don't put

240
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,580
your bare feet on it.

241
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:20,800
Yeah.

242
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,860
But a lot of women came in.

243
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,320
So I think a lot of women were very curious to see that.

244
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,160
People kept talking about like, oh, the women always want to see the urinal.

245
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,900
And then I was waiting outside to go, or I was trying to get in and the two women were like,

246
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,540
would you mind if we walk, go in there with you?

247
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,640
And I was like, oh, I guess that's okay.

248
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,620
They're like, well, there's like an old man in there right now.

249
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,080
We don't want to like barge in on him.

250
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,520
But I was like, okay.

251
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,640
So like I walked in there like looking and like they were disappointed and then they left.

252
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,560
What an experience.

253
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,160
Yeah.

254
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,940
I actually didn't pee in the waterfall.

255
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,640
I went to the stall.

256
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,460
I couldn't do it.

257
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:51,980
Oh, really?

258
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,500
Yeah.

259
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,280
Though I did it loud and proud.

260
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:54,560
It was a blast.

261
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,260
Well, that's fine.

262
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,620
I mean, I've peed in the famous Chicago Wrigley Field troughs.

263
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,400
Ah, yeah, yeah.

264
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:00,900
That's pretty.

265
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,460
You got no division in a baseball stadium.

266
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,880
Which was similar to this situation.

267
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,240
So you have to be, you have to be happy with what you're pulling out.

268
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,480
Anybody's got a view.

269
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,600
I guess I'm not happy with what I'm pulling out.

270
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,220
Again, I'll say this intro this week is wild.

271
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:22,220
Well, it is loosely tied because I think you really can see.

272
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,800
And what the fun thing about living in California is that I do think there's so many different

273
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,060
places that clearly kind of captured the spirit of when Disneyland started.

274
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,500
So I'm tying it back here.

275
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:35,480
So like, you know, there's a place called the Tamo Shanter in Los Feliz.

276
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:40,600
And then there's like, like I used to live right over where the animators build, like

277
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,680
the animators used to live in the old Walt Disney Studios was and their little cottage

278
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,080
houses.

279
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:49,420
So you get to see a lot of this fun stuff that was like the design aesthetic of the

280
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:53,040
time and that obviously inspired with Disneyland and Walt Disney.

281
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,900
So that is a kind of a roadside attraction.

282
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,020
Yes, like the Madonna.

283
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,380
It was the family was called the Madonna family.

284
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,080
It was the last name and clearly they realized if we're going to attract people to our hotel,

285
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,040
there's got to be some novelty to it.

286
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,360
There's got to be some theming.

287
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:12,200
It's sort of a similar landmark to the Cabazon dinosaurs, which are on the way to Palm Springs.

288
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:17,240
Yes, like kind of big kooky 60s dinosaurs that are in Huey's Big Adventure.

289
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:24,160
There's also the theme park website, Yesterland has a site as a part of the site devoted to

290
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,080
other lands in the Orange County area.

291
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:32,260
When Disneyland opened, then everything had to be called land from the, you know, there

292
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:39,180
was like a religious, you know, concert venue called Melodyland or even just like a taco

293
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:39,520
stand.

294
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,500
It'd be called Taco Land.

295
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,460
Everything was land around that time.

296
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:47,920
Shout out to Yesterland, a website I have killed an obscene amount of hours on.

297
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,460
Reading about extinct attractions.

298
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,240
No kidding.

299
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,560
And long gone stuff.

300
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:56,020
Yeah, and they're much more researched than we are.

301
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:56,520
Oh, yeah.

302
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,020
Much tighter.

303
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:57,500
They don't.

304
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,420
You can read those articles.

305
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,640
They have a real minutes.

306
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,020
They don't talk about pissing or throwing up.

307
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,900
You don't know the guy who runs Yesterland, what he did over the weekend.

308
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:07,580
They don't.

309
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:14,260
There's no 32 year old man trying to just stay a little youthful by using snack or thirsty.

310
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,200
Yesterland does not.

311
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,680
Werner Weiss, the founder of Yesterland.

312
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,940
I don't know anything about the man.

313
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,240
He doesn't put his personal shit on the website.

314
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:23,800
No.

315
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,560
But you know what?

316
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,000
That's what we bring to the table.

317
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,280
We put a little bit of ourselves into what we talk about.

318
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,840
And I think you'd all give us a round of applause.

319
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,740
Give us a round of applause.

320
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,340
Give us applause.

321
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,280
We are asking for applause.

322
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,920
Whether you're alone or with people.

323
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,320
Take a video of yourself applauding us.

324
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,940
Upload it and we'll...

325
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,620
Tweet it at us.

326
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,320
Yeah, tweet it at us.

327
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,500
All right, well, let's get into the main topic for today, which is Back to the Future, the

328
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:57,680
ride, which in my estimation has to be one of the finest rides of all time.

329
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,040
Yeah, I mean, it's one of the greats.

330
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:08,800
I might have a controversial opinion about it at the end, but I won't say it now, I guess.

331
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,080
I think I would...

332
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,240
A cliffhanger like at the end of Back to the Future 2.

333
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,840
A tease of part three.

334
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,800
This to me is one of the rides I would call a classic.

335
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:18,460
Yes.

336
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:23,640
If we were going to start compiling, at some point I'm sure we will, through some complicated

337
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,580
tournament mechanism or...

338
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:31,000
We'll make it as difficult as possible to determine the top 10 rides of all time.

339
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:31,620
But I might...

340
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,220
I would have to put this in the top 10.

341
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:33,600
Yeah.

342
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:40,240
And I mean, I think for us too, like we are all right around the right age of when this...

343
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,760
We would have been kids when this first opened in the early 90s.

344
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,480
And as always, you're maybe skewed by nostalgia.

345
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:54,140
And I recognize that I could be with this, because Back to the Future is my franchise,

346
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:54,860
for sure.

347
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:00,180
I'm really not a giant Star Wars fan, I'm not a giant Star Trek fan, I'm not a giant

348
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,080
Harry Potter fan.

349
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,320
Back to the Future is my thing.

350
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,500
Probably because I don't like being taken to fantasy worlds, I like hearing exposition

351
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:16,380
about almanacs and small suburban California towns with infrastructural issues.

352
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,000
Back to the Future, just to talk about the movie, I think it is one of those...

353
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,680
I don't know who hates Back to the Future, even someone...

354
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,860
Parents like it, kids like it.

355
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:31,020
You'd be a real big contrarian, I think, to find somebody who's not into Back to the Future.

356
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:38,480
Back to the Future is one of those things, maybe like the Borat movie, where I get a

357
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,220
excessive fandom of it sometimes.

358
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,900
Like it's a little too much.

359
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:46,180
Not that that can be said about most of the things I like.

360
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,380
But there's just so much of it.

361
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:56,880
And we have now lived through the celebration of Back to the Future Day of October, whatever,

362
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,600
2015, which there was a real big spike of...

363
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,620
And I feel like there was a 30th anniversary and a ton of...

364
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:09,500
There's been a lot of occasions to bring Back to the Future, to get all the cast members

365
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,060
together, to make them dress up in the uniforms.

366
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,460
Force them to dress up.

367
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,320
Which is an odd thing.

368
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,320
Michael J. Fox obviously has his condition.

369
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,740
Christopher Lloyd is...

370
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,260
In his 80s.

371
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,020
He's getting up there.

372
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,060
That being said, it was very delightful when they were on Jimmy Kimmel.

373
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,700
I thought they really gave that sketch their all.

374
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,820
They time traveled into the Jimmy Kimmel Theater when he did shows from Brooklyn.

375
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,440
That is...

376
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,360
Yeah, look that up if you haven't seen it, which I assume everyone has.

377
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,620
That is one of those where I saw the clip, I saw the link of it and went,

378
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,720
Oh no.

379
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,900
And then I clicked on it and I was like, all right, I have to admit I like this.

380
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,180
Yeah, absolutely.

381
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,960
But at first you're like, oh no, they're dressed up.

382
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:47,840
Oh no.

383
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:48,360
What?

384
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,360
Yeah, I was nervous.

385
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,140
You gotta be nervous about any sort of reunion callback situation.

386
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:58,680
Which that being said, the big thing with this is I don't have a lot of aggressive fanboy

387
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,480
opinions and I try to be open minded on things, but I swear to fucking God,

388
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,340
they ever remake this goddamn movie.

389
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,420
As soon as Zemeckis is dead though, it's happening.

390
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,020
Well, Zemeckis and Bob Gale have like refused...

391
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,820
Like they are pretty firm on like they have...

392
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,040
I feel like it's in the contract.

393
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,840
No Back to the Future reboot or Back to the Future IV.

394
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:21,740
Like it just won't happen, which I think is interesting because like this

395
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:30,220
franchise has definitely been part of our generation hitting our late 20s, early 30s,

396
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,100
and having a little disposable income.

397
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,840
So there's been a lot of like, here's the rainbow hat for sale.

398
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,480
Here's the hoverboard for sale.

399
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,040
Here's the sneakers for sale.

400
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,140
Here's Pepsi in a different bottle, you assholes.

401
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:41,540
Yeah, you're Pepsi in the bottle.

402
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,540
And did I try to buy one?

403
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,320
Yeah, I did.

404
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,340
I didn't though.

405
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,180
It was hard to get.

406
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:49,760
Oh yeah, there was a big Pepsi Perfect promotion at New York Comic Con 2015.

407
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,320
Shoelaces, the hoverboard, all of it.

408
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,200
I own an almanac.

409
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,680
I own like just a very cheapo like copy of the newsletter.

410
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,160
It says save the clock tower.

411
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,760
Jennifer's number is written on the back.

412
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:04,380
Oh, that's good.

413
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,460
Everybody catch up.

414
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:10,140
I imagine if you're listening to this, you know Back to the Future, Arcania pretty well.

415
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,960
But I just want to feel free to throw out secure references.

416
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,600
Yeah, we should feel free on this podcast.

417
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:21,420
But unlike some of those other like Star Wars or X-Men where we'll just keep or Avengers

418
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,200
where we'll just keep getting them forever.

419
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,720
Like they just won't stop.

420
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:27,620
Like Back to the Future is like finite.

421
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,840
Like it is stopped.

422
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,180
Until he's dead.

423
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,540
Until I guess he's dead.

424
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,260
He said that.

425
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:36,240
He says yes, as long as I'm alive, there won't be another Back to the Future.

426
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,480
But as soon as he's dead, someone's just going to sign off.

427
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,040
Whoever has the controlling rights, they'll be like, oh, well, I take 20 whatever billion

428
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,660
dollars to make a shitty version of this and a newer, shittier version of it.

429
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,420
People will be hovering around his hospital bed, certainly.

430
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,660
Stay in good shape, Robert Zemeckis.

431
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:58,540
You know what's a lucky thing, though, is that it is it's a Universal film.

432
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,300
And I feel like of all the with all of the chaos in the film industry currently, I think

433
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,540
Universal is doing very well.

434
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,520
I think they've got a lot of big franchises.

435
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,560
They're Fast and Furious, correct?

436
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,060
Sure.

437
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,800
They don't I don't think they need it.

438
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:15,520
They don't need to like suck the marrow out of the bone in the same way that other if

439
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,120
it was if it was a more struggling company, I feel like it would have happened, you know,

440
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:19,960
15 years ago.

441
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,800
Warner Brothers is coming off a year with both Justice League and King Arthur Legend

442
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,480
of the Sword in one financial year.

443
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,760
Which, by the way, I watched about 50 minutes of King Arthur Legend of the Sword the other

444
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,260
night and then had to like go out.

445
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,400
And I was like, oh, there can't be too much of this left.

446
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,080
And I'm like, there's two more hours of this.

447
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,540
It's fine.

448
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,280
It's fine.

449
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:48,060
It's not offensively bad, but it's just like, I can't believe a King Arthur movie is that

450
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:48,380
long.

451
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,160
Yeah, yeah.

452
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:55,780
Well, see, as soon as they figure out that, like by old sequel rules, it would have been

453
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,580
like, well, how do you do it without Marty and if Michael J.

454
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,420
Fox won't participate?

455
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:03,240
But now we know that franchises are about the ethereal thing.

456
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:09,860
It's about like outsiders taking up, taking the mantle and like they will like a new generation

457
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,620
will rise to drive the DeLorean around.

458
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,160
It's going to happen.

459
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,900
I mean, you have to brace for it now.

460
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,640
Yeah, you should get in the bunker now.

461
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,380
Until then, you have...

462
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,140
I know it's happening.

463
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,840
But it might be in a decade.

464
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,900
I want to stave it off as long as possible.

465
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,920
Or Zemeckis might live to be the oldest, world's oldest man.

466
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,540
Oh, please.

467
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,180
Yeah, please.

468
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,340
110, 50, like you'll be so old at that point that it won't even matter.

469
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,660
You won't even know, you won't be up on pop culture.

470
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,140
So you didn't hear about the new one.

471
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:43,280
Until then, we have three movies, our memories and footage of the ride, the cartoon and a

472
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,720
four part Telltale Games.

473
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:50,300
And I think there was like a little short with for the anniversary, a little short with

474
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:57,420
Christopher Lloyd doing Doc Brown, doing some bits about like explaining paradoxes or why

475
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:01,880
the future doesn't look exactly like it did in Back to the Future 2.

476
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:02,760
Okay, okay.

477
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,880
That said, these movies made insane amounts of money.

478
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,560
Like the first movie cost $19 million and it made over $200 million.

479
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:12,480
Jeez.

480
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,580
And the second movie, they doubled the budget.

481
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,620
It was like $40 million.

482
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:19,620
And then that also, the second and third ones also hugely successful.

483
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,300
I feel like this was not, I feel like the first Back to the Future was not made thinking

484
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,020
this will be a big old franchise.

485
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,680
They never would have imagined a ride.

486
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:31,500
I can't imagine because it's more of a, even more so than, although your Star Wars was

487
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,580
like, what's that weird little movie they're making in the desert.

488
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:33,900
Yeah.

489
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:39,880
This felt like more, it feels like a romantic comedy that has sci-fi components, whereas

490
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:44,720
it became kind of a bigger, full on sci-fi franchise as it went on.

491
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:45,480
Yeah.

492
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:50,380
It's interesting how, because like, yeah, Star Wars, as you said, like that's designed

493
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:55,160
for to make a million movies as much like this is not designed, at least when you're

494
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,980
watching the first movie, it's like, oh, this is an interesting thing that happened

495
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,580
in this young man's life.

496
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,760
But then it's like, no, wait, no, it's all these adventures.

497
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,840
It's all, it all happens over the course of like a week.

498
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,140
And he's like, he's still got to go to college.

499
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,520
Like Marty's got everything ahead of him.

500
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:09,920
Yes.

501
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,720
Uh, I, Christopher Lloyd was saying he always wishes he wished there was one more.

502
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,700
And I think he said he wished it was like an Egypt.

503
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:19,960
Like he had some fantasy in his head that he wishes there was a fourth one that was

504
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,780
like an ancient Egypt or in like, like way old in times.

505
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:23,300
Oh, weird.

506
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:29,120
Well, this is in the ride you get to go to extremely olden times and it's the, uh, it's,

507
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,080
uh, you know, for probably the last chance to, to really see him.

508
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,500
Although there was the TV show and things that you've mentioned, but anyway, it seems

509
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:41,920
like, you know, in a way the, like the last bit of the original trilogy.

510
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:42,400
Yeah.

511
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,340
And, uh, uh, here, if I may, with the, the aforementioned, uh, old tattered universal

512
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:47,920
flyer.

513
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:53,200
Tattered, uh, yeah, brochure, which I told Scott, I have, uh, the exact same brochure.

514
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:57,860
Probably have it here in California and it is in the exact same shape and it's gotta

515
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:01,140
be from the first opening year or two of universal.

516
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:06,260
I think my family first went to universal studios, Florida in 1991, which would be about

517
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,360
a year after it opened, right?

518
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,720
Park opened in 1990.

519
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,840
I think mine might be from 93.

520
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:12,960
There's a big picture.

521
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:17,100
There's like pictures of all the celebrities who've recently attended, uh, universal studios

522
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,740
like Dan Aykroyd, Macaulay Culkin, and Bill Cosby.

523
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:24,140
A giant quote, there just isn't anything like this in the world.

524
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,300
Robert Wagner.

525
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,200
Oh, another, yeah, yeah.

526
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,520
Another good, another good guy to talk about.

527
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:35,740
Uh, anyway, but the description of the ride, just to hype everyone up, brace yourself for

528
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,280
the greatest ride in history.

529
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,140
Buckle up.

530
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:42,780
Doc Brown is sending you screaming through time, climbing, diving, blasting you into

531
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:47,720
the past for an ice age encounter with avalanches, dinosaurs, and a molten volcano.

532
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,580
Then rocketing you into Hill Valley 2015.

533
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:56,840
It's a 21 million gigawatt since surround adventure that brings the blockbuster to life

534
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,060
and makes other thrill rides seem tame.

535
00:25:59,420 --> 00:25:59,900
Wow.

536
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:00,640
That's great.

537
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,740
I think I agree.

538
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,280
Uh, I don't, I don't disagree with the word of that.

539
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:08,780
Uh, uh, that, uh, that specific amount of gigawatts is pretty bizarre, but Hey, sure.

540
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,360
Why not?

541
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:14,600
Uh, this is a, one of my earliest memories of universal is he's riding this ride.

542
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:19,060
I guess if we were going through the park chronologically, when my family first went

543
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,160
there, we'd probably hit the E.T. ride first.

544
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,860
Cause you hit it first on the way.

545
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:26,120
Um, but I definitely remember riding this ride probably very vividly.

546
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,900
Cause I think it was one of the few times I remember my family using the child swap.

547
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,620
So I got to ride this ride twice in a row.

548
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:36,580
Uh, uh, while someone sat with my little brother.

549
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,340
It was awesome.

550
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,120
It was great.

551
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:44,760
And also I realized like, once we did this, I don't know how much else I would have ridden

552
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:49,480
in the park, I guess King Kong and the Ghostbusters, the short-lived Ghostbusters show.

553
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,960
And I think that's where I would have tapped out in first grade.

554
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:58,180
But if all you do, when I started like, you know, the ride was still open, I think up

555
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,040
through 2007 here in Hollywood.

556
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:03,780
And I would have days where I'd essentially go into that ride, that's it.

557
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:09,180
And then go, uh, uh, yeah, it's, uh, uh, definitely the, the, the centerpiece of, of both

558
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:13,360
parks, probably the best attraction in both parks until some other stuff came along.

559
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,040
Uh, um, uh, some basics about the ride.

560
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:21,480
Now, so open from 1990, uh, although I guess soft opened in 1990, but not really open until

561
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:26,680
91, officially open in 91 in Florida, Florida open until two, then closed in 2007, opened

562
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,380
from 1994 to 2007 in universal Hollywood.

563
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,400
No, 93.

564
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,060
Wasn't it?

565
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,240
Maybe I could be wrong.

566
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:32,640
Okay.

567
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:36,020
Uh, uh, don't get at us about the research.

568
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:44,200
Uh, uh, and, and from 2001 to 2016 in universal Japan, uh, so big, big, lengthy runs, no longer

569
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,940
in operation anywhere, but as, but it, it does sort of, it's a, it's a closure that

570
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:54,180
I am not terribly upset about because you literally, uh, the ride takes you into a year

571
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:57,940
that would have passed by the time, uh, you were going on it.

572
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:00,620
Like, like that ride could not stay open past 2015.

573
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,240
Although it did in Japan.

574
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,180
Yes.

575
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,440
So you were going into the past.

576
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,160
Jaws is still open in Japan.

577
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:07,660
Uh huh.

578
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,040
Oh really?

579
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:14,100
Uh, which is a thing that, uh, uh, yeah, I, I, why I might want to go there.

580
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:14,460
Yeah.

581
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,280
And go to Japan.

582
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:20,940
There's a few of our friends, anytime we talk about like, oh, we all kind of, people have

583
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:27,020
gone to Japan or want to visit Japan, uh, there, there's a few of us who are like, do

584
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:30,700
you set aside the time to go to universal because they do have the Jaws ride?

585
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,340
Like, uh,

586
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:35,000
If they still had BTTF, I think that would seal the deal.

587
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,280
Yeah.

588
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,660
Yeah.

589
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:40,400
Um, what I was going to say, I didn't actually go, we didn't go to universal studios.

590
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:43,800
The first couple of times I went to Florida, we just went to Disney.

591
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,880
So I didn't ride this until I was a little older, which also with the ET ride.

592
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:53,700
Um, but this ride does the similar thing to ET and that it like drastically expands.

593
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,820
What like the universe, like kind of gives you all this new information and like adds

594
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,880
another element to it.

595
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,440
Like ET gives you a whole nother planet and his backstory.

596
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:06,380
Of course we all know the flop glopple and botanicus of course.

597
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,600
But this is like, there's a future Institute and this expands like what doc does and who

598
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:17,280
he is like, this is honestly kind of a case for like, I wouldn't mind a movie about this

599
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:22,620
Institute that doc Brown has multiple branches in multiple times.

600
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,160
It's kind of interesting.

601
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:27,520
It's kind of an interesting idea where he would go like as much as we're like not liking

602
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,100
the idea.

603
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:31,600
And obviously Christopher Lloyd probably can't play doc Brown.

604
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,100
Alden, Alden Reich.

605
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:39,280
He takes young Hans, young doc, Donald Glover as Marty.

606
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:45,620
But like if it was the nineties and like the, the people who made the movie wanted to make

607
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:48,160
another movie, I was like, it's kind of a fun idea.

608
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:53,160
The stuff that they introduced in this lot in the queue and it's all just to justify

609
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,260
why we're putting a bunch of tourists in this adventure.

610
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,360
But it's similarly to ET.

611
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,820
It's like, this is a bunch of stuff not in the movie.

612
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:04,920
And that's the thing I like about universal Indiana Jones does it a little bit at Disney,

613
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:09,780
but Disney is much more kind of book report as they say,

614
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:13,900
Which is a complaint about a couple of probably might be the complaint about little mermaid

615
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:17,020
might be a complaint about the Nemo submarines.

616
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:21,060
Although I think some of the, you know, I like little mermaid a lot.

617
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,300
Nemo, I don't know.

618
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,260
We can get into that later.

619
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,540
We'll talk about that in another episode.

620
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:29,120
But yeah, they're a little more maybe because Disney in general as probably also true with

621
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,640
the Marvel and Star Wars properties.

622
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,920
It's there's less maybe risk in terms of expanding the universe.

623
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:38,420
Whereas universal will take big old strides.

624
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,620
Be a little, you know, T2 3D similar example where they,

625
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:46,420
you know, you have the T 1000, but then you expand to the T1 million.

626
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,560
And the invention that's only in the ride.

627
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:49,120
Yes.

628
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,220
So that's a good thing.

629
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,180
We like that.

630
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:56,240
But if you get that stuff wrong, it can be so wrong and so off.

631
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:59,920
But I also but I mean, as I said, maybe it was on the last episode where I was saying

632
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,640
like I had a certain point, even if it's bad, I like it.

633
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:07,080
Like, I will say this like the ET Green Planet doesn't make any sense.

634
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,780
It doesn't make sense to ET.

635
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:12,420
He looks totally different than these happy characters, like, but it's great.

636
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,760
And now it's just canon.

637
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,420
So even if it's bad, eventually it's good.

638
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,880
And especially if you were a kid when you saw it, it's good.

639
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,760
Yeah, it is automatically good.

640
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:26,080
But yeah, so the so the basic premise of this doc has opened the Institute of Future Technology

641
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,160
from which he can run a time travel test, but other tech you get to see in the line

642
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:35,220
like examples of hover bikes and other technologies that he's exploring.

643
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:40,980
I love that in the line that you see the office numbers where everybody works in the Institute

644
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,940
of Future Technology.

645
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,400
And it's a lot of obscure names, probably names of people who worked on the ride.

646
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:51,020
But then also like Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Edison and Leonardo da Vinci.

647
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,940
They all work somehow out of this facility.

648
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,060
This is the thing.

649
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,260
So I was just looking.

650
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,540
There's a whole I forget what we'll tweet a link to.

651
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,200
There's somebody who put all of this together.

652
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,180
The ride, the queue, the video, like the pre-show video.

653
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,640
It's like an hour long YouTube video.

654
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,860
I watched all of it today.

655
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:07,520
Of course.

656
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:11,100
And the first thing I'll say is you're mentioning that.

657
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:16,320
And there's a lot of like great like fake newsreel footage of Doc going back in time

658
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,640
and like hanging out with Edison and the right.

659
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,020
He's at the first plane flight.

660
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,000
The Wright Brothers.

661
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,560
Oh, yeah.

662
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:24,500
The Beatles.

663
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,820
He's at the Beatles, which this doesn't make any sense because the Beatles came to America

664
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:32,980
in 1964 and Marty goes back in time into 1955.

665
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:37,360
So like they're acting like it's all part of the same thing where Doc is like traveling

666
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,020
through time.

667
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,780
But I don't know why he went back.

668
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:43,820
I guess maybe he didn't know the Beatles would be a thing as a thing, right?

669
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,060
He just wanted to go see them.

670
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:45,680
That's what I'm saying.

671
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:49,000
It seems like the doctors kind of wandered into the Beatles press conference.

672
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,520
And then I think the joke is concerned with like disrupting the space time.

673
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,520
This is my point next to the beat.

674
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,220
This is my point.

675
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,360
He's in the movies.

676
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,360
He's very worried about like you cannot.

677
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,800
And that part of the ride is they're sending teams to.

678
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,100
Yeah.

679
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:06,320
So different time periods they went to in the movies just to make sure everything's

680
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:06,980
copacetic.

681
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:11,700
They're sending future institute employees to check out constantly.

682
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,160
And he's hanging out with famous people.

683
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:17,260
So the only thing I would criticize maybe about in this pre-show is there should be

684
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:21,580
a thing where Doc realized that when he went all this like time traveling that they did

685
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,240
in these movies.

686
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,920
That didn't really matter very much.

687
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:24,460
So who cares?

688
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,360
Yeah, go back in time.

689
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:25,860
Fuck around.

690
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:26,660
It doesn't really matter.

691
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,300
It didn't change the time stream that much.

692
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:28,680
Who cares?

693
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,780
It's a more lax Doc.

694
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,980
And also at the end of part three, Doc has vowed to destroy the time machine.

695
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,060
No more experiments.

696
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:39,700
Although I guess the time train is an indicator that he has reversed that decision.

697
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,900
He is going to travel through time with his wife, Clara, and his two creepy sons.

698
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,460
The boy who points at his dick.

699
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:50,660
If you haven't seen that YouTube video or if you, if you, you guys know this, right?

700
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,380
I just heard about this.

701
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,480
Like we didn't talk about this last week.

702
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:54,920
Did we?

703
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:55,520
I don't believe so.

704
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,560
I heard about it in the last week for whatever reason.

705
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,020
Either Jules or Vern.

706
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,340
I don't know about this actually.

707
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,180
Oh my God.

708
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,060
Look it up.

709
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:03,300
Yeah.

710
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,980
Just look, just Google creepy kid back to the future.

711
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:09,540
Sorry to if that child has grown and a good dude now.

712
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:10,460
I would hope they've grown.

713
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,440
You were creepy as a kid.

714
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:16,980
And he, I think it's, he does this bizarre gesture where he points down to his crotch

715
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:20,220
and then does a kind of like come hither gesture.

716
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:25,120
And it's in the movie as you're pushing in on doc kind of saying his final, like in the

717
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,480
future is what you make of it.

718
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:27,840
There's this kid pointing at his dick.

719
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:28,980
It's really, really weird.

720
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,060
And which I, which my wife interpreted.

721
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,540
Little kids are weird.

722
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,500
I think he had to pee.

723
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,720
I think is what I think he was telling someone off camera.

724
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:36,760
That was the best take thing.

725
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:37,900


726
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,860
But in the other ones he just yells, I gotta pee.

727
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,840
Or, or started peeing.

728
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,100
Yeah.

729
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,560
That's like a trick when you go to like child acting school is like, if you have to pee,

730
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:54,800
signal to the first AD, like this point here and then wave anytime.

731
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,100
If it's in the take, it's fine.

732
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:56,940
So yeah.

733
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:59,360
So doc is like real casual now about time travel.

734
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:02,800
So I would have loved like a him explaining like, nah, it doesn't really matter.

735
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:06,600
We just, I'm just having the time of my life hanging out with these old celebrities.

736
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,700
My retirement years.

737
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:08,920
Fuck them rules.

738
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:13,540
You said though, he says he's going to just get rid of the time to shoot and stuff, but

739
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,160
they zoom off, right?

740
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:15,480
Things.

741
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,120
The time train zooms off.

742
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,420
Yeah.

743
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:21,120
What I'm saying is to go fuck around somewhere.

744
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,840
He says he's going to destroy the time machine by the time he shows up with the time train.

745
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:28,760
Maybe that's an indicator that maybe that's, that's true.

746
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,340
That's a good point.

747
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,080
Because why would you build the time train?

748
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,680
I guess it's sort of like in Breaking Bad, you know, Mike tells Walt no more half measures

749
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,280
and then everything Mike does is half measures.

750
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,460
People have a pattern.

751
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:44,980
So I guess if I think about it, doc constantly tells people not to fuck with time, but he

752
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:45,840
built a time machine.

753
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,760
So he's always going to fuck with time.

754
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,340
I guess that's really, I guess there doesn't need to be an explanation.

755
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,580
I guess I've solved the problem that I presented.

756
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,680
Doc is always going to mess with the time stream.

757
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,520
By butterfly effect logic.

758
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:03,560
Any, if he were running over a blade of grass with the DeLorean would have some effect on

759
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,020
something.

760
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:04,440
Of course.

761
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,680
No way he's making it out.

762
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:06,380
Yeah.

763
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,120
Yeah.

764
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,260
So anyway, it's fun.

765
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,500
Time travels now just fun.

766
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,780
And they presented in this really great way.

767
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:17,540
And I forgot sort of all about this is they do a newsreel called doc on the March, which

768
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:22,700
is like the same kind of bit as the Indiana Jones ride, which is an old style newsreel.

769
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,960
And it's black and white footage.

770
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,880
And they use like stock footage of like sixties things.

771
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,860
And like they show what doc has made his inventions.

772
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:31,360
Like it's all this history of doc and it's great.

773
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,280
I was so delighted watching it.

774
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,680
Loved that kid.

775
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,800
And that kind of film style that was like tougher to do.

776
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:42,760
And it was, this is pre forest gump, like, uh, you know, starting a book into the old

777
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,160
footage is pretty crazy.

778
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:48,400
Uh, so kudos to, you know, in general, I'm sure we'll keep coming back to it besides

779
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,080
the ride film itself, which is incredible.

780
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:54,460
All of the pre-show materials are so great and there is so much of it.

781
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,740
There's a half hour's worth of pre-show material.

782
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:03,100
And credited, uh, one of the first gigs credited to Peyton Reed, director of Iron Man or Ant

783
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:06,460
Man and Ant Man and the Wasp, the upcoming Ant Man and the Wasp.

784
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:11,660
I, I, downward love a director of, uh, some of the last season of Mr.

785
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,580
Show, some of the best sketches they ever did.

786
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:19,740
Uh, uh, I think he even, I remember hearing an interview with him and he talked about

787
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:24,400
how like they, they really did get them a lot of freedom on this ride.

788
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:28,820
And I feel like he may have also directed some of the pre-show Q segments.

789
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:29,960
He's not credited.

790
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,000
Wrote it though.

791
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,940
Uh, uh, but yeah, it is credited as, as writer.

792
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:39,800
Um, also wrote and directed the making of the Bags of Future trilogy with Kirk Cameron

793
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:45,240
that was included as a bonus VHS in the four pack that I bought at Universal Studios.

794
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:45,640
Wow.

795
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:49,660
The first time I went on the ride because there was a Bags of Future specific store

796
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:52,640
and I said, boy, it's the other cherished childhood memory.

797
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,420
I still got those tapes kicking around.

798
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,820
What an insane markup that must have had.

799
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:57,680
Oh yeah, I'm sure.

800
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,020
Must've been like $109 in 1995.

801
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,960
Um, yeah, so there's just so much material.

802
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:08,260
Um, and I mean, I was writing notes down, but it's like, we can't get through all of

803
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:08,660
it.

804
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:11,100
But there's good, there's like, there's funny jokes in it still.

805
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,560
Like there's like these weird inventions he made, uh, the flapjack maker.

806
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:20,240
There's like something where you can, you can bronze shoes and bronze your wife's hat.

807
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:24,000
And then it says like, and there's like just old footage of like somebody getting blasted

808
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,700
in the head with bronze, like some stock footage they must've found.

809
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,680
He has a bizarre like hair puff up.

810
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:34,040
And it's, I wrote it, uh, it's static, the head static hair chair.

811
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,180
So the way you would cut your hair is like, it would make your hair stand up and then

812
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,140
they would cut it easier.

813
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:41,840
And it looks like this was maybe actually a weird invention someone made and they just

814
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,720
attribute it to doc.

815
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,860
Oh yeah, it was like kooky old has to the future kind of.

816
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,280
Yeah, like those, like that weight loss machine that would just jiggle you with that thing

817
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,220
around, whatever that's called.

818
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,500
Good for doc though.

819
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:58,060
He's running through time, make it like he's, he's, he's a crackpot when you meet him who

820
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:01,020
nobody's heard of and he's distrusted by this local principle.

821
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:06,720
And then now he is beloved by the world, hanging with the Beatles, hanging with all the greatest

822
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,840
inventors of all time.

823
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:12,820
Is a movie I would have liked to see a nineties movie where doc was hanging with, like, just

824
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:16,200
take Marty out of the equation and just, it's doc hanging out.

825
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:23,340
Where doc goes like back just far enough to kind of hang around Steve jobs, hear the idea,

826
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:29,420
take it, come back, do his own keynote and you know, uh, 2000 right before he gets the

827
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:32,200
jump on the iPod on the iPad and the black turtleneck.

828
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:34,000
Yeah, I think that's great.

829
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,060
You got the whole thing.

830
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:35,380
Yeah.

831
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:35,740
Yeah.

832
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:42,540
Uh, this ride has, uh, I think one of, one of my favorite, like legitimately solid jokes

833
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:47,860
in a theme park attraction when the ride is over and you are exiting the room, uh, then

834
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:52,100
you can hear doc going, hurry up, get out before you meet yourself coming in.

835
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:55,580
Like that's such a solid time travel joke.

836
00:39:55,620 --> 00:40:00,200
Like the ride really does a great job of capturing the humor of the movies.

837
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:05,500
Like the basic premise of why the Institute of future technology is there is doc's going

838
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:10,400
to do a test where he's going to send you one day into the future because any more than

839
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,520
that would be a, uh, too much of a shock to the system.

840
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,060
Right.

841
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,740
But until things go terribly awry.

842
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:23,480
Thing goes, uh, yeah, because, uh, I think we said earlier, but, uh, doc has sent his

843
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:28,320
employees to the different time periods they visit in the movies to make sure everything

844
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,720
is copacetic after, uh, you know, he had been there.

845
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:40,460
And 1950s Biff, uh, Stowe, not the Stowe's away in with the 1955 team and now comes to

846
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,940
the future and he has a vendetta.

847
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:43,280
Right.

848
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:47,420
Which is this, this sort of is the least making sense part of the ride in my mind.

849
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:47,720
Yeah.

850
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,140
Why is it specifically 1950s Biff?

851
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,020
Because there's multiple Biffs you could choose from.

852
00:40:54,020 --> 00:41:00,040
He's like, uh, you know, he's, he's, he's an older disheveled guy, uh, in, in 1985 and

853
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,720
then a bitter old man in 2015.

854
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,560
And then the current day is the Trump Biff.

855
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,060
Yeah.

856
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,100
Who is certainly like a savvier person.

857
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:13,380
And like that's the alternate 1985, which by the way, as we record this, uh, uh, essentially

858
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:17,660
Biff Tannen is giving his presidential state of the union for that first time.

859
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:21,480
We, we live in the deep into the alternate 1985.

860
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:24,320
A worse Biff is giving his state of the union.

861
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,140
That is our president.

862
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:28,700
Kind of a little more street smart and crafty than Biff Tannen.

863
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:28,960
Yeah.

864
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,500
But this guy, he pulled off, it was, it, uh, but it's something that maybe a young Trump

865
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:37,560
would have done is stow away in the, uh, in an early iteration of the Institute of future

866
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,020
technology and to do what?

867
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:42,960
To go out, he says, I'm going to take it on a little joy ride, but what's really,

868
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,900
It doesn't really, it's not, I don't, I can't,

869
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,380
It's just going to cause chaos.

870
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:47,380
Yeah.

871
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:51,440
So he stows away in a DeLorean that's doing like a routine checkup.

872
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,340
Now it seems like doc is running cars and time machines just to go to years to check up.

873
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:58,160
He's got a shit ton of DeLoreans.

874
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:58,480
Yeah.

875
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:03,460
Because he doesn't take the, one of the new eight passenger DeLoreans, which is what he's

876
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:08,960
showing off to us, the audience, uh, he, the eight passenger convertible DeLorean, as he

877
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,980
points out, there's a couple of mods to the DeLorean that we're getting on, but Biff is

878
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:18,000
just on an old fashioned regular one, which is also sitting around the Institute and he's

879
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,180
able to like override all of this technology.

880
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:25,660
He locks doc in his own office, a bunch of bars drop down.

881
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,080
He overrides whatever security system is in place at the Institute.

882
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:33,560
Biff is just some sort of technological genius all of a sudden.

883
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,120
There's a joke just how stupid he is in Back to the Future.

884
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,280
The old Biff can't do literally anything right.

885
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,680
He doesn't know how to speak very well.

886
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:43,240
But he goes to 1990 and is able to override security.

887
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:49,020
Like he's, there's a part where he sprays paint on a, over a security camera, but like

888
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:52,320
That concept wouldn't have been introduced in the 50s, right?

889
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,380
When did security cameras first catch on?

890
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:55,700
They were really archaic.

891
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,600
I just feel like to see one tilting back and forth.

892
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:01,020
I mean, maybe he's thinking one step ahead.

893
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:07,000
Oh, of course, security cameras are more technologically advanced now, but I don't know.

894
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:09,020
Don't say don't go over to that cafe 80s.

895
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:13,240
Don't go meet that Reagan and Ayatollah hologram or that'll really freak you out.

896
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:13,940
If he's Biff.

897
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:19,080
There's also a section where he talks to the audience via a security camera, which I don't

898
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:19,940
think they explain.

899
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:27,260
Doc has a two way camera to talk to the tourists, but Biff is like, obviously looks in a security

900
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:29,380
camera and goes, well, tourists are out here.

901
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,040
And then it's like, come on guys.

902
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:36,840
Security cameras don't traditionally capture audio sometimes either.

903
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:38,760
Yeah.

904
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:48,660
There's a really funny piece of universal promotional video where he says into the security

905
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,340
camera, what are you looking at, butthead?

906
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:53,340
And it cuts to a full audience like, ha ha ha ha ha.

907
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:57,320
Like a big old laugh at just what are you looking at, butthead?

908
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,520
Which is one of his classic lines.

909
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,100
But it's not in a ride that has like literal jokes.

910
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:04,120
That one's not particularly a joke.

911
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:09,160
Although I always love the, you know, like the screen door in a battleship.

912
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,800
Those like those jokes and insults that Biff gets wrong.

913
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,700
I think that's a very funny thing from the movies.

914
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:20,120
In this one, he says he, before unleashing a bunch of ball bearings, just a bunch of

915
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:23,320
marbles go on the floor and he trips up the security guards.

916
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,460
He says, have a nice trip.

917
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:26,820
See you next winter.

918
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,520
And they all see you next fall.

919
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,140
Again, solid jokes in this ride.

920
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,200
Yeah, pretty good.

921
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:38,040
Like there's something about, I think, not just in the ride, but in the films themselves,

922
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,920
the Back to the Future comedy, I think is fairly timeless.

923
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:46,220
And I think some of it survives better than we've talked about, like comedy and rides

924
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:47,700
going stale very quickly.

925
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:52,420
And there's something about, it's like not hard, funny enough, but it's like classic

926
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:55,260
enough and multigenerational enough that this stuff still works.

927
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,860
Well, Doc is, Christopher Lloyd is the greatest mugger of all time also.

928
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,520
It's just mugging is funny if it's done by a person who's good at it.

929
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,460
And Christopher Lloyd is the best in the business.

930
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:07,440
I think people don't talk about how great Christopher Lloyd is enough.

931
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:11,260
As a kid, I loved him in Camp Nowhere.

932
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:15,020
Remember Camp Nowhere, the movie where they make a fake summer camp?

933
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:16,100
He's Uncle Fester.

934
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:19,160
He's Jim Mignotowski on Taxi.

935
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,580
He's great on all of these things, even stuff that's bad.

936
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,660
It's like, well, he's very watchable and he mugs and like mugging is a comedy language

937
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:29,060
that transcends generations and countries.

938
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:33,020
And this had to work in America and Japan.

939
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:34,700
And I'm sure his face is funny.

940
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:35,860
He makes funny faces.

941
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:40,760
There's a really good one in the ride where he like he's kind of like shuttering through

942
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:43,440
the bars, just like, oh, Tannenbrrrrr.

943
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:48,780
Yeah, and it could be horrible with a worse actor doing it, but like the bigness of Christopher

944
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:50,720
Lloyd just really worked.

945
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:56,820
He's like one of those classic Adam West-y guys where he pulled off broad so well.

946
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:02,400
I feel like there's a self-awareness to the humor in the ride, too, which definitely gets

947
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:07,520
heightened even more with the replacement, because The Simpsons ride is the most like

948
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,820
take so many potshots.

949
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:09,840
It's so self-aware.

950
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:10,700
It's a ride.

951
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:17,240
Also, self-aware, the animated Doc Brown shows up in the pre-show queue of The Simpsons ride.

952
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:20,300
Yes, but we should save that for the Simpsons episode.

953
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:26,660
But I think we're not doing I was so delighted to see that they like handed off the keys,

954
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:27,260
essentially.

955
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:32,220
And you get to see seeing a Simpsonized Doc Brown is a lot of fun and seeing him interact

956
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:33,840
with Professor Frank.

957
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:34,800
And Krusty.

958
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:35,980
Funniest scientist.

959
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:38,660
And Christopher Lloyd's voice.

960
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:40,400
Not a sound alike.

961
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:41,020
Very cool.

962
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:43,520
Did Christopher Lloyd do the voice on the cartoon?

963
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,520
No, it's Dan Castellaneta.

964
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:46,160
It is?

965
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:46,560
Yeah.

966
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:47,400
Is that really?

967
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:49,900
That's crazy.

968
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:55,240
As the Genie and now I've he replaced Robin Williams as the Genie here and there and then

969
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,060
he played Doc Brown in the cartoon.

970
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:00,740
That seems like I set you up for that perfectly, but I did not know the answer to it.

971
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:06,600
I was very surprised because he has done the voice in other stuff like other video games

972
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:07,100
and stuff.

973
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:09,860
So yeah, that's a nice little nod to it.

974
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:12,740
Oh, he's Doc Brown in the Seth MacFarlane of the Western movie.

975
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,760
I believe they like they open a door and he's like an old blacksmith.

976
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:16,540
He's in Old West.

977
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,640
Oh, A Million Ways to Die in the West?

978
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:19,300
There you go.

979
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,120
Oh my God.

980
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:22,340
All right, because he becomes a blacksmith in the third movie.

981
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:27,140
What an odd nod to the other universal Western comedy.

982
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,120
Yeah, they all tie together.

983
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,220
Um, well, God, what?

984
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:31,460
And what else?

985
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:32,280
I mean, there's so much.

986
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:36,020
He was just to say Jason was saying there's a lot of it's like a very self-referential

987
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,920
in the one of the pre-show videos.

988
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:39,020
I think it's when he's in the future.

989
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:42,400
He's like, look at the Zemeckis Gale diagram.

990
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:43,240
Oh, yeah.

991
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:46,020
Like they just like there's not any subtlety to that reference.

992
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:51,580
And when you're in the DeLorean, you can see a little graph that says Zemeckis Gale coordinates,

993
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:55,740
which those are the two creators and screenwriters of the Back to the Future franchise.

994
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:58,680
Some of that, a little reference that I understood when I was

995
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:02,120
10 or whatever and felt like a good goody little two shoes.

996
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:03,900
Like, does everyone else in the car get this?

997
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:05,780
I know who Gale and Zemeckis are.

998
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,880
That's funny because I don't know that a lot of people would know Bob Gale.

999
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:15,040
But I think Zemeckis is on the level where like, oh, I know he's a Hollywood guy.

1000
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,300
Like, you know, I feel like my parents would know.

1001
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:19,180
Early 90s or late 80s?

1002
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:20,780
Oh, yeah, maybe not.

1003
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,440
Probably as the 90s went on.

1004
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:24,140
He hadn't had Polar Express yet.

1005
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:25,300
He hadn't had these.

1006
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:26,380
Beowulf.

1007
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,120
Beowulf.

1008
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:30,180
He had the Wire, White Man on Wire, right?

1009
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,020
He made that?

1010
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:31,660
I believe so.

1011
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:32,980
Oh, that's the documentary.

1012
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,320
But the film.

1013
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,020
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1014
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,840
That's the real version.

1015
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,480
We do our research, dammit.

1016
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:39,980
No more three stars.

1017
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,900
I'm just gonna keep haranguing that single review.

1018
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:47,140
Even though we've had worse reviews since, but that was the first one and the worst one.

1019
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:48,580
It stings the most.

1020
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:49,840
I mean, it doesn't sting.

1021
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:50,400
I don't care.

1022
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,220
I don't care at all.

1023
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:55,600
All right, well, elsewhere in the research that we've done about this, right?

1024
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:57,160
There is so much to talk about.

1025
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:02,560
Okay, so you're also, there's the video, you're moving through so many rooms and watching

1026
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,520
different videos in all of these rooms.

1027
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:09,840
You're also introduced to a woman who is kind of a receptionist, like a representative somehow

1028
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:14,060
of the Institute of Future Technology, played by an actress, Darlene Vogel, who has also

1029
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:18,400
Spike, the female member of Griff's gang in 2015.

1030
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:20,340
Griff is Biff's son.

1031
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:22,680
Wait, no, grandson, I believe.

1032
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:23,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1033
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:23,960
No, it's grandson.

1034
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:24,960
Oh, yeah.

1035
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,820
Did you finish watching my car, Gramps?

1036
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:31,980
Where do you guys land on Back to the Future in terms of favorite movies?

1037
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:33,700
I'm such a Back to the Future 2 person.

1038
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:36,040
Yeah, I was a big Back to the Future 2 kid.

1039
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:41,480
I think that we're all Tomorrowland kids, and I think future always won.

1040
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:44,840
So when I was a kid, I was always very big on like, two is the best.

1041
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:47,420
And my mom would always be like, two isn't the best.

1042
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,280
The first one's obviously the best.

1043
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,640
I'd be like, yeah, but two is cool.

1044
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,760
And you go to the future.

1045
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,880
And then I think you were the one who pointed out a year or two ago, they're in the future

1046
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,260
for like 10 minutes and two.

1047
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:56,880
Yeah, yeah.

1048
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:57,440
There's not much future.

1049
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,620
They had a breeze through it.

1050
00:49:58,700 --> 00:49:59,680
They sort of have to deal with it.

1051
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:02,820
And they spent most of two in the 50s.

1052
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:03,320
Yeah.

1053
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:05,800
Like, it's kind of on top of each other.

1054
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:07,300
You're in alternate 1985.

1055
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:09,500
You're in R&B and Trump world.

1056
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:12,200
And then you're in 1950, you're back in the first movie.

1057
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:13,980
But I love that.

1058
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:19,160
I love that bizarre 80s by way of future for sure.

1059
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:19,760
Oh, yeah.

1060
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:21,900
Big influence on the show I got to do Moobib City.

1061
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:26,800
This like crazy neon pastel clash of 80s and future.

1062
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:30,680
So too, I could just swim in that forever.

1063
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:38,260
So there is a ride where you get to go into this bizarre 2015.

1064
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:42,760
It's more specifically a Back to the Future 2 ride than

1065
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:44,720
any of the other movies really.

1066
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:45,160
Yes.

1067
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:46,200
I think that, yeah.

1068
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:50,160
I think as a kid, I did not care for the Old West,

1069
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:51,540
which totally different now.

1070
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:52,620
I love the Old West.

1071
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,620
But as a kid, three was like fine.

1072
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:56,380
But I was sort of bored because it was Old West.

1073
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,900
Two, I think just because of the future stuff,

1074
00:50:59,080 --> 00:50:59,940
always was my favorite.

1075
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:02,420
I think you probably have to give it up for one,

1076
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,680
being the best movie.

1077
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,300
As a movie that stands on its own.

1078
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:07,420
And it's like, it's almost perfect.

1079
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,880
I mean, there's a bunch of creepy stuff.

1080
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:11,080
And like, yeah, two is great.

1081
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,660
Like two, yeah.

1082
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:13,720
It's a big weird mess.

1083
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,200
Two is a hoverboard.

1084
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,400
Yeah, there's so many good stuff.

1085
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,500
There's a lot of iconography from that.

1086
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,900
I think as we were saying earlier, the rainbow hat.

1087
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:25,980
I love the big weird mess nature of it.

1088
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,860
I like that it's sort of scattered and all.

1089
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,580
And there's stuff that works and stuff that doesn't work.

1090
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:29,900
Oh yeah.

1091
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:31,920
There's so much bizarre technology.

1092
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:32,580
The pizza.

1093
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:34,300
Oh, the pizza hut.

1094
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:34,660
It's great.

1095
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:36,740
There's two ties when he's talking to needle,

1096
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:38,120
uh, Flea when he's talking to needles.

1097
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,460
That's the television channel,

1098
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,360
that multi-channel TV that he's watching.

1099
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:44,340
The fax machine.

1100
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:45,140
Oh yeah.

1101
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,780
Refired Fujitsu-san.

1102
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,700
Here is a fact about me.

1103
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,060
When I was a kid, like I was a big action figure kid.

1104
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:53,880
I really liked action figures, playing with them

1105
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,260
and buying them.

1106
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:56,960
And they were all pretty,

1107
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:01,440
when action figures were first really like hit a boom in the 90s.

1108
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,840
I mean, I guess they'd been around for a little while,

1109
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:05,280
but they all came with this very thin cardboard backers.

1110
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,100
And I would take the big ones of those and like,

1111
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:11,320
try to like push myself around on the carpet.

1112
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:12,600
Like it was a hoverboard.

1113
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:15,600
Cause they were always very smooth, glossy cardboard.

1114
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:19,300
So like they would slide around carpet, not very far,

1115
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:22,700
but they didn't make the hoverboard until like

1116
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:28,100
fucking 20 years later, people are spending $300 on hoverboard replicas.

1117
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:30,660
They're still not real, but they're still not real.

1118
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:34,920
But the current hoverboards light on fire very much in the way

1119
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,920
that a lot of Doc Brown inventions do.

1120
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:37,360
That's true.

1121
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:37,960
Yeah.

1122
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:42,820
Even within the ride, they kind of reprise the joke from the first movie

1123
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:45,720
where he's got a little complicated model that he downplays and says,

1124
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,520
you know, forgive the, the crudity of this.

1125
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,420
And then he sets up a car, it goes catches on fire.

1126
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,700
Trying to scare you that you're going to burst into flames on the ride.

1127
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:59,300
And there's a lot, like, I was very nervous about this ride as always,

1128
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:00,600
this being for 80 cat kids.

1129
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,560
I was very nervous about this ride the first time and almost every time,

1130
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:07,500
because you end up in this little, this tiny waiting room.

1131
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:09,820
Once you get split off into the little eight person groups,

1132
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:13,740
the room that you go into right before the ride begins is very small

1133
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:18,580
and claustrophobic and it shakes like crazy because you're right next to the ride

1134
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:19,540
and the ride mechanism.

1135
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:20,520
Do you guys remember this?

1136
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:23,100
Well, it's still happening now on the Simpsons ride.

1137
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,940
Oh, they didn't diminish the shake.

1138
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,740
You know, there's no way to diminish that shake because it really feels like

1139
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:30,540
you're getting bombed while you're in that little world.

1140
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:34,740
Like six or eight feet from a massive hydraulic arm.

1141
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:37,600
But the thing keeps jerking around and there's like 20,

1142
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:38,800
how many cars on this thing?

1143
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:43,760
So, OK, so there's two IMAX domes and each one has 12 cars.

1144
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:45,380
Are they called omni something?

1145
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:46,700
Omni max domes.

1146
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:47,980
It's not IMAX.

1147
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:53,480
An interesting thing I found out the range of movement in either direction of the car

1148
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,120
is only about two feet.

1149
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:59,920
But because you're getting jerked around so much and it's queued up with, like,

1150
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:04,220
different effects and the footage on screen, you think you're really getting thrown around.

1151
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:11,360
The most you can go, like, left to right, you know, front to back is like two feet of movement.

1152
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:11,980
Yeah, really.

1153
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:17,280
But also the fact that you're in these smaller vehicles that are all looking at the one giant

1154
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:24,440
screen, like you're rocking around so much that it, because they're smaller,

1155
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:30,300
like the smaller range of motion does more to you than a Star Tours cabin does.

1156
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:30,780
Oh, yeah.

1157
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:31,520
That's a bigger room.

1158
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:37,940
So you have, I don't know, in a smaller car, you're feeling those jerks and movements a lot more.

1159
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:41,900
And there's something to the open, because it's open air, like Star Tours is a closed vehicle

1160
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:46,080
and like it's being open air almost feels like when I was a kid or even now in The Simpsons,

1161
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,120
you kind of feel like you could fly out of it a little bit.

1162
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,540
Like you could fly out of the car.

1163
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:55,480
In terms of motion rides, looking at screens, I think this is the cream of the crop.

1164
00:54:55,680 --> 00:55:01,260
Like I prefer this much more to like a moving theater or even the minion ride.

1165
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:07,520
I guess the minion ride is separate cars, but you can see them all in this.

1166
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:10,520
It's kind of designed so you can just see.

1167
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:15,380
I mean, if you are on the edge and you lean out of the car opening a little,

1168
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,240
you can see the other cars around you.

1169
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:23,240
Ideally, like you are just seeing the screen like you are not looking at the other cars.

1170
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:25,860
And that screen is so immersive that it's going in all directions.

1171
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:31,060
Like if you look up, it's all the way above you, you know, because it's a fisheye shaped screen.

1172
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,100
It's it's it's all directions.

1173
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:38,260
I mean, it's still it's sort of the same like the newest version of this is the Avatar ride.

1174
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,440
Oh, yeah.

1175
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:39,680
Yeah.

1176
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,320
Is that no, I haven't been on that ride yet.

1177
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:42,320
Is that a curved screen?

1178
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:46,980
Is that like does that I have no up you like the like the Soren rides do it.

1179
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:51,200
But more so I have not looked into exactly what the shape of the screen is,

1180
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:55,360
but it is another one where, like, if you really kind of crane your neck to the right,

1181
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,660
you see like, oh, the illusion gets broken a little bit.

1182
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:03,100
But it is like the it's the it's the latest version of this, basically.

1183
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:08,500
Well, if I could talk a little about the some of the technology involved in this ride,

1184
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:11,560
because like I think until I was doing research in the last couple of days,

1185
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:16,080
I don't think I appreciated like what a step forward this ride was and what it's for sure.

1186
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,900
The film was itself.

1187
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,040
So the fact that it is.

1188
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:19,420
All right.

1189
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:23,660
So, yeah, it's OmniMax screens, which is it is that is a part of IMAX.

1190
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,640
Apparently now they call it IMAX Dome.

1191
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:31,560
But the idea that you're looking at 70 millimeter footage shot in a fish eye way

1192
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:37,660
so that it's it's an image that totally wraps all around you up, down, left, right.

1193
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:42,000
And this had only been used in museums up until this point.

1194
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:46,000
You know, I think like at Carnegie Mellon, there was this giant IMAX facility.

1195
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:50,420
Franklin Institute in Philadelphia had a huge, huge IMAX.

1196
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:56,360
And yeah, IMAX now it's IMAX or large format screen.

1197
00:56:56,560 --> 00:57:00,380
If we're not using copyrighted terms, are just everywhere.

1198
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:03,840
We're like we can walk to an IMAX screen from where we're recording.

1199
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:07,040
Yes, but like a real it's not a full like IMAX, though.

1200
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:10,820
It's it's good and it's high def, but it's not like the full the no,

1201
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:13,660
we could get the universal city walk if that's what you're saying.

1202
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:15,120
That is a real IMAX screen.

1203
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,200
But there's a one in Burbank.

1204
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:18,160
Yeah, there's one in Burbank.

1205
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:20,520
Yeah, spoiler alert, we're recording in Burbank.

1206
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:21,220
Recording in Burbank.

1207
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:25,380
But they I mean, when when they went to test it,

1208
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:29,820
like they had to take foam cars to an IMAX in in Canada.

1209
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:30,660
Is that right?

1210
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:31,900
I read something about this.

1211
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:32,380
Wait, I'm not sure.

1212
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:33,080
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1213
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,180
It was from a World's Fair.

1214
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:38,500
It was they had a leftover giant screen from the World's Fair in Canada.

1215
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:39,740
Yes.

1216
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:40,180
Yes.

1217
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:46,040
So they were so Universal made the deal with Omnimax to take this this technology

1218
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:50,040
that only been used in an educational way, basically be the first to use it for entertainment.

1219
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:54,400
Now it's the same technology that's used in Soarin' Over California or Soarin' Over the World.

1220
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:56,740
This is the first use in a theme park setting.

1221
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:01,280
So they made this deal with Omnimax, started building the theaters, bought the projector.

1222
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,560
It is all happening.

1223
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:03,720
The deal is in place.

1224
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:08,240
And then they start running tests of a separate movie, not the one that we all

1225
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:10,600
know and love today.

1226
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:15,400
But there was another ride film made by a different director named Richard Edlund.

1227
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:16,720
And they were filming.

1228
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:22,440
They were like testing out dailies of this thing at this Vancouver location.

1229
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:26,040
And whenever with like a little mock up DeLorean.

1230
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:30,040
But the tests went really badly and people were getting nauseous.

1231
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:34,840
And just like the the screen itself, there were a lot of problems with.

1232
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:36,100
Like you didn't know where to look.

1233
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:37,960
It was very disorienting.

1234
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:44,920
Like showing footage in these kind of theaters is really insane because it's this massive dome.

1235
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:49,680
So if there's a really bright object up in the upper right, the light refracts all over

1236
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:53,000
the room and messes up the lighting on the rest of the screen.

1237
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:55,680
So people are getting nauseous.

1238
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,260
There's weird lighting issues.

1239
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,540
The ride's going very badly.

1240
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,680
Universal knows they need to make a change.

1241
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:07,800
So they reach out to a director named Douglas Trumbull, who ended up directing the final

1242
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:08,180
film.

1243
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:09,600
Let me consult my notes here.

1244
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:15,680
But Douglas Trumbull, he's like this amazing optical effects artist who worked on 2001

1245
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:20,780
A Space Odyssey, Close Encounters, Blade Runner, Tree of Life much later.

1246
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:25,320
Directed this bizarre movie Brainstorm with Christopher Walken in the 80s.

1247
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:31,460
He's just like this, like if you that he did that crazy space travel sequence in 2001.

1248
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:33,500
Just incredible pioneer.

1249
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:38,920
Like the practical effects and like all like the cool images from all these films before

1250
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:41,500
digital effects were so prevalent.

1251
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:42,420
Yeah, yeah.

1252
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,740
And I wouldn't pretend to know how to describe all this stuff.

1253
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:52,680
Yeah, but it's all like giant cells are being printed out and like hand painted to make

1254
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,980
effects like what you see in Close Encounters and Blade Runner.

1255
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,020
And that's what got me.

1256
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:58,620
You're talking about tech on this ride.

1257
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:02,020
The footage, the ride footage is all practical.

1258
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:03,120
It's all miniatures.

1259
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:03,600
Yeah.

1260
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,100
Like there's no CGI.

1261
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:08,600
Good CGI had it was just a few years away from catching on.

1262
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:11,560
But like there are no computer effects in this ride.

1263
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,860
This is a bonkers wild fact about this thing.

1264
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:17,960
Even though you're smashing through signs and like there's big time warp tunnels.

1265
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:18,840
It's stop motion.

1266
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:19,380
Yeah.

1267
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:20,080
It's crazy.

1268
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:23,280
If you've ever seen like there's like one star where they were making Star Wars like

1269
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:27,520
there's these just they made the Death Star and they were just shooting little X wings

1270
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:31,700
and like that's sort of what this is like when you see the videos because there's a

1271
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:36,240
couple different there's some video like I watched about this this gentleman and they're

1272
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:39,620
showing a lot of like pictures from the the making of it.

1273
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:41,020
And it's all just models.

1274
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:43,560
It's all just and they're all gigantic.

1275
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:48,000
Like we haven't really talked about the structure of this ride too much, but basically,

1276
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,700
but if you if you don't know it, first you're in the you follow Biff into the future.

1277
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:52,620
You're in 2015.

1278
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:54,360
Then you end up in the Ice Age.

1279
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:59,800
You're going through these giant ice caverns and you end up encountering a big dinosaur

1280
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:03,640
and going down like a lava fall basically.

1281
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:07,220
And if you look at behind the scenes photos, and I'm sure we'll post some of these.

1282
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:10,000
It is in these are gigantic sets.

1283
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:15,560
There is an overhead of that dinosaur set and it goes on forever and ever and ever because

1284
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:21,860
they had to build the dinosaur that was big enough to swallow the camera, which like I

1285
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:25,500
often wonder going on it is this like a weird little puppet dinosaur, but I didn't know

1286
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:26,420
to last few days.

1287
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:27,560
It's it is.

1288
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:34,180
It's it's a motion controlled gigantic rig creature that is free camera into.

1289
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:38,580
And what's really bizarre is they had to build the IMAX camera that they ended up building

1290
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:44,040
was only a foot wide, even though it's you're looking at is creating images that are being

1291
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:47,160
projected in beautiful quality at seven stories.

1292
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:51,780
It's only a foot because it had to fit through all these miniatures and go into a dinosaur.

1293
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:58,600
So anyway, the like the situation with Doug Trumbull, he comes in and says, well, this

1294
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:02,100
technology that you're using, the OmniMax, you know, this is really bad for this ride

1295
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:02,680
for this reason.

1296
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,520
And this reason I think you should bail on that.

1297
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:06,260
And Universal says too late.

1298
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:07,780
We are building the buildings.

1299
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:09,320
We have the projector.

1300
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:10,700
We are not changing that.

1301
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:11,920
It's too late to change that.

1302
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:17,760
So he has to pitch out a new version of the ride that makes use of this technology that's

1303
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,320
extremely clunky and bizarre.

1304
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:26,540
And his main pitches are, as I said, you can't have, you know, like weird, you know, weird

1305
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:29,700
bright thing flying by on one end of the screen and flying away to the other.

1306
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:34,740
You need like like focal points, basically, and even lighting, which is why so much of

1307
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:35,600
the ride is at night.

1308
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:39,120
It's why it's all at night or you're in like the ice room or the lava room and that's

1309
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:39,560
all even.

1310
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:46,300
But it's also why it's a chase, because Biff is like a single point to focus on.

1311
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:51,900
So he brought that idea of chase Biff, bump him, keep him in your view.

1312
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:54,260
That is so that you have one thing to focus on.

1313
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:59,280
So you aren't noticing Bizarro strobing on one side of the camera or the other.

1314
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:01,740
Yeah, so bugged out by shit and getting nauseous.

1315
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:06,580
The narrative of the ride is that to get Biff back to the present, you need to bump him

1316
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:07,280
with your car.

1317
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:11,620
You have to bump at 88 miles per hour, which will create a time vortex.

1318
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:14,960
We'll send you back to the both vehicles hurtling vehicles,

1319
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:21,500
sending you flying through a sign that says back to the future once you ultimately do

1320
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:21,720
it.

1321
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,460
This is one of my other odd bones to pick about this ride.

1322
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:27,140
Why are you why do you burst through a scene?

1323
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:29,440
Why do you burst through a screen that says back to the future?

1324
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:35,900
Like the movie is not like the characters are not aware of the Back to the Future logo.

1325
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:40,360
No, you know, like why wouldn't it say Institute of Future Technology?

1326
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:41,180
Yeah, I don't know.

1327
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:41,980
That doesn't make any sense.

1328
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:42,960
I haven't seen anything.

1329
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:45,520
I was looking through that and I was like, there's no real explanation.

1330
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:49,900
Yeah, as much as it was very cool to fly through that logo because it's a badass logo.

1331
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:56,680
But anyway, the other thing I glossed over this, that this was the new plot added by

1332
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:57,120
Doug Trumbull.

1333
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:58,780
But do you guys know about the old plot?

1334
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:00,500
I saw a little bit about this.

1335
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:03,580
The old plot was that you were going over scenes from the movies.

1336
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:04,680
Is that right or no?

1337
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:06,860
I've heard several reports.

1338
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:07,720
There is that.

1339
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:08,900
This conflicting information.

1340
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:09,720
Yes, apparently.

1341
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:14,220
They considered a roller coaster very early on and they're like, oh shit, this goes too

1342
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:14,520
fast.

1343
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,340
He can't tell a story with a roller coaster.

1344
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:16,780
Uh huh.

1345
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:21,960
Nowadays, they've slowly started figuring out how to combine show scenes and roller coasters.

1346
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:23,540
And I think, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1347
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:27,240
You can like sort of stop a roller coaster car on a dime a little better.

1348
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:30,120
Things like The Mummy, you can actually have scenes in a roller coaster.

1349
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:31,160
But yeah, it wouldn't have.

1350
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:31,620
It would have.

1351
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:34,800
You would have just been passing by big arrows and clocks.

1352
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,260
What did you read?

1353
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:39,540
Because I read it was like you would kind of float, go over like different scenes from

1354
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:40,520
three movies.

1355
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:45,380
Apparently, and this is this is pretty this is validated by a little press release that

1356
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:50,160
was put out in the in the L.A. Times, among other things.

1357
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:51,920
These are things that would have happened in the ride.

1358
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:56,200
You'll catapult to Kitty Hawk for a run in with the Wright Brothers.

1359
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:59,940
Rocket to Venice for a brush with Da Vinci.

1360
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:02,500
Whoosh through Niagara Falls.

1361
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:06,440
These are things stated to who this is what would have.

1362
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,820
And I believe some of this stuff was filmed.

1363
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:11,460
I think this is what they were testing in Vancouver.

1364
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:13,100
And this is what was bugging people out.

1365
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:17,200
Well, you got the Wright Brothers in a kooky old plane flying left to right, flying all

1366
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:17,720
over the frame.

1367
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:19,820
And people like got sick trying to follow them.

1368
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:21,360
A couple of things on that.

1369
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:29,580
One, sort of similar to what would go in Soarin', like going through like or by giant waterfalls.

1370
01:05:30,020 --> 01:05:35,820
The other thing is like that is sort of much more along the lines of what we're talking

1371
01:05:35,820 --> 01:05:38,580
about in the queue and the pre-show stuff like.

1372
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:41,020
Meeting famous people through history.

1373
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:44,620
It makes more sense when you're looking at that pre-show material.

1374
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:45,520
Yeah, yeah.

1375
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:50,360
And it's also there's a weird I guess it's like Da Vinci and a flying machine and the

1376
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:55,440
Wright Brothers because they had to think of flying stuff to get a bunch of shit whizzing

1377
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:55,720
around.

1378
01:05:56,020 --> 01:06:00,440
But yeah, I think it was Doc Brown goes to stop Hitler or something like that.

1379
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,360
Brown and Biff stops him.

1380
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:04,640
Biff wants Hitler to succeed.

1381
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,100
Biff and Hitler are hanging out.

1382
01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:11,680
As a proponent of evil, he doesn't want to crush Hitler's legs with the DeLorean.

1383
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:13,760
Christopher Lloyd back in this.

1384
01:06:13,820 --> 01:06:16,420
Thomas F. Wilson who played Biff is back in it as well.

1385
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:17,680
Great as always.

1386
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:18,820
Very funny.

1387
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:19,300
He's fantastic.

1388
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:19,880
Yeah, yeah.

1389
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:21,240
He's really, really funny in this.

1390
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:23,400
Here, let me also show you.

1391
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:27,900
So this notion of this version of the ride also validated by this concept art.

1392
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:29,300
We'll post this on the Twitter.

1393
01:06:29,540 --> 01:06:31,540
This is from studiotour.com.

1394
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:32,960
Look at this crazy thing.

1395
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,960
You got flying machines.

1396
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:38,380
You got the DeLorean going down a waterfall.

1397
01:06:38,580 --> 01:06:42,300
You do have a dinosaur which ended up in the final ride and a pterodactyl.

1398
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:43,680
And there's another thing you can Google.

1399
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:45,300
They built this pterodactyl.

1400
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:51,280
You can buy a pterodactyl used in an unused version of the B.T.G.F.

1401
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,060
And you've also got, look up here.

1402
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:55,020
Here's another bizarre thing.

1403
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:56,680
A Blade Runner kind of cityscape?

1404
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:57,160
Yes.

1405
01:06:57,820 --> 01:07:02,940
You've got some future building that looks like my favorite building in the world.

1406
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:04,780
The Westin Bonaventure downtown.

1407
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:09,380
This amazing like pod building with all with rotating restaurants at the top.

1408
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:10,480
It looks exactly like that.

1409
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:13,060
And there's a bunch of weird blimps flying around.

1410
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:14,720
Yes, I read about the blimps.

1411
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,400
Oh, I read about the blimps.

1412
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:16,840
Yes.

1413
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:21,220
There was some sort of preoccupation with blimps in an original version of this ride.

1414
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:22,000
Uh huh.

1415
01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:23,860
And no one knows why or do you know why?

1416
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:24,540
I don't know.

1417
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:25,080
Don't know why.

1418
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:26,960
They're flying things.

1419
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:27,600
Might as well put them on their head.

1420
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:28,760
I think they noted in here.

1421
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:34,720
That is a go-to trope I feel like for like a world similar to ours but not quite.

1422
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:40,900
Most versions of Gotham City in Batman comics or movies or TV shows there's a bunch of fucking

1423
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:42,480
blimps floating around.

1424
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:48,040
Even, like I said, Blade Runner, not quite blimps but there's like some weird floating

1425
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:49,660
shit about this city.

1426
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:53,700
Also in the music video for the Spice Girls spice up your life.

1427
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:54,600
Yeah.

1428
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:56,140
There's a bunch of big blimps flying around.

1429
01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:01,060
The Spice Girls also into futuristic aerial technology.

1430
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:04,820
Sky captain in the world of tomorrow, a much maligned movie that I saw in theaters and

1431
01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:05,240
enjoyed.

1432
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:05,700
Hey.

1433
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:05,980
Huh.

1434
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:06,480
It's not it.

1435
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:07,080
Indiana Jones.

1436
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:07,620
A decent ride.

1437
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:08,020
Yeah.

1438
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:09,200
Three there's a blimp.

1439
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:11,300
But that's a historical blimp.

1440
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:11,760
Oh yeah.

1441
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:12,000
Exactly.

1442
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:13,320
It's a blimp of the...

1443
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:15,540
I guess it's not really a blimp then it's a zeppelin.

1444
01:08:15,740 --> 01:08:16,100
A zeppelin.

1445
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:16,480
Yeah, yeah.

1446
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:19,900
But let me point out one more thing about this concept art and I hope on Twitter you

1447
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:23,080
can go to our Twitter as you're listening to this to see what we're talking about.

1448
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:27,880
But note one thing about this concept art doesn't Doc look bizarre?

1449
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:28,600
He looks like the joke.

1450
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:30,060
He looks like Jack Nicholson Joker to me.

1451
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:31,920
He looks like the...

1452
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,460
He looks like Beetlejuice.

1453
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:35,380
Like he looks like Beetlejuice.

1454
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:36,180
I feel like there's a...

1455
01:08:36,180 --> 01:08:39,380
He's got his arms widespread and evil glint in his eye.

1456
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:43,020
There's likely Beetlejuice in that brochure you were showing us earlier.

1457
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:43,560
Yeah, yeah.

1458
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:46,760
Which we can also take some pictures of and post on the Twitter.

1459
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:47,720
Tatter old...

1460
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:49,380
If you like tatter old brochure books.

1461
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:51,140
Tatter old marketing material.

1462
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:55,980
So this one is not as validated as what I found out about the Wright brothers and DaVinci

1463
01:08:55,980 --> 01:09:00,580
and all that, but according to Defunctland, a great video series about old theme park

1464
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:03,880
rides, this guy claims, and I couldn't find a second source, but this guy claims that

1465
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:07,100
this ride was supposed to have Doc Brown's evil twin brother.

1466
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:07,780
Yes, yes.

1467
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,020
I saw that too.

1468
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:10,100
And that was very...

1469
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:11,020
I would have loved that.

1470
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:14,720
That's another thing where like they're just making shit up about this universe.

1471
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:17,860
Because you know that would have been Christopher Lloyd just in a different wig.

1472
01:09:18,580 --> 01:09:19,860
Oh boy, that would have been something.

1473
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:21,780
Black jumpsuit, black wig.

1474
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:23,220
I...

1475
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:24,540
You're like crazy black hair.

1476
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:26,280
He'd look like Tim Burton.

1477
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:28,380
Just me and Tim Burton.

1478
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:31,140
He would look like his character in Roger Rabbit.

1479
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:32,680
Oh yeah.

1480
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:33,580
Oh, maybe no hair.

1481
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:36,200
Maybe that's the opposite of Doc Brown.

1482
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:37,020
Maybe you have no hair.

1483
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:38,340
You are not curious.

1484
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:40,780
Because you don't read.

1485
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,140
You're not into Jules Verne.

1486
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:43,060
Oh, he's a Luddite.

1487
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:44,940
He's some valid genius Luddite.

1488
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:46,740
He doesn't talk like this.

1489
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:50,260
Who is upset that his brother is so pro-technology.

1490
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:51,640
Right, that would have to be the case.

1491
01:09:51,940 --> 01:09:52,160
Sinful.

1492
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:54,900
So also Doc Brown's evil twin brother is religious.

1493
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:57,660
Yes, he is just a man of faith.

1494
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:58,720
He's about the Lord.

1495
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:01,020
And he thinks Doc Brown is playing God.

1496
01:10:01,820 --> 01:10:02,760
Yeah, and he wouldn't be wrong.

1497
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:06,660
I think you have to really to develop a villain, he would have to have some interesting points

1498
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:07,120
to make.

1499
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:08,560
And that would be fair to say.

1500
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:11,440
I think we go to Zemeckis with this idea, baby.

1501
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,980
I think this is how we get it back.

1502
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:18,160
Okay, so the Institute of Future Technology is up and running.

1503
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:22,420
Doc Brown is renowned all over the world, but he didn't count on one thing, his evil twin

1504
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:24,720
brother showing up.

1505
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:29,940
Presumably like be a horse and buggy getting to the Institute of Future Technology, messing

1506
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:30,540
up the whole thing.

1507
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:35,520
I think he's probably locked his evil brother away in some prison in time somewhere.

1508
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:37,460
And his brother's gotten out.

1509
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:40,920
So now he has a real bone to pick with his brother because he locked him away.

1510
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,980
Like the days of the plague or something.

1511
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:48,800
Put him in some weird dungeon and hoping that maybe he'd catch a little bubonic.

1512
01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:50,080
Or like a famous prison.

1513
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:51,460
What's the most famous prison?

1514
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:52,260
Uh, Alcatraz.

1515
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:54,120
It's the worst prison in all of time.

1516
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,920
Well, but I think you'd have to go back to whatever the...

1517
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,420
The countermonic Christo one on the island.

1518
01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:01,880
I hate to say it, but you're probably going back to slave times.

1519
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:04,780
I think slaves probably had the worst prisons.

1520
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:06,420
If you consider those prisons.

1521
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:14,580
I think maybe he'd like convinces a slave owner that his brother is on a...

1522
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:17,200
So you're saying he sells his evil brother to slavery?

1523
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:19,580
Doc sells his evil brother to a slave owner.

1524
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:20,780
Here's a dumb question.

1525
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:23,320
Is the Bastille a prison or a palace?

1526
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:24,360
That they...

1527
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:25,580
You snort the Bastille?

1528
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:27,420
I feel very dumb.

1529
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:28,720
If it was not at the theme park, right?

1530
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:29,480
It wasn't a theme park.

1531
01:11:29,860 --> 01:11:31,020
Irrelevant history to us.

1532
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:33,820
I think they left that out of Impressions de France.

1533
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:38,080
Lot of history ignored in World Showcase.

1534
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:39,920
I think we can make this now.

1535
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:46,940
Doc Brown, one day from retirement, about to hand off the Institute of Future Technology

1536
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:49,960
to his young protege, Donald Glover.

1537
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:51,640
All right.

1538
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:53,200
Very popular, right?

1539
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:54,100
Very hot right now.

1540
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:55,640
Big reboot guy right now.

1541
01:11:56,180 --> 01:12:03,060
And yeah, and then suddenly evil Doc Brown shows up, hidden away,

1542
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:06,500
like Rochester's first wife in Jane Eyre.

1543
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:07,600
That's right.

1544
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:10,340
You didn't expect me to drop a literature reference on the way.

1545
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:13,020
There wasn't a ride about Jane Eyre, was there?

1546
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:15,180
There's no Jane Eyre ride anywhere.

1547
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:17,420
It may be in Eiffeldling.

1548
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:20,180
Eiffeldling, get on that Jane Eyre ride.

1549
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,320
Straight from Jason's imagination.

1550
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:23,220
There's no Wuthering Heights.

1551
01:12:23,660 --> 01:12:25,740
The great novels are not represented in the theme parks.

1552
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:28,340
The Wuthering Heights, the spooky house from Wuthering Heights,

1553
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:30,220
does not show up at Halloween Horror Nights.

1554
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:31,780
That's a good idea though.

1555
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:36,100
Doc Brown's opposite would have to, well, I guess his last name is Brown,

1556
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:39,660
and he can't help that, but what color is the opposite of Brown?

1557
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:40,640
If you're looking at a color wheel.

1558
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:41,480
He could change his name though.

1559
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:43,440
Yeah, he could probably change his own.

1560
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:45,540
No, he doesn't want to be associated with the Brown family.

1561
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:47,840
Yeah, because it's not black and white, but Brown and...

1562
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:48,180
Yellow?

1563
01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:50,720
Doc Yellow?

1564
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,580
We have to look at a color wheel to figure this out.

1565
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:55,100
Whatever the opposite of Brown is.

1566
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:56,720
I would pitch Doc Gray.

1567
01:12:58,140 --> 01:13:01,760
It's not perfect opposite, but Dr. Gray is interesting.

1568
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,280
What's the opposite of being a doctor?

1569
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:06,920
Alderman?

1570
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:07,540
Professor?

1571
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:09,820
Maybe I'd just be Professor Brown.

1572
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:12,220
Yeah, Professor's too good though.

1573
01:13:12,460 --> 01:13:13,480
Pastor Gray?

1574
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:15,040
Oh, Pastor Gray.

1575
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:18,120
Doc Brown's evil twin brother, Professor Gray,

1576
01:13:18,820 --> 01:13:22,320
shows up, hopes that the power of Christ will...

1577
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:27,360
Imagine, what if he showed up when he first sent Marty back in time,

1578
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:31,260
tried to combat the power of the lightning bolt with the power of Christ?

1579
01:13:31,780 --> 01:13:36,320
And you're looking at like interdimensional Christ rays coming out of a cross,

1580
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:39,160
trying to push back that lightning bolt.

1581
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:41,400
So Christianity is now real in this, for sure.

1582
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:44,820
Like the Bible is real and the powers he has are real, I guess.

1583
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:46,200
I mean, that's fine.

1584
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:48,640
Well, I bet that could tie together to the end.

1585
01:13:48,820 --> 01:13:53,840
Maybe as a Hail Mary, Doc Brown and Donald Glover travel back in time,

1586
01:13:54,180 --> 01:14:00,060
bring Christ himself to present day to convince Pastor Gray

1587
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:02,200
the wrongs of his ways.

1588
01:14:02,420 --> 01:14:04,280
There's a reference in the first movie, I think he says,

1589
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:08,220
where you can go back to when Christ was, was he says born or does he say the crucifixion?

1590
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:09,280
Oh yeah, because he goes to Christmas.

1591
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:10,140
He goes to...

1592
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:10,780
No, no, he doesn't yet.

1593
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:12,060
Nobody's going to the crucifixion.

1594
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:13,800
We could go to the crucifixion, Marty.

1595
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:15,280
But maybe that's...

1596
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:15,560
Maybe that...

1597
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:16,420
What if...

1598
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:19,260
Although, would Pastor Gray use Doc...

1599
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:20,780
Would he be able to use Doc's technology?

1600
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,900
Maybe he wishes to Christ that,

1601
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:27,320
can I get my brother sent back to your crucifixion and get him crucified?

1602
01:14:28,020 --> 01:14:31,480
In lieu of Barabbas, Barabbas gets away.

1603
01:14:32,620 --> 01:14:34,840
My favorite biblical character, Barabbas.

1604
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:40,420
Do you choose this man, Jesus of Nazareth, or do you choose Dr. Emmett Brown?

1605
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:42,640
Dr. Brown.

1606
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:46,700
The more we talk about this, the more there should have been 10 Back to the Future movies,

1607
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:47,980
where they go everywhere.

1608
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:49,080
Well, we're not...

1609
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:51,120
Maybe we don't object to there being more movies.

1610
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:52,780
We object to them not being done by us.

1611
01:14:52,980 --> 01:14:53,620
That's fair.

1612
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:54,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1613
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:54,700
That's good.

1614
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:58,300
I did just see today the headline, and I read no further.

1615
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:03,540
Mel Gibson set up to make Passion of Christ secret with original...

1616
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:06,800
I think with Kavizel back as Christ, which is...

1617
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:07,680
Kavizel is back.

1618
01:15:08,060 --> 01:15:08,180
Wild.

1619
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:10,280
Again, a wild day.

1620
01:15:11,620 --> 01:15:13,720
So maybe this happens in that movie.

1621
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:15,520
Maybe they're already on top of this.

1622
01:15:15,620 --> 01:15:16,340
You would need Kavizel.

1623
01:15:16,340 --> 01:15:17,280
Jesus traveling to the future.

1624
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:18,680
Pastor Gray.

1625
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:20,120
Pastor Gray.

1626
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:20,800
Pastor Gray.

1627
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:24,660
Finally, the Back to the Passion verse.

1628
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:31,680
All right, well, that's a pretty bold expansion of the universe.

1629
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:34,260
But later, let's get back to this one that was actually...

1630
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:35,580
Let's get back to some more dry facts.

1631
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:36,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1632
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:40,480
Let's get back into God's light, where we have strayed so far from it.

1633
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:43,360
So the Omnimax screens are...

1634
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:45,560
I do have some dry facts that I wrote down.

1635
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:48,700
Well, this actually is in fact...

1636
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:53,060
Douglas Trumbull, I was watching an interview with him talking about the ride,

1637
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:58,260
and he was upset that the ride was not 48 frames per second,

1638
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:02,880
and he was upset that the screen was not brighter, which is up until apparently

1639
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:08,220
like a month or two ago, the screen remained at this dull level of bright.

1640
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,240
It was not that bright.

1641
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:10,300
It's noticeable in The Simpsons.

1642
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:11,460
Simpsons didn't look great.

1643
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:12,840
This thing was not bright enough.

1644
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:17,480
Apparently, we have not been to Universal Studios out here yet,

1645
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:22,140
but they have brightened the screens finally after 20 long years.

1646
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:27,000
But this was a problem that Douglas identified back then.

1647
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,260
He knew that this thing was not bright enough,

1648
01:16:29,260 --> 01:16:32,120
because when you're projecting this much up on these giant screens,

1649
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:33,540
you need it to be very bright.

1650
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:37,700
Like that's what the mark of a good IMAX screen is, that it's bright and giant.

1651
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:41,420
Well, and these screen rides, you gotta replace the screen so often.

1652
01:16:41,860 --> 01:16:43,180
You gotta replace the screens.

1653
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:47,940
I feel like in the past, a lot of the parks have let the screens go too long.

1654
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:50,720
They get literal holes.

1655
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:53,960
I think the future was running with creases towards the end.

1656
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:57,380
Which is the kind of thing where you can't be too sad when a ride is retired,

1657
01:16:57,420 --> 01:17:00,180
because you know the new ride will be improved technologically.

1658
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:02,020
You know what's the weird thing about this ride too?

1659
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:04,480
The speakers are all behind the screen.

1660
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:07,400
A giant wall of speakers blasting at you.

1661
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:07,860
It is loud.

1662
01:17:07,860 --> 01:17:09,840
So the screen is porous.

1663
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:12,940
There's little holes all over the screen that you can't really see.

1664
01:17:13,820 --> 01:17:19,540
And in addition to Biff and Doc are talking to you inside your DeLorean.

1665
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:20,680
Is it just like stacks?

1666
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:27,200
Does it look like when you see an 80s heavy metal band with stacks of speakers on top?

1667
01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:31,320
Yeah, it's like a cartoon fantasy of a concert.

1668
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:34,660
Like that a demonic rock devil would have.

1669
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:36,340
I bet it's something like that.

1670
01:17:36,580 --> 01:17:40,140
These screens are, if you've not been on either of these rides, if that's somehow possible,

1671
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:41,260
yeah they are giants.

1672
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:42,300
Seven stories.

1673
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:48,620
When you go on the Simpsons ride you hear a gasp when you actually get up to the top

1674
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:53,680
of the fake roller coaster ladder that you're climbing on that Simpsons roller coaster.

1675
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:56,340
And yeah it's pretty jaw-dropping.

1676
01:17:56,740 --> 01:18:02,460
And really fun how they do it, how they transition you seamlessly using smoke and fog machines.

1677
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,300
And then suddenly you're in it.

1678
01:18:04,860 --> 01:18:09,480
I'm sure as a kid you're like, I can't believe how I had no idea this thing was gonna be this huge.

1679
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:13,820
I have some dry facts that I think are interesting.

1680
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:15,280
The drier the better, Jason.

1681
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:24,980
So both of these Anaheim, or not Anaheim, California and Florida, both were like delayed,

1682
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:28,260
both like were delayed in opening.

1683
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:31,480
Like the building of both of these took so long.

1684
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:37,100
Florida costs 40 million dollars, which is the same amount as the budget for Back to the Future 2.

1685
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:42,160
California costs 60 million dollars because they had so many issues with the foundation.

1686
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:45,760
Now there's a couple things going with both of these buildings.

1687
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:50,580
One, when you're building in Orlando you are building on swampland and you have to deal with that.

1688
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:56,900
In California this building is for one built into the side of a mountain.

1689
01:18:57,140 --> 01:18:58,740
It's a very odd shaped building.

1690
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:02,960
It's built like on top of this universal city, mountain.

1691
01:19:02,980 --> 01:19:07,460
The other thing is when you build huge buildings in California there are rollers

1692
01:19:07,460 --> 01:19:12,360
underneath in the event of an earthquake to allow for the building to shift a little.

1693
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:18,060
Any skyscrapers or any buildings of a certain height, there's rollers underneath so the building

1694
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:23,540
can move a few feet without the foundation just getting totally fucked.

1695
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:28,420
The California one costs 60 million, even more than the Florida one.

1696
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:29,460
They messed up the foundation.

1697
01:19:29,620 --> 01:19:31,320
They started building it and the foundation was off.

1698
01:19:31,420 --> 01:19:32,120
I think that's right.

1699
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:33,280
That's really crazy.

1700
01:19:33,380 --> 01:19:36,960
I think we've gotten a lot of emails too and thanks for talking about this because people

1701
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:41,180
have been asking when are you guys going to talk more about the foundations of these rides?

1702
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:42,400
I think it's interesting.

1703
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:44,420
The potential for earthquake damage.

1704
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:52,700
It is kind of crazy that both of these theme parks thankfully survived the pretty intact

1705
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:55,420
in the California earthquake of 1994.

1706
01:19:56,020 --> 01:20:00,060
Pretty crazy that there wasn't, you know, how horrifying if the castle cracked apart or whatever.

1707
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:00,900
Oh god.

1708
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:05,700
Well this is a whole side note but I mean there's videos of people, I don't know why this is

1709
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:11,160
a thing that happens I guess, but people have like, what does the park look like after the

1710
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:11,540
apocalypse?

1711
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:13,580
What does it look like after?

1712
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:15,540
Oh people make that in video game simulators.

1713
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:20,080
CGI, sort of like what does it look like when no one lives on earth anymore?

1714
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:23,220
Like what have done the land is taken over back by mother nature.

1715
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:26,760
Need I remind you Biff is our president.

1716
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:30,300
This is not something we should be letting our minds watch.

1717
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:31,760
Yeah because this is very possible.

1718
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:42,140
And then there are videos of Disney ripoff parks that nature has taken back.

1719
01:20:43,060 --> 01:20:45,840
Yeah and there's a couple different ones.

1720
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:46,600
We should post some of these.

1721
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:48,520
There's one in Japan, there's one in China.

1722
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:53,020
Yeah and they have like Main Street that's very familiar and like a castle at the end

1723
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:58,340
and it's just like plants and grass that's as tall as your head and then there's like

1724
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:01,580
backpack douchebag who snuck in.

1725
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:05,400
He's like oh my god I can't believe I'm here, I'm here finally here, this is so crazy,

1726
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:09,360
I can't believe it and then you're like just turn it on mute and then you watch the creepiest

1727
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:09,800
image.

1728
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:11,120
Put your own soundtrack too.

1729
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:11,860
Yeah yeah yeah.

1730
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:18,860
There's a great photographer too who publishes these massive photo books of abandoned places

1731
01:21:18,860 --> 01:21:24,880
and there are enough abandoned theme parks that he has a book of just abandoned amusement

1732
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:25,760
parks and stuff.

1733
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:29,100
I think he usually gets permission because he's got a pretty...

1734
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:29,640
That's a good idea.

1735
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:30,960
We should probably do that.

1736
01:21:31,060 --> 01:21:34,300
That's probably a good episode now that I'm thinking about abandoned parks.

1737
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:36,480
Well yeah someone wrote in.

1738
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:38,160
Maybe Halloween, maybe that's the spooky episode.

1739
01:21:39,340 --> 01:21:43,160
There was one that was pretty much, it was not doing well.

1740
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:48,060
There was I believe it eventually had, it was a Six Flags I think when it occurred but

1741
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:52,840
there was one that got hit by Katrina and it was just left to rot pretty much.

1742
01:21:52,860 --> 01:21:55,660
Yes and that one, there's many videos of that and it's...

1743
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:56,780
It's terrifying.

1744
01:21:57,540 --> 01:21:59,500
It could have been where Disney World was built apparently.

1745
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:02,220
That was a spot looked at as a spot.

1746
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:03,020
Oh yeah.

1747
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:04,940
Disney World could have been wiped out in Katrina.

1748
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:05,560
Jesus.

1749
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:06,540
Jesus Christ.

1750
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:11,920
Yeah I mean I don't think the local governments handled it well either supposedly.

1751
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:16,400
Someone either emailed or tweeted us about like yeah you guys should check that out because

1752
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:21,580
it's a fascinating story about that park and how it was already kind of mismanaged and

1753
01:22:21,580 --> 01:22:23,420
then it was just pretty much just submerged.

1754
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:24,180
Left for dead.

1755
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:30,820
Can I also say that this brochure that I keep referring to in the earthquake section, I

1756
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:34,900
was struck by the headline Florida's most devastating ride.

1757
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:37,980
That's a little grim.

1758
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:42,180
That earthquake thing always hit a little too close to home I'll tell you.

1759
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:43,780
Kid in that earthquake.

1760
01:22:43,980 --> 01:22:45,060
Yeah you survived.

1761
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:47,980
You did survive 1994 out here.

1762
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:49,700
My own 1994 the ride.

1763
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:54,660
Okay what have we not covered in the in the in the drive.

1764
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:57,040
Let's do a little bit more of the ride itself.

1765
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:59,740
So like the video like the first part you go through the future.

1766
01:23:00,020 --> 01:23:06,020
It's Hilldale in the future and there's like some fun big neon signs and I noticed

1767
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:10,820
that there's a lot of their idea the future is that there are like translucent tubes connecting

1768
01:23:10,820 --> 01:23:11,540
buildings.

1769
01:23:11,580 --> 01:23:13,040
That's a big feature of them.

1770
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:14,600
Like give me some tube bridges baby.

1771
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:15,580
I love that.

1772
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:17,000
Yeah I love that.

1773
01:23:17,940 --> 01:23:25,040
There's there's another crazy thing in the in dry fact world that the okay so you're

1774
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:29,700
shooting on these fisheye cameras where you have a view all directions around you where

1775
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:30,540
do you put lights.

1776
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:35,020
It is impossible to light this ride because it would be in frame and sure you could today

1777
01:23:35,020 --> 01:23:38,980
digitally erase the lights but they didn't have they were worried they literally couldn't

1778
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:44,220
find an optical printer that would allow them to do effects so that so all the lights had

1779
01:23:44,220 --> 01:23:48,360
to be hidden which is why when you're in that zone in the tube zone there's lights

1780
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:54,360
in those tubes there's lights in the building there's lights on Biff's car so so all of

1781
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:59,580
the light in this ride is on camera and it's also true in the ice section like all the

1782
01:23:59,580 --> 01:24:06,620
lights are behind the ice and then and in the and in the lava section as well like the

1783
01:24:06,620 --> 01:24:09,660
lava is being like the lava is real liquid.

1784
01:24:09,660 --> 01:24:14,420
That's a bizarre thing that is being cycled right a big tank and it's being blasted with

1785
01:24:14,420 --> 01:24:18,800
like orange light underneath so when you when you look at this ride through you are seeing

1786
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:22,240
all of the lights it is all those all on camera because they couldn't hide them.

1787
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:28,400
Yeah I remember at the the commercial for Universal Studios all I think always the dinosaur

1788
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:33,120
was the last thing maybe in this one a lot of those spots yeah like that was the big

1789
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:37,200
when the dinosaur like tries to eat the door or the big things presented as like a reason

1790
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:38,640
to come to Universal Florida.

1791
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:44,240
Funny enough then when Jurassic Park ride was built also the big thing is the feature

1792
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:46,300
is that there's a T-Rex trying to eat you.

1793
01:24:46,380 --> 01:24:47,780
But a very different T-Rex.

1794
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:52,100
That started to become weird I think the ride started feeling a little weird after Jurassic

1795
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:56,280
Park was open because it was so clearly not a correct T-Rex.

1796
01:24:56,740 --> 01:25:01,080
The T-Rex is definitely silly in Back to the Future the ride but I like he's a he's kind

1797
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:03,940
of lovable he's yes he has he's a dummy he's like a dog.

1798
01:25:03,940 --> 01:25:07,960
He's a weird T-Rex but he's not he's a wacky T-Rex.

1799
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:08,400
Yeah yeah.

1800
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:14,420
Not the vicious killer that the T-Rex is on Jurassic the dignified yeah no yeah you're

1801
01:25:14,420 --> 01:25:16,420
right he was that one is much more killer.

1802
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:18,080
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

1803
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:24,460
Universal responsible for one of the most canny marketing moves partnering with Nickelodeon

1804
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:29,740
all of those live Nickelodeon shows that were shot in Florida would have the end card shot

1805
01:25:29,740 --> 01:25:35,280
on location at Universal Studios Florida with the big neon logo and sometimes footage

1806
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:41,340
of like rides and stuff and I'm just thinking back to that now I was like oh that's probably

1807
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:45,420
why I was always like we're doing a day at Universal right if we're doing we're going

1808
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:49,160
to Florida it was just ubiquitous and Nickelodeon reigned in my mind.

1809
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:53,700
Propaganda got to me yeah and seeing at the end that at the end of every single Nickelodeon

1810
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:57,080
show that it was filmed live at Universal Studios Florida.

1811
01:25:57,640 --> 01:26:02,740
And one of the first times I was ever wow this seems so dumb in retrospect but I remember

1812
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:06,660
you used to be able to take a walking tour of the Universal the Nickelodeon production

1813
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:13,740
facilities in Orlando and at one point they had a giant room with mood lighting and behind

1814
01:26:13,740 --> 01:26:19,380
glass was the orange couch from SNCC the SNCC programming block and as a kid I was just

1815
01:26:19,380 --> 01:26:22,460
like holy cow there's the couch.

1816
01:26:22,740 --> 01:26:25,100
As a kid you dreamed of napping on that couch.

1817
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:30,040
There was no couch you wanted to nap on more.

1818
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:33,700
Being a lazy dog rubbing your back on the famous SNCC couch.

1819
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:37,600
Yeah but I did not want to participate in the live show at the end where you could get

1820
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:41,820
slimed I was like I don't want to get slimed these are my nice clothes I don't what will

1821
01:26:41,820 --> 01:26:47,180
happen what is this I'm made of I am a scared nice little boy and they they're like parents

1822
01:26:47,180 --> 01:26:52,100
sit on these bleachers kids sit in these bleachers and I was like what is this like.

1823
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:54,240
Where is the non-splash zone?

1824
01:26:55,920 --> 01:27:02,180
I a big a big thing is that I never went to the Nickelodeon studios as a child and I am

1825
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:08,200
still upset about it I wish I regret it I mean it's not my fault because we we didn't

1826
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:12,860
go we just didn't go so it's not my fault it's my parents fault even though I was the

1827
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:14,060
biggest Nickelodeon fan.

1828
01:27:14,060 --> 01:27:15,820
I was legitimately more than full as you.

1829
01:27:16,300 --> 01:27:20,520
I understand why no Nickelodeon studios no alien encounter.

1830
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:22,640
This explains so much.

1831
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:24,300
These holes.

1832
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:25,180
Things I would.

1833
01:27:25,860 --> 01:27:27,200
Next time at the therapist.

1834
01:27:28,580 --> 01:27:30,220
I think we all just had a breakthrough.

1835
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:36,080
You know also the one cool thing about this ride being open at Universal Studios is you

1836
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:43,080
ended up with a Doc Brown walk around character and he would factor into totally unrelated

1837
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:50,400
things such as the opening of the I'm sorry the burial of the Nick time capsule in 1992

1838
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:54,240
which is an event I know all about large to me as a child.

1839
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:59,960
All about time I've been there I went to I like I had to go like have a moment like even

1840
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:05,520
you know like when I went you know five years ago I had to go stare at the spot where the

1841
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:10,600
where the time capsule was buried although the time capsule has moved it moves to a Nickelodeon

1842
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:13,620
themed hotel right elsewhere in Orlando.

1843
01:28:13,700 --> 01:28:15,480
When is that getting open 2020?

1844
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:20,140
I think it was a 50-year time capsule so I think we're talking 2042 and I remember doing

1845
01:28:20,140 --> 01:28:25,760
the math as a kid and thinking like how will I be alive how old will I be 112 how.

1846
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:30,000
I like that you were going to pay your respects like it was a World War II memorial.

1847
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:36,660
To me again we don't know real history but I do know where the cover of Disney adventures

1848
01:28:36,660 --> 01:28:37,760
with Macaulay Culkin.

1849
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,100
There's an original Game Boy I think in there.

1850
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:41,160
Yeah yeah that's right.

1851
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:43,540
It might be like some gak some Nickelodeon gak.

1852
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:50,120
I think my elementary school buried our own time capsule on school property inspired by

1853
01:28:50,620 --> 01:28:51,100
this.

1854
01:28:50,980 --> 01:28:51,580
Really?

1855
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:57,560
I'm just remembering now that my elementary school was demolished and they rebuilt it

1856
01:28:57,560 --> 01:29:03,060
right next to it so that time capsule might be under some rubble or under the current

1857
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:03,500
building.

1858
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:04,620
I wonder what happened to that.

1859
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:07,760
I think when you're back home you should get the old shovel out and see if you can take

1860
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:10,120
that and then sell what's ever in there for a little cab.

1861
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:11,580
I just show up right?

1862
01:29:11,740 --> 01:29:16,520
I don't need to tell them I'm coming they'll know why a 32-year-old man is on his elementary

1863
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:18,040
school property with a shovel.

1864
01:29:18,460 --> 01:29:19,500
Dark of night is what I'm saying.

1865
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:20,560
Don't do it.

1866
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:21,620
Don't let them know you're coming.

1867
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:22,500
Well you know I'm out.

1868
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:23,800
I'm out pretty early.

1869
01:29:23,860 --> 01:29:24,560
That's a good point.

1870
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:25,040
Obviously.

1871
01:29:25,660 --> 01:29:26,180
That's a good point.

1872
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:27,340
When night falls.

1873
01:29:27,740 --> 01:29:30,400
Start of a magical coming of age story though.

1874
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:31,920
That's true.

1875
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:35,580
A man returns to the childhood the school he left behind.

1876
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:38,640
It's a Book of Henry style heartwarming tale.

1877
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:42,580
Anyway that yeah Doc Brown I think helped.

1878
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:47,460
There were a lot of Doc Brown's running around at Universal and always like didn't look like

1879
01:29:47,460 --> 01:29:48,420
Christopher Lloyd didn't really.

1880
01:29:48,420 --> 01:29:50,160
Yeah yeah yeah it was weird.

1881
01:29:50,900 --> 01:29:54,900
Even they shut down the ride and Christopher Lloyd the real Christopher Lloyd went and

1882
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:58,180
like like said goodbye next to a very broad.

1883
01:29:58,940 --> 01:30:02,640
Great Scott like a horrible Doc Brown impersonator.

1884
01:30:03,420 --> 01:30:07,620
The thing I don't know maybe this is another episode but the thing I would like to talk

1885
01:30:07,620 --> 01:30:13,040
about the last thing I want to talk about is the the restaurant in front of Back to the Future

1886
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:14,300
in Hollywood.

1887
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:16,760
Doc Brown's chicken.

1888
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:18,420
Fried chicken fried chicken.

1889
01:30:18,660 --> 01:30:19,780
Sorry yeah.

1890
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:27,880
Yes supposedly I never ate there supposedly so delicious and widely liked that chicken.

1891
01:30:28,100 --> 01:30:30,660
Well they kept the recipe crusty.

1892
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:36,080
It is now changed into Cletus's the Simpsons character Cletus has a chicken shack and it's

1893
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:37,920
the same theory recipe.

1894
01:30:38,820 --> 01:30:44,080
Apparently chicken was served in that spot for years before this.

1895
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:46,360
There was like it was a different restaurant.

1896
01:30:46,380 --> 01:30:47,580
Mrs. Knott's.

1897
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:51,660
It was like a sort of a Mrs. Knott's style chicken restaurant or whatever.

1898
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:52,440
I'm not I should.

1899
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:57,120
Again you know it's a universal thing you go to a theme park in the middle of the summer

1900
01:30:57,120 --> 01:31:05,080
lunchtime comes around I want three pieces of dark meat two sides and a biscuit.

1901
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:09,820
Hot crackling oil hot crackling oils delicious chicken gravy.

1902
01:31:10,740 --> 01:31:16,180
The the ride itself doc doc for some reason opening up a chicken restaurant doesn't

1903
01:31:16,180 --> 01:31:17,400
make any sense.

1904
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:23,300
But then what was funny or made me laugh I guess maybe it was just me was that the Simpsons

1905
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:27,260
right then was open and then this lasted for a few years.

1906
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:32,660
So independent of any other Back to the Future thing just Doc Brown had a chicken restaurant

1907
01:31:32,660 --> 01:31:38,480
and if you came this was the first time boy were you confused why this is even here if

1908
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:40,660
you didn't know that that used to be a Back to the Future right.

1909
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:47,740
Also a few like 10 20 feet away from that was the shark from Jaws with the hanging the

1910
01:31:47,740 --> 01:31:50,040
dead shark from Jaws hanging upside down.

1911
01:31:50,060 --> 01:31:55,420
But at least you knew he died the Jaws died in the movie and you go oh yeah sure that's

1912
01:31:55,420 --> 01:31:59,200
what happened to Jaws after the movie you walk over to this and you're like when did

1913
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:00,960
he open a chicken?

1914
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:05,280
Doc Brown independent but elsewhere at City Walk you have Bubba Gumps.

1915
01:32:05,740 --> 01:32:10,600
Right which make again makes sense when you're talking about the movies this one I'm saying

1916
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:12,620
like Doc doesn't go because it's in the movie.

1917
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:15,320
It's in the movie.

1918
01:32:15,460 --> 01:32:16,280
That's what I'm trying to say.

1919
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:18,020
Nothing canonically amazing.

1920
01:32:18,260 --> 01:32:21,360
Right he doesn't have like he loves chicken or something there's not a scene where he's

1921
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:25,260
like he's like we gotta make a stop and then they go to like KFC or something.

1922
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:31,440
I think I can justify this I believe that at some point with all these inventions he

1923
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:36,100
probably would have gotten around to or maybe someone did it for him filing at least one

1924
01:32:36,580 --> 01:32:42,260
patent which was used in something that was successful so he would get you know rights

1925
01:32:42,260 --> 01:32:49,120
or residuals or whatever and invested it in a business because you know the restaurant

1926
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:53,000
business while margins are small people do like fried chicken.

1927
01:32:53,380 --> 01:32:53,960
Keep going.

1928
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:57,500
You're 10 percent of the way through this explanation I think.

1929
01:32:58,220 --> 01:33:01,480
He always had a passion for the restaurant and maybe he just wanted to see what it was

1930
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:07,020
like he had conquered so many inventions but he had never opened a small business restaurant.

1931
01:33:07,420 --> 01:33:12,100
That concise explanation really helped me when I was in line to buy some fried chicken

1932
01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:12,780
at his restaurant.

1933
01:33:12,980 --> 01:33:17,460
I think we're in a timeline where he as we've established we think that maybe Doc steals

1934
01:33:17,460 --> 01:33:18,700
inventions from other people.

1935
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:19,740
Yeah he's a bad man.

1936
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:24,500
I think he went back and stole the Colonel's recipe.

1937
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:25,940
Yes that's great.

1938
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:30,640
I think he we're in a timeline where the where Doc Brown has replaced the Colonel in terms

1939
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:33,760
of pop culture because they're similar.

1940
01:33:34,120 --> 01:33:36,660
Shock a white hair they dress all in white.

1941
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:37,160
That's true.

1942
01:33:37,420 --> 01:33:42,680
So yeah there is no Colonel when you're inside Universal Studios there's no Colonel right

1943
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:45,860
where Doc Brown has replaced him and erased him from history.

1944
01:33:46,180 --> 01:33:46,240
Wow.

1945
01:33:46,460 --> 01:33:47,940
I'm going to go one step further.

1946
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:48,720
Okay go ahead.

1947
01:33:49,700 --> 01:33:52,180
In our new movie with Doc Brown's evil brother.

1948
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:52,620
Yeah yeah.

1949
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:56,100
Doc Brown's protege played by Don McGlover.

1950
01:33:56,540 --> 01:34:03,160
Doc Brown in when he retires is is finally devoting his time to his passion project.

1951
01:34:03,380 --> 01:34:07,260
Doc Brown's fried chicken which is next to the.

1952
01:34:07,660 --> 01:34:12,680
So that makes it so so your pitch for the movie is that he's done with time travel and

1953
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:14,200
he's just all about chicken now.

1954
01:34:14,740 --> 01:34:20,960
Well I think that's when when Gray comes back is at the retirement ceremony or party for

1955
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:26,080
Doc Brown Pastor Gray blows up the chicken restaurant and that's his big entrance.

1956
01:34:26,120 --> 01:34:27,580
That's his big thatos like entrance.

1957
01:34:27,580 --> 01:34:32,280
Well they blew up the chicken man in Hilldale last night.

1958
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:36,180
But he would but he would have had to do it with some with a like an old-fashioned bomb

1959
01:34:36,180 --> 01:34:38,080
no electronics involved in that bomb.

1960
01:34:38,220 --> 01:34:44,760
No we're talking a big circular black sphere with a long fuse coming out of it.

1961
01:34:44,900 --> 01:34:49,580
If this is in the same Universal world where as Snidely Whiplash perhaps he could have

1962
01:34:49,580 --> 01:34:51,520
borrowed it from from Snidely Whiplash.

1963
01:34:51,820 --> 01:34:56,500
Yeah or maybe one of the dastardly villains from a million ways to die in the west.

1964
01:34:57,480 --> 01:35:00,940
I'll be honest this is sounding less fun to me now by the end.

1965
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:02,220
The movie?

1966
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:07,300
Oh come on properties interacting with a DeLorean at the center it's a ready player one.

1967
01:35:07,540 --> 01:35:10,420
We're all we're together pitching ready player one two.

1968
01:35:10,860 --> 01:35:14,100
Okay fine here let me throw some in so I'm so I like it again.

1969
01:35:15,140 --> 01:35:20,620
The Lockhards, the comic strip Love Is and then Andy Cap is also involved.

1970
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:22,840
Oh great oh finally closure.

1971
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:25,380
Those characters are all in and I'm back.

1972
01:35:25,900 --> 01:35:29,900
If they can they all well they all of them together could fit into an eight person DeLorean.

1973
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:30,620
That's true yeah.

1974
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:34,640
That's how you get them all you collect them through whatever time and places they're all in.

1975
01:35:35,780 --> 01:35:40,760
I feel like we may have missed massive swaths of what the actual ride is.

1976
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:44,480
We talked about the ride a lot less than everything else.

1977
01:35:44,940 --> 01:35:49,820
Yeah but I don't know if you're listening to this you probably you know if you want to just watch

1978
01:35:49,820 --> 01:35:54,840
the ride you could do that but if you want to hear a lot of tangents mixed with dry facts that's what

1979
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:57,280
you come to podcast the ride for and I think we delivered.

1980
01:35:57,660 --> 01:35:58,540
Oh yeah for sure.

1981
01:35:59,020 --> 01:36:05,620
So that being said well do we do do we review this as a is it a keep it as is?

1982
01:36:05,620 --> 01:36:11,260
Burn it to the ground for insurance money even though it is gone if it were still there do is

1983
01:36:11,260 --> 01:36:13,220
there anything that we would want to change or improve?

1984
01:36:14,380 --> 01:36:15,680
Yeah I would we can do that.

1985
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:17,200
I'm gonna go first.

1986
01:36:17,780 --> 01:36:24,480
If it were 2018 and this ride was open right now what would I want to do to it?

1987
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:27,080
Would it be keep it perfectly as is?

1988
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:29,160
Would I want to plus it up or I want to demolish it?

1989
01:36:29,740 --> 01:36:32,220
I'm gonna say demolish it.

1990
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:35,320
I'm gonna say knock it down.

1991
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:42,380
Because here's why here's why because the ride is a classic it's great I love it but I think it's

1992
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:47,580
too outdated and I think then the ride system sort of holds it back because if they were going to

1993
01:36:47,580 --> 01:36:53,980
truly plus it up to the point of making it a new Back to the Future they'd have to make a big CGI

1994
01:36:53,980 --> 01:36:58,560
Back to the Future video that's because they're not going to do it the old way they're not going

1995
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:01,320
to make practical model stuff so.

1996
01:37:01,580 --> 01:37:02,720
It sounds like such a pain in the ass.

1997
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:06,180
Much a pain in the ass there's no way they would do it even in my blue sky I won't even

1998
01:37:06,180 --> 01:37:08,700
consider it in a blue sky fantasy.

1999
01:37:09,140 --> 01:37:11,000
Sorry Doug Trumbull we're doing it different this time.

2000
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:15,240
Yeah it would be CGI and that would be a lot less fun and sort of not in the spirit of

2001
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:20,480
the original movies I feel so I just I think this is the first time I've ever said this about any

2002
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:32,700
ride I think demolish it again if I have to do something and then build a totally new Back to

2003
01:37:32,780 --> 01:37:33,740
the Future.

2004
01:37:33,740 --> 01:37:38,360
I don't think I think that's possible still especially when we're talking about maybe a third

2005
01:37:38,360 --> 01:37:43,540
park in Universal in Florida this is something that's still obviously culturally very relevant

2006
01:37:43,540 --> 01:37:48,560
and there's somebody put some sort of I don't know if this was just sort of fan art but somebody put

2007
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:54,860
some some idea for a Back to the Future coaster a newer one and they're like a DeLorean sort of

2008
01:37:54,860 --> 01:37:59,960
a car and then you know you load into it and two and there would be show scenes so like I feel

2009
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:03,880
I feel like demolish the thing and then build a new Back to the Future ride.

2010
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:08,700
Using technology using Harry Potter level technology top of the line boy that would be.

2011
01:38:08,980 --> 01:38:15,000
Show scenes going back to the going to the future because because to actually go to that fake future

2012
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:20,880
and I mean I guess you could maybe push it to like 2030 or something so it's not such a weird thing

2013
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:22,640
that we're going three years in the past.

2014
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:23,840
Going backwards yes.

2015
01:38:24,380 --> 01:38:25,500
That wouldn't really make sense.

2016
01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:29,820
But yeah yeah retcon it so it's like a 30 year everything's 30 years difference.

2017
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:35,540
One of my thoughts is if I want to see some of those characters that I love so much.

2018
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:35,700
Yes.

2019
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:40,560
That like in the way that you in The Simpsons ride you're like narrowly avoiding some of your

2020
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:46,160
favorite Simpsons characters so I want to see Fujitsu-san, Mario's mean boss in the future.

2021
01:38:46,700 --> 01:38:48,600
I want to see Marlene McFly.

2022
01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:49,180
Yes.

2023
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:52,840
On a shopping excursion you know.

2024
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:53,800
Goldie Wilson.

2025
01:38:54,340 --> 01:38:59,640
Yeah yeah yeah what's Mayor and his son who does hover conversions.

2026
01:38:59,860 --> 01:39:00,660
He's around.

2027
01:39:01,120 --> 01:39:03,000
I want to and I most of all I want to see Needles.

2028
01:39:03,180 --> 01:39:04,040
We all want to see Needles.

2029
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:09,040
When you said I want to see characters Needles first Needles is the first name that popped into

2030
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:09,360
my head.

2031
01:39:09,580 --> 01:39:15,460
Please character who convinces Marty to do some confusing deal via facts in the future.

2032
01:39:15,700 --> 01:39:20,540
This bizarre god why is that scene so I don't know why in my head for it's so strange you don't

2033
01:39:20,540 --> 01:39:24,960
really know what he's talking about the gits will never find out what what is the plan.

2034
01:39:25,220 --> 01:39:28,660
You also don't find out what Marty Junior's plan is with Griff.

2035
01:39:28,780 --> 01:39:31,360
He's pulling some scheme and they never tell you what that is.

2036
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:31,640
Yeah.

2037
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:32,240
Is it a drug deal?

2038
01:39:32,540 --> 01:39:32,580
Right.

2039
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:35,880
What why are the McFly's getting into such nefarious shit.

2040
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:39,920
Right they're like yeah it seems like they're all like shitty they all get shitty later but

2041
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:44,680
like to be able to go into a dark ride into that living room.

2042
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:47,580
And watch the McFly's have dinner.

2043
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:52,360
Oh my if it looked like the that last scene in Carousel of Progress.

2044
01:39:53,160 --> 01:39:54,720
Oh it's a lot like that yeah.

2045
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:56,120
Bizarro future.

2046
01:39:56,300 --> 01:39:56,940
Bizarro future.

2047
01:39:57,140 --> 01:39:58,320
Gramps is around.

2048
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:04,320
You almost knock over George McFly and his upside down back correcting machine.

2049
01:40:04,660 --> 01:40:06,780
I mean that's what else do you want.

2050
01:40:06,980 --> 01:40:11,100
Scott you're saying plus it up to demolish it and then build something new too.

2051
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:17,960
I suppose I would say that and I and I but I have I have one other pitch for this for what I

2052
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:20,940
what I want to see happen in a new iteration of the ride.

2053
01:40:21,860 --> 01:40:25,340
You know so just to tie it all up you know in the end you bump Biff.

2054
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:31,380
You take him back to the the present day and what happens there he's sort of taken away

2055
01:40:31,380 --> 01:40:34,600
by some suited guards at the Institute of Future Technology.

2056
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:40,640
I don't think he's thoroughly punished enough for his deeds his evil deeds through time.

2057
01:40:41,240 --> 01:40:46,260
And and what's more I don't think we're punishing the right Biff because yeah he's just going on a

2058
01:40:46,260 --> 01:40:50,880
joy ride or whatever but he's some punk kid you know just crashing into stuff you know.

2059
01:40:51,060 --> 01:40:56,840
I think you want to bring justice to the ultimate most villainous Biff which is the Biff who is in

2060
01:40:56,840 --> 01:41:02,340
control of the alternate 1985 future. The Biff who's the mayor the Biff who's taken over the

2061
01:41:02,340 --> 01:41:06,340
town with horrible casinos who's all powerful and does all this awful stuff.

2062
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:12,900
So I say in the end we go deep into that alternate future and we track down that Biff.

2063
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:17,020
The the bloated Biff with the shitty out-of-date hair.

2064
01:41:17,020 --> 01:41:23,380
He looks awful he's a horrible despotic leader and maybe we find out a little bit more about

2065
01:41:23,380 --> 01:41:29,700
him like you know he that he rose to power you know by on this wave of angry populism in hill

2066
01:41:29,700 --> 01:41:34,280
valley he started accusing Mayor Goldie Wilson of not being born in America.

2067
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:40,000
You know you find out that his one of his gang members like the Billy Zane guy was meeting with

2068
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:44,540
the Russian government and that's how he was elected mayor and he didn't even want to be mayor

2069
01:41:44,540 --> 01:41:49,300
he just wanted like a contract to build a Biff Tannen's pleasure palace in Moscow.

2070
01:41:50,140 --> 01:41:53,840
You know just kind of flesh out Biff being in charge and what that means.

2071
01:41:53,880 --> 01:41:58,740
He wants to kick Syrians out of hill valley even though it was the Libyans who were up to the

2072
01:41:58,740 --> 01:42:04,340
plutonium hijinks. So we're gonna find I want to find that Biff maybe find him when he's like

2073
01:42:04,340 --> 01:42:09,460
I don't know give or take 71 years old something like that let's find that Biff let's pin him up

2074
01:42:09,460 --> 01:42:15,740
against the wall of his own casino and let's just ram that DeLorean into him over and over again.

2075
01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:20,720
Let him drop to the ground run over his head a couple of times this Biff I just I don't know

2076
01:42:20,720 --> 01:42:26,840
something about that 71 year old horrible Biff who rules over this terrible future where everyone's

2077
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:31,900
angry at each other I want to see that Biff come to justice. I think this is a good idea

2078
01:42:31,900 --> 01:42:35,760
obviously like it's very unbelievable but that's what's fun about fantasy

2079
01:42:36,220 --> 01:42:40,980
but I like the idea that it's a nice fun family adventure and then the last part of it is just

2080
01:42:40,980 --> 01:42:46,480
the grossest most gruesome thing full of you murdering a man. Yeah yeah just squishing his

2081
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:52,560
bloated head. Again it's fantasy no one would want to see that happen. It's blue sky here.

2082
01:42:53,320 --> 01:42:57,420
You never want to see that happen to anyone in our real world. Yeah if now if a character

2083
01:42:57,420 --> 01:43:02,860
like you were describing existed absolutely yeah we would all pay top dollar to see a car. Imagine

2084
01:43:02,860 --> 01:43:08,340
if a guy who looks like Biff Tannen if you had to like watch his shitty bloated face on tv every

2085
01:43:08,340 --> 01:43:13,560
day and listen every blather out of his mouth I don't know I want to I want to I want to take I

2086
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:19,420
want to I want to crush that skull and throw the remains into the Mr Fusion and ride off into the

2087
01:43:19,420 --> 01:43:23,220
sunset. I think that's great too. So that's it's a little grim but that's my idea of where to take

2088
01:43:23,220 --> 01:43:32,840
the new back to the future of the ride. Unfortunately our real world is much more bleak and

2089
01:43:32,840 --> 01:43:39,620
I would say my big thing is you know I said her at the top I think this ride is is one of the

2090
01:43:39,620 --> 01:43:46,440
ones I would call a classic so were it still around this I'm going to go the the middle

2091
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:54,360
route of just keep it as is but if if again it was still around I say fresh coat of paint on

2092
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:58,940
everything yeah they should have brightened that that screen brighten the projectors years ago

2093
01:43:58,940 --> 01:44:04,440
probably replace the projectors replace the screen and and just like gussy it up in the

2094
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:10,080
same way that Disney kind of gussied up some of some of the Fantasyland rides for the recent

2095
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:18,520
what was it 60th anniversary just just made made everything look a little more pretty because I

2096
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:23,940
think this yeah I think there's still a huge fandom for this attraction as we've seen as

2097
01:44:24,200 --> 01:44:30,040
talked about ourselves and yeah and there's also not that much back to the future stuff

2098
01:44:30,040 --> 01:44:35,180
like we said so it was always nice you know why that ride was still open when I worked there when

2099
01:44:35,180 --> 01:44:40,420
I was a tour guide at Universal and hearing the hearing that score and hearing the sweet swell of

2100
01:44:40,420 --> 01:44:46,000
Huey Lewis in the news it was right outside of our break room so I'd sit out on the patio if a tour

2101
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:53,340
went well then I get to come back chill out have some baked leis and listen to Huey Lewis loop over

2102
01:44:53,340 --> 01:44:57,800
and over again did you get positive feelings did you eat at doc brown did you get like an employee

2103
01:44:57,800 --> 01:45:02,280
discount at doc browns yeah I would like specifically make the doc browns a trip not free

2104
01:45:02,280 --> 01:45:07,960
or anything right uh yeah but I'd take the time what was your order at doc browns uh I think we're

2105
01:45:07,960 --> 01:45:13,100
just talking basic uh basic leg and thigh I think I think I liked the I think I preferred the dark

2106
01:45:13,100 --> 01:45:17,900
and uh real good fries it kind of got like shittier as it went on a little more like

2107
01:45:18,100 --> 01:45:23,660
sodium heavy you could tell like they were letting that recipe lapse uh but uh you know as they do

2108
01:45:23,660 --> 01:45:30,320
with rides they uh yeah things deteriorate um but you know what uh that's uh that's what that's what

2109
01:45:30,320 --> 01:45:34,700
I I we'll have to go check out Cletus and see yeah we'll see how it's doing under new ownership

2110
01:45:34,700 --> 01:45:42,680
well you guys uh we've really done it today uh we've gone the distance again truly we we thought

2111
01:45:42,680 --> 01:45:47,560
we were we were gonna try to keep it we were trying to keep it short we didn't no uh we went

2112
01:45:47,560 --> 01:45:53,400
very long uh but this is back to the future and it deserves it so yeah uh uh yeah split it we

2113
01:45:53,400 --> 01:45:58,860
didn't want to well we we had the choice really of splitting it in two as they as the filmmakers did

2114
01:45:58,860 --> 01:46:05,900
in making parts two and three and we chose to make it one mega uh one mega episode yeah um but

2115
01:46:05,900 --> 01:46:12,060
uh I don't know but it will revisit it in editing and uh split it yeah um but scott you were about

2116
01:46:12,060 --> 01:46:17,100
to say they've survived podcast the ride that's correct yeah but you know what I think you covered

2117
01:46:17,180 --> 01:46:23,580
it uh all right yeah I'll still take the fun hey in this case you truly survived podcast the ride

2118
01:46:23,580 --> 01:46:31,600
you survived a uh an epic adventure through time uh I feel like I expended 21 kilo jill watts of

2119
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:36,740
energy sticking the landing on the way out yeah yeah yeah uh we always yeah we never we don't

2120
01:46:36,740 --> 01:46:42,740
sputter to a stop we hit the landing hard we need to bump this landing let's let's bump it
