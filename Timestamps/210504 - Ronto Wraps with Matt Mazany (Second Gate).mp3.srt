1
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,380
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,420
Okay, so I was trying to understand

3
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,660
the park reservation system this morning,

4
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,440
because I, you know, I put stuff off sometimes

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,460
and welcome to podcast, The Ride, The Second Gate.

6
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,240
It's a cold start now, we don't do that a lot.

7
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,100
But yeah, now we're just going.

8
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,700
And you know, I had been wanting to do one of those.

9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,540
So, and the one park ticket calendar

10
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,640
is different than the park hopper calendar.

11
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,700
And then the one park ticket calendar

12
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,600
was changing every half hour what was available.

13
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:53,640
Wait, can I?

14
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,000
Context, a little context.

15
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,360
Is Mammazani our guest?

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,360
Matt, yes, go ahead.

17
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:58,720
Yeah, Matt's here.

18
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,340
Great to be here.

19
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,060
Welcome back.

20
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:00,900
Thanks very much.

21
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,860
The one park with the one ticket,

22
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:06,200
is that one calendar for California Adventure and Disneyland?

23
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,540
Or is it like, okay.

24
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,080
Well, it tells you what's available.

25
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,840
So right now for the next however many months,

26
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,640
if you want to buy one park ticket,

27
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,460
you're pretty much going to California Adventure.

28
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,160
Unless you can get the ticket and find a day

29
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,500
where suddenly someone has canceled their one park Disneyland outing.

30
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,040
Now, people are clearly watching this calendar

31
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,180
because when I would refresh it, those days would disappear.

32
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,560
If you want to get a park hopper ticket,

33
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,740
you have to choose a starting park.

34
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,500
Now your starting park,

35
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,560
if you want to start a California Adventure,

36
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,540
you're pretty much safe to do that.

37
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,660
If you want to go to Disneyland,

38
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,200
there's a handful of days.

39
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,280
And so I guess that's what I'm going to end up doing to get back there,

40
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,600
is pay the extra,

41
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,620
because this is a difference of like 50 to $60 potentially.

42
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:57,780
Insignificant.

43
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,100
Yeah.

44
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,240
And then you can get into the other park until 1 p.

45
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:01,400
m.

46
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,260
or so.

47
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:02,960
Correct.

48
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:03,680
Yes.

49
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,980
And now that's complicated.

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,580
If you want to do Rise of the Resistance,

51
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,360
because the Rise of the Resistance Virtual Queue lottery is at 7 a.

52
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:11,520
m.

53
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,720
and then at 1 p.

54
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:12,960
m.

55
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,280
So if you're okay with trying it at 1 p.

56
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,480
m.

57
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:16,480
,

58
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,340
you're fine when you are clear to go back into Disneyland.

59
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,040
And it doesn't seem like you'll be locked out of the second park

60
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,860
because of the limited reservations.

61
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:25,740
Can you clarify something?

62
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,820
So if you got a park hopper and you're doing California to Disneyland,

63
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,660
will you be able to get in the Virtual Queue for Rise of the Resistance

64
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,440
if you're not at Disneyland already?

65
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:39,840
Okay, as long as you have carted into either Disneyland or California Adventure.

66
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,400
Here's, let me say what happened.

67
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,780
Jason was describing his frustrating day trying to get Disneyland tickets,

68
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,540
and he was burrowing his fingers into his forehead so hard,

69
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,860
I thought they might like go in, they might go into his brain.

70
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,320
And then he started telling the story and I said,

71
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,720
save it for the show.

72
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,920
And I was joking.

73
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,960
And then everyone else agreed, including Matt, it should be on the show.

74
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,040
So I dug my own grave here.

75
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,860
But maybe this will help people trying to get tickets.

76
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,780
You know, because the topic today, we're talking RontoRaps.

77
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,160
It's the Star Wars day.

78
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,200
We're talking RontoRaps.

79
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,940
Usually these episodes come out on Wednesday.

80
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,220
It's Monday early because the Star Wars day fell out on a Tuesday.

81
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,900
May the second be with you, everyone.

82
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,680
Yeah, may the second be with you.

83
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,280
May the fifth be with you.

84
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,780
My joke was going to be the boys speak about sausage wraps.

85
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,700
And that's a nod to the crawl.

86
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,960
Yeah, that's pretty good, right?

87
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,260
Rise of the Skywalker crawl.

88
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,240
That would have played great.

89
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,900
Yeah, I actually really like the dead speak.

90
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,160
I think that is a very dynamic way to start.

91
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,640
One of the most confusing movies I've ever seen.

92
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,580
It's like any movie being called an exclamation point.

93
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,960
The only one that's coming to mind is The Informant.

94
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:56,700
But I feel like there's a mystery science theater movie, I think, called I Accused My Parents.

95
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,400
And that line is in the movie within the first minute.

96
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,060
Now I just wish that it had been episode nine, the dead speak.

97
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,380
And then that would have really set the tone.

98
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,840
Well, there's the Korean movie, the Korean thriller Mother.

99
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,820
And then there's the Darren Aronofsky, Mother, which is one with an exclamation point.

100
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,360
So that's how you tell those two apart.

101
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,460
I totally forgot a recent exclamation film.

102
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,100
Absolutely.

103
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,800
And the Albert Brooks mother is just mother.

104
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,640
Just mother.

105
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,780
OK, so that's different.

106
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,640
That's like being said with a groan.

107
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,120
Mother, I assume.

108
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,380
That's probably the tone, right?

109
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,260
So mother is not mother is not mother.

110
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:35,140
Yeah.

111
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,300
God, I just want to make sure everyone knows.

112
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,840
Is there any punctuation in Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead?

113
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,200
I don't think there is.

114
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,860
And maybe that implies that it's like a like let's keep it chill.

115
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,160
Everybody calm down.

116
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,240
Don't tell mom the babysitter's dead.

117
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:56,420
But if you had an exclamation point, then that implies that the stress level is much higher.

118
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,280
And if you put it right in the middle, that's an interesting move.

119
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,860
Don't tell mom the babysitter's dead.

120
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,600
It's under your breath after the fact.

121
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,380
Yeah.

122
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:12,100
Well, I mean, I think a lot of you could really change the tone of a lot of movies with just a couple punctuation marks.

123
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,680
Just throw a couple willy nilly into the center.

124
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,800
Is that Mr.

125
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,140
Speaking to Mr.

126
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:21,380
Viral Questions himself, has anyone done that is a viral question.

127
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,980
That honestly seems like a very good idea.

128
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:33,760
Like ruin a movie's title or just affect shape a movie's title by putting a next putting punctuation in the middle.

129
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,580
Yeah, that would blow up.

130
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,480
That would blow up so hard, I think.

131
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:43,480
And if you tweeted that and then it was got like a hundred thousand likes and responses,

132
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,140
what would come to your life and your career from that?

133
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,860
What you would reap would be so tremendous.

134
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,840
What I understand, what I do understand is why people do this and why they keep doing it.

135
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,880
And I think we should all be doing it all the time, seeding that viral content.

136
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,760
Man, by the way, we are missing a huge, huge recent exclamation point title.

137
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,300
Gutfeld.

138
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,260
Oh, my God.

139
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:17,740
We talked about the premiere had so much hype and then we've all lost the thread on Gutfeld.

140
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,780
Has anyone been keeping up with it?

141
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,460
I haven't seen a recent.

142
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,280
Yeah.

143
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,520
Is it still on?

144
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:25,620
It is.

145
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,700
Yeah, I don't know.

146
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,880
Now that Falcon and Winter Soldier is done, once Gutfeld's first season runs out,

147
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,820
I'm going to cancel my Disney Plus again and wait for Loki to come out.

148
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:39,040
It's very strange that Disney Disney Plus is the archive on Gutfeld.

149
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,680
Growing the library, the great, the riches of Fox.

150
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,960
Let's let's introduce him properly.

151
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,640
A good friend, writer, comedian, actor, podcaster, Matt Mazzani.

152
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,120
Welcome back to the show.

153
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:01,780
I guess early on in the first few months and a guest in real life on so many of our adventures.

154
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,280
And I'm happy to have you here, Matt.

155
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,140
Mazzani, excavation point.

156
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,200
Yeah, Mazzani is here.

157
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,860
I'm so excited to be here, man.

158
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,320
But there's so much so much to talk about with the amusement parks right now.

159
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,940
It's finally like rolling that amusement parks are in people's heads again.

160
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,440
We've got crying adults.

161
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,020
We've got the rising cases in some places.

162
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:26,220
We got, you know, people are people are chatting about theme parks, the Avengers campus.

163
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,200
There's things.

164
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,060
It's exciting.

165
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,960
This course is all over the place.

166
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,080
Yes, it really is.

167
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,960
People crying as people mad at the people crying.

168
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,960
Choose a Twitter.

169
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,380
Are you are you crying Twitter or anti crying Twitter?

170
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,140
Where do you guys land on?

171
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,600
I like crying adults.

172
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,480
I think crying adults are I think we all went through sad shit and we want to look.

173
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,320
We want to go to Mr.

174
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,840
Toads while riding go to hell.

175
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,420
Like that's what we've been waiting for.

176
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,880
So, yeah, like I'm going to cry when I see Mr.

177
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,440
Toad.

178
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:53,760
Sure.

179
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,340
Yeah, sure.

180
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,360
I mean, I'll say what I said yesterday.

181
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,740
Yeah, people, employees going back to work at a place they like and you're making fun of them.

182
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,360
Fuck off.

183
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,580
That's what I say.

184
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:05,640
Yeah.

185
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:17,760
But the rewards they get from this likes and retweets and replies, just like when you ask viral questions, you get so much from a cynical shitting on Disney tweet.

186
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:23,220
So much more than the people who go and go on a roller coaster and have a snack like a Ronto wrap.

187
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,880
You get like to sit to sit there and tweet is so much better of a lifestyle.

188
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,560
I feel.

189
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,500
Yeah, I know.

190
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:35,660
I'm sure they're reaping the rewards of making fun of some people emotional after going through a year of a pandemic.

191
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:41,660
After an indisputably after the worst thing of any of our lifetimes by far.

192
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:49,160
How dare you cry at the beginning of going to a place that's like the most fun place.

193
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,300
How bizarre.

194
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:51,160
Yeah.

195
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:58,700
Oh, these freaks, these freaks getting along with their brains and the corporations have gotten in their brains.

196
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,760
These Disney adult freaks lock them up.

197
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,960
I say lock them all up.

198
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,120
I log in.

199
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,660
I log into Twitter and it's the cynical speak.

200
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,140
It's right off the bat.

201
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,440
That's what it is.

202
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,380
That is a scroll of people being jerks for no reason.

203
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,180
Come on, guys.

204
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:16,940
Come on, guys.

205
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,280
Better.

206
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,600
Let's have some fun.

207
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,200
You're absolutely right.

208
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,340
It's a busy time, a really fun time.

209
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,960
And it's exciting that everything's ramping up so much.

210
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,400
I don't know when.

211
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,420
Well, as we said, we're all trying to get there.

212
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,140
We're figuring out our path to get back into these places.

213
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:42,980
I'm really nostalgic for all this stuff right now, because, Matt, you were there for so many of our some of the best trips to Batu.

214
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,200
I feel opening morning of Rise of the Resistance.

215
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:50,560
How long like long ago does this feel that was so nostalgic for it?

216
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,040
That was probably honest to God.

217
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,800
That might be my favorite Disney day I've ever had.

218
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,880
That would the whole Rise of the Resistance day.

219
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,420
I remember we went on Casey Jr.

220
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:58,920
that day.

221
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,120
I was my first time on the train.

222
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,860
Rise of the Resistance, of course, just amazing ride.

223
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,660
By that time, we were we were like old vets of Batu.

224
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,640
So we knew our way around the Millennium Falcon ride.

225
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,740
It was, you know, just a pleasant, pleasant day.

226
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:18,080
But I'm so I am so eager to get back and just like, you know, we're talking Ronto wraps.

227
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:25,120
That is like at this point, I was thinking my my have to do at Disneyland is Mr.

228
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,360
Toad and now Ronto wraps.

229
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,740
I think I have to do a Ronto wrap whenever I go.

230
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:35,500
Yeah, it's I think universally like, you know, as the reviews started,

231
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,700
you know, the Galaxy's Edge reviews started coming in very quickly.

232
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:45,120
And then about a month, a few months later, people were like, well, yeah, would be nice.

233
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,380
You know, us especially like, yeah, be nice that there were more characters.

234
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,940
There was more interaction.

235
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:55,360
But like, I think right from the gate, you know, everyone was like, man, these are pretty good, huh?

236
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,280
Like, I think we can all agree on this.

237
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:04,520
The most universally agreed upon thing in Galaxy's Edge is the Ronto wrap.

238
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:10,500
I believe maybe Rise of Resistance might be tied, but maybe slightly under just like.

239
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,660
You put Ogres in there because I was thinking the same thought is it.

240
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,920
It's like as close as well.

241
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:23,360
But I feel like the prey, I feel like Ronto wrap is the top.

242
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,220
And again, it might be percentage, little percentages, slivers of percentages.

243
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,920
I think it's also ease of entry.

244
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,300
If Ogres was easy to get into,

245
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,540
if I knew I could walk into Galaxy's Edge and just walk into Ogres, I would love that.

246
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,880
Like, you can always get a Ronto wrap.

247
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:37,920
It's always available.

248
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,020
It's near the restroom.

249
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,140
It's like it's your recharge for your whole day.

250
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:45,380
Yeah, you have to do a little less work to get into Ogres now.

251
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,860
You still have to kind of do a complicated virtual queue to do Rise of the Resistance.

252
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,320
But yeah, you just walk up and order a Ronto wrap or you order it in the app.

253
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,060
And they keep adding new.

254
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:55,860
They've iterated.

255
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,100
There's like, you know, vegetarian ones.

256
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,160
There's chicken ones.

257
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,060
In Florida, there's a zucchini one.

258
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,340
That sounds gross to me.

259
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,540
But oh, breakfast.

260
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,320
That sounds nice to me.

261
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,020
So you're not a zucchini guy?

262
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,560
I'm not a zucchini guy.

263
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,180
I just never like it.

264
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,260
It never grew on me.

265
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:14,460
Even in like an app form like a like a fried zucchini and ranch.

266
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

267
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,680
Like a TGI Fridays, fried zucchini.

268
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,180
Is that see that I feel like, you know, you're getting the ranch and the fry is doing some heavy lifting.

269
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,940
So I think in that 100 percent.

270
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:25,500
100 percent.

271
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:25,960
Yeah.

272
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:32,340
I think it's a little it's a little bit of a blank slate, a blank canvas to put other stuff on to.

273
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,640
And so but yeah, it's not not really my go to.

274
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,080
But I love the standard Ronto wrap and I really like the vegetarian one, too.

275
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:40,520
Mm hmm.

276
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,260
Yeah, no, I agree.

277
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,340
I think I mean, we're all this is the this we agree on this.

278
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,700
I mean, this could be like a quick episode.

279
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,040
We're going to go.

280
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:47,520
It's great.

281
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,520
And everyone really good.

282
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,560
They're just they're good.

283
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,000
So go get them because they're good.

284
00:12:53,340 --> 00:13:01,380
Well, you know, let's talk a little bit about let's do the the spatial context of the Ronto wrap.

285
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:06,740
We call the episode Ronto reps, but it is, of course, from the establishment Ronto Roasters,

286
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:12,580
which I think even before you have the food, which is just immediately one of the best,

287
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:15,460
like quick casual things Disneyland has.

288
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:21,380
I when I heard about this place, I was like, that sounds like one of the best things they have.

289
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,480
Then you see it in person.

290
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,220
It is one of the best things they have.

291
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:28,860
Just one of the best tableaus, I think, of Galaxy's Edge for sure.

292
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,560
Oh, yeah.

293
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:34,420
I mean, in the promo art there was and it's not quite the promo art is a little different,

294
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:40,380
but the basic part of it remains the same is that when I saw the art for Ronto's Roasters,

295
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:44,120
I said, oh, my God, it's a giant pod racing engine.

296
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:53,160
And I was so excited by this because a thing I think and I this will not turn into any sort of critique of the Star Wars movies.

297
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:57,340
But I will say seven, eight, nine, when I was looking forward to those before they come out,

298
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:03,600
I was legitimately excited about the combination of four, five and six Star Wars with the prequels.

299
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:08,660
So just an idea of seeing a big piece of the prequels,

300
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:12,920
which obviously we all have complicated feelings about, but pod racing is cool.

301
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:20,140
The idea that you're going to repurpose a pod racing engine to be cooking food in the themed experience in the in the world building of it.

302
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,560
That got me very excited because I was like, OK, good.

303
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,500
They're putting everything from the whole history of Star Wars into this land.

304
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:34,280
Well, it's funny because they kind of took the most beloved icon of Episode one, which I think there's two beloved icons, I'll say.

305
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,700
It's the double sided lightsaber.

306
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,860
People like that.

307
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,280
I think it's unequivocal.

308
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,680
And then also pod racing.

309
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:43,860
If you don't like episode one, everybody goes like, yeah, the pod racing scene was really cool.

310
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,980
And so Darth Maul with the light double sided, I think, as well.

311
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,240
Yeah, they all come together, too.

312
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,480
And and I also think Duel of the Fates is the best John Williams piece of music he's ever done.

313
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,220
Let's throw that out there for number.

314
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:54,500
Sure.

315
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,480
I'll agree with that.

316
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,680
I yeah.

317
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:05,220
But so I think that they use this thing like and also now the Ronto rap is like the core of the of the Galatis edge experience.

318
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:12,520
I think that it all comes together as like this, like they really figured out what people like about Episode one and Star Wars in general.

319
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,160
It's all there.

320
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:18,320
And by the way, if you guys don't mind, I'm going to take another sip from my this is this is pod racer fuel.

321
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,780
This is my custom Star Wars beverage I made.

322
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,820
What this is.

323
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,340
This is I just I just thought, you know, I made my Ronto rap.

324
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,820
So I also wanted to make my own Star Wars drink.

325
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,620
So this is this is one part spin drift grapefruit.

326
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:42,780
One part sugar free Red Bull and two crushed oranges in here and then some dried cranberries on top that do a little like floaty thing.

327
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,280
So my own little Star Wars drink right here, just like little space pebbles.

328
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:55,140
And you have you have invented this yourself and cast this as a drink that would gear up the pilots in the pod races.

329
00:15:55,140 --> 00:16:02,200
Yeah, this is like, you know, I'm like, yeah, and they probably do blue milk and like a little bit of like actual pod race fuel.

330
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,080
And that's what they do to get like you got to be crazy to pod race.

331
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,220
You got to be out of your mind.

332
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,900
You got to get a little zuded.

333
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,160
Oh, yeah.

334
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,960
So Boba getting a little gacked out of his mind to race against Anakin.

335
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,960
So it's like honey boo boo's gogo juice.

336
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:21,240
Yeah, that's that's a good metaphor that Star Wars people understand.

337
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,420
Yeah, yeah.

338
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:22,900
Go go juice.

339
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,540
Do you have a whole back story you've sort of crafted like who made this?

340
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,440
What planet did it come from?

341
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,500
Or could we could we brainstorm on that right now?

342
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:35,860
I do think it's I all I do know is that this is some Boba's favorite drink.

343
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:39,120
I think Jason, you were on that because I do think he needs to get.

344
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,240
Yeah, he's like he murdered people in that race.

345
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:42,540
Right.

346
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,200
Am I wrong?

347
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,360
Well, yeah.

348
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,700
I mean, there were some nefarious tactics being used in that pod race.

349
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:52,280
So I think yeah, I think people were dying and getting hurt really bad in the pod race.

350
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,300
And so was the Boba again.

351
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,720
I saw I don't know.

352
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,680
Oh, he's the guy.

353
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:00,100
He's the kind of like, yeah, yeah, and guy.

354
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:05,700
Yeah, you're like me and you revisit the prequels because everybody says they're good now.

355
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:10,420
And then you give up around the part where Jar Jar's friend goes, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

356
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,980
Then maybe you don't remember who's the boss.

357
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,080
Nass Jar Jar.

358
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,500
I don't like when boss Nass shakes his cheeks.

359
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,720
I'm sorry, everyone.

360
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,540
I'm canceled.

361
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,340
I'm sorry.

362
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:20,780
You are.

363
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,120
But this is why I remember this guy from the trailer.

364
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:23,940
Oh, yeah.

365
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,340
OK, sure.

366
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,120
I love all the pod racers.

367
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,760
I love one sandage.

368
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,880
I love team topicales.

369
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,820
I love all the pod racers names that I know.

370
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,780
But so Boba is really good.

371
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,380
I'm a big fan of him.

372
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,420
He looks really scary in some of these photos.

373
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:47,560
Yeah, he takes two slugs of of pod racer fuel before every race for sure.

374
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,260
Yeah.

375
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:54,500
So I just want to yeah, briefly, like I think it's Tatooine and Origin probably because that's where a majority of these pod races happen.

376
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,220
I would think I mean, you could tie it right to Moss Isley.

377
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:03,080
You could say the Cantina is where they tank up before they go out, maybe.

378
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:13,960
But is this like are the things floating in it like their cranberries in our world behind the scenes, as Wikipedia would say.

379
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:18,320
But in their world, is it like weird frog eggs or something?

380
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,400
Who are the little salesman guys, the OOTD guys?

381
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,360
The Jawas.

382
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,320
The Jawas.

383
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,040
Maybe they're like Jawas shits or they're like or like little blobs.

384
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,980
Womp rat eyes.

385
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:32,700
Womp rat.

386
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,760
I like Womp Rat Eyes.

387
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,580
Yeah, like yeah.

388
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:43,100
It's like in Alaska, where I'm from, you go to Dawson, which is which is place you go snowmobile there the winter and it's like negative 15.

389
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:48,360
If you snowmobile there, you're supposed to get a drink where you drink with like a toe inside of it.

390
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,080
There's a man who man who died and his like they kept his toe.

391
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,120
It's petrified and you just drop it in the shot glass.

392
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,160
You don't like drink the toe.

393
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,460
You just kind of like drink around the toe.

394
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:05,320
So, yeah, I could I could see it being like Womp Rat Eyes is that kind of like tough guy, you know, the worm in the tequila type thing to do.

395
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:05,740
Right.

396
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,040
Right.

397
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,300
And Womp Rats are they're how big are they?

398
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,220
I'm looking here pretty big.

399
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,700
They're kind of like little skittering guys, right?

400
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:19,420
Aren't they aren't they where they put in in the special edition like the Ronto was?

401
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,760
Well, the Ronto's put in.

402
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,740
No, there's a line in the original Star Wars.

403
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,240
Am I wrong?

404
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:23,560
Yeah.

405
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,540
Shooting bullsizing Womp Rats.

406
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:25,840
Yeah.

407
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,600
Well, here's a Womp Rat that's the size of baby Yoda.

408
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,980
And then there's another one.

409
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,060
There's other ones that seem to be as big as Luke.

410
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,100
But maybe that's just like because it's a poster.

411
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,220
So I don't know.

412
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,300
We there's no this is all over the place because it was it was in the planning scene.

413
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,300
I think he's talking to go.

414
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:43,920
That's no problem.

415
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,200
I used to shoot Womp Rats in Baker's Canyon, right?

416
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:49,260
Like, I think I think it's like they're supposed to be small.

417
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:49,900
Right.

418
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,080
But there's this picture of Luke on a giant one.

419
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,660
So I don't know.

420
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,080
Maybe there are like mega Womp Rats and babies.

421
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,320
And maybe Luke was just talking about killing the babies.

422
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,040
I don't know.

423
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,700
I'm not sure.

424
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:04,240
But it's a big creature doesn't mean it would have giant eyes necessarily.

425
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:08,400
So I think I think it being eyes works fine either way.

426
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,480
Yeah, that's true.

427
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,200
That's a good point.

428
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,060
Yeah.

429
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,280
Yeah.

430
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,150
Well, say they're Womp Rat eyes that you're drinking.

431
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,280
So it's it's it's it's Podraise.

432
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,280
It's Podraise or fuel Womp Rat eyes.

433
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,780
But I don't think like it can't be all Podraise or fuel.

434
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,880
That's the red.

435
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,900
That's the Red Bull in there.

436
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,620
So what's the what's the softer part of this drink could be?

437
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,480
What liquid are we missing here?

438
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,280
What else is what else is in there that we're like faking an equivalent for?

439
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,900
Spindrift grape grapefruit.

440
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:42,960
So like could be Wookiee put piss could be sort of like sour but sweet piss.

441
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:47,380
We're saying no, I don't have that experience.

442
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,760
God, God, love me.

443
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,440
I wish I could.

444
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,040
But I don't know what Wookiee Piss tastes like.

445
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:54,300
It might look it's for sure some kind of piss.

446
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,360
It has to be.

447
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,920
Wookiee, we could say Wookiee.

448
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,240
I mean, that's yeah, that would be.

449
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:03,660
Hmm.

450
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:09,380
But depending on their diet, I mean, we'd have to look up Wookiee Wookiee diet maybe and see how it would.

451
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,140
It's all great.

452
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,420
Like back to back to fluid.

453
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:21,760
Well, no, like, you know how like you can get collagen to put in like smoothies and oatmeal and stuff.

454
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,480
That's true.

455
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:30,160
If people in Star Wars are like, well, add back to, you know, a scoop of back to Scott back to is what Luke is in the back.

456
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,020
The tank healing up from his injuries.

457
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:38,540
A number of characters, Finn, I believe, is in a back to tank at the end of The Force Awakens.

458
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,020
It's a medical thing.

459
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,500
So it would be a medical thing like back to fluid.

460
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,580
But maybe there's alcohol in it.

461
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,000
Like, I mean, well, this is I don't think is an alcohol drink.

462
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,040
But if we want it, maybe that's it.

463
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,140
Maybe you do put a little trace of it in there.

464
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,980
So that's if you want to make it like stiff.

465
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,300
If you want it with a shot of vodka, you ask for it with a back to backer.

466
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,300
Yeah.

467
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:02,640
Or you drop it in like like like an Irish Car bomb.

468
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:03,480
Yeah.

469
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:11,000
And it gives it maybe maybe that gives it a medicinal quality like a flaming moh like the cough syrup in a flaming moh.

470
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,080
It encourages you to throw it back fast.

471
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,900
Like, take don't take your time with this.

472
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,080
This isn't a sipper of the right because you got to get out there and race.

473
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,020
Yeah.

474
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:20,860
Yeah.

475
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,060
Yeah.

476
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:21,440
Good.

477
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,020
This is good.

478
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:22,640
Completely.

479
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:33,740
But like not only I think is a good back story and a good drink for Star Wars, I think like this would this would fill up a giant Wikipedia page and be taken as fact readily.

480
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,320
Yeah.

481
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,840
Can someone in the audience do that for us?

482
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,280
Yeah, because we were told Wikipedia is like kind of open source updated.

483
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:48,260
And I think there's a codex or a codec that is the more the official Lucasfilm thing.

484
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:55,480
Let's create right now for Mazani sort of analog Star Wars character for him that he could be like sort of working for.

485
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:59,900
The guy's name is the bartender at Mos Eisley is were W.

486
00:22:55,620 --> 00:23:00,480
R.

487
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:00,200
H.

488
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:00,480
E.

489
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:06,260
But let's say like the Mazani standing characters guy who created this drink for the pod racers.

490
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,640
This is the bartender, of course, from Mos Eisley.

491
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,660
So like name is a man.

492
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,720
But like you're so well created Star Wars character.

493
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,540
This is for the Wikipedia for this bit of canon we're adding.

494
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:22,200
So I think Maz is a good Maz is always a good Star Wars first name for sure.

495
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,220
It just needs like a blast name to kind of.

496
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,960
So you'll be like the same name as Maz Kanata is what you're saying.

497
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,900
Yeah, I'll be Maz Matana.

498
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,720
OK, that's done.

499
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,380
I think it's done.

500
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,140
I think it's done.

501
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,920
I don't think we need to go any farther.

502
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,460
Yeah, we all know Maz is a general neutral name in the universe.

503
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:40,620
So we're yeah, we're good.

504
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,440
That's going to be good.

505
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:41,940
Maz.

506
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:42,720
What did you say?

507
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,220
Manat?

508
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:44,740
Matana.

509
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:45,460
Matana.

510
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,040
Because then you can get M.

511
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,420
A.

512
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:47,420
A.

513
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:47,940
T.

514
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:48,240
A.

515
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:48,420
A.

516
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,260
Throw an umlaut in there somewhere and I think we'll be good.

517
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:51,680
Great.

518
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,000
Listener will put all that information into Wikipedia.

519
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,600
Now it's official canon.

520
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,380
You just have to decide when it happened.

521
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,780
There's this terminology all over Wikipedia.

522
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,960
This is the Star Wars Wikipedia.

523
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,240
If that isn't clear, it's always A B Y.

524
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,440
Am I getting those letters right?

525
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:11,420
They like they say there's there's their version of B C and A D.

526
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:15,860
And I'm forgetting what the central point is in our in our world.

527
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,180
It's the birth of Christ.

528
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,780
But in Star Wars, it's the birth of Anakin.

529
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,960
I don't know what's A B Y.

530
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,040
That's a good question.

531
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:24,520
Is it?

532
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,320
Oh, is it after Battle of Yavin?

533
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:28,300
Yes.

534
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:28,480
Yes.

535
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:28,740
Yes.

536
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:28,860
Yes.

537
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,960
It's after the Battle of Yavin.

538
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,340
So that's the battle where the first Death Star is blown up.

539
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,700
Oh, OK.

540
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,120
OK.

541
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:38,840
So this would be B B Y because this is this is this is Podracer.

542
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,140
This is Subulba's drink.

543
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,760
Mazmatan always cooks it up for him before the big race.

544
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,760
Gets him shloded and he goes out there and he kills people with his machine.

545
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:48,480
Mazmatan.

546
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,120
The Galactic Senate is still in session.

547
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,380
The Jedi Council is still around.

548
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:53,800
Right.

549
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:58,940
And your man, your character, Maz, is like hanging around Mandalorian times, too, I bet.

550
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:02,160
So you could pop up on the show, I think, after we put this on Wikipedia.

551
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,040
Oh, man.

552
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:06,700
You're like the Tom Cruise in Cocktail of the Maas eyes.

553
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,760
Lee Cantina.

554
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:08,220
Yeah.

555
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,780
John Favreau make it happen and not not not Iron Man Favreau.

556
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,200
I'm talking about politically connected John Favreau.

557
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,300
Get me on Mandalorian.

558
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,000
Talk to Obama.

559
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,240
Work on it.

560
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:20,560
Yeah.

561
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:21,780
Yeah.

562
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:22,460
Sure.

563
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:25,460
Bomb is a co-producer on the next season of Mandalorian.

564
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,700
So you could probably get me on.

565
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:27,520
Yeah, that's true.

566
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:27,740
Yeah.

567
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:30,260
He's developing 10 Star Wars shows right now.

568
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:42,000
We're very we couldn't be more excited that Barack Obama, beloved producer Barack Obama, has joined the Star Wars family.

569
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,800
And he's in the animated Clone Wars one.

570
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,580
And it's just like, oh, you like you just see the characters on.

571
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,900
You're like, oh, it's that weird angular animation.

572
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:01,700
I didn't know if it was Mitch McConnell or Salacious Crumb, you'd say something like that.

573
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:02,340
Yes.

574
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,180
Yeah.

575
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:06,000
Everyone's like the whole crew.

576
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,900
Whole crew going wild at Star Wars.

577
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,000
First in person Star Wars celebration.

578
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,640
And Amazon takes the stage and shows the drink off.

579
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:16,980
Oh, man.

580
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,080
It's Mazz Metana.

581
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:27,880
This is all like every bit as viable as some stuff that I found on Wikipedia, which is or is this a Star Wars dot fandom?

582
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,200
No, no, no, that is Wikipedia.

583
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:35,000
Here's let me pull up the screen that I found for the guy who runs Ronto Roasters.

584
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:44,920
This is it's Baccar, everyone, you know, Baccar, Baccar, who just this this reeks of Imagineer to me.

585
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,700
This is just a picture of a man.

586
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,800
I think they're making somebody happy.

587
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:53,240
I don't know who who Baccar is, but and which is fine.

588
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,640
That's cute when they do it.

589
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,480
But he just doesn't look like a Star Wars guy.

590
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,560
It looks like a regular guy.

591
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,220
Give him a card.

592
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,060
Give him a hat.

593
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:04,420
At least he just looks like a guy with like a slightly odd collared shirt.

594
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,120
Like just an eye patch.

595
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,120
Yeah, fine.

596
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:16,820
An eye patch, like a chromium piece and chrome ear or something like, come on, let's do something that would make him look a little bit more Star Warsy.

597
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,860
Something spacey.

598
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:30,720
This is his idea, apparently, to do like he's he combined his obsessions of making food and podracing into one place.

599
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,980
He hails from Tatooine, came from a family that worked as butchers for four generations.

600
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,360
And he's also an avid fan of podracing.

601
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:44,880
In some comics somewhere, somebody says, if you want to avoid small talk and eat in peace, just don't mention podracing.

602
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,000
He's crazy for it.

603
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,340
Can't stop talking about it.

604
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,300
He's a super fan.

605
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,240
He's like a hard though.

606
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,920
That's hard to not mention.

607
00:27:54,920 --> 00:28:01,140
I feel like someone who doesn't know is going to walk into Rondo Roasters and go like, what the fuck is that?

608
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:05,300
And that's really opens him up for like, well, let me tell you.

609
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:06,520
Yeah, he'll talk.

610
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,720
Yeah, he'll talk your ear off.

611
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:13,780
I mean, it's like somebody bringing up like Max Pass to me or something where it's like, don't ask him.

612
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,820
He'll talk about it for a few hours.

613
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,520
I had this question.

614
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,500
Disneyland is open and there is no Max Pass and there's no Fast Pass.

615
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,000
Is this your worst nightmare?

616
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Well, if you notice what Jason was talking about, his like the scheduling issues, I was kind of doing like I think a Jack Nicholson jiff from Departed where I'm like, yes, I'm enjoying the bureaucracy of this.

617
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,160
That's where you get your rocks off now.

618
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:36,820
Yeah.

619
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,040
Getting in.

620
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,060
Yeah.

621
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:45,400
So Jason was kind of, his thing was stressful and he was presenting a challenge to me to try to find things that open up.

622
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:49,360
So I'll get my rocks off a different place.

623
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:54,120
It'll be a separate checking situation that I'll enjoy.

624
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,820
Did you Mike?

625
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:00,260
Speaking of checking, I'm going to bring it up publicly and you can raise this if you want, Mike.

626
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,980
I got to publicly thank you.

627
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:08,060
Mike, with your checking powers, I was on a travel job at Just at the Edge when vaccinations were open up.

628
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:14,960
Mike was kind enough to use his checking powers to get me an appointment out of town to get my first vaccination shot.

629
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,560
Another city.

630
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,020
I was joking about it.

631
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,000
I was like, I was on a text.

632
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,040
I'm like, oh, what kind of shot do you have?

633
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,500
He goes, I haven't got, we were talking a little bit.

634
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,860
Then he goes like, give me your, give me your Walgreens account.

635
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,820
I'm going to get you an appointment.

636
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,880
And all of a sudden, like he uses checking powers.

637
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:32,240
Like the day later I had an appointment for my first Pfizer shot.

638
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,420
So thank you, Michael.

639
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,860
Your checking powers saved my life.

640
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,860
I appreciate you.

641
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,760
It's no problem.

642
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:44,980
I had already mastered the Walgreens system because of my parents, because I had gotten both parents shots via Walgreens.

643
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:48,720
So I was in the zone with it and it was no problem.

644
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:51,260
It's just a quick, you check one on whatever I was up by the computer.

645
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:51,980
I check.

646
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,440
So it's like you check me into good health.

647
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,420
I'm fully baked.

648
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,040
I'm running around already.

649
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,260
I could walk into Universal Studios tomorrow.

650
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,940
I could do it.

651
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,340
I think maybe you should.

652
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:06,160
I might.

653
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:12,000
I've been thinking, I was thinking about that today when I was just like, because I was like, oh, it's been a while since I've been on podcast The Ride.

654
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,320
I got to, you know, I want to re-see Jurassic Park, the update, because I went on there once and I think it was a little fuzzy.

655
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:21,800
And I want to see if it's all up to stuff now with the whole year of maintenance.

656
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,280
Oh, sure.

657
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:22,900
It looks pretty good.

658
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,400
It's looking pretty good.

659
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:30,540
I'll be, yeah, I'm almost at the date, the specials second date or after the second date.

660
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,600
So who knows?

661
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,640
I could be at Jurassic Park.

662
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,220
I could be, I don't know.

663
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,140
I said this before we started.

664
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,320
I could be at these parks.

665
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,180
I don't know when.

666
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:37,900
It could be tomorrow.

667
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:38,700
It could be another month.

668
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,320
We'll see.

669
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,840
But I have the same urge.

670
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,760
A friend also was at Universal today and I went, oh, that looks good.

671
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:45,940
Yeah.

672
00:30:49,660 --> 00:31:00,300
Oh, I'm trying to work out the, there isn't anything nice to call the waiting, the two weeks or whatever it is for your shot, for your specific shot.

673
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:06,920
But maybe it should be like it's an AD, like an A to S after second shot.

674
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,100
If it is a second shot scenario.

675
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,320
Oh, I see.

676
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,160
Yeah.

677
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,020
Like it's the ADY of this.

678
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,980
It's a special date that we have nothing cool to call it.

679
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:18,300
Right.

680
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:21,560
After second shot, which is ass, A-S-S.

681
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:22,620
Yeah.

682
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:28,560
Yeah.

683
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,740
I have been saying fully baked, but I just don't like that.

684
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:35,620
Like it's just, it's not quite, it doesn't feel right.

685
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:35,880
Right.

686
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,700
Cause it's like, it's close.

687
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:41,280
There's something weird about, about the terminology on a lot of it.

688
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,660
Your pokies and your jabbies.

689
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,440
I'm not sure.

690
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,540
I jab.

691
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,480
I go like, Ooh.

692
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,780
And they, I have jabs.

693
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,580
I don't know why.

694
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,640
Why is jabs?

695
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,460
That seems odd to me.

696
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,500
I think fully baked.

697
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:58,020
You can only say if you got both shots from Jim Brewer.

698
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,520
Jim Brewer is giving you both shots.

699
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,460
Yeah, but he's skeptical.

700
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,140
He's skeptical.

701
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:02,840
I think.

702
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:03,940
Oh goody.

703
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,920
That's why he stayed half baked.

704
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,060
80% is good enough, man.

705
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,200
I'm not under the government's control, dude.

706
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:14,340
Yeah.

707
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,240
Yeah.

708
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:19,760
No, I can't think of like, maybe roasted, maybe cause we're talking about Rondo roasted.

709
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,320
Maybe fully roasted.

710
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,820
You can say you're all.

711
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,220
Roasted on all sides.

712
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:24,920
Yeah.

713
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:25,720
Yeah.

714
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,600
You've gone, I've gone around the spit.

715
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,200
Yeah.

716
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,600
Eight, eight DJ eight.

717
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,260
I can't see my notes right now.

718
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,160
Is that his name?

719
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,220
The roasting man, the roasting bot.

720
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,180
Oh, the roasting bot.

721
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,620
Oh, let's talk about the roasting bot, please.

722
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,060
I like him more than Bakar.

723
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:48,840
The droid cooking is the guy that Bakar signs the checks.

724
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:56,080
Like Bakar is the one going like, I can't find anyone to work after this galactic Senate fell apart.

725
00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:00,680
You know, I can't find anyone willing to work for this few credits.

726
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,580
Got to build an employee, I guess.

727
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,340
8DJ8 is what I'm seeing.

728
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:08,900
Yeah, he's cool.

729
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:09,580
Does he?

730
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,320
I haven't really, I haven't been there in a while.

731
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:24,880
I know that if you stand around, like there's the little sequence of events where the pod race engine shakes a lot and there's different levels of heat and orange to the, and there's meat that's rotating around.

732
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,220
Does 8DJ8 say stuff?

733
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,540
He says stuff, right?

734
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,900
I don't remember him talking.

735
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,340
I think he just, he just, he's just arms.

736
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,720
He's just, maybe he talks.

737
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:37,880
Does he beat?

738
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:38,780
Kebab.

739
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,660
He makes noises.

740
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,080
People are going to be upset about this.

741
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,980
And I'm realizing now that I didn't even remember this.

742
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,800
I thought I saw that he did.

743
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,260
He like wisecracking like Flintstones.

744
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,200
Like it's a living kind of line.

745
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:50,620
Yeah.

746
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,340
People are yelling.

747
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,320
I'll look into this.

748
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,880
If you guys want to talk amongst yourselves.

749
00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:03,880
Well, I will say I would just, I do remember the first time me and Scott went to Galaxy's Edge together and I, I've never seen Scott so happy.

750
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:12,880
And I visited Scott with his child and he, but I've never seen him glow so much as when he was like taking in the, the, the, the pod race engine.

751
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,720
And then it started roaring and he was like, whoa.

752
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,500
And I just remember, I remember it was such a moment.

753
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,540
There it is.

754
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,020
Oh, you pulled up there.

755
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,260
That was, we were very excited.

756
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,160
Oh, the smoke comes out of the engine.

757
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,560
I forgot about that.

758
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,320
I, yeah, I love this display.

759
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:32,720
Like the, how massive a piece that is shaking around, how realistic the meat is.

760
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,820
You know, it's not real meat, but that's well rendered.

761
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,900
We were talking about doing fake food, right?

762
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:42,120
I think like the meat on the skewers being cooked under the pod race engine.

763
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:45,040
That's, that's some pretty appetizing looking food for sure.

764
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:49,900
I think it looks better than one actual ingredient in the Rata wraps.

765
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:50,720
I'll say that.

766
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,760
Oh, wow.

767
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,760
Coming in hot.

768
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:54,940
Oh, interesting.

769
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,520
Ooh, I'm excited to get into that.

770
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:56,900
Okay.

771
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:57,440
Okay.

772
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,280
Oh, not, not lizards though.

773
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,460
The lizards are not the lizards.

774
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,300
You don't want to eat those.

775
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,020
Yeah.

776
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,260
But you know, I have a lot to say about sausage wrap.

777
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,680
Like, I don't think that's a surprise to anyone.

778
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,000
By the way, we've been talking 35 minutes.

779
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:16,940
We, if somebody listened to this and they have never heard of a Ronto wrap, they don't even know what a Ronto wrap is at this point.

780
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:19,580
We haven't described what a Ronto wrap is.

781
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,480
Yeah.

782
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,440
Well, this is good of you to police us as an outsider.

783
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,020
This happens a lot.

784
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,800
The deep end of the episode.

785
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,120
And we haven't said the thing yet.

786
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:34,060
It's this good like sausage wrap that you have next to the spot race engine.

787
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:34,940
I have the.

788
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:35,980
It feels spacey.

789
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,540
Like I keep saying spacey.

790
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,900
That's a bad word to say.

791
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,520
Space-ish.

792
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,480
Space-esque.

793
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:50,580
It feels like from outer space because the ingredients, while all earthly ingredients are combined in an interesting, odd way, but still very palatable and delicious.

794
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,420
What's your favorite Kevin space-esque movie?

795
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,240
I fucked the delivery.

796
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,800
I would have been really good if I'd nailed it, but it's hard to say Kevin space-esque for the first time.

797
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,420
Yeah, yeah, that's a mouthful.

798
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,640
That's a lot all at once.

799
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,860
A billionaire boss club.

800
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,820
That's a good Star Wars reference right there.

801
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,000
Oh, yeah, that is good.

802
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:19,680
I have the official menu listing from the website of a Ronto wrap roasted pork grilled pork sausage, peppercorn, corn sauce, tangy slaw wrapped in a pita.

803
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,920
That is the traditional Ronto wrap.

804
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:32,720
A Ronto in Star Wars, you know, continuity is surprisingly more majestic than I thought it would be.

805
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:39,440
I forgot that it is the guy added in the special edition of A New Hope that kind of rears up.

806
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:47,660
It's kind of a giraffe dinosaur horse thing that rears up as a speeder goes by as they're going into Mos Eisley.

807
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,200
Yeah, on on Tatooine.

808
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:56,320
Yeah, I immediately recognized the Ronto when I saw I never knew I never associated the name with that character.

809
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:03,660
I'm like, oh, yes, really CGI ish new addition to New Hope in the 97 re-release for sure.

810
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:12,140
Talking about icons, I think the Ronto is the icon of the special edition because that's when you think of special edition, you think of that that the guy rearing up and do that's right.

811
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:14,140
That's the exact thing I think of.

812
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:18,820
Well, that and young Java, young Java in the cut.

813
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:24,380
See the CGI, you know, and let's give them credit to young Java.

814
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:31,140
So Boba in the early days of the computer generated imagery in the 90s, they look pretty good.

815
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:32,720
They look pretty good.

816
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:37,560
I don't I still love the weird step on the tail trick.

817
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,300
Like they're like, how are we going to get them to get behind him?

818
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:44,800
He had no tail when he worked with his actor and then like the like like Han goes behind.

819
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,300
He just suddenly jumps up and like he's like the ring girl.

820
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,140
Like he just kind of steps over.

821
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:56,240
It looks very that still looks a little goofy, but they've got a job that makes that like really strange.

822
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,880
They've tried to make it better.

823
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,680
They think they fixed it a couple of times and it's still it's not going to be perfect ever.

824
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,000
But they have finessed it.

825
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:09,900
I just want to real quick say I've looked, watched four movies of this droid and I don't believe he speaks words.

826
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,360
Maybe he doesn't.

827
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,160
I might be making that.

828
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:17,780
I feel like maybe I would make a faint ghostly voice or it's just the most Easter egg thing.

829
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:23,300
But the fact that I don't remember it too strongly and then you're not finding it like maybe he does not speak.

830
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,740
People are mad if they know.

831
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:27,840
I'm so sorry if you've talked to you and had a conversation.

832
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,900
It's a great audio environment, though.

833
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,120
There's a lot of sounds.

834
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,240
There's some music.

835
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:38,080
You hear stuff at different volumes like the marketplace section of a Galaxy's Edge.

836
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:38,880
Very well done.

837
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:43,620
I remember my mom was so blown away, but I believe she had a Ronto rap.

838
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:44,440
Really loved it.

839
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:48,080
And that just that was like the peak of this new area of Disneyland.

840
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,500
She was experiencing just like food.

841
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:50,920
Great.

842
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,960
That display.

843
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:52,760
So great.

844
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,440
Sound design.

845
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:53,820
Great.

846
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:57,840
It is like maybe it is sort of a centerpiece of Galaxy's Edge, I feel.

847
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:58,440
Yes.

848
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,200
Yeah, for sure.

849
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,960
Where does everybody in this group stand as far as Galaxy's Edge night or day?

850
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,800
Where does everybody stand on that?

851
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:12,620
I think I've been there more in the daytime, but it really is very striking at night.

852
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,280
I mean, it's hard to it's hard.

853
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:15,760
Night.

854
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,860
Everything ends up winning in my mind.

855
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:22,560
I'm trying to think of anything that doesn't isn't improved by the night atmosphere.

856
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,720
So I will say night.

857
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:30,700
I think I've liked going there midday partially for the purposes of getting this Ronto rap,

858
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:37,020
maybe doing my longer pass in Batuu during the day and then hitting it again at night.

859
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:42,320
Briefer maybe because I like pop into a single rider Millennium Falcon.

860
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,800
Maybe I don't get into Rise of the Resistance until the end of the day.

861
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,320
And again, I'm describing things that have only happened like three times because this all closed really fast.

862
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:57,240
But yeah, I think I think a lot of day and a little night chaser.

863
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,080
I think that's my favorite way to do it.

864
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,380
That way you're yourself.

865
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:01,660
I will.

866
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:08,260
The one thing is we're talking about the sound design, the sound design of like ships flying over your head at night is such a great trick.

867
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:13,100
I feel like you're in a you're a busy spaceport because you wouldn't necessarily see the ships if you're looking up.

868
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:19,680
And I also I think I said this the first time we went to Galaxy said we with his at night and you look up at the sky and you look at the stars and you're in an alien planet.

869
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:23,380
You're like guys like we're we're in space right now, whether you like it or not.

870
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,920
We're actually really in space.

871
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,000
And I felt I felt like kind of like a high guy.

872
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:30,800
I'm not a high guy, but I felt like a high guy because I was like, well, we're like this.

873
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,480
If this was an alien planet, it would look exactly the same.

874
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,320
If you looked up, it looked like stars.

875
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,160
So I did love that.

876
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:42,000
But I but on the flip side, daytime is like what you see Tatooine in in the movies.

877
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:50,320
So you do have that kind of like, you know, I'll say this specifically in the the Ronto Roasters area daytime.

878
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:59,260
If I'm walking around outside, if I'm getting if I'm looking at the Millennium Falcon for like a photo op or just to get on the single writer line, I'm going to go night for that.

879
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,060
So you got to split it.

880
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:00,240
It's hard.

881
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,520
It's hard to pick one equitably.

882
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,060
Do both if you can't.

883
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,540
Yeah, yeah, that's probably the best.

884
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,740
Go twice in a day.

885
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:17,920
Did anybody see this odd little fact about the Ronto and where the literal in the making of the film or the special edition where the Ronto came from?

886
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:18,560
No.

887
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:31,340
Which explains the word Ronto, which is that in order to do this, Industrial Light and Magic started with and modified the Brachiosaurus model from Jurassic Park.

888
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:34,460
And that is how you're looking when you're looking at that figure.

889
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:41,080
It is a it is the bones, the base of the Brachiosaurus from Jurassic Park, which am I dumb?

890
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,880
Is that is that the Brontosaurus?

891
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,840
Is that the same thing or is a Brachiosaurus a different thing?

892
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,180
I think there are two different things.

893
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,420
My different things.

894
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:59,060
Well, it's confusing because while making the film like until Lucas had really seen it, the animators were referring to it as the Bronto.

895
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:05,640
And then George came in and said, just drop the B and he named he named Ronto personally.

896
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:08,480
And it is Ronto because it's Bronto minus B.

897
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,060
That's why that's a great factoid.

898
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:10,860
He's a genius.

899
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:11,980
That's why he's a genius.

900
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:15,720
He comes in, he solves a problem and walks out.

901
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:18,240
I can tell you this without even looking it up, Mike.

902
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,560
The Brachiosaurus is a taller dinosaur.

903
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,000
It has kind of a ridged head.

904
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,640
The Brontosaurus is a little bit of a longer dinosaur.

905
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:31,760
It's head like rides a little lower and it might be a little larger than the Brachiosaurus, but it's generally like it kind of like slings low.

906
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,220
A similar silhouette.

907
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,920
Yeah, like like you're looking at a distance.

908
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:36,540
Yeah.

909
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,920
Oh, but so wait, I might not.

910
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,520
Maybe I didn't realize this till right now that it is not.

911
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:47,000
I think I've always thought of the first dinosaur you see in Jurassic Park as a Brontosaurus, but it is not.

912
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,100
I believe so.

913
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,020
I think they change.

914
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:56,840
They make new discoveries about dinosaurs seemingly every month and they've changed names a lot.

915
00:42:56,860 --> 00:43:04,520
And so I I will admit I am not knowledgeable about you didn't learn anything from Jurassic Quest.

916
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,440
Jurassic Fantastic.

917
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,000
That's what I learned.

918
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,100
I learned how to sing a great song.

919
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,380
Sing a song.

920
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,540
Anyways, so so the Ronto.

921
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:18,880
Yeah.

922
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:24,780
So does it like disturb you guys a little now to like I mean, well, you're eating meat.

923
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:36,760
You're eating an animal product anyway, but are now or if mentally in the little play acting you're doing when you go there to know that you are eating this gigantic, majestic Brachiosaurus-esque creature.

924
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:38,000
Is that bothersome?

925
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,340
Now that ruin anything?

926
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:41,820
I don't know that it ruins anything, but it is odd.

927
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:43,940
It is like I'm eating a dinosaur.

928
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:50,340
Now, if we just think about any meat consumption in general, it's odd and it's a little disturbing.

929
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:55,240
But is the size is the size what's so disturbing about it?

930
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:56,880
I'm not sure.

931
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,380
It's an interesting question.

932
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:01,940
Could be that just that it looks so cool, but we animals that look cool.

933
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:05,720
So the skittishness that like, oh, it's got feelings.

934
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:06,760
It knows.

935
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,930
Yeah, I think that's a clear personality.

936
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Yeah.

937
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:10,400
Yeah.

938
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:13,220
That's another problem with meat in general, too.

939
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:15,280
Got to give him credit on that, too.

940
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:18,750
The Ronto list garden wrap 1299 Ronto wrap 1299.

941
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:26,340
I think that's a big hurdle for a lot of people were not trying plant based alternatives in the past was the price point.

942
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:32,740
And if you can get a closer to the price of actual meat, I think it is people come around to it a little more.

943
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:47,020
So do we know in Canon is the vegetarian Ronto wrap actually a Ronto substitute that was developed on tattoo or wherever we are, but to know the vegetarian wrap is actually little Yodas.

944
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:49,740
It's like it's like they're kind of plant based because they're so green.

945
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:50,760
They're photosynthesized.

946
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:54,840
It's really kind of weird because it's like six, one half does the other when it comes to meat consumption.

947
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:57,240
But, you know, it's different on Star Wars.

948
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:06,980
So it's like kind of a clone army of Yodas that are grown for the purpose of eating and selling as plant based alternatives to a Ronto.

949
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:18,320
Yeah, there is a big viral video that happened on Tatooine where they showed these like factories of just like little cloned eyeless Yodas is Yodas that eyes or mouths and they just like they move and stuff, but they're not really alive.

950
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,720
So it's not a big deal.

951
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:20,980
Nerve endings.

952
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,080
Yeah, exactly.

953
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,920
I mean, no, no, there are nerve endings.

954
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,760
They do feel pain, but they're not alive.

955
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:32,860
Just so you know, and they're only they're like they're like 3% less cute, like still very cute, but like not as cute.

956
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:40,640
So so it's like like on is it on Camino, which is a clone planet with like all the oceans and the storms from Attack of the Clones?

957
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,220
Yeah, they're they're solving the problem.

958
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:46,420
They're making impossible Rontos out there, which are just little Yodas.

959
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:46,720
Yeah.

960
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:47,280
Wow.

961
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:48,820
That's like a from Camino.

962
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:50,980
Big waste, but OK.

963
00:45:51,920 --> 00:46:02,480
I think they also I think Ronto wrap is kind of like a catch all like cheesesteak if you really burrow down to it because at the Florida Galaxy's Edge, they had a tip.

964
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,460
You're a Bronto, of course, on Batu tip.

965
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:05,700
You're is what they call chicken.

966
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:08,360
So they had a chicken version of the Ronto wrap.

967
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,140
So but it doesn't have Ronto meat.

968
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:13,440
It has to be a meat, you know, right?

969
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:16,360
And if they sell tip, you're inside, right?

970
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,080
In docking Bay seven docking Bay seven as well.

971
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:20,800
OK, so I see what you're saying.

972
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:26,580
So there's so Ronto vegetarian is probably a different meat, but they just haven't specified or a plant.

973
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,960
A Star Wars plant, perhaps, is what this sort of sausage is made out of.

974
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,080
They just haven't specified with Canon yet.

975
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:42,840
I don't have my head wrapped around this question, but is there another Disney food that pretends to be not the food it is like we're talking about tipi and roto meat?

976
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:49,060
Is there other Disney foods that like don't have like, oh, this is a mermaid pudding or whatever?

977
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,400
Avatar in Avatar land.

978
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,200
Yeah, those are those are like weird Avatar beasts of burden.

979
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:56,260
The gray stuff.

980
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:57,240
I believe so.

981
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:03,700
The gray stuff, though, is still like the gray stuff is still like a sweet treat in Beauty and the Beast, right?

982
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:06,800
I thought it was supposed to be like a paté in Beauty and the Beast.

983
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:07,320
Oh, yeah.

984
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,160
It's the blood of alive brooms.

985
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,940
It's an enchanted broom.

986
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:16,660
And it's when you squeeze it, when you milk the juice out of it, that's the gray stuff.

987
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,040
Right.

988
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:17,540
Yeah.

989
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:19,020
That's interesting.

990
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:19,460
Yeah.

991
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:20,540
Is there any other one?

992
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:31,080
You don't eat mighty crons, of course, in that they would not have you would not go on a ride and then be told to eat the this majestic beast.

993
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,180
Well, I got four movies to fill.

994
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:34,680
You know, you never know.

995
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:44,060
There might be like a more, you know, a different crop of Navi on the other side of the planet.

996
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:46,180
So it's like the costumes are different here.

997
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:49,320
This is this is far flung speculation.

998
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:54,420
But being that the next three or four Avatar movies are going to be very sea based.

999
00:47:55,060 --> 00:48:06,140
Is there a Tokyo Disney Sea Avatar plan for when there is like Avatar Sea and they're going to add on like an Avatar Sea world at at Tokyo Disney?

1000
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,000
Is there anything like that?

1001
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:09,560
Sounds good.

1002
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:12,260
Is there room at Tokyo Disney Sea to do anything like that?

1003
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,220
Well, there's a big expansion happening now.

1004
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:22,420
I haven't looked at the overall map to see where the expansion pads lie, but it's something I'd be happy to look at very soon.

1005
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:25,580
But I don't know.

1006
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:28,200
I don't know if I don't think there's any plans that we've heard about.

1007
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,020
But it's not a bad idea.

1008
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:34,000
And I think there are I think there is more room for sure to expand.

1009
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:35,840
Do they like it in Japan?

1010
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:36,380
Is this one?

1011
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:39,440
There's this odd thing of like there's no galaxy's edge in Japan.

1012
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,660
And maybe there's the calculation that they don't care about.

1013
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:42,700
Is that way?

1014
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:45,780
That seems crazy that Japan doesn't like Star Wars.

1015
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:48,020
Why is there no galaxy's edge there?

1016
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:49,380
Huh?

1017
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,440
That's a good question.

1018
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:51,740
I think maybe timing.

1019
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,060
I think they already were just working on so many new attractions.

1020
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:59,600
Maybe it just didn't line up and maybe the park didn't need it.

1021
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,500
I think Paris needs it.

1022
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:02,840
Yeah, that's true.

1023
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:03,540
That makes sense.

1024
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:08,120
By the way, can I jump in on the Tokyo Disney Days questions?

1025
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:09,620
It's been a while since I've been on here.

1026
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:11,260
Oh, and I think it's closed.

1027
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:13,360
But can I throw my two cents opening the way open?

1028
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:14,360
Yeah, open it up.

1029
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:14,960
Let's do it.

1030
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:15,420
All right.

1031
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:16,800
So here's where I land.

1032
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,100
Tokyo Disney Sea.

1033
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:20,720
One day.

1034
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,340
Tokyo Disney Land.

1035
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,740
Half day.

1036
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,140
Travel to Osaka.

1037
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:27,060
Universal Japan.

1038
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,240
Two days.

1039
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:29,660
What?

1040
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:30,620
Two days at Universal?

1041
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:32,100
That includes the travel?

1042
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:35,300
Well, yeah, because it's going to be a half day travel and it's going to.

1043
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:37,320
Well, no, I think you do.

1044
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:42,620
You could do one day at Universal Japan, but I left a lot of rides on the table when I when I left Universal.

1045
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,640
So there's a there's something thrown down that I like.

1046
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:49,000
This is like a little closer to what I said originally.

1047
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:53,700
But now you've been we have not been to Universal Osaka and you have.

1048
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,060
So that that's interesting.

1049
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:56,120
That shapes the whole thing.

1050
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,400
This is some flame throwing gut felt.

1051
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:04,800
So I'll say I'll say truly, truly a dissonant not joking.

1052
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,560
It would be it would be Pooh's Honey Hunt.

1053
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:11,920
And I mean, I do want to see the beauty and the beast thing with that, because that looks amazing.

1054
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:16,380
But everything else, I mean, the pizza place was closed when I went there.

1055
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:18,480
I did say I did say problem.

1056
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,880
I did say I had very bad.

1057
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:21,700
I had very bad tours.

1058
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:22,120
Japanese.

1059
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:26,020
There's two things I said where I did the doko deska, which is like, it's like, how do you see things?

1060
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:34,780
And why do you remember asking a poor Japanese woman, Tony Solaroni, doko deska and and she was like,

1061
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:35,900
she told me that it was closed.

1062
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,440
And then the other one was I did.

1063
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:40,180
I was looking for some liver lips McGraw merch for you, Mike.

1064
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:43,680
And I did have to ask a woman to give shop liver lips McGraw doko deska.

1065
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:47,180
And she she truly had no idea what I was doko desking.

1066
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:52,920
But and I guess the country bears in Japan was also very charming Disneyland.

1067
00:50:53,360 --> 00:51:00,600
But you could do you could do country bears Pooh's Honey Hunt and and Beauty and the Beast in a half day.

1068
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:06,140
And then spend the rest of the day traveling to Osaka because Universal is this is pre Super Nintendo land.

1069
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:09,620
Universal was crazy, like really, really great.

1070
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:13,780
And I can't that that's the other reason is I can't fit on the thrill rides there.

1071
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:17,580
So because they're very Japanese person size and I'm not.

1072
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:22,400
So there is I probably didn't go on maybe four big coasters there.

1073
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:26,900
But I went on Jaws a bunch and I missed the T2 show.

1074
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,940
Want to see T2 again?

1075
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:33,800
This big stuff and you still would say and it's still you still have like a big packed day.

1076
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,760
I had a packed day.

1077
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:35,180
Wow.

1078
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:35,500
Wow.

1079
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:39,080
Plus there's plus there's a there's a universal Japanese city walk.

1080
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,780
And there's one of the only guests quality.

1081
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:45,500
Well, you're like, I mean, I'm not sure anyone's been on maybe just Michael.

1082
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:45,860
I forget.

1083
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:50,020
Like, is anyone qualified to be on the city walk of soccer saga?

1084
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:51,720
Yes.

1085
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:53,760
Justin Emmeriss is a whole thing.

1086
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:57,360
They just have barely them and then and then Matt, that's a good lineup.

1087
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:59,020
Did you do anything in city walk?

1088
00:51:59,140 --> 00:51:59,540
Yes.

1089
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:06,760
There was a there was a Western themed like American Western like like like themed arcade where you could go in there.

1090
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:07,540
And it's like, is it?

1091
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:08,860
There's like a lot of arcades in Japan.

1092
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:09,800
Very similar stuff.

1093
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,740
But it was very much like like this is an American saloon Western where there's guns everywhere.

1094
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:18,120
And it's just like America because there's guns everywhere.

1095
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,540
That was kind of the theme of it.

1096
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:23,940
And there was something on the back wall that was written like, don't mess with me, pal.

1097
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:24,440
Shoot.

1098
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:24,820
Yeah.

1099
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:33,260
It just like it just like said that in big letters and just and it was like, yeah, this this feels like a good estimation of what our wild west cultures like.

1100
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:34,360
They got our ticket.

1101
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,120
Yeah, they really do.

1102
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,180
And then I think there was a bubble.

1103
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:41,080
There was like the they did have the King Kong there.

1104
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,180
There was an ice cream.

1105
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:43,620
They were they were they were even have that in Florida.

1106
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:44,480
That's amazing.

1107
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:45,140
Yeah.

1108
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:46,220
Yeah.

1109
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:47,640
I want you to have Fridays.

1110
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,660
Yeah, there is a bunch of stuff like that.

1111
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:51,480
I remember the Western saloon the most.

1112
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:54,740
But I would I would.

1113
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:57,500
Yeah, the universe was so there's so much minion stuff at Universal.

1114
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:58,320
That was amazing.

1115
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:05,780
I had a great moment at Universal Japan where I was leaving and I had like all my bags packed in like a locker at the entrance.

1116
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:08,760
The thing is kind of a little bit outside of the entrance kind of.

1117
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:11,080
And it felt like the backstage area.

1118
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:16,040
And all of a sudden I was sitting there by myself, just kind of fiddle with my fiddling with my luggage, getting it all together.

1119
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:21,600
And maybe two dozen minions just ran by me and there was no music or nothing playing.

1120
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,860
They were just like marching out to go do a show.

1121
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:25,480
And I was like, what the fuck?

1122
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,680
There's all these and I just started high fiving them all.

1123
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:29,220
And they started high fiving me.

1124
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:34,780
And it was just like I got to high five like 20 minions by myself in a little corner of a locker room.

1125
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:35,780
It was fantastic.

1126
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:37,260
What a great what a great moment.

1127
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:38,020
Wow.

1128
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,860
That is a great moment.

1129
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:49,240
So this before Nintendo, we got to get back to Osaka, obviously, to meet the minions like that and go to the bubblegum.

1130
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,680
Yeah, I have to see their bubblegum.

1131
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:56,960
But we'll ask Jason, Jason, there was a there was a minions burger, a yellow burger with an eyeball on it.

1132
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:57,880
The bun was yellow.

1133
00:53:58,300 --> 00:53:59,600
That's a lot of fun.

1134
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:08,600
The minions I think are very popular internationally because I think it's so much slapstick.

1135
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:12,360
It's so much physical comedy and goofiness and cuteness.

1136
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:15,600
And I think like everywhere in the world can agree on that.

1137
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:25,040
But I I do like the cross-cultural Western stuff, too, like the people planning Disneyland, Paris, Euro Disneyland and Universal Osaka.

1138
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:26,120
Just getting a whiteboard.

1139
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,820
It's like, OK, first things first.

1140
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:29,960
Cowboy idiots.

1141
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:32,100
So that's what America is.

1142
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:34,920
So we got to have that next.

1143
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:36,380
TGI Friday.

1144
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,300
Forest Gump restaurant.

1145
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,020
Yeah, for us.

1146
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:45,040
Oh, yeah, we are legally obligated to have far the forest Gump restaurant.

1147
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,160
So that's number two.

1148
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:51,860
There's a there's a TGI Fridays and bubblegum shrimp by Tokyo Dome City as well.

1149
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,060
Oh, yeah, I did go to Tokyo Dome City.

1150
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:54,380
I did.

1151
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,600
I did miss that, but I didn't want to go to that.

1152
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:03,560
Let I mean, I can't I believe I'm going to apologize for being on a tangent on this show, since that is this show.

1153
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:16,340
But the last thing about Osaka Universal Studios is seeing back draft with like Ron Howard dubbed in Japanese with like the deepest, like manliest Japanese man's voice is just such an amazing.

1154
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,160
And it's but it's like Ron Howard's like goofy little face.

1155
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,520
It's so it's just a beautiful.

1156
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,820
It's such a great time doing back draft again.

1157
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,220
Still back draft.

1158
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:26,440
I think I forgot that.

1159
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:27,380
That's crazy.

1160
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:28,200
Wow.

1161
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:28,760
Got to go.

1162
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:29,240
Got to go.

1163
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,780
I don't know if Super Nintendo World got rid of it or something like that.

1164
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:34,300
But it's it was a joy to do all that stuff again.

1165
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:43,580
I mean, I'm very excited that the prospect of riding Spider-Man and then walking to ride Jaws like in the same park like that is thrilling to me.

1166
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:49,560
That I've never been on Spider-Man, but that's the first place I've been on Spider-Man because I've never been to Florida Universal Studios.

1167
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,540
So Spider-Man was was a was a joy.

1168
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:54,860
What a what a just so fantastic park.

1169
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:55,780
Yeah.

1170
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:58,740
But Mike, is this all madness?

1171
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,500
Can you know I'm upset by this day?

1172
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:01,220
Look at my face.

1173
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:01,780
I'm upset.

1174
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:13,080
So if you're folding this in, if you if you're going to now toss in Universal Osaka, how many days of of just pure theme park will it be for you next time you go?

1175
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:23,160
Well, I obviously just off the top of my head, I think I want to add dates to how Tokyo Disney I think it's two days at Disneyland, three days at Tokyo Disney Sea.

1176
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:27,680
You've got up to four, four days at Universal Osaka.

1177
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,740
That's what I think off the top of my head.

1178
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,020
I spent as many days you want to Disney Sea.

1179
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:48,980
I like if you want to spend that place is fantastic, as everybody said, I could do two days there, but I'd have to be I'd have to have a long Japanese Japan trip to do two days there.

1180
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:54,700
But Disneyland, like I don't know, like there's a lot of stuff that's in our Disneyland that's just as good.

1181
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:55,480
Like what are you going to do?

1182
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:58,860
Like, you know, like I said, honey, honey, amazing.

1183
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:03,080
Every quick service restaurant there has different awesome.

1184
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:07,900
I just mentioned this on the show, different kind of awesome wrappers for the different foods.

1185
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:16,040
And I really next time I go, I would like to see all of the different wrappers for the chicken sandwiches, for the hamburgers, for anything I'm not even thinking about.

1186
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:22,200
And you have to go admire that the roofs and the awnings look exactly like they did in 1983.

1187
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:25,000
And it looks exactly like Disneyland 1983.

1188
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:32,360
If you're going to admire early 80s architecture and take a lot of pictures of it, you just really you get that's going to add time.

1189
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:33,180
Yeah, of course.

1190
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:35,260
So I'm not also at Disneyland.

1191
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,220
I'd had a great snack.

1192
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,480
I had a cone.

1193
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:40,900
It was a waffle cone with mashed potato and braised beef inside.

1194
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:44,280
That was maybe my favorite Disney meal I had.

1195
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:45,100
That was delicious.

1196
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:53,080
Although they had they had Minion or not Minion, but little Toy Story Green Guy Mochi ice creams at Disney.

1197
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:55,640
See, that was the best pure snack of the trip.

1198
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:56,700
That's very fun.

1199
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:57,440
Yeah, that sounds great.

1200
00:57:57,460 --> 00:58:00,140
I'm actually forgetting my was I saying three days?

1201
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:00,960
Was that my argument?

1202
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:07,260
I think at one point in time it was three and now you've expanded to five, which has never been on the table.

1203
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:09,320
Even Tony Baxter did not say five.

1204
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,500
Tony said four.

1205
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,200
Yeah, I said three.

1206
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:15,540
Three seems so reasonable now that I'm thinking about it with what I just said.

1207
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:21,920
This is the reverse Joe Rody experience where you are sacrificing days.

1208
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:29,260
You could be doing international cultural expeditions to go to theme parks where he would sacrifice like, I don't need to go with theme park.

1209
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:32,600
I'm going to go see, you know, that's the issue for me.

1210
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:35,040
I don't want to go be in Mr.

1211
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,260
Culture here, but Mike, if you do that, you have to go to Japan for a month.

1212
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:43,220
That's the only way I will allow you go all the way there and then only go to like Jaws.

1213
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:49,860
You have to add other stuff because Mike, we've got we've got two days to do Wrestle King and we've got to be there both nights of Wrestle Kingdom.

1214
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,880
So let's put get that on the table.

1215
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:55,940
You're going to go, which is when January, January 4th and 5th.

1216
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:56,380
Yes.

1217
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:04,320
2021 Mike Carlson is going to be there if you meet him at the Tokyo Dome City the day before Wrestle Kingdom, he'll sign your autographs.

1218
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,340
You got to go out there and get them.

1219
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,480
Am I doing an appearance?

1220
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:07,740
Yes, absolutely.

1221
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:08,860
We're booking it.

1222
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:11,420
You're being travel doxed, I think.

1223
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:12,420
I mean, that's fine.

1224
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:13,580
Yeah.

1225
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:16,640
So and then we got to go back to Pearl and yeah.

1226
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:17,680
Well, look, that that is it.

1227
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:18,960
That wasn't even part of the days.

1228
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:19,240
Yeah.

1229
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:19,840
If that all right.

1230
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:22,080
If that counts as days, because that's yeah, that's a day.

1231
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:26,120
We have to have more time to go to other goofy ass themed experiences.

1232
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:27,240
That's correct.

1233
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,820
It has to be spread around there.

1234
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:31,720
It has to be different things.

1235
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:36,200
I understand now that Studio Ghibli Park looks really amazing.

1236
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:40,520
I know that's like that's far away, but that looks really that could be something that could be something.

1237
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:42,720
Let's let's get back to the two.

1238
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:47,860
We should get back to the two because we have this whole chapter of this that we haven't even haven't even gotten into.

1239
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:48,840
Yeah, no.

1240
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:49,480
Yeah, yeah.

1241
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:50,020
Yeah.

1242
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:53,280
So we because all right.

1243
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:54,100
So Disneyland's open.

1244
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:55,300
People starting to get these.

1245
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,700
They were the Ronto wraps again.

1246
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:59,560
They've always they've been just going to Disney World for a long time.

1247
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:00,900
We'll go back and we'll get them.

1248
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:02,120
But we're not quite there.

1249
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,400
We're not at Disneyland yet.

1250
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,040
We're craving these things.

1251
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:08,360
We wanted to see if it was possible to pull them off at home.

1252
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:17,320
And that is why all of us, I believe we haven't really talked about it, but there is we all attempted to make at home Ronto wraps.

1253
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:19,320
We're correct.

1254
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:21,220
Oh, did everybody give it a shot?

1255
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:22,560
Yes, I tried.

1256
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:24,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1257
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:27,640
Well, that's that's what I'm I'm curious about.

1258
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:30,780
How how skilled were we?

1259
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:39,020
Did anyone get to the car levels or I should say the actual chef who is eight DG eight?

1260
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:43,180
Did anyone feel like an eight DG eight G J eight?

1261
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:45,840
Are you more of a one D one eight?

1262
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:50,320
I certainly stressed myself out doing it.

1263
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:53,880
Yeah, because I went to here.

1264
01:00:53,920 --> 01:01:00,120
I went to two grocery stores to obtain the ingredients, some of the ingredients, some of this I already had in the house.

1265
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:03,520
And you're not going to be shocked by what I had in the house.

1266
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:05,500
Ronto meat, Ronto meat already.

1267
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:06,260
Basically.

1268
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:09,260
So I went to two stores.

1269
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:10,360
I came home.

1270
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:15,560
I cooked it and I took I rushed to take pictures of it.

1271
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:19,700
And and then I was just so hungry.

1272
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:20,780
I'm like eating it.

1273
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:27,620
And I was like, should I take a more picture like and the other qualifier, I am awful at taking pictures of food.

1274
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:30,300
I want to say that right off the gate.

1275
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:30,680
Yeah.

1276
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:33,540
So I don't think I sold mine necessarily either.

1277
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:36,660
Yeah, mine looks so pathetic and sad.

1278
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:38,340
Yeah.

1279
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:39,660
Yeah, this is so this whole thing.

1280
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:47,040
I mean, I don't know if we're making this an official contest or if just someone will be confident enough to say that they are the winner at least.

1281
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:48,240
I mean, what a way in.

1282
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,760
That's my that's been my guess.

1283
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:57,780
So Zani is a real like, you know, griller and meat smoker like like you you have prepared.

1284
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:02,340
I've had delicious things you've prepared before wings and I think brisket.

1285
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:06,640
Yeah, so well, but this is very indicative of my personality at large.

1286
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:13,500
S.

1287
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:12,660
If we were to be able to meet in person, I know not everybody's A.

1288
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:12,820
S.

1289
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:13,500
two weeks.

1290
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:18,860
But I would I was going to go to like get this special meat.

1291
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:20,220
I was going to smoke the dogs.

1292
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:22,860
I was going to get this like special pita bread, do all this stuff.

1293
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:25,620
And then I was going to make the slaw from like scratch, like Dillis lock.

1294
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:28,780
But I went with a different route because I'm just making it for myself.

1295
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:34,300
And so what I did is I and I have it right here because I have not eaten mine yet.

1296
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:34,880
Oh, wow.

1297
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:35,500
Oh, smart.

1298
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,400
We should all show tonight.

1299
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:37,340
Yeah, I took it.

1300
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:39,020
I took a cheesy Gordina crunch.

1301
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:40,240
Whoa.

1302
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:42,740
Oh, yeah, you win.

1303
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:43,220
You win.

1304
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:43,640
You win.

1305
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:49,860
And then I went to Venus, it's all and I got the Aussie dog, which has an a only horseradish sauce.

1306
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:51,240
Sauce.

1307
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:53,620
This is a much smarter approach.

1308
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:54,120
So much.

1309
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:57,160
And I just put the I put the dog.

1310
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:58,700
I didn't even I was going to take the meat out.

1311
01:02:58,760 --> 01:02:59,180
I was like, I don't know.

1312
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:00,740
I'm just going to leave the taco meat in.

1313
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:03,140
And and I did that.

1314
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:05,800
So I have a little Frankenstein thing and I'm going to take a bite right now.

1315
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:06,480
I'll tell you how it is.

1316
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:07,460
I'll get away from camera.

1317
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:12,740
This is like and I hate to use the other star reference, but this is like Kirk beating the Kobayashi Maru.

1318
01:03:12,940 --> 01:03:16,020
This is a cheating situation where he has won.

1319
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:17,280
But at what cost?

1320
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:18,560
Yeah, yeah.

1321
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:19,900
To himself potentially.

1322
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:21,820
But at what cost for us?

1323
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:25,220
Because I just have a giant bag of like dollar seventy coleslaw.

1324
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:28,820
I have a massive bag of cabbage in the fridge now.

1325
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,300
I don't know what to do with you.

1326
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:32,200
Throw it away at a dollar seventy.

1327
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:33,200
Throw it away.

1328
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:34,100
No.

1329
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:35,460
Costco Cabot.

1330
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:37,520
Jason Costco Cabot Sheridan.

1331
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,900
Jane better at preparing stuff with vegetables.

1332
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:44,900
So I'm sure she will cook up, figure out a nice salad and toss it with others.

1333
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:52,640
All right, Matt, the reaction I as a bit, I was like going to like, oh, I'm going to like like throw up or not.

1334
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:54,680
That was really good.

1335
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:57,660
And of course, it was good.

1336
01:03:57,860 --> 01:04:01,120
And I'd already to crunch one of the best pieces of food you can eat.

1337
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:08,620
And it's the it's the cheesy, gritty, crunch sauce that actually does really feel like the peppercorn sauce in a in a Rondo.

1338
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:09,300
That's really good.

1339
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:13,860
The Aussie dog's a little too spicy because the Rondo dog's not that spicy.

1340
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:16,540
But that's not that far off.

1341
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:18,060
It's it's definitely a cheap.

1342
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:26,280
But boy, does that like if I close my eyes and I can I can see eight DG seven eight or whatever his name is just like rolling his dog.

1343
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:27,940
I don't think that's pretty good.

1344
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:28,680
Seventy nine.

1345
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:31,400
I mean, I think that I think I think that was a good idea.

1346
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:35,780
But I will say you put almost any piece of food inside a cheese gritty to crunch and it's delicious.

1347
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:36,680
There's no way.

1348
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:37,180
Yes.

1349
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:37,680
Cheesy good.

1350
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:46,300
I mean, I think your Dita Crunch shell sauce cheese literally can take almost anything edible or not and make it really delicious.

1351
01:04:47,060 --> 01:04:52,400
I mean, get that Popeyes chicken sandwich, cut that patty in half, put that in there and call it the yip yip or the tip.

1352
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:55,000
So that'd be good.

1353
01:04:55,220 --> 01:04:56,040
That sandwich.

1354
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,440
The chicken sandwich is good.

1355
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:58,720
The fish sandwich is also good.

1356
01:04:58,880 --> 01:04:59,900
Way too big, though.

1357
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:01,800
Yeah, you can't have that much fish.

1358
01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:02,740
It's like that's a bit much.

1359
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,800
It's too much breading and bread and everything.

1360
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,540
Yeah, this is so smart.

1361
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:07,860
This is so smart what you've done.

1362
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:10,320
And you've also you defied our expectations.

1363
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:14,940
Yeah, we were thinking that you were going to like hustle it out for 14 hours,

1364
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,880
slaving away with the right juices and for no reason for absolutely no for yourself.

1365
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,880
Like that's closer to what we did, although we didn't put that much effort into it.

1366
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:26,860
I'm sure you would have done great if you did it, Matt.

1367
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:29,800
But that's so this is a brilliant execution.

1368
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:38,880
Matt, Matt put his targeting system away and just felt it and fired the first on your feet.

1369
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:43,480
I'll be one told to close his eyes and concentrate and not worry too much like we did.

1370
01:05:44,180 --> 01:05:48,200
We all blew up in our X wings on our Death Star trench run.

1371
01:05:48,940 --> 01:05:53,480
And Lazzani just closed his eyes and zend his way into blowing it up.

1372
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:55,840
We have to talk about our oh, sorry.

1373
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:56,520
Oh, yeah, go ahead.

1374
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:57,600
No, but please talk.

1375
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:00,920
I want to I want to hear everybody else like theirs or didn't like theirs.

1376
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:02,480
I know that the preparation was hard.

1377
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:03,620
How was the landing?

1378
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:07,960
Well, Jason, do you do we miss steps of yours?

1379
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:10,320
What you want to finish out the tail?

1380
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:19,980
Yeah, let me let me walk everyone through this because I was trying to do this in a way where a listener who could get to like a Ralphs or, you know, which is owned by Kroger.

1381
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:28,400
I was trying to do this in a way where it's like, OK, I'm going to try to replicate this with I am a reasonably good cook,

1382
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:33,420
but I was trying to replicate it with like ingredients you could get between a Kroger and a Trader Joe's.

1383
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:37,760
So I already had Hillshire Farms smoked sausage in the house.

1384
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:38,840
Surprising.

1385
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:43,920
And that's what I'm pretty sure the sausage is not that brand necessarily.

1386
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:49,460
I think it's a smoked sausage link and I had a chunk of rope sausage left.

1387
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:50,720
So that's what I use.

1388
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:56,960
So do you always have sausage like a like a like a bunch of links like a dog?

1389
01:06:57,020 --> 01:06:58,800
It's like a dog's dream of stealing.

1390
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:00,960
Do you always have this in the house?

1391
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:01,880
I don't always have.

1392
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:09,500
Well, I buy the rope sausage sometimes and cut it into pieces and then freeze some of it and then use some of it within a couple of days.

1393
01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:11,140
I've been over there a while.

1394
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:16,760
It's like that Seinfeld episode where Newman and Kramer are making sausages and it's hanging everywhere in your house.

1395
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:19,560
I've seen it.

1396
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:23,360
So they're dancing, dancing, making sausages.

1397
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:29,300
So I use that for the sausage for the wrap itself.

1398
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:31,240
I find PETA.

1399
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:33,280
You get two things with store bought PETA.

1400
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:38,120
It either like it's the stuff from the grocery store that kind of keeps forever.

1401
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:45,280
It's not super flavorful or the Trader Joe's PETA is pretty good, but it goes bad immediately.

1402
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:48,820
Like once they scan out the cash register, it starts to go bad.

1403
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:51,260
So I tried these.

1404
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:52,740
These are really good.

1405
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:58,040
They label them as Middle Eastern style flatbreads and it's a little chewier.

1406
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:03,260
It's kind of like something you might get at a kebab place.

1407
01:08:03,820 --> 01:08:05,220
And that was pretty good.

1408
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:06,840
I did the same thing.

1409
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:07,740
That was part of mine.

1410
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:08,240
They were great.

1411
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:12,020
I threw them in the oven on one of the passes and yeah, agreed.

1412
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:13,100
Yeah, ingredient.

1413
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:21,520
By the way, I would say the fast food idea first came from was like, you know, I got to get the PETA bread from I got to go to Zanku Chicken.

1414
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:25,160
And then when the PETA bread they give you there, that's what I'm going to use.

1415
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,020
And I'm like, wait a second.

1416
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:30,380
If I would do that, I don't want to have a nice source everything from fast food places.

1417
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:31,840
That is good.

1418
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,600
But yeah, great.

1419
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,900
Great PETA bread if it comes with your chicken there.

1420
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:37,940
Yes, I agree.

1421
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:48,360
For the slaw mix, I just bought a generic bag of coleslaw mix, green cabbage and carrots, tossed it with vinegar, olive oil, salt and pepper.

1422
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:49,520
That was fine.

1423
01:08:49,580 --> 01:08:52,520
I should have let it sit in the fridge and marinate for a little while.

1424
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:57,100
OK, so here's my big take on the other ingredients.

1425
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:09,400
I always thought the white sauce, the peppercorn sauce, originally they called a clutch sauce on the website, which is another name for Alabama white barbecue sauce, which I don't know how to make.

1426
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:18,620
I mean, most sauces are just some combination of like different of like milk yogurt, mayonnaise oil or vinegar, different portions.

1427
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:22,380
So I always thought it kind of reminded me of ranch.

1428
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:26,120
I didn't want to end up with a big bottle of peppercorn dressing or peppercorn ranch.

1429
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:32,300
So I bought the packet of ranch mix and then made that ranch dressing mix.

1430
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:33,880
That's pretty simple.

1431
01:09:33,980 --> 01:09:37,020
It's just milk mayonnaise and then the ranch mix.

1432
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:38,720
So I made that.

1433
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,540
It's a little too powerful.

1434
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:44,940
I kept adding black pepper to it, but the ranch flavor was just overwhelming it.

1435
01:09:44,940 --> 01:09:53,480
And then I am not a big fan of the roast pork slice they use at the park, but I do like carnitas a lot.

1436
01:09:53,480 --> 01:10:00,360
So I bought the Trader Joe's like brick of carnitas that they sell that you microwave and then pull it apart with works.

1437
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:02,200
That is delicious.

1438
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:04,840
And so that's what I used for the pork element.

1439
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:07,380
What does everybody in general think of that?

1440
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:08,680
That step of it?

1441
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:17,280
Like, like, is it crucial that there be this like the main thing is a big sausage much longer than the pita hanging off of it.

1442
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:24,080
And then in the middle, there's like a thin but still a little thick like extra piece of pork like wrapping it.

1443
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:26,420
And do does that seem like crucial to you?

1444
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:30,820
Or if they suddenly said we're discontinuing that part, would you be like, good, less pork?

1445
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:36,460
It's there's some texture, but I don't think it's the most flavorful thing.

1446
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:45,500
Yeah, I think I and it's funny because I think the last few times I've had the vegetarian one, so I don't even remember that.

1447
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:48,580
They don't give you anything extra in there for the veggie one.

1448
01:10:49,060 --> 01:10:49,320
I'm trying to remember.

1449
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:50,220
I'm trying to remember.

1450
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:53,960
I think you get like cucumbers and stuff on top.

1451
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:55,460
There's like there's an extra veggie.

1452
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:56,680
Yeah, yeah.

1453
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:58,520
There's some crunch or something in there.

1454
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:03,580
So obviously, like if a vegetarian is missing from the vegetarian and I really like the vegetarian, I don't think it's crucial.

1455
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:07,340
Yeah, my gut tells me like I would like it.

1456
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:08,700
I mean, it just sounds good.

1457
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:15,840
And I think it does like the I think but I do think it's probably more for texture, which I think is because it gives your gives your pita a little snap, right?

1458
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:19,360
Gives it a little extra feedback when you bite through.

1459
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:25,260
So, you know, you feel a little, you know, you feel a little mean like Subalba like you're you're like, you know, gnawing at the competition.

1460
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:26,860
And it's more fun that way.

1461
01:11:26,860 --> 01:11:33,160
I think it's good for that sort of like medieval feeling of just, yeah, a whole bunch of meat of all different varieties.

1462
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:33,680
Yeah.

1463
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:34,600
Jamming it in.

1464
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,020
Some might say a little resistance, if you will.

1465
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:41,460
Some might.

1466
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:42,340
Some might say that.

1467
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:49,740
Is that's what we're waiting for here?

1468
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:52,240
Well, let me let me pull up my pictures.

1469
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:53,800
I thought it tasted good.

1470
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:57,600
I mean, it's kind of hard to mess up with that much pork.

1471
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:58,900
I mean, it's a smaller portion.

1472
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:01,640
You can see the scored sausage.

1473
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:05,600
I only used a little slaw.

1474
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:08,660
Like, this is a thicker sausage.

1475
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:10,900
You know, it's a chunk of the rope sausage.

1476
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:12,740
Here's what it looks like from the side.

1477
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:16,160
And here's a cut it.

1478
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:16,960
Here's a bisection.

1479
01:12:17,020 --> 01:12:18,820
Yeah, the bisection doesn't look great.

1480
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:21,720
But like food bloggers do that.

1481
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:26,500
And I don't I don't see the appeal, but I thought it tasted pretty good.

1482
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:32,820
I mean, again, I was starving after I did all this, so I was very excited to have this meal.

1483
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:34,500
I don't know.

1484
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:35,940
I feel about this ranch component.

1485
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:38,860
I don't think that I don't think of that sauce as ranchy.

1486
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:42,040
And I think that I'm just not a big ranch person either.

1487
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:44,820
So I wouldn't have I wouldn't have gone that way with it.

1488
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:46,540
It was definitely my biggest misfire.

1489
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:47,660
Scott, you're totally right.

1490
01:12:47,660 --> 01:12:54,160
I should have just bought a bottle of like the Gerard's peppercorn dressing or Ken's peppercorn.

1491
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:55,160
Some peppercorn.

1492
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:56,860
Yeah, because what is peppercorn sauce?

1493
01:12:57,140 --> 01:13:01,620
And yeah, but I don't I don't really that would just sit in the fridge forever.

1494
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:04,280
Like, that was my other thought.

1495
01:13:04,540 --> 01:13:11,060
It's like, well, now I have a I will I'm still eating carnitas because it makes so much.

1496
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:12,360
Yeah, it's going to go for a while.

1497
01:13:12,460 --> 01:13:13,040
Yeah, yeah.

1498
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:15,860
Yeah, I got a lot of extra at this point.

1499
01:13:15,860 --> 01:13:17,820
Yeah, but it was very good.

1500
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:21,140
Actually, what I used it with was another one of those flatbreads.

1501
01:13:21,140 --> 01:13:23,020
They have this eggplant pepper spread.

1502
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:28,860
And I did some slices of sharp cheddar and kind of made a little pizza in a toaster.

1503
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:31,200
And that was that was pretty good.

1504
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:32,500
Pretty good.

1505
01:13:32,940 --> 01:13:33,840
That sounds good.

1506
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:44,760
Yeah, I feel I feel the ranch might be a little the tang of the ranch might feel different than the than the but I couldn't quite if I was going to pull it from scratch,

1507
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:47,740
I couldn't quite say what that peppercorn sauce tastes like.

1508
01:13:47,740 --> 01:13:48,840
It's been a while since I had it.

1509
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:50,020
But yes, I know.

1510
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:53,220
I remember I think that was my thinking, too.

1511
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:56,640
It's like I can't quite remember because it's been so long.

1512
01:13:57,460 --> 01:14:02,480
And my one complaint any time I've had it is like not enough sauce on this.

1513
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,260
It's getting a little dry by the end.

1514
01:14:04,460 --> 01:14:07,400
But I think if you're I feel you on that.

1515
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:11,800
But then you can end up with sort of the you know, they kind of serve it on some parchment paper kind of stuff.

1516
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:14,000
And you can end up that can end up pretty wet.

1517
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:15,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1518
01:14:15,180 --> 01:14:19,300
I don't want the dried rather have less sauce that end up in a drippy zone.

1519
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:19,880
Yeah.

1520
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:32,520
By the way, the Ronto list garden wrap is listed as plant based sausage, spicy kimchi slaw, sweet pickled cucumber, plant based gochu Chang spread wrapped in pita.

1521
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:37,320
So that one definitely gets a little messy at the end.

1522
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:40,020
But yeah, really, really flavorful.

1523
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:42,240
Yes, for sure.

1524
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:45,140
So so like I would say mild.

1525
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:50,640
Is there like a Star Wars way to rank your confidence in your own?

1526
01:14:51,940 --> 01:14:56,300
I don't know what what in universe is the way to do it.

1527
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:04,240
Um, I would give it a well, I mean, it tasted great.

1528
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:05,960
I don't know.

1529
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:07,960
It tasted reasonably accurate.

1530
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:08,560
I don't know.

1531
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:08,920
I don't know.

1532
01:15:08,980 --> 01:15:09,600
Star Wars ranking.

1533
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:21,140
I would give it a return of the Jedi like some fun stuff, but not the home run or grand slam as a new Hope or Empire Strikes Back.

1534
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:22,360
Hmm.

1535
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:22,800
Hmm.

1536
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:23,340
Oh, interesting.

1537
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:23,840
We got to go.

1538
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:25,660
We got to go analog to movies.

1539
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:28,140
Going first.

1540
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:32,060
Well, let me double back to mine then since I've since I kind of talked about it rated a little bit.

1541
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:33,700
I'm very happy with my taste.

1542
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:36,940
I do think it was like outside of the box.

1543
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:40,700
I think it's not canon necessarily because there's a little bit of a cheat.

1544
01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:42,040
I went a little bit on the dark side.

1545
01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:45,620
I'm going to give mine a Knights of the Old Republic.

1546
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:49,500
I think it's a very fun, enjoyable thing.

1547
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:51,740
And I think anybody would enjoy it.

1548
01:15:51,740 --> 01:15:54,200
But also don't expect it to be like a real Rondo rap.

1549
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:57,520
It's not like a canon movie, but you're going to have a hell of a time.

1550
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:00,660
You know about Revan, which means you're going to be on this side of the gate.

1551
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:03,940
So, yeah, this is definitely a Knights of the Old Republic.

1552
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:04,620
Mine.

1553
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:05,320
All right.

1554
01:16:06,260 --> 01:16:06,660
Hmm.

1555
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:08,080
Yeah, that makes sense.

1556
01:16:08,420 --> 01:16:08,840
Good rating.

1557
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:09,300
Good rating.

1558
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:11,340
Should I go next?

1559
01:16:11,620 --> 01:16:12,020
Sure.

1560
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:14,720
At least this year's was more disastrous.

1561
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:16,620
Is it better to end with a disaster?

1562
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:20,480
I feel like it's a disaster, but I don't know.

1563
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:21,600
Maybe I'm being dramatic.

1564
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:22,580
I'm not sure.

1565
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:24,360
Well, you're you're in it.

1566
01:16:24,460 --> 01:16:24,700
Just.

1567
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:25,240
Yeah.

1568
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:25,400
Yeah.

1569
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:26,340
You take it.

1570
01:16:26,340 --> 01:16:27,160
Take a look at this.

1571
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:27,620
You know what?

1572
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:28,460
This is fellas.

1573
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:29,520
OK.

1574
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:32,840
That's very sad.

1575
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:34,100
I have to say.

1576
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:35,340
Yeah.

1577
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:35,640
Yeah.

1578
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:38,120
I mean, we'll post the picture of this.

1579
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:42,320
Here's what happened.

1580
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:44,440
I had the whole I had like one of these recipes

1581
01:16:45,140 --> 01:16:49,620
bookmarked and I got to the store and I went, oh, my God, there are 25 ingredients to this recipe.

1582
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:51,420
I cannot do this.

1583
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:52,460
This is impossible.

1584
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:53,380
How am I going to do this?

1585
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:54,100
All right.

1586
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:55,760
I'll start start combining steps.

1587
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:57,260
I really like, OK, I can get Pete I had to go.

1588
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:58,220
I did to Target.

1589
01:16:58,360 --> 01:16:59,960
I did Ralph's

1590
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:04,500
for the just bought coleslaw instead of just like slaw,

1591
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:06,920
which is a big mistake.

1592
01:17:06,980 --> 01:17:09,340
But I felt like it's close, close enough.

1593
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:14,400
I made I made peppercorn

1594
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:19,500
sauce out of ranch and peppercorn, which I like ranch.

1595
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:21,760
I combine the two of them.

1596
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:23,200
The sauce is fine.

1597
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:31,420
And I had a it's a vegetarian sausage, which I like the one at Disney fine.

1598
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:37,320
And I feel like though, anytime vegetarian meat and it's very it's tough.

1599
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:41,060
You really need to know something's good because it's I don't know.

1600
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:44,720
It's just it's like I almost would rather it just be its own thing

1601
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:46,620
than try to pretend it's meat.

1602
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:47,320
Very often.

1603
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:48,400
Yeah, I felt that way.

1604
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:50,720
And I hadn't tried this and I forget the brand.

1605
01:17:50,740 --> 01:17:51,800
I don't want to trash this brand.

1606
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:54,900
It wasn't bad, but it's just like one of those things where like falls apart

1607
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:57,520
in your mouth and your brain is like, this isn't a sausage.

1608
01:17:57,980 --> 01:18:04,140
There is a vegetarian Italian sausage that you could fool me that I would think it was meat.

1609
01:18:04,140 --> 01:18:05,280
It is so good.

1610
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:06,540
I forget.

1611
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:07,860
Pretty easy.

1612
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:09,860
Yeah, I like impossible meat.

1613
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:10,880
Yes.

1614
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:11,720
For the most part.

1615
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:14,800
And that's that fools me most of the time.

1616
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:17,280
But I ate this and it was sad.

1617
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:18,600
It was real pathetic.

1618
01:18:19,340 --> 01:18:20,960
It's a single man.

1619
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:22,780
It's a single man meal.

1620
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:29,780
I'm a bad cook in general, but this really when I looked at what I had done was a new low for me.

1621
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:37,820
So I don't know, I would rate mine maybe like the scene in solo where they name him solo because he's alone.

1622
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:41,900
That would be my rating for what I did here.

1623
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:50,600
Well, it doesn't make sense to me how I'm I'm looking at what you made and I'm saying this is a single man meal and it's sad.

1624
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:58,160
Mazzani went to two fast food places, put one in the other and I'm like, victory, a great achievement of man.

1625
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:01,020
I'm not sure why that is, but I think you would agree.

1626
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:02,180
Oh, I 100 percent agree.

1627
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:03,920
Yeah, I was thrilled when he showed that.

1628
01:19:04,020 --> 01:19:07,660
I mean, he's a big cheater, but it was a fantastic idea.

1629
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:09,660
There was never rules, though.

1630
01:19:09,660 --> 01:19:10,120
No rules.

1631
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:12,000
He didn't even really say make it.

1632
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:12,700
That's true.

1633
01:19:12,940 --> 01:19:13,100
No.

1634
01:19:14,260 --> 01:19:16,480
In fact, I made a point.

1635
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:25,260
I made mine like a number of days, like six or seven days ago, because I'm like, I'm going to make this and get it done before we start putting rules on this and I have to make it again.

1636
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:37,780
I guess I can I can go into mine, which now I just want to breeze through because the contest has been won, I feel.

1637
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:49,600
So, I mean, like, all right, I'm trying to base it on there's an unofficial Star Wars cookbook by somebody named Ashley Kraft, where apparently this she seems to have gotten it pretty right.

1638
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:51,140
And there's a website, Ashleycrafted.

1639
01:19:51,140 --> 01:19:51,580
com.

1640
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:54,920
This she seems to know what she's talking about.

1641
01:19:55,260 --> 01:20:02,080
Something that doesn't is the official Galaxy's Edge cookbook, which they have a Ronto rep and it's just nonsense.

1642
01:20:02,260 --> 01:20:04,600
This is like, did anybody run across this?

1643
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:07,320
This is like it's chorizo.

1644
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:09,340
It's like some weird taco situation.

1645
01:20:09,340 --> 01:20:09,620
Right.

1646
01:20:09,940 --> 01:20:09,940
Right.

1647
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:10,640
I saw that.

1648
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:12,140
What are you talking about?

1649
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:12,700
Yeah.

1650
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:16,700
This is like earlier in the pandemic when they're like, make Dole Whip at home.

1651
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:19,140
OK, first off, get vanilla ice cream.

1652
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:20,820
No, no, get out of here.

1653
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:22,300
There's no dairy and Dole Whip.

1654
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:24,020
That's the big part of it.

1655
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:25,460
Oh, interesting.

1656
01:20:25,820 --> 01:20:26,120
Huh.

1657
01:20:26,540 --> 01:20:33,300
Maybe they just are they not wanting to give away secrets is that kind of maybe that's what maybe there's also weird.

1658
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:36,740
Baccar is referenced in this copy.

1659
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:38,820
I'm realizing it's kind of small.

1660
01:20:38,820 --> 01:20:40,520
It's a little hard to read.

1661
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:44,760
Baccar ain't too eager to share his family secret spice blend.

1662
01:20:44,780 --> 01:20:47,980
That's why the Baccar is not given his recipe out.

1663
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:51,140
But I've managed to I don't know who wrote this.

1664
01:20:51,260 --> 01:20:52,800
Somebody wrote the Star Wars book.

1665
01:20:53,560 --> 01:21:01,640
I'm willing to admit that my version ain't quite as sublime as Baccar's, but smother it in enough chatty and dressing and dressing next to apostrophe.

1666
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:03,220
And you'll barely notice the difference.

1667
01:21:03,580 --> 01:21:04,080
I don't know.

1668
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:05,220
I don't like this.

1669
01:21:05,620 --> 01:21:06,140
What?

1670
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:07,520
What an insane.

1671
01:21:07,820 --> 01:21:09,700
You're this the official book, right?

1672
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:10,460
Yeah.

1673
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:11,880
Disney put this out.

1674
01:21:11,980 --> 01:21:15,700
So their official line is like, well, we can't get the recipe.

1675
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:17,320
So here's a fake recipe.

1676
01:21:17,780 --> 01:21:20,300
This is not even remotely the same genre.

1677
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:22,920
It's just not the same thing at all.

1678
01:21:23,180 --> 01:21:25,000
Yeah, these are like these look like tacos.

1679
01:21:25,100 --> 01:21:28,320
Like they're like they're like tacos with guacamole on it.

1680
01:21:28,340 --> 01:21:28,620
Yeah.

1681
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:32,820
Which if you're going to involve tacos, then just do it from Taco Bell.

1682
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:34,840
Yeah, with the right taco way.

1683
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:36,820
I did see a disclaimer.

1684
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:44,720
I think either on there was a Ronto wrap recipe that was reprinted on the Today Show website, oddly enough.

1685
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:49,300
But then there was something similar on the Food Network website that had a disclaimer.

1686
01:21:49,820 --> 01:21:54,340
This was prepared or submitted by a chef or food preparation professional.

1687
01:21:54,940 --> 01:21:59,740
We cannot guarantee the same result if you try to cook it at home.

1688
01:21:59,740 --> 01:22:06,960
And I'm wondering if the Star Wars cookbook, it's like, well, people have to make this in a home kitchen, not a consumer grade kitchen.

1689
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:09,520
So what can they get and what can they do?

1690
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:12,240
You know, let's like step it down a little.

1691
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:13,160
Let's step it down.

1692
01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:14,920
Well, look, that makes sense.

1693
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:22,660
And that ties into my situation because here I am doing it just like really methodically and like, OK, so the right.

1694
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:29,820
And the slaw that needs to have apple cider vinegar and Dijon mustard and the and the Middle Eastern flatbread will do.

1695
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:35,200
That will be my replacement for not realizing you could like what I could do, whatever I wanted.

1696
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:40,320
Why am I being so slavish to the one thing I did?

1697
01:22:40,340 --> 01:22:45,840
Here's my take on the sauce, because I started seeing what was listed in her site and Ashley's sauce.

1698
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:51,360
And I'm like, isn't most of this in Tzatziki because I'm seeing cucumbers in there.

1699
01:22:51,420 --> 01:22:52,780
I'm seeing dill.

1700
01:22:53,660 --> 01:22:54,240
You know what?

1701
01:22:54,340 --> 01:22:55,880
I think that and is it maybe it's yogurt.

1702
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,940
So I just went with that Tzatziki from Trader Joe's.

1703
01:22:59,020 --> 01:23:01,040
I did a lot of a lot of Trader Joe's.

1704
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:08,020
I decided I was not going to do I'm not going to make to like pork things from scratch.

1705
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:08,540
Why?

1706
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:09,840
That seems like a lot.

1707
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:17,860
And my friends at Cheesemongers Sherman Oaks had sliced porchetta, which is not what is on the thing.

1708
01:23:17,900 --> 01:23:19,840
But it like I don't think I've had it before.

1709
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:20,880
It looked really good.

1710
01:23:20,980 --> 01:23:22,280
It was very good.

1711
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:23,320
This is fantastic.

1712
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:24,620
It's more like cured meat.

1713
01:23:24,780 --> 01:23:25,420
It's Italian.

1714
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:30,680
Probably anybody with any culinary knowledge is saying this is not the same thing at all.

1715
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:33,100
This is not replaced like essentially part of a pork chop.

1716
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:36,280
But whatever I wanted like something thinner, a different texture.

1717
01:23:36,780 --> 01:23:38,180
And this fit the bill.

1718
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:39,160
I thought it was great.

1719
01:23:40,220 --> 01:23:50,420
And then I get into the sausage situation and I'm thinking, well, really what you know, like somebody like buying props for Galaxy's Edge, like authenticity is the key you see.

1720
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:58,460
And I went back to when they announced all of the food for Galaxy's Edge, like when they had all the nice like, you know, really manicured photos.

1721
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:00,400
I was mainly paying attention to the beer and the wine.

1722
01:24:00,540 --> 01:24:03,580
I kind of skipped past what the what the food was going to be.

1723
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:10,380
But I saw that in a really early press release, they called it a Portuguese sausage.

1724
01:24:11,020 --> 01:24:12,780
That's sort of stricken from the record now.

1725
01:24:12,820 --> 01:24:14,100
You don't always see that now.

1726
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:21,560
But I thought maybe that's the key because I think if I get some Italian thing, it might end up just like maybe you're not going to get that color.

1727
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:23,900
You're not going to get the spice potentially.

1728
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:27,440
I mean, there probably are spicy sausages, but I'm just like now.

1729
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:29,100
And now I was just fixated on it.

1730
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:31,240
I got to do Portuguese sausage.

1731
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:33,760
So where am I going to get that?

1732
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:40,400
I found a specialty sausage place that's kind of between Glendale and Montrose drove out there.

1733
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:43,240
They said they have Portuguese sausage on the website.

1734
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:45,220
This is a fine establishment, by the way.

1735
01:24:45,220 --> 01:24:45,980
I had lunch there.

1736
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:48,360
Really liked to Shriner's fine sausages.

1737
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:50,920
Highly recommended in the Glendale area.

1738
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:52,980
So I drive out there.

1739
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:55,100
Hello, Portuguese sausage, please.

1740
01:24:55,540 --> 01:24:57,000
I don't think so.

1741
01:24:57,320 --> 01:24:58,080
Like, oh, dang.

1742
01:24:58,300 --> 01:24:59,340
Well, they have it frozen.

1743
01:24:59,340 --> 01:25:11,440
They have one package for actually they have a lot of packages frozen, which makes me think that the Portuguese sausage Linguisa is not necessarily the most like, you know, like flying off the trucks item.

1744
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:12,940
So now I get concerned.

1745
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:16,840
Is there a problem with Linguisa to people not like Linguisa?

1746
01:25:16,940 --> 01:25:18,340
I love Linguisa.

1747
01:25:18,620 --> 01:25:19,820
Have you had Linguisa before?

1748
01:25:19,980 --> 01:25:21,160
I have had Linguisa before.

1749
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:25,040
Yeah, I forget where I have had Portuguese.

1750
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:25,720
You know what?

1751
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:29,620
That was a thing they were pushing at the Disneyland Resort for a while.

1752
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:36,340
I think that was one of the items at Tangerara Terrace you could get as a breakfast meat.

1753
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:38,720
It was like bacon and Portuguese sausage.

1754
01:25:39,940 --> 01:25:41,640
Is Linguisa tongue meat?

1755
01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:44,620
I don't know.

1756
01:25:44,740 --> 01:25:45,960
Maybe not necessarily.

1757
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:48,240
Because it'd be like you think of it like Linguas.

1758
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:51,280
Yeah, you get Linguas and that is not from the same.

1759
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:52,760
Could be.

1760
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:56,460
Now I don't know how I feel if that was a bunch of tongue meat.

1761
01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:03,840
I can imagine it's one of those, you know, crazy, it's, you know, it's a big creature walking around stomping around.

1762
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:04,520
That's cool.

1763
01:26:04,820 --> 01:26:13,140
But I think it's too soft for sausage filling and usually stewed or braised or boiled, I think.

1764
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:14,000
Yeah.

1765
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:14,340
Okay.

1766
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:14,940
Interesting.

1767
01:26:15,740 --> 01:26:18,000
Anyway, I was seeing that makes sense.

1768
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:22,060
If Disney had ever flirted with Linguisa before, maybe that is what they're eating.

1769
01:26:22,060 --> 01:26:25,540
Maybe they are doing something in the Portuguese, the Linguisa family.

1770
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:27,040
But I get the thing.

1771
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:27,660
It's frozen.

1772
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:29,200
And then I get it home.

1773
01:26:29,980 --> 01:26:35,340
And now I have to bring Erin, my wife, into the story who is a vegetarian and doesn't know anything about anything.

1774
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:40,420
And she's concerned with the whole notion that I'm going to be cooking a bunch of meat in the kitchen and ruining the kitchen.

1775
01:26:40,420 --> 01:26:44,900
While she takes care of the baby and probably cleans up the mess that I make after.

1776
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,880
And she's like, wait a minute, are these cooked or is this raw?

1777
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:50,740
Is this raw frozen sausage?

1778
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,200
I think it's cooked probably.

1779
01:26:52,460 --> 01:26:55,480
And then I thought, and it is raw meat inside, clearly.

1780
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:58,040
This is not insane that you would get raw sausage.

1781
01:26:58,160 --> 01:27:02,800
But what do I know about, like, I've never, I don't cook meat at home ever.

1782
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:05,400
I cook meat maybe once every two years.

1783
01:27:05,620 --> 01:27:06,300
This never happens.

1784
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:10,140
What have I gotten myself into now where I have to like, I have to learn a process.

1785
01:27:10,140 --> 01:27:15,900
I have to learn how to make like, I have to look up how to cook raw sausage.

1786
01:27:16,020 --> 01:27:17,840
It's kind of this two step process.

1787
01:27:18,180 --> 01:27:19,420
Has anybody done this before?

1788
01:27:19,740 --> 01:27:20,180
Yes.

1789
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:21,100
You've done.

1790
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:23,280
OK, that's the sausage king.

1791
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:25,980
Did you find it difficult?

1792
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:30,200
Well, I usually it's a raw Italian sausage and I cook it.

1793
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:37,320
So what I think my dad taught me this, you just like raw Italian sausage.

1794
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:50,240
If you sear it on each side, like a few minutes on each side and then toss it in a pot of tomato sauce and cook it real low for an hour or longer or like, you know, half a day.

1795
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:52,860
If it's in a crock pot, it'll cook all the way through.

1796
01:27:52,860 --> 01:27:58,120
I think if you were just cooking sausage without the sauce, I would probably suggest either.

1797
01:27:58,900 --> 01:28:00,880
I don't know that you want to boil raw sausage.

1798
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:04,560
I think bratwurst you can boil first and then cook it in the pan.

1799
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:12,580
I would have suggested cooking it in the oven or a toaster oven for a short while and then finishing it in the pan or on a grill.

1800
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:17,920
I think you can cook it raw, defrost it in the fridge and then cook it right in the grill.

1801
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:19,200
Does that sound right?

1802
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:20,240
That does sound right.

1803
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:28,840
You know, there's a big thing going on right now in the meat world with steaks because it used to the old conventional wisdom used to be sear first and then cook second.

1804
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:31,580
But now finishing with the sear is the new hot thing.

1805
01:28:31,580 --> 01:28:32,240
And I don't know.

1806
01:28:32,260 --> 01:28:33,420
I still like to see her first.

1807
01:28:33,420 --> 01:28:36,840
I think if I was doing a raw sausage, I think I'd do the same thing because I do the same thing.

1808
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:40,040
If it's like in a sauce, you paint, you know, sear in the pan, then you put in the sauce.

1809
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:44,120
But I would see her in a pan that I maybe I put it in an oven after that, like I do a cast iron.

1810
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:46,700
So I take the whole cast iron and put it in the oven.

1811
01:28:47,060 --> 01:28:47,380
Yeah.

1812
01:28:47,380 --> 01:28:48,500
That is a low heat.

1813
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:49,520
You know, huh?

1814
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:50,560
Here's what's happening to me.

1815
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:54,260
I'm sweating as I'm just as this is all being described.

1816
01:28:54,260 --> 01:28:58,400
As you were saying, I wouldn't do this because I did end up boiling like that.

1817
01:28:58,420 --> 01:29:03,180
Like there was kind of a boil for I look up an article on bone app a teeth, which for now I'm doing that.

1818
01:29:03,220 --> 01:29:04,380
I'm on bone app a teeth.

1819
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:06,280
I'm like, I'm like, all right.

1820
01:29:06,380 --> 01:29:10,860
So like, yeah, but it boiled in a bunch of water and then ended up kind of frying it on both sides.

1821
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:16,020
But like I'm stressed about this all day and Aaron stressed about it for me all day.

1822
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:22,280
And I'm saying like, I don't know, wouldn't it be better if I bought one that was already that was, you know, like already grilled or already smoked?

1823
01:29:22,460 --> 01:29:25,440
And Aaron said, you don't know the difference between grilling and smoking, do you?

1824
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:27,520
And I said, no, no, I don't.

1825
01:29:27,740 --> 01:29:29,020
I don't do any of this.

1826
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:32,880
Why did the podcast doesn't need this enough for me to do it?

1827
01:29:32,980 --> 01:29:39,080
And then like right around this time, I watch I've been slowly finally stepping through the Sopranos.

1828
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:45,080
And I ended up on the season two finale of the Sopranos where Tony has food poisoning

1829
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:52,280
and he's having lots of terrible nightmares and like assessing a lot in his life while he thinks that he is dying from food poisoning.

1830
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:57,000
And I'm Googling about like, could I poison myself from raw port?

1831
01:29:57,020 --> 01:30:01,160
Like I'm now I'm dovetailing into Tony Sopranos stress.

1832
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:06,480
Like I'm worried now I'm worried I'm going to end up having bizarre stress nightmares where I shoot all of you.

1833
01:30:06,580 --> 01:30:13,340
It's just it's all combining into a terrible stew that seriously I am sweating as I'm describing all of this now.

1834
01:30:13,340 --> 01:30:18,240
As I flashback to what yesterday ended up being, I think you were probably in the same.

1835
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:26,980
My mom has made a couple of dishes where like white meat, it starts by boiling white meat chicken and then baking it in a casserole pan.

1836
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:34,400
So like I don't think it's unheard of to cook raw meat in if you really boil it and then finish it another way.

1837
01:30:34,540 --> 01:30:37,300
You know, you just need the heat to kill anything.

1838
01:30:37,300 --> 01:30:42,160
And several forms of heat give you several passions at which to.

1839
01:30:43,220 --> 01:30:48,580
So, yeah, look, a whole bunch of stress, but I figure out how to make these sausages.

1840
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:49,860
I learn a process.

1841
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:50,900
I get it done.

1842
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,380
I combine everything.

1843
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:56,500
And let me tell you, it ruled.

1844
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:58,540
It was so great.

1845
01:30:58,900 --> 01:30:59,760
It was really great.

1846
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:04,600
And I don't know that I attribute that to myself other than that I figured out how to make myself not die.

1847
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:09,680
But this the linguisa, holy shit, this was a really fantastic food.

1848
01:31:09,780 --> 01:31:15,400
I'm really sold on this when I see this on menus from now on, I'm going to get it the right amount of spice.

1849
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:19,040
It didn't look like a weird pepperoni, like weird other linguisa that I saw.

1850
01:31:19,180 --> 01:31:24,860
I was just worried that I will have made it and it would have just been as thick as a pepperoni and I bite in and it hurts my teeth.

1851
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:26,000
None of this happened.

1852
01:31:26,020 --> 01:31:26,640
It was great.

1853
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:29,000
I'll show you photographs.

1854
01:31:29,060 --> 01:31:34,040
I don't know how much it translates, but like seems pretty decent, right?

1855
01:31:34,820 --> 01:31:36,160
I don't know.

1856
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:39,660
And then you see the thin pork on the side.

1857
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:41,520
I had a little beer with it too.

1858
01:31:41,820 --> 01:31:43,780
It did really transport me.

1859
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:45,360
Let me find more of a close up.

1860
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:46,980
Here's me holding it.

1861
01:31:47,220 --> 01:31:49,420
The proud dad of this sausage.

1862
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:50,840
Like, I don't know.

1863
01:31:51,020 --> 01:31:51,940
Am I crazy?

1864
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:53,260
Does this look garbage?

1865
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,000
That looks great to me.

1866
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,280
I would like to say that you looks like you won, honestly.

1867
01:31:58,940 --> 01:32:03,360
Maybe in the like authentic doing it way.

1868
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:06,740
And Erin did some of this along with me and helped me figure out some of it.

1869
01:32:06,740 --> 01:32:10,900
And she did it with like a with Tofurkey, which was less satisfying as happened with you, Mike.

1870
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:15,100
But, you know, it ended up being pretty solid.

1871
01:32:15,260 --> 01:32:15,740
That's fantastic.

1872
01:32:16,180 --> 01:32:17,860
I went in for a second go at this.

1873
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:21,040
I had it yesterday and then I had it today again.

1874
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:23,820
So I am all hopped up on pork.

1875
01:32:24,020 --> 01:32:25,060
I am porked up.

1876
01:32:25,060 --> 01:32:31,440
I am probably going to pass out as soon as we finish this podcast because so many of my meals have been pork lately.

1877
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,600
But I feel pretty good about it.

1878
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:35,580
Jason is really proud of you, I think, today.

1879
01:32:36,020 --> 01:32:36,540
Wow.

1880
01:32:37,100 --> 01:32:42,080
I mentioned things that you knew and you're able to like where we can compare sausage notes.

1881
01:32:42,180 --> 01:32:45,060
This is like a good bonding level for us.

1882
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:48,600
The sausage king of Burbank has a new protege.

1883
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:56,140
I actually know a different sausage place in Glendale, the border of Glendale and Burbank, and I'm blanking on it.

1884
01:32:56,140 --> 01:33:05,960
It's a German deli and they supply a lot of the like beer halls and beer gardens in L.

1885
01:32:56,140 --> 01:33:06,940
A.

1886
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:06,540
, I think.

1887
01:33:07,640 --> 01:33:10,540
Oh, so there's the restaurants with that theme and they might come from that place.

1888
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:12,840
Hey, Jason, the usual.

1889
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:15,220
Send me up.

1890
01:33:15,220 --> 01:33:15,920
Hello, Jason.

1891
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:16,400
Begay.

1892
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:18,420
It's a scene in the Vandabar.

1893
01:33:18,940 --> 01:33:20,580
Yeah, sure, man.

1894
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:21,920
Sounds good.

1895
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:22,780
Open up the trunk.

1896
01:33:22,980 --> 01:33:24,720
We have the crates for you.

1897
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:32,160
As like they wheel out twenty one at a time in a big rope.

1898
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:34,800
A German Oompa band plays while he's there.

1899
01:33:35,260 --> 01:33:38,220
Some bars will have a stein for you.

1900
01:33:38,220 --> 01:33:40,960
You can join a club and they'll have your stein on a hook.

1901
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:44,020
Mine, it's just like sauce, different sausages.

1902
01:33:44,380 --> 01:33:47,280
Like a bunch of pure sausage.

1903
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:53,960
So you really felt good when we were at that bachelor party when there was that woman that was paddling men for a dollar.

1904
01:33:54,440 --> 01:33:58,000
Yeah, I felt good for a little while until I did not.

1905
01:33:58,320 --> 01:33:58,940
Yeah, right.

1906
01:33:59,280 --> 01:33:59,980
Go back and tie.

1907
01:34:00,060 --> 01:34:01,920
Forget which episode we tell that story on.

1908
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:07,340
Yeah, I so yeah, look, I ended up feeling pretty good about this.

1909
01:34:08,020 --> 01:34:10,340
Shriner's fine sausages free ad for them.

1910
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:13,420
Now I have frozen a couple left over.

1911
01:34:13,420 --> 01:34:16,860
I have frozen sausages in my fridge and I might do this again.

1912
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:18,040
I might do the run.

1913
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:23,200
It ended up with so much effort, but it ended up being worth it, I think.

1914
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:28,800
Except that, like, of course, Matt is still the wit, like, because you didn't have to do any of this.

1915
01:34:28,980 --> 01:34:30,720
No, no, but here's where it comes.

1916
01:34:30,820 --> 01:34:35,120
I love this where it's at, because you I am a Sith Lord and you are a Jedi.

1917
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:41,760
I went to I went the way of the dark side and I but I cheated and I half asked my way to get it and it's delicious.

1918
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:42,200
It works.

1919
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:42,920
I'm powerful.

1920
01:34:43,260 --> 01:34:44,660
But you did the right thing.

1921
01:34:44,660 --> 01:34:46,000
You trained with Master Yoda.

1922
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:50,680
You work through your fears and you came out the other side, a real hero.

1923
01:34:50,700 --> 01:34:52,620
And I think you're the you're the Jedi winner.

1924
01:34:52,740 --> 01:34:54,540
You like you're the you're a Jedi master now.

1925
01:34:54,540 --> 01:34:55,380
You're Obi Wan.

1926
01:34:55,540 --> 01:34:56,020
Yeah.

1927
01:34:56,020 --> 01:34:56,580
Of the pork.

1928
01:34:56,580 --> 01:34:57,400
Oh, my God.

1929
01:34:57,740 --> 01:34:59,200
After all, I get it.

1930
01:34:59,200 --> 01:34:59,500
Whoa.

1931
01:34:59,540 --> 01:35:04,200
And from the person who clearly did the funniest thing, that's an honor.

1932
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:09,020
And there's like an older woman is going to walk by you, Scott, and say like, hey, what's your name?

1933
01:35:09,060 --> 01:35:13,120
And you're holding your Ronto wrap and you're going to say Scott and she's going to go, Scott, who?

1934
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:15,680
And you're going to say Scott Skywalker.

1935
01:35:16,900 --> 01:35:18,960
Scott Sausagemaker.

1936
01:35:19,820 --> 01:35:20,620
Scott Sausagewalker.

1937
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:23,340
Scott Baccar.

1938
01:35:23,980 --> 01:35:25,420
Like, what's your name, Scott?

1939
01:35:25,860 --> 01:35:26,720
What's your last name?

1940
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:28,160
And you already have a mouthful of Ronto.

1941
01:35:31,080 --> 01:35:35,040
And now I'm trying to think of what how to rate it myself.

1942
01:35:35,220 --> 01:35:45,580
And I think like what's coming to mind is with a lot of very sweaty efforts,

1943
01:35:45,740 --> 01:35:53,600
I was able to mechanically recreate something kind of resembling the original, but at what cost?

1944
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:59,760
And that is I can't think of any Star Wars movies where that you would describe it that way.

1945
01:35:59,820 --> 01:36:00,900
Can you?

1946
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:03,380
Well, it's that your Mandalorian.

1947
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:05,160
Your galaxy's edge.

1948
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:06,060
Oh, it's galaxy's edge.

1949
01:36:06,580 --> 01:36:06,580
Yeah.

1950
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:09,360
Oh, why do I get galaxy's edge?

1951
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:10,920
I'll take it.

1952
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:17,540
I like it because your equivalent of grief is taking away the people mover Bonta attraction.

1953
01:36:17,540 --> 01:36:22,940
Like, oh, we don't have the money, but this is so cool.

1954
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:26,680
I know that is you said it's close to something that resembles the real thing.

1955
01:36:26,700 --> 01:36:27,520
But at what cost?

1956
01:36:27,540 --> 01:36:30,900
It's like a four billion dollar part that kind of resembles Star Wars.

1957
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:31,680
It's good enough.

1958
01:36:31,680 --> 01:36:32,920
It makes us kind of happy.

1959
01:36:33,460 --> 01:36:34,780
I think that's galaxy's edge.

1960
01:36:34,820 --> 01:36:36,040
That's what that looks like to me.

1961
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:37,260
And that's a winner in my book.

1962
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:38,520
That's a winner in my book.

1963
01:36:38,540 --> 01:36:43,800
I feel like I didn't spend four billion dollars to make this single sausage for myself.

1964
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:47,660
But I feel like four billion dollars worth of effort.

1965
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:58,940
You spent you spent a significant amount of gas money crisscrossing the San Fernando Valley for like nice ingredients as opposed to me.

1966
01:36:58,940 --> 01:37:05,040
Who's like, all right, Kroger brand and Hillshire Farm brand, please come, come Hidden Valley.

1967
01:37:05,140 --> 01:37:05,880
Get in the car.

1968
01:37:06,300 --> 01:37:06,780
Yes.

1969
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:11,020
You know, I think they all like I want to say that all of our choices reflect us in some way.

1970
01:37:11,020 --> 01:37:16,300
But I don't want to say that about Mike, because I don't I don't look at that dog and see you in it.

1971
01:37:16,440 --> 01:37:22,060
I think what you what you should have done do exactly what you did, but then just like wrap it in fruity pebbles.

1972
01:37:22,060 --> 01:37:25,160
And then I think I should have more of a spin on it.

1973
01:37:25,160 --> 01:37:25,660
I agree.

1974
01:37:25,820 --> 01:37:31,940
I also think the sausage, I think you fighting that sausage was truly the key was the was the thing.

1975
01:37:32,020 --> 01:37:35,320
I think if I had a better sausage in there, the sauce I made actually was fine.

1976
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:38,760
Obviously coleslaw and slaw is different, but the coleslaw was fine.

1977
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:42,020
And then I put a little spice into it to make it a little more zesty.

1978
01:37:42,520 --> 01:37:45,420
And I feel like it's the sausage part was key.

1979
01:37:45,740 --> 01:37:52,700
Even with the ugliest presentation, which I showed you there, I believe I could have at least gone, well, it did taste good.

1980
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:56,400
It looks like absolute dog shit, but it could have overcome it.

1981
01:37:56,740 --> 01:37:56,740
Yeah.

1982
01:37:56,860 --> 01:37:59,700
Well, and I'm I feel like I had an adventure.

1983
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:02,820
I discovered an establishment that I like a lot.

1984
01:38:02,820 --> 01:38:06,740
New type of food, a new way to bond with Jason.

1985
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,300
We're linguis of buddies now.

1986
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:13,060
And I reaped the rewards of my journeys.

1987
01:38:13,460 --> 01:38:17,220
And yeah, you are saw your brothers in sausage today.

1988
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:20,820
You're just you're just standing on Naboo holding your sausage over your head.

1989
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
That that that that that that that that that.

1990
01:38:23,080 --> 01:38:23,680
Yeah.

1991
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:27,100
Just celebrating with Bosnian.

1992
01:38:28,100 --> 01:38:28,980
Oh, man.

1993
01:38:29,540 --> 01:38:29,540
Yes.

1994
01:38:29,960 --> 01:38:34,100
I said I didn't like Bosnian, but I'm in such a good mood after how good this ended up tasting.

1995
01:38:34,380 --> 01:38:37,740
I'd show I'd I'd I'd grill him up for Bosnian all day.

1996
01:38:37,740 --> 01:38:40,880
He can rattle him around in his CGI mouth all he wants.

1997
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:42,620
I think he's funny.

1998
01:38:43,580 --> 01:38:45,580
Oh, I like Bosnian.

1999
01:38:45,740 --> 01:38:46,640
I like Bosnian.

2000
01:38:46,660 --> 01:38:50,560
Of course, he's not like the my my man here sitting here is Dexter Jetster,

2001
01:38:50,980 --> 01:38:54,100
who, of course, would make probably a great Ronto wrap if he asked him.

2002
01:38:54,140 --> 01:38:54,720
I don't ask them.

2003
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:56,360
I don't know if it's on the menu, but.

2004
01:38:56,360 --> 01:38:57,380
Oh, yeah.

2005
01:38:57,820 --> 01:38:58,900
It will whip you up something.

2006
01:38:59,620 --> 01:39:04,800
Do you think that's one thing I want to say before we get out of it is just like that the stakes of Star Wars

2007
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:11,580
and the majesty of Star Wars and the incredible journeys and the and the war battles that are fought in life and death.

2008
01:39:11,860 --> 01:39:15,680
They do that in the midst of all this, that people are eating like fast,

2009
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:23,520
casual hot dogs sometimes I think is really funny, like that that they don't show you these scenes usually,

2010
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:31,360
but that like imagine your favorite episode of The Mandalorian and then imagine like three parts where he's stopping to eat a hot dog.

2011
01:39:31,940 --> 01:39:33,360
I think that would be great.

2012
01:39:33,420 --> 01:39:36,500
I think that's the if Jason was on staff on that show,

2013
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:39,840
that would obviously be assigned to him to fit to write those episodes.

2014
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:45,600
I I'm on record as saying like I've wanted to drink the blue milk since I was a child.

2015
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:47,060
Yeah, which I found shocking.

2016
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:52,360
Very first thing I did like I like disappeared from the group

2017
01:39:52,360 --> 01:39:59,180
and just reappeared that opening day at like eight, ten in the morning with blue milk all over my face.

2018
01:39:59,180 --> 01:40:03,200
Yes, I was shocked by that revelation because that was never anything where I was.

2019
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:09,520
It was I said that butter beer is like, oh, yeah, of course, every kid was like reading that book or seeing those movies and going, I got to try that.

2020
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:13,800
But the blue milk was this like kind of gross thing and a weird cup in the middle of the desert.

2021
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:14,520
Like, I don't know.

2022
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:15,740
I want to eat.

2023
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:16,280
I would eat.

2024
01:40:16,420 --> 01:40:21,460
I guess they kind of like raise instant bread, like weird looking blue bread.

2025
01:40:21,460 --> 01:40:23,840
Well, raising bread is a totally different story.

2026
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:27,700
The raisins and bread is one of the best things in the whole nine movies.

2027
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:29,780
I love that bread.

2028
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:36,460
I think one of the side dishes at Talking Bay seven kind of comes with or no, one of them comes with a blueberry muffin.

2029
01:40:36,660 --> 01:40:46,820
Like I do like the interesting angles they took at Star Wars Galaxy's Edge where like your platter is ribs, a blueberry muffin and some coleslaw.

2030
01:40:46,820 --> 01:40:51,280
Like that is an alien presentation, but it all kind of makes sense.

2031
01:40:51,460 --> 01:40:53,080
I like I like the Talking Bay food.

2032
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:53,780
I like the dessert.

2033
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:56,240
The little puffy dessert is really great there.

2034
01:40:56,280 --> 01:40:57,800
Both of them are delicious.

2035
01:40:57,800 --> 01:40:58,240
Yeah.

2036
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:02,840
What are the odds that the Mandalorian the next season will feature a Ronto rap?

2037
01:41:02,920 --> 01:41:04,380
What do you think the odds are that happening?

2038
01:41:04,760 --> 01:41:11,860
Like is somebody casually eating a Ronto rap or like Mando walks up or like, you know, it's like Mando and he's having a big old Ronto rap.

2039
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:13,180
What was giving?

2040
01:41:13,180 --> 01:41:15,200
Oh, they should have had like Karl Weathers.

2041
01:41:15,480 --> 01:41:15,960
Yeah.

2042
01:41:16,100 --> 01:41:17,440
Like had a Ronto rap or something.

2043
01:41:18,700 --> 01:41:19,900
I know Bakar.

2044
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:21,640
Good frenzy.

2045
01:41:21,740 --> 01:41:23,300
Or let's yeah, let's put Bakar.

2046
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:24,660
Let's make Bakar a character.

2047
01:41:24,920 --> 01:41:31,840
I think there's a decent chance they've tried to add stuff and there are little references to like Black Spire Outpost and Solo.

2048
01:41:32,420 --> 01:41:36,100
And I forget there's one more somewhere else that popped up and they have the book.

2049
01:41:36,220 --> 01:41:38,460
So I don't think it's that crazy that that would happen.

2050
01:41:38,640 --> 01:41:39,680
I really don't.

2051
01:41:39,680 --> 01:41:43,900
You can see the droid in the comic book and the Galaxy's Edge comic book.

2052
01:41:44,060 --> 01:41:44,820
He's like walking around.

2053
01:41:45,100 --> 01:41:51,500
We haven't seen Black Spire Outpost yet on screen, but I don't think I think that'll happen.

2054
01:41:51,680 --> 01:41:54,520
I don't think I think that'll be what I think.

2055
01:41:54,760 --> 01:41:58,380
Maybe you have to open it like, yeah, going into Batuu would get you there.

2056
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:01,000
But I like to think that this is not you don't only get this there.

2057
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:19,140
Well, like my hope is that my mythology is that this is like the movie, the founders, the McDonald's founder situation where there's Bakar and then some like sleazier guy comes and steals the recipe from Bakar, takes it to every other planet.

2058
01:42:19,140 --> 01:42:27,120
And now there's like, you know, super corporate Ronto places everywhere that you go in the Star Wars universe.

2059
01:42:27,120 --> 01:42:33,560
You just landed on a Disney plus show that I would 100 percent rush like the Ronto rap founder movie.

2060
01:42:34,020 --> 01:42:42,340
Just this whole story, this saga of Bakar versus this like Jabba the Jabba the Hutt style guy like a Huttese guy who steals the recipe.

2061
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:47,140
That's like a yeah, he's a he's a crazy alien guy.

2062
01:42:47,300 --> 01:42:47,860
Absolutely.

2063
01:42:48,100 --> 01:42:48,500
Yeah.

2064
01:42:48,500 --> 01:42:51,100
How about Kroc the Hutt?

2065
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:54,560
Like if he's like Ray Kroc, who is a nefarious character in some ways.

2066
01:42:55,340 --> 01:43:00,060
Or call him just Kroc maybe Kroc and you can you can spell it in a Star Wars-y way.

2067
01:43:00,820 --> 01:43:01,640
Yeah, yeah.

2068
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:07,040
Maybe and maybe he's he's like subtitled to he speaks in a bizarre.

2069
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:10,100
Yeah, bizarre language, you got a subtitle.

2070
01:43:10,100 --> 01:43:16,140
And yeah, I mean, just like watching the watching a small business get crushed into the ground.

2071
01:43:16,380 --> 01:43:18,460
Well, that's they're going to make all these shows.

2072
01:43:18,660 --> 01:43:19,960
I want to see that happen.

2073
01:43:20,100 --> 01:43:21,380
But in space, great.

2074
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:32,760
Someone someone hires the Mandalorian or hires there's like two McDonald's brothers of the Star Wars universe hire bounty hunters like we need you to get back at Kroc for us.

2075
01:43:33,020 --> 01:43:35,580
He took everything from us.

2076
01:43:37,240 --> 01:43:42,380
Look, well, and then like the gold, they he dies in the end.

2077
01:43:42,540 --> 01:43:47,620
They kill him and then they use his meat to create the next big food phenomenon.

2078
01:43:47,860 --> 01:43:53,020
Listen, Jon Favreau, if you're listening to this, tell Jon Lovett about it and then get this get this on.

2079
01:43:53,080 --> 01:43:57,480
Get this through the podcast network that will get to Obama that will get this to Disney Plus.

2080
01:43:57,480 --> 01:43:58,580
We want to sell the show.

2081
01:43:58,620 --> 01:44:02,800
So Jon Favreau, not Iron Man, Jon Favreau, speechwriter Jon Favreau.

2082
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:09,480
Please, I know you're a little tuckered out from Freedom Day or whatever Joe Biden declared it the other day.

2083
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:14,240
I know you're a little low low, but like, let's get to work on this.

2084
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:17,820
OK, happy Freedom Day, everyone.

2085
01:44:17,900 --> 01:44:19,300
Happy Freedom Day, guys.

2086
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:19,660
I forgot.

2087
01:44:20,040 --> 01:44:20,360
Freedom Day.

2088
01:44:20,440 --> 01:44:21,160
Happy Life Day.

2089
01:44:21,300 --> 01:44:24,580
I think this was a great journey we all took together.

2090
01:44:24,780 --> 01:44:25,340
I'm at Mazani.

2091
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:27,220
You survived podcast, The Ride.

2092
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:28,600
What a blast.

2093
01:44:28,760 --> 01:44:29,960
So happy to have you back.

2094
01:44:30,040 --> 01:44:31,440
Let's exit through the gift shop.

2095
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:33,080
Is there anything you would like to plug?

2096
01:44:33,580 --> 01:44:35,340
Yeah, I've got a couple of podcasts.

2097
01:44:35,420 --> 01:44:35,960
Give them a listen.

2098
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:42,200
The first one is Get It Again, a wrestling podcast where we listen to we watch WCW Thunder from start to finish.

2099
01:44:42,920 --> 01:44:43,900
But W.

2100
01:44:42,920 --> 01:44:45,660
E.

2101
01:44:43,900 --> 01:44:44,120
W.

2102
01:44:44,220 --> 01:44:45,660
has screwed that up with Peacock.

2103
01:44:45,660 --> 01:44:50,760
And now we are watching Wrestle Society X, which is the MTV wrestling show from the 2000s.

2104
01:44:50,820 --> 01:44:51,380
It's horrible.

2105
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:52,580
So come listen to us.

2106
01:44:52,580 --> 01:44:54,180
We've all worked in the wrestling industry.

2107
01:44:54,460 --> 01:44:58,740
The other one is the Art of Arting, a fine art podcast, the opposite of a wrestling podcast.

2108
01:44:58,740 --> 01:45:02,860
This is a fine art podcast where I interview artists while I paint their portrait.

2109
01:45:03,280 --> 01:45:04,700
It's a whole thing.

2110
01:45:05,080 --> 01:45:07,300
So check out the Art of Arting and Get It Again.

2111
01:45:08,340 --> 01:45:11,940
Geez, wonderful, wonderful lineup covering the entire gamut.

2112
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:18,120
And as for us, keep it tuned here to podcast The Ride at the Second Gate for three bonus episodes every month.

2113
01:45:18,980 --> 01:45:21,260
Go check out Shriner's Sausages.

2114
01:45:21,620 --> 01:45:21,760
Get it?

2115
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:24,420
Everybody get on the Linguisa train.

2116
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:30,040
And hey, may the pork be with you.

2117
01:45:31,160 --> 01:45:32,320
I love that.

2118
01:45:33,420 --> 01:45:35,400
Not just today, but every day.

2119
01:45:35,700 --> 01:45:37,580
Make that last all year round.
