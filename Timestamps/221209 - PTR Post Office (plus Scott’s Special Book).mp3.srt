1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:13,280
Warning, the following podcast may contain fursonas, pig guys, nightmarish cues with no

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,440
ride at the end, and gigantic ups and downs for me, Scott.

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:24,280
It's the PTR Post Office, plus a special little Scott story on Podcast the Ride.

6
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,160
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, a theme park podcast that does not cook our books to make

7
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,800
our Patreon seem more successful than it is.

8
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:03,940
I am Scott Gardner, I'm committing no illegal activity and I have not anytime recently,

9
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,440
and also being honest about our numbers is Mike Carlson.

10
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,120
Yes, I'm very honest about our numbers.

11
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:14,400
A lot of people only like us because of the success we have, you know?

12
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,400
A lot of listeners are like-

13
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,400
That's our currency, yes.

14
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,400
Yeah.

15
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,920
I don't want to listen to the show, I don't give a shit if it's funny, I just want to

16
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,040
know that these guys are really doing it and they're very popular and successful.

17
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,440
So no, it's all legit.

18
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,520
We're not pumping up numbers.

19
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:34,100
We're not, and the numbers need to be good to ensure that we will continue to be the

20
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,680
hosts of this podcast and don't get yanked all of a sudden because people want to keep

21
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,240
hearing Jason Sherrod and the third host.

22
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,960
And look, I like the, you two, I love good numbers and metrics and charts.

23
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:52,080
I am scratching my head if there was a recent news story that I should be aware of that

24
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,960
this is directly referencing.

25
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,240
Well, look, it's a stretch.

26
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:03,640
It's true, first of all, but it's a little bit parallel with what we found out was going

27
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:13,600
on with Mr. Chapek, that there was some hanky panky going on with putting in the, what do

28
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,600
you call it?

29
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,280
The budgets.

30
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:21,120
That shows would air, yeah, that technically, all right, the new Doogie Howser is going

31
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,840
to get called a Disney Channel show and not a Disney Plus show so that the numbers even,

32
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:32,960
it was just putting things in different buckets to just prop up Disney Plus as much as he

33
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:39,440
could, which seems like the kind of thing that everybody would immediately rat him on

34
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,800
as soon as he's out of the company.

35
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,800
That's what happened.

36
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,040
Yes.

37
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,480
Yeah, I always heard that called monkey accounting.

38
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:56,400
Like it's a fine Hollywood tradition is like allocating funds, you know, shifting money

39
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,400
around.

40
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,760
Sure, sure. I had the phrase hanky panky ready to go.

41
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:08,720
And that is not because of any early 2010s websites that I may have made content for.

42
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,480
It has no that term.

43
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,720
I don't know where it came from.

44
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:17,040
I don't know. I've only worked for places that are on the up and up and including podcast

45
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,040
The Ride.

46
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:27,440
So look, today we are opening up the PTR Post Office and that is a big chunk of a segment

47
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,600
that we recorded a little while ago altogether in person.

48
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,840
But we're doing a little prelude right now back on Zoom.

49
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,680
And that is because the the final good boy has fallen.

50
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,320
We are completing the trilogy of All of Us Getting Covid.

51
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,880
And if you weren't keeping track, that is me, Scott.

52
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,560
I'm closing it out.

53
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,240
I'm honored to be the rise of Skywalker of All of Us Getting Covid.

54
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,880
The perfect ending that ties it all together connects all the loose ends.

55
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,200
You're like, wow, it really all it all makes sense now.

56
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,800
The story of them all getting Covid.

57
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,000
Right. And I'm Force Awakens.

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,320
And Jason is, of course, the most divisive host and also the last Jedi.

59
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:19,840
Of course, it makes perfect sense that that's he's number eight or he's the second one.

60
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,440
Jason is the last Jedi of hosts of podcast The Ride because it's a Rorschach.

61
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,840
Jason is a Rorschach test for whatever your preexisting beliefs are.

62
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,520
So, yeah, that makes a lot of sense to me.

63
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,160
I am I do sometimes worry about being divisive.

64
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,920
That's why I occasionally find myself giving things like a little credit or a little benefit of the doubt.

65
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,120
All media, a lot of media, everything keeps getting worse and worse.

66
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,920
So that's doing that less and less, you know.

67
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,920
I find it shocking, honestly, how many people are still furiously angry at Jason

68
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,080
for things that he did five years ago in 2017.

69
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:05,400
It's been a long time, but people still manage to be furiously angry at it.

70
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,280
I think people should give Jason a break.

71
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,440
I agree. But there's people that have also made Jason their whole personality.

72
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,360
So that's the other side of it, too.

73
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,560
So it can't reverse. You can't go all the way back.

74
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,040
Yeah, it's both ways.

75
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,840
Makes a lot of sense. Yeah.

76
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,520
Well, I think these all these all line up pretty well, I think.

77
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,880
Yeah, I agree.

78
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,520
Look, and point is, you know, I even if the covid was not good,

79
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,960
I only found out this morning and if the covid was really bad,

80
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,880
I wouldn't even be doing this, this joking and gesturing even in a Zoom format.

81
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,200
You guys see me, I'm not lying down.

82
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,960
I didn't rig up a microphone upside down.

83
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,480
I'm sitting upright.

84
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:50,640
It's really minor and it's just a inconvenience more than anything.

85
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,800
That's obviously good.

86
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,000
It's going fine besides the

87
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,240
the irritants of having to tell people that I have.

88
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,640
I didn't have to tell the listeners, just so you know, it's some some to talk about.

89
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,440
Just give them an honesty.

90
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,520
We were honest about what's going on with us and we're honest about our books.

91
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,840
We're honest about everything. That's true.

92
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,760
But I guess this current stuff, the cold weather spike is real.

93
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,360
So get that boost, everyone, I suppose.

94
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,840
Be careful out there.

95
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,400
Yeah, yeah.

96
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,200
It's a real thing.

97
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:27,040
But there is here just to kind of flesh out this post office episode.

98
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,120
I wanted to talk about something that is that is cooler,

99
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,960
a cooler thing that happened to me then getting covid

100
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,080
all the way on the flip side.

101
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,000
And I've been looking for an opportunity to to bring it up.

102
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,480
And I think this this is a good one.

103
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,440
I think it'll cheer me up, given what's what's going on.

104
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,160
And it kind of relates to last week's episode, which was

105
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,800
All-Star Resorts with Jekes Neil,

106
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,600
which was a lot of fun, fun topic.

107
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,520
And he is great.

108
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,680
And I really enjoyed that one.

109
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,160
And it was fun to think about the All-Star Resorts for a little while.

110
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:10,920
And among the things among the non 9-11 things that came up in that episode

111
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,160
were the it was it was really brief.

112
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,640
I mentioned the the architects of of those resorts

113
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:23,040
and also of the soon to be not FTX arena in Miami.

114
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,440
And these these architects, the cut, the firm is called

115
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,400
architect on a car.

116
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,080
And I really like saying it.

117
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,120
And I like saying it again right now.

118
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,760
And when I noted that fact,

119
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,120
architect on a car who built that those resorts,

120
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,240
the source on Wikipedia for that was a book.

121
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,400
And the book is called

122
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,480
it is called Building a Dream, the Art of Disney Architecture.

123
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,200
That is like and it's by Beth Dunlop.

124
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,080
And it's a book that came out that Disney put out in like

125
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,400
98, 99 or something.

126
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,280
And when I learned that there was this book,

127
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,800
I got very excited because I love Disney architecture.

128
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,680
I like any opportunity to read the names of these people

129
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,560
who built the especially the hotels in Eisner era

130
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,000
that I think are so stunning to this day.

131
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,400
I like reading about Michael Graves and Robert

132
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:29,000
A.M. Stern and Robert Venturi and Wing Chow.

133
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,800
It makes me happy to think about these architects.

134
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,480
It makes me happy to wander around the places that they built that are such like

135
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,920
it's especially like time travel to 80s Disney to, you know,

136
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,840
like that I fell in love with as a kid.

137
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,560
So I'm like, I got to get this book.

138
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,760
I'm going to get this book.

139
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:50,480
And here now, this is my copy of Building a Dream by Beth Dunlop.

140
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,480
And I like the book in general.

141
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,600
The book is full of dramatic stories and really like Eisner

142
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,560
heavy stories, which is exactly what I wanted.

143
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,400
There's the like as soon as I got it, as soon as I opened it up,

144
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,240
I go straight to the section about the the swan and the dolphin,

145
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,040
which are some of my favorite pieces.

146
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,040
Down in Orlando.

147
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:18,480
And it's it's it's a super dramatic section about like Eisner took over in 1984.

148
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,680
And it's only his second day and he can't sleep.

149
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,280
And it's not because of Disney's plummeting numbers or like we got to

150
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,080
need some bigger box office hits.

151
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:32,160
He's upset because he saw a presentation about two hotels they were going to build

152
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,520
in Disney World and he thought they stink.

153
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,200
He thought they were so boring and Disney like, you know, like this is an

154
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,720
empire, we need to be building like impressive.

155
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,560
We need to be like the Romans, like build real feats.

156
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,400
And he had seven sleepless nights.

157
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,320
And then a week later, he said, it's off.

158
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,520
We're killing those.

159
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,800
We're going to get a bunch of the best architects in the world to come down and

160
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,560
we're going to build something impressive.

161
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,080
And that became the swan and the dolphin.

162
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,640
I'm getting a tear in my eyes.

163
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,600
You tell me this tale.

164
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,920
Isn't this this is the young go getter.

165
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:12,120
We focus so much on the later years, on the ousted years.

166
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,800
And, you know, this is our guy.

167
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,960
This is why he's not just some guy saying hello to us before some specials and acting

168
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,320
very stiffly, he's the guy who's trying to change the skyline for the better.

169
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,880
It's chronicled in the Disney war book, too.

170
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,240
And it's very thrilling.

171
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,600
Oh, that's in there, too.

172
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,920
Yeah. Some of the the hiccups along the way,

173
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,040
getting this one and dolphin built.

174
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,280
Oh, really? OK.

175
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,280
This is like when Admiral Holdo uses the ship in Last Jedi.

176
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:48,760
This is like a big dramatic moment where like the course of history has changed forever.

177
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,800
Yeah. Yeah.

178
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,280
And so in the equivalent, the cinematic equivalent of Jason getting covid.

179
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,880
Yes. All right.

180
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,200
All right.

181
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:02,760
I one of my favorite memories of twenty twenty two.

182
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,480
It's funny, we all got it this year also.

183
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,760
We're in the clear for the first two years of this motherfucker.

184
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,080
And then all of us and like evenly spaced out, too.

185
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,400
I realize, like because Mike was April,

186
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,400
Jason was like August, and now I'm right at the top of December.

187
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,040
We gave ourselves we spaced out.

188
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,600
We didn't want the audience to get fatigued with us being fatigued.

189
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,040
Mine's the only one that makes sense, honestly, because I was like,

190
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,320
I didn't do anything and then I did.

191
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,680
I went out and then I got it.

192
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,600
So I didn't dodge it at all.

193
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,920
I didn't dodge it at all.

194
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,080
I got hit right in the face stepping outside.

195
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,440
Like the biggest chance that you took.

196
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,200
Yeah, as opposed to me, who I don't know.

197
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,600
It might have been one guy coughing in a Chipotle.

198
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,560
I that's my best guess.

199
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,800
Yeah, one lot of people coughing right now.

200
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,880
A lot of coughing going on.

201
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,360
Flu numbers are up.

202
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,920
RSV is up.

203
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:03,400
You know, I yeah, that's the you know, I can't it's not it's very generic advice

204
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,160
to say get the booster, and I suspect a lot of listeners already have.

205
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,800
But so I instead will say just in case

206
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,800
if you're in a restaurant where somebody's weird and coughing, just run out

207
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,240
of the restaurant, deal with the food later.

208
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,120
Maybe they won't pick it.

209
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,720
But like I should have left as soon as I heard that.

210
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,120
That's really what happened.

211
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,320
I don't know.

212
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,640
It's one guess that I have.

213
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,600
When did you when did we in the Chipotle with the coughing person?

214
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,560
That was on Thursday.

215
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,720
So could have been.

216
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,000
I don't want to spoil it.

217
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,280
It was it was in the middle of doing research for an episode we haven't put out yet.

218
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:44,040
Oh, I don't want to go giving away what brought me to the North Hollywood area.

219
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,600
Real tease for the adventures.

220
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,920
Yeah, interesting.

221
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,760
But I risked life and limb to do it, to eat a burrito bowl.

222
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,600
Anyway, to get back to why I bring all this up,

223
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,840
I'm not just like trying to read stuff from the book.

224
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,520
Well, I am going to read something very specific from the book.

225
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,480
And it's not something written by Beth Dunlop, the author.

226
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,760
It's a little something extra that I suspect is only in this copy, which,

227
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:16,920
by the way, I bought randomly on eBay and even bought the cheapest version that was

228
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,760
available on eBay, and it happened to it's just normal book.

229
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,800
And I'm flipping through and I'm tell I'm regaling Aaron with these tales of

230
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,240
Eisner lore.

231
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,040
And then all of a sudden turn the page and I'm like the front blank page.

232
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,480
And I'll put it up to the screen here.

233
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,720
There is a very inscribed like calligraphy note.

234
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,880
And I will read this note.

235
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,200
Harrison, thank you for your contribution

236
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,800
in making the Disney studios so special in our world.

237
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,080
And then this note is then signed by three people and its signatures.

238
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,720
So it's not the easiest to make out.

239
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,440
But I went backwards because this is curious.

240
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,120
What is the story here?

241
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,680
This is like maybe a special copy potentially.

242
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:13,520
And one of the signatures I can make out pretty well down in the lower right.

243
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,960
There are lower left there.

244
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,360
I see an R. I see an E.

245
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,800
Roy E Disney.

246
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,480
I add as a Roy E Disney right there.

247
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,280
Wow.

248
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,960
I mean, I'm pretty confident.

249
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,200
Like that you saw it.

250
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,320
It's a period after the E.

251
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,720
You know, it's a big flourishy Disney D.

252
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,160
It's not the Disney D.

253
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,400
But, you know, when you're a Disney, you probably take some liberties with your D.

254
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,800
You got to get fancy with it.

255
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,720
Yeah, take some D liberties.

256
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,760
Yes. So I'm like, wait a minute, that's got to be Roy Disney.

257
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,360
Who are these other names?

258
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:49,920
So one of them is much easier to make out, but it's a name that I've never heard.

259
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,600
The name is Sandy Litvak.

260
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,280
And then I look up Sandy Litvak Disney.

261
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,680
Sandy Litvak was like a legal counsel to the company.

262
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,280
He joined in 1991.

263
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,320
He became the senior vice president.

264
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:08,920
And then in 1994, he was named senior executive vice president.

265
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,000
That's a bunch of qualifiers

266
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:18,520
in that role, taking over many of Frank Wells duties after Frank Wells death and

267
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,320
later became vice chairman of the board.

268
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,080
So, like, wait, I've never heard of this guy.

269
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:28,440
But in this era, when this book was signed, he essentially was the new Frank Wells,

270
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,320
which makes him the number two of the company.

271
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,640
Right. Yeah.

272
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,920
Nobody's ever come across Sandy Litvak.

273
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,160
Is he in Disney War?

274
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,840
Do you know about old Sandy?

275
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,920
Sandy Litvak is a big character in Disney War.

276
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,520
And I forget what crazy thing he was responsible for.

277
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,120
He might have been a Roy.

278
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,040
He was either a pro Roy guy or an anti Roy guy.

279
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,000
And I cannot remember which.

280
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,200
Somehow like balancing against Roy.

281
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,360
It's one or the other.

282
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,720
Yeah, there was so many shareholders,

283
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,600
revolts or different different factions going on.

284
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,680
And I feel like his name came up in one of those.

285
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,200
Huh? Huh?

286
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,960
Well, you know, a new guy to learn about Sandy Litvak.

287
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,400
We'll figure out. We'll know all the.

288
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,520
We'll do a Sandy Litvak episode at some point.

289
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,480
But then I then I get to thinking, like, wait a minute, if this is a trio of names,

290
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,880
the last one's very hard to make out, given the pattern.

291
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,160
Roy Disney, the essentially new Frank Wells.

292
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,040
It has to be. There is one more.

293
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,400
I mean, yeah, look, you might know the end of this story, but that last one,

294
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,240
I mean, that looks like an E to me.

295
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,080
And Erin, who is, you know, along for the ride.

296
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,880
She's like, let me look up a certain person's signature.

297
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,600
And she does. And it's immediately a match.

298
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,680
Ding, ding, ding.

299
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,880
This book is signed by Michael.

300
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,200
I know.

301
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,840
Yeah, why?

302
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,520
The full Trillium with no indication of any of this.

303
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,920
This was a very random eBay purchase, as I mentioned, pretty cheap.

304
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,480
Yeah, there you have it.

305
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,240
A holy Trinity.

306
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,080
And then especially hello.

307
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,440
Hello, I'm so.

308
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,560
Yeah. Yeah.

309
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,480
How about that?

310
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,840
Now he's going to have to come on the show.

311
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,120
Yes, you'll find this so special.

312
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:27,600
We were turned down multiple times, but now this book that's come into your

313
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,440
possession, what a talking, what a piece.

314
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,160
What he has to talk about it.

315
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,120
It's yeah, it's really something.

316
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,000
Well, look, it's about stuff.

317
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,360
The book is so largely about stuff that he did and great gifts that he

318
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,920
commissioned for the world to beautify the world.

319
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:50,200
And in addition, this this gift itself, the man actually touched.

320
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,320
I am touching something that greatness touched.

321
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,160
I wish I could pass it around, but we're on Zoom.

322
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,520
But I'm a little relieved because I suspect that the three of us could end up like

323
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,560
the the three men in the comic book from the early Simpsons episode.

324
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:05,960
Oh, yeah.

325
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,320
Suddenly, they want to show us that.

326
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,240
Yeah, yeah.

327
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,560
Now we're now we're vying for custody of it and we're tearing it apart.

328
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,720
And then no one has the book.

329
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,800
Yeah, lock that up.

330
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,600
We can't be trusted around a book signed by Michael Eisner.

331
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:25,360
Yeah, look, I I trust you guys in general, but I understand in this.

332
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:29,440
In a special case, I would expect you to go rabid.

333
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,520
The covid is fake because you just wanted to be able to show us on Zoom to make sure

334
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,360
that the book wouldn't be stolen.

335
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,040
Damn, you got no, no, no.

336
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,080
It's not. No, look, I'm honest about everything.

337
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,520
And I will show you a positive test result.

338
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:47,640
If you give me about an hour and don't mind me, I'm not pulling up Photoshop.

339
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:53,400
I'm just I'm looking for the results, the literature in an email somewhere.

340
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,600
One more bit of this tale.

341
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,440
Then I start thinking, who is Harrison?

342
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,880
Oh, what is who?

343
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,040
Who is an important Disney Harrison?

344
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,800
And I've got a really solid candidate because when you look up Disney Harrison,

345
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,440
you find Harrison Buzz Price and this name may come on the show.

346
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,920
I mean, I think so, because if you get like if you get the big dogs out,

347
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,760
yeah, to all sign the book and give them a special calligraphy copy,

348
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,760
I feel like it has to be Harrison Buzz Price.

349
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,440
If you don't know a Disney legend and the guy who the boring thing to say is

350
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,080
that he ran feasibility studies to see, like to examine different markets and to

351
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,800
see what locations might be a fit for some of the endeavors the Disney company was

352
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:43,080
doing. Long story short, that means he picked the Anaheim spot for Disneyland.

353
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,040
He picked the Orlando spot for Disney World.

354
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,640
I think he was part of Tokyo as well.

355
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,920
Wow.

356
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:51,960
Yeah.

357
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,960
And plus all of these, like he crunched the numbers on some of these weird things

358
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:02,400
they didn't do, like text position, the attempt at a Texas like mall slash theme

359
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,440
park in maybe the 70s or 80s and this Burbank thing.

360
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,280
I believe he worked on it like the thing I'm obsessed with where like the whole

361
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,400
Burbank Mall and beyond could have been this Disney pseudo theme park with a great

362
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,960
movie ride. Yeah.

363
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,440
So I that's got to be it.

364
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,520
I think, yeah, for sure.

365
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,440
I think here's what I'll say this.

366
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,000
Go back to eBay and go to the eBay store.

367
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,720
You bought things from and see what else is on there.

368
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:34,680
Oh, that's because Buzz Price, I looked it up just now, died 12 years ago.

369
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:40,600
So who knows who this person is just cheaply dumping, you know,

370
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,880
Disney stuff signed by all these all these people.

371
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,440
God, you're right.

372
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:52,200
Do you know about the even closer connection to Buzz Price from your past?

373
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,080
From my past? No.

374
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:58,680
Yeah. Buzz Price designed the Universal Studios Glamour Tram.

375
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,800
Oh, my God.

376
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,320
That sounds really familiar.

377
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,840
This must have come up before.

378
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,080
Oh, my God.

379
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:09,840
I think help them in the 60s where they're like, we could bring the tours back,

380
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:16,680
like help them develop when I believe the owner of Universal at the time was the

381
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:23,720
biggest one or at least one of the biggest, you know, proprietors of tours in America.

382
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,680
Just the concept of tours.

383
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,840
Oh, right. Oh, this all sounds super familiar.

384
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,960
But yeah, wasn't it like the trams were like this this fun, like

385
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:36,640
kind of like Pepto pink, like they were sort of like like a candy.

386
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,600
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

387
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,280
And he got he.

388
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,360
Wow. So I owe this guy.

389
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:49,120
I owe him two summers worth of minimum wage salary for setting up

390
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,160
one of the best places I ever got to work.

391
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:57,840
And and some in through some odd set of circumstances, I ended up with a

392
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,560
personalized book from his library, like just that fact of it all.

393
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,640
Besides the signatures.

394
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:09,040
I mean, I can't help but talk about these things in a, you know, I feel like I have

395
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,240
to do it in sort of a bit adjacent way.

396
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,240
But like I did grow the way I grew up,

397
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,200
loving the company and loving the Eisner era and loving books like this.

398
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,480
Like, I'm amazed I didn't have the book because I had a bunch of other like Disney

399
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:25,120
coffee table books and I would have loved this at the time.

400
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,480
But I'm glad I didn't have it at the time

401
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,840
because I ended up with the ultimate copy.

402
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:32,200
Wow. It does like honestly move me to have this.

403
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:32,920
Yeah.

404
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,280
I mean, who knows what other books with

405
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,600
signatures from executives you could still find out there and like really

406
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,800
complete all your dreams. Whoa.

407
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,480
Yeah.

408
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,280
Like what happened to Lee Iacocca's

409
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,000
library? It's out there.

410
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,560
I bet it's out there.

411
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,760
Yeah. Who's

412
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,240
like Bob Wright from GE?

413
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,960
If people aren't tracking their,

414
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:02,440
you know, if you've got a dying executive in your life,

415
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,760
make sure that their library is properly tended to because you never know.

416
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,160
This is my premise.

417
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,920
This is my premise for action figures

418
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,320
where there's always something somebody would be a completist about.

419
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,960
And I think we figured it out for Scott.

420
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:20,120
It is Disney executive signatures in books from the personal libraries.

421
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,600
That's what I know.

422
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,560
I got a taste now.

423
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,240
I'm like, I'm hooked.

424
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,360
I can't stop here.

425
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,880
I'm jonesing.

426
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,600
I'm going to tease this because I don't think I've ever.

427
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,280
I have an artifact in this vein.

428
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,440
Oh, that in the future, I'll say I'll say this in twenty twenty three.

429
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,760
I will I will show off my artifact.

430
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,480
Wow. Wow.

431
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,960
We have a Jason artifact to come.

432
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,640
It's it's it's kind of similar.

433
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,240
Not dissimilar to what you found.

434
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,560
I don't want to talk about now and steal your thunder because that's such a cool

435
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,720
find, uh, just coming in the mail like that.

436
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:06,360
Just a rock. You had to buy that from someone and it had to get shipped to you.

437
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,960
Like that's such a crazy copy.

438
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:13,120
I could have picked other copies, but my my cheapness paid off.

439
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,760
And I'm going to go pick the second cheapest copy because sometimes what

440
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,080
happens is we talk about an out of print book on this show and then the episode

441
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,920
comes out and then it becomes even harder to find because people buy it.

442
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,240
So you think the audience is going to the audience buys stuff up.

443
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,400
That's what we were saying earlier.

444
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:35,800
PTR bump and people are going to want to keep scouring Harrison Buzz Price's

445
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,280
private collection.

446
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:42,520
I have a different artifact that I have not figured out how to how to approach an

447
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,040
episode about multiple artifacts.

448
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,800
Gee, Jason, whatever these artifacts are,

449
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,040
I think half the audience is going to think they're the greatest and half the

450
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,200
audience is going to think they're a huge letdown.

451
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,240
Michael, I you're a turner as they are not.

452
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,560
We'll find out who falls on what side.

453
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,120
Well, that's a good tease.

454
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:10,840
And I given the way 2022 has gone, I think that we should not tease or promise much

455
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:16,520
more than artifacts, because as we have learned in exact thirds throughout the

456
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:23,000
year, sometimes plans need to be changed as these are acquired.

457
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:30,480
But hey, here's hoping to to good health for you guys and hopefully me tomorrow.

458
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:34,080
And of course, to the listeners who now,

459
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,080
well, we recorded this in the past, so I know that nobody there was no airborne

460
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,120
covid in the PTR post office.

461
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,640
All the letters were opened successfully.

462
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,840
Yes.

463
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,920
And no diseases were passed on.

464
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,200
No. But if the if the video version survived,

465
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:59,400
the you there is a footage of me in a very loud Hawaiian shirt because I ran

466
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,120
from my house from doing the Zoom audition for that Hulu commercial that ended up

467
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,280
coming out and didn't have time to take off that Hawaiian shirt.

468
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,480
Oh, that was it.

469
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,480
Wow. Wow.

470
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,600
You were giving them a mental image of you in a Hawaiian shirt.

471
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,920
And they said, sign us up for more.

472
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,120
Yeah.

473
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,800
Well, that's beautiful.

474
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,920
Boy, that's a Hawaiian shirt that paid off.

475
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,280
Good news for you.

476
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,240
This book, good news for me.

477
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,880
It offsets the less good news.

478
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,200
But, you know, OK, so so here we go.

479
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,760
We're going to pass it over to this post office.

480
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,560
I'm going to rest up because we've got a big Feliz Navidad the way of winter ahead

481
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,520
of us and I want to be in in tip top shape.

482
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,400
But so all right.

483
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,080
So now, audience, you take over with your questions.

484
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:52,400
All right. The PTR post office is open.

485
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,760
It's not a mailbag.

486
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,320
We don't open a bag.

487
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,000
We open a door.

488
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,280
Let's get the keys out.

489
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,320
Jingle, jingle.

490
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,120
Oh, right.

491
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,160
Which one is it?

492
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,560
No, not. Ah, there's so many keys on this thing.

493
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,720
This isn't Santa's mail sack.

494
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,160
This is the PTR post office.

495
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,080
We did a mail sack.

496
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,600
Yeah. If you're tracking them.

497
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,200
Sometimes it's a sack.

498
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,280
Right. But not today.

499
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,200
No sacks are being opened today.

500
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,080
Just a post office which is full of sacks.

501
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,480
You filled the sacks.

502
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,080
Right.

503
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,280
Thank you for filling our sack.

504
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,040
Oh, my God.

505
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,280
And now we're going to open the sacks now that we've opened the post.

506
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,360
Yes. Great.

507
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,360
OK.

508
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,400
If you'd like me to explain it more, what we're doing.

509
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:39,000
Confuse the audience with some lewd double entendres, please.

510
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,240
This is a ninth one.

511
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,320
On the tenth one, they'll understand.

512
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,680
Yeah, they're going to get I really I'm rooting for you guys.

513
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:50,160
I think you I think you're going to get the premise of an episode where you ask us questions.

514
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:55,480
They're questions usually on point, but I think they'll really get it.

515
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,520
All right. Who's seeing anything you like?

516
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,480
Let me see.

517
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,880
Here we go.

518
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,480
What would be this is from

519
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:09,560
famously chill dude at tweets for hot dogs.

520
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:14,200
What would be the PTR experience a la the late show with Jimmy Kimmel ride,

521
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,560
which I think means the Jimmy Fallon ride?

522
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,120
Is that a purposeful combining of every every guess?

523
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:28,520
Because the late show is the late show is Colbert, which is and Colbert is not Kimmel.

524
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,000
And I think I think this might be a little prank.

525
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:32,840
Is this a prank?

526
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:33,800
We've been pranked.

527
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,160
We have a question for you.

528
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,120
Are you pranking us?

529
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,320
But the PTR experience.

530
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:46,640
OK, well, it depends on is it set at the at the forever dog studios

531
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:50,160
or is it or is it at in my garage?

532
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,600
Well, is that where the queue is?

533
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,960
Oh, maybe you your or the queue is multiple rooms.

534
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:00,480
It's like the secret lives of pets queue where you go through all the apartment rooms.

535
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:07,040
So you start in like Mike's living room and then you go to your garage and then you end up in a studio.

536
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:12,840
Oh, I see. OK, so all the iconic places, all the locales, right?

537
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:17,240
Pass by. You get to look at but not touch Mike's toys.

538
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,160
You get to admire Leonardo's tail dick.

539
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:29,840
Yes, you get to step over Jason's and by that I mean, Jane's dog.

540
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,000
We say our dog now.

541
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,720
It's our day is on the ground taking a little nap.

542
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,480
Little dog.

543
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,800
So, yeah, all the real world things would be in the queue.

544
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,240
I think that's what Jason's saying.

545
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:41,600
But then the right itself, I mean, if we're talking budget, I'd like to blue sky this.

546
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:48,320
I'd like to say this is going to be a high ticket, a big budget rise, the rise of the resistance level budget.

547
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,040
Yeah.

548
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,720
So I think at this point we're going to use

549
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:56,040
the best ride system available, which is a Transformers ride system.

550
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,280
Spider-Man ride system.

551
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,560
Yeah, sure. OK, so it's going to have don't even put Spider-Man.

552
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,600
It's we know it as the Transformers ride system.

553
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,880
The iconic Spider-Man's invented the ride system.

554
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:12,040
Transformers perfected it is the way I perfected rides in general, perfected rides in general.

555
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,840
So I think it's going to be yeah, there's going to be like a little practical set

556
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,280
to moving in and out of screens because we need the motion.

557
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,000
And at that point, I think you're going to go through our whole lives.

558
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:29,440
You know, you're going to start as little boys and we're going to sort of see what went wrong,

559
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,520
what went wrong that started this whole podcast, this whole

560
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,120
mental illness that we have.

561
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:42,800
Well, we're now in kind of a you could have doors opening up a la Tower of Terror and which I maybe

562
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,520
I thought of that because there's a little girl at the end of the hallway.

563
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:52,960
Right. But it's so it's the holograms of us and like the fatal choices that I don't know what mine is.

564
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,840
Is it me like,

565
00:30:55,080 --> 00:31:01,400
wow, mom, the 1993 Disney shareholders annual report.

566
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,520
And then it's me not going into the Twilight Zone, but going into the Unrelatable Zone.

567
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:17,120
That is the choice I made where for many decades he'll be trapped there and people will not his peers won't be able to talk to him because he reads shit like this.

568
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,720
Mine could be like me showing a girl

569
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:27,320
that I had printed out the entire Return of the Jedi script right when I first got a computer and she went, what, why do you have that?

570
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:33,240
And I was like, oh, I it's and then I go into the Unrelatable Zone.

571
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,120
You were walking around with a full paper.

572
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,000
It was a big and it was in a file or it was in like a folder.

573
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,000
I had the script. I was like, oh, my gosh, it's a full return of the script is available on the computer.

574
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,880
I can print it out. So I printed out a full script.

575
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:51,440
And that was it. You felt caught like you expect it.

576
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,000
Maybe it hadn't occurred to you. There could be a negative reaction.

577
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:03,320
It did not occur to me that a female or male would react negatively to me printing out the Return of the Jedi script.

578
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,560
What are you going to do with it? Like have people.

579
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:12,440
I don't know. I think I just like the idea of looking at it like, oh, my God, this is what the actors saw when they were doing the movie.

580
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,960
My favorite movie at the time.

581
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,840
Was it though or was it like a transcript that it was probably a transcript?

582
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,920
Because that was a lot of the things you'd find online when you were looking for scripts.

583
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,240
As somebody had just made a transcript of the movie and it was not full.

584
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:31,800
It wasn't full of those like George, you know, action descriptions, which I'm sure were very specific and dynamic.

585
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,080
Jason, what's your moment for the because we're by the way, we're about five percent through this hypothetical.

586
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:41,960
Yeah, probably explaining to like people.

587
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:47,320
My my college girlfriend or anyone who came into my dorm room, my my desktop background

588
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,160
was the Islands of Adventure.

589
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,720
Like, oh, see, this is this is now this Marvel superhero island.

590
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,400
This is Dr. Seuss Island.

591
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,160
Now, this is the Lost Continent, which is it's copyright free.

592
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,800
It's myths and legends, but it's copyright free.

593
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,600
And they were kind of running out of money.

594
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:10,320
You know, you even within theme park world, you remain so Islands of Adventure centric, like within the niche.

595
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,040
You have your niche.

596
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,960
It just hit at the right 12 year old age.

597
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,600
That's your that's you made that your whole personality.

598
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,240
Islands of Adventure in a lot of ways.

599
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,960
I guess so.

600
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,400
We've got this island.

601
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,520
You're wearing an island shirt on

602
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,920
Islands of Adventure shirt.

603
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,760
I mean, it's got a bunch of beer on it.

604
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,440
Yeah, it's got beers on it.

605
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,880
It was wacky, Ikeke ale.

606
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,600
Yeah, a lot of like brands within this.

607
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,160
It was from a Goodwill.

608
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:43,440
I bought it in college for like a play or like Halloween costume.

609
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,960
It looks new.

610
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,720
Oh, no, this is like from like 2004.

611
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:51,440
That looks that's what they call fresh, I think, as far as the look is concerned.

612
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,200
It looks new. Your outfit.

613
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,680
So, oh, thanks. All right.

614
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,240
OK, so wait, hold on. Five percent through.

615
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,520
OK, we see embarrassing moments as little boys.

616
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,040
All right. Then we like whirl into like maybe well, you're already in college age.

617
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,320
So maybe we like get together.

618
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,400
It's like the origin of the podcast.

619
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,560
Nick Mundy is there.

620
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,960
He's pounding on the ride vehicle and saying, start this podcast.

621
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,920
Oh, a massive we build it in what he is in our minds.

622
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,200
Yeah, foot tall, intimidating.

623
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,640
So he's like Megatron.

624
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,880
Yeah, he's like Megatron.

625
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:22,760
He like puts his hands and he like grabs them and digs them into the ride vehicle

626
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,280
and starts shaking it.

627
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,760
You will start a podcast and then like throws the thing around.

628
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,600
There was the vehicle around.

629
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,200
That's good, because that's I feel like always cut like a big creature grabs

630
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,840
the vehicle and shakes the I feel like that's the first thing to go when they're

631
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,360
trimming budgets. Oh, well, this is remember this is Transformers.

632
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,800
So this is this is a screen.

633
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,520
It's a screen.

634
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,600
OK, it's going to be weird.

635
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,720
Should we definitely want and need it to be a screen?

636
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,320
It needs this for this ride that I'm envisioning.

637
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,720
It has to be a screen.

638
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,760
It has to be.

639
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,480
OK, so we've already made some some trims.

640
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,400
Yeah, right.

641
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,840
It's

642
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,240
because really this is the problem is with the budget is going to be very long.

643
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,120
The right. Yeah.

644
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,280
Well, it has to be because he's asking what's the PTR experience and the PTR

645
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,360
experience is pretty long, very the episodes are.

646
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,280
So it needs to be.

647
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,160
So we're talking like a I mean, it's at least an hour and a half.

648
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:19,360
Yeah. So then at that point, I think then this is going to be sort of this is going

649
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,320
to be like maybe 15 minutes.

650
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,560
And then at that point, you go through a highlight reel of all the best podcasts,

651
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,480
the right moments.

652
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:30,120
So Jason yelling about grapefruit beer, that's a dollar too expensive for him.

653
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,760
The argument about

654
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,200
how many days stay at Tokyo Disney, of course.

655
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,960
So you see all of these different things

656
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,280
play out in kind of a highlight reel and it's very dynamic.

657
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,560
And, you know, you see,

658
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:46,120
I guess you use like maybe like soaring transitions to go from moment to moment.

659
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,560
And when I mean by that, it's just like a fade

660
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:55,040
or like a wipe like a bird of prey crosses.

661
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:55,840
That's good. Yeah.

662
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:00,560
And or Michael Eisenhower hitting a golf ball is a transition for everything.

663
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,560
So there's always a environment.

664
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,360
Yeah, there's always eyes in there.

665
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,720
And you just keep swinging a golf ball, a golf club at us.

666
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:16,080
And then I would like it if we could add him saying hello every time.

667
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,320
Yeah.

668
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,120
I mean, hello doesn't make sense.

669
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:25,440
Does he or just an Eisner style for or goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

670
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,120
But he says goodbye to every golf ball he hits.

671
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:28,960
That's good. Yeah.

672
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,320
And then and then after we've done the highlight reel,

673
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,520
I think we have to fight all the villains we've ever fought on the show.

674
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,400
And sort of

675
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,800
I'm trying to think of a good example,

676
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,520
like I guess like Sinister Six or something.

677
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,640
It's Tillman Fratida.

678
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,880
It's oh, they're all back.

679
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:44,960
They're all back. Yeah.

680
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:45,520
Yeah.

681
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:50,960
And then I Billy Joe Armstrong shows up and I'm like, come on, guys, let's get him.

682
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,840
And you guys go, I don't know.

683
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,560
Well, keep in mind some of the later stuff.

684
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,200
Actually, the latest stuff is the right touch.

685
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,880
And we're not touching it.

686
00:36:59,080 --> 00:36:59,720
It's going on.

687
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,840
Scott's enemy aisle.

688
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,960
And then mine is a lot more, by the way.

689
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,680
A lot of enemies. Mine is set.

690
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,600
Brian Setzer lands on the hood of the vehicle and starts soloing.

691
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,600
Like a dude.

692
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,880
He's a boogie boogie boogie boy from Campanile.

693
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:20,080
He tries to force bowling shirts on everyone in the vehicle and fedoras.

694
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,160
Yeah.

695
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,720
You'll wear this fedora forever.

696
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,000
So then if you got the Scott path, the ride is an extra 30 minutes.

697
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,680
Well, and because part of it, because that involves you just going on the full

698
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:35,360
living with the land as well as also living on land is just in there.

699
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,680
So you have to chase Brian Setzer

700
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:44,760
and Randy Gerber through a crop maze.

701
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,840
So so then the

702
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:53,320
the Jason path, I would just spend a little time reading you treats,

703
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,200
but then switch it up to disgusting old food menus.

704
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:01,520
Yeah, got some disgusting old food stuff and then the hard tack coming up.

705
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,160
Yeah. And Scrapple.

706
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:07,800
And I think all of our separate avenues, that's where really the ride gains its

707
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,680
length, it's all right. I mean, what do you do with your half hour?

708
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,640
Like with my half hour?

709
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,400
I think it's it's definitely

710
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:19,280
it's definitely the ride vehicle like there's screens in front and you just

711
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:23,640
check for 30 minutes, like times for different rides in the park.

712
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:27,480
Whatever park this is in, you basically just check for fast passes for like

713
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,480
other rides, for other rides.

714
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,520
And so, yeah, you're not even this is going to be good for the budget because

715
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,480
there won't even be a need for screens or anything.

716
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,040
You just be on your console for 30 minutes, refreshing it

717
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,880
to see if you get better time.

718
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,200
It's the vehicle is still.

719
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,840
Yeah, you're playing like, I don't know,

720
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:47,040
clocks by Coldplay or something loudly in the background.

721
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:52,960
All of Milo's I low toe, all of my low low toe as a train, the train,

722
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,920
a digital version of the train like

723
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,560
Jerusalem bells are ringing.

724
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,240
I'm going to get a 1215.

725
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,840
Fast pass for no no no no.

726
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,920
Quick, Mike, what are a baby?

727
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:10,520
What are a baby serving two spoonfuls of mac and cheese and an applesauce packet?

728
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,040
Oh, wait, there's an alert.

729
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:15,520
You can get a Marvel Legends figure for three dollars less than you normally can.

730
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,360
Oh, order it real quick while you're trying to check.

731
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,560
No, no, no, no, no, no.

732
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,080
So this is yeah, this is everybody has their own.

733
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:30,160
Rather go down the avenue with my enemies than this cold play blasting.

734
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,840
Well, it's like Guardians of the Galaxy songs.

735
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,720
It's randomized.

736
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,160
So I don't get to do.

737
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,360
Yeah, I mean, it could be.

738
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,680
When you try your best, you don't succeed.

739
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,360
When it's not what you want, but that's what you need.

740
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,400
Whatever the yeah.

741
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,000
So the scientists, all of it.

742
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,640
Or that's not the sign that that's fix you.

743
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,400
I'm sorry. I'm singing the wrong Coldplay song.

744
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,480
I apologize.

745
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:56,840
And then in year five was when Coldplay became a fixture.

746
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,120
And that's where there's got spirits really saying.

747
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,480
There's still a lot of bands that I know a good amount of that haven't even come up

748
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,640
on the show, so there's still a lot of this is the long con.

749
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,760
You've played not just with the audience,

750
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:13,800
but with me personally, you've top loaded it with the cool ones.

751
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,800
I like through the years you reveal.

752
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,640
But I like this, but I like this.

753
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,040
But I'm a big defender of Sugar Ray.

754
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,480
Oh, yeah.

755
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,400
Yeah, Sugar Ray is no, no.

756
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,640
You tricked me.

757
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,920
That's part of the ride is you tricking me with bands that are cool.

758
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,040
This happened to me once, but this was it.

759
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:32,880
But it was wrong.

760
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,800
The person was wrong.

761
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,800
They were like, oh, I thought you only like cool stuff because they I said I like

762
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,200
the Justin Timberlake, the the future sex love songs.

763
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,000
But that's cool.

764
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:41,960
So I don't know.

765
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,800
This has happened to me before, but it's been about it's been the wrong.

766
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,280
I've been accused of this before, I'm saying, but at that point it was wrong.

767
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,920
And now I guess it's writer.

768
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:55,320
But also like the older I get, the older I get, the less I want to watch movies

769
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,200
and TV and more I want to listen to any song.

770
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,440
I don't know what that is.

771
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,360
Hmm.

772
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:06,280
Like I'll go like I'm not I used to be much more like picky about country and stuff.

773
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,800
And now it's all good.

774
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,520
I don't know.

775
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,200
I don't know.

776
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,480
It's all pretty standard is just music.

777
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,440
Any you just want to be.

778
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:18,560
I like music a lot, but I am very forgiving of music.

779
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,920
There's there's not a lot.

780
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,000
That is when we've had the music.

781
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,520
I mean, you do just seem like, well, look, there's a guy up on stage with a guitar.

782
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,000
And I like it.

783
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,920
It's loud.

784
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:31,200
And that's like, wow, that's your standard is just music is being played.

785
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:36,040
I could rank things like I do know what's cooler than other things, I think.

786
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:36,800
But sure.

787
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,840
But who is the time?

788
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,880
We're all getting older.

789
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,480
Now, that's that's practical.

790
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,800
That's a practical thought.

791
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,640
Yeah, I know.

792
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:48,720
Like, for example, I know, like some of the best musicians and songwriters and stuff

793
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:53,880
are in like Nashville, right, because that's where there's like a whole music

794
00:41:53,920 --> 00:42:00,040
industry, like like like the real country, like pros and stuff.

795
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,000
There's a whole lot of cash is doing their

796
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,840
local class, all the best bands like low cash.

797
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,800
Isn't that where Third Man Studios is?

798
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,800
Yeah, no, no, of course.

799
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

800
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,920
It's cool stuff, obviously.

801
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:15,080
But like you can like find something on like Apple Music or Spotify and then it'll

802
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,760
start recommending other people that you've never heard of.

803
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:21,000
And it's just like, oh, here's what it is.

804
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,520
I've gone through too many cycles of the Jimmy Buffett cycle of, oh, my God, this

805
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:29,480
exists, these songs are crazy, some of them are embarrassing.

806
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,440
And then I come on the other side and go, I guess I like it, though.

807
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,880
I guess I like a lot of this stuff.

808
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,840
You have come around those cycle that cycle

809
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:39,280
a couple of times to the point where now I think I've just eliminated the part

810
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,840
where I go, oh, this is kind of cringe, isn't it?

811
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:45,600
And I just go, I guess I like it straight to I guess I just like this.

812
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,720
You hear something that sucks and go straight to liking it.

813
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,800
Yeah, I like anything that sucks.

814
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,080
What do you oh, what's your taste in music?

815
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,520
Why anything that sucks?

816
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:59,880
Just like my favorite genre is sucky music.

817
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:03,360
So all of that, like that's then that happens in the ride.

818
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,640
You just get a 10 minute

819
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:09,160
sidetrack about just in general.

820
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,480
It's not even like an insightful music conversation.

821
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,040
It's just music exists.

822
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,920
And then I look at artists and listen to other artists.

823
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,440
So that happens in the ride.

824
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,440
You get that. Yeah.

825
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,400
And then, yeah, you could.

826
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,920
Yeah, there's I can make up.

827
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,520
I should make a playlist of this hypothetical ride and then see what you could get.

828
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,640
Is this song red chili pepper song?

829
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,120
I like dirt on the list.

830
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,760
Yeah, it is.

831
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,000
Well, a question for you.

832
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,440
Does it suck?

833
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,120
That song does kind of suck.

834
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,720
I think that song does my guess.

835
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,800
That song is not my favorite song of the red chili peppers.

836
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,880
But does this ride end?

837
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,040
Is there an end to the ride?

838
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:46,880
Here's the question.

839
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:47,400
Here's the thing.

840
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,240
Maybe when you started the ride, you thought it ended.

841
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:52,480
But now that we've been doing it for five years, you're like, I guess no end in sight.

842
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,920
No end in sight. It's like comic books.

843
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,640
All second act. That's right.

844
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,840
No.

845
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,840
At one point in time decades ago, there was a first act.

846
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:03,160
There was no Act three in sight.

847
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:08,240
OK, so that the PTR experience is at least five years.

848
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,240
That's correct. And running.

849
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:14,360
OK, I've got one from Ali Hodgkinson.

850
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:17,120
If you had to spend the night in a theme park,

851
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,720
which would you choose and where would you sleep?

852
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,880
Maybe nestled up with the pig guy and Pirates of the Caribbean.

853
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,880
The pig guy. That's pretty good.

854
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,640
No, no, not.

855
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:28,960
Jason, I love the idea.

856
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,280
It's Lauren Cozy.

857
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,800
It's not warm.

858
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,440
It's cold and pirate talking the whole night.

859
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:36,640
We've talked a little.

860
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,800
We've talked a little bit about this, I think, on the show.

861
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:39,960
Where do you sleep?

862
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:43,440
Because I think we've talked about the bed on pirates with those skeleton.

863
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,640
You sleep with the skeleton.

864
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,560
Yeah. And I push him over.

865
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:47,920
Is he going to be there?

866
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,360
Well, it depends if you have any respect for the ride.

867
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,960
You won't push him over.

868
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,720
OK, it's not the narrative.

869
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,720
It's like I don't. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

870
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,560
OK.

871
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:01,160
Is there any couches in the Carousel of Progress?

872
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,600
Can I crash? There are couches.

873
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,280
Yeah, there's got to be some furniture to sleep on.

874
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,920
Yeah. I mean, yes.

875
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,480
And they made everyone hotter.

876
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,960
Oh, they did just update the Carousel of Progress.

877
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,800
And they made everyone hotter on the ride.

878
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,640
Did they change the physical, the look of the character?

879
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,720
They did. Yeah. Yeah.

880
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,080
The faces look different.

881
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,560
And the mom, I think. Yeah.

882
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,000
I don't know. That's you know what?

883
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,120
That's a good room.

884
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,160
It would creep me out, I guess, to have so many characters around.

885
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,960
But that New Year's scene where there's, I guess,

886
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,640
being around eight robots would be a little odd to spend the night.

887
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:38,480
But like, there's got to be a piece of furniture in there that I can, you know,

888
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,680
like they've got a sectional, don't they?

889
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,240
So many of them are sitting on the floor playing video games.

890
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,760
I bet there's a free couch.

891
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,640
Probably. Yeah. Yeah.

892
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:49,440
Jason, obviously Islands of Adventure, I would think, is where you would want to

893
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,600
sleep. I mean, it looks very good at night.

894
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,200
The lighting setups are very cool at night.

895
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,080
I think I'm trying to think you sleep up in the Hulk's arms.

896
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,000
He's like lifting that piece of track.

897
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,880
You could like sleep on top of the Hulk.

898
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:05,040
Yeah, because with like Toon Lagoon,

899
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:10,240
you'd probably run into the same thing as Toon Town, where it looks like there's

900
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,520
beds and couches and stuff. They're all hard.

901
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,800
Oh, you wouldn't want to sleep on.

902
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,240
Do they have a plastic Beetle Bailey cot in Toon Lagoon?

903
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,840
I don't think so. No, I think it's mostly flat.

904
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:21,800
I don't even think they have a three

905
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,240
dimensional like approximation of what the cartoon characters living quarters would

906
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:29,680
be. Yeah, I what about the lighthouse?

907
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,320
Oh, the lighthouse would be good.

908
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:34,120
And I'll venture and you could like room at the top of the lighthouse.

909
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,840
You could dress up like the night before

910
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:40,000
Christmas, father with the cap and the whole thing and like bring up a little

911
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,280
candle as you climb the stairs of the Islands of Adventure Lighthouse.

912
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,960
Yeah, with no railing.

913
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:46,400
I'll just eat it.

914
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:47,480
Just climbing up.

915
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,560
Well, that's up to you.

916
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:54,400
Did you someone post it like a picture of like across from Ogas in Galaxy's Edge?

917
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:59,120
There's just a stairwell to like a landing with plants on it.

918
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:02,560
And someone's like, you could you get up there.

919
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,000
There's nothing stopping anyone from walking up these stairs.

920
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:12,800
Yeah, there is no railing, but it's definitely just a stairs to a patio.

921
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,720
Yeah, I don't want to sleep up there, though.

922
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,320
Yeah.

923
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:17,840
What would I do?

924
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:23,040
I would say don't do Animal Kingdom because a lot of those animals come out at night.

925
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,280
So I feel like it'd be rowdy and noisy.

926
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:28,040
No, not the monkey cages.

927
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,520
But what if I gained their trust, the animals trust?

928
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,600
They would probably just be a trick and they just beat the shit out of you.

929
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:35,760
Or kill me.

930
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,240
Yeah.

931
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,160
What can I sleep in the hemisphere dancer at City Walk?

932
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:45,400
I don't know what's in there, but a little probably a little plane doesn't have

933
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:50,040
your tall guy and a little cockpit is going to be tough to lean the seat back.

934
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,600
Jimmy Buffett has a plane that can recline.

935
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,280
That's a good point.

936
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,560
This is Jimmy Buffett.

937
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:56,120
Yeah, there could be a hammock in there.

938
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,000
I might.

939
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,680
It's probably an upside down control

940
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,680
panel so that he can it can lower on top of his hand.

941
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:02,080
Yeah.

942
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,880
So I guess that's where I'm going to do.

943
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,880
I'm going to sleep in the hemisphere dancer at City Walk Orlando.

944
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,200
You could probably sleep at the Carthay Circle.

945
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:13,080
A lot of comfy comfy chairs and couches and stuff in there.

946
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:13,880
It does count. Yeah.

947
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,200
Oh, yeah.

948
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:19,640
They do they have the little elevator that could close up the little elevator.

949
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:23,080
And yeah, yeah, that sounds nice.

950
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,280
Let's go, boy.

951
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,440
Well, I don't think it's a cabinet anytime soon because they don't offer

952
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,840
a sleeping package as far as I know.

953
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,560
It's like hotels, but who cares?

954
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:33,120
It's boring.

955
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:33,800
It is.

956
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,960
It's interesting they haven't done private event like lock ins.

957
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:42,840
It's probably would be like a library lock in like, yeah, like a gym lock,

958
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,520
like a school lock in that people would do.

959
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:50,120
I guess they did the 24 hour days or longer.

960
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,520
Yeah, I've been there.

961
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:55,480
But they don't really want you sleeping during the 24 hour day.

962
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:56,840
No, no.

963
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:01,600
But I mean, you can't control like tired dads can sleep anywhere in a theme park.

964
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:02,960
You can't remember this.

965
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,400
You can't control a tired dad.

966
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,440
Your dad.

967
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,960
Remember that, folks.

968
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:10,040
This is interesting.

969
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:14,560
Andrew Lippins, what favorite treat of Jason's would Scott hate the most?

970
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:15,840
Oh, man, what a question.

971
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,040
Any ideas? I don't know which angle to you.

972
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,880
I mean, you got to tell me and I have to react, I suppose.

973
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:22,800
I really.

974
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,360
I feel I.

975
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:27,880
We just recently tweeted a picture of Scrapple.

976
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:30,080
Yeah, that looks like shit to me.

977
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:32,280
It looks so bad.

978
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,760
Yeah, I hmm.

979
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:35,760
I don't know.

980
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,200
I mean, one of my favorite treats is a hot fudge

981
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,640
Sunday with chocolate ice cream instead of vanilla ice cream.

982
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,840
Is that too sweet for you? Is that too chocolate?

983
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:43,720
That sounds great.

984
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,760
Establish a base. OK, that's good.

985
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:51,280
No, I get I think I start running into trouble the more like chemical we get.

986
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:55,600
The fakier it is, I think is where I start to dive.

987
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,400
You mean like diet sodas?

988
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:01,920
That is the word of stuff like, yeah, when you had me try the Coke Star,

989
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:04,960
I despised that that was that was one of my favorite.

990
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,160
No, no, never.

991
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,200
You ever drink a regular Coke?

992
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,440
Not anymore. No, not not in decades.

993
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:13,440
No, I feel like it's come the zero calories.

994
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:18,440
So it's come a long way with the introduction of zero line, zero sugar.

995
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:22,760
I think a lot of them do taste pretty close to regular sodas.

996
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,720
But then I don't drink regular sodas either.

997
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,840
So there's there's your trouble.

998
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,080
That doesn't help me necessarily.

999
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,400
That's true.

1000
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,040
No, but it's that fake diet.

1001
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,720
I like that.

1002
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,840
I I don't like that.

1003
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:41,080
That tastes to me like somebody took a bunch of aspirin and ground them up in the drink.

1004
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,440
That's not my go to.

1005
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:48,360
OK, a place I it burned down, but a place my family went to.

1006
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:52,840
For for years, it still find pork roll,

1007
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:56,320
Taylor Ham, whatever you call it, at a lot of the Jersey boardwalks.

1008
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:00,200
But one place we really love, the Hamburger Construction Company would do.

1009
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,280
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1010
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:03,560
It's a hamburger construction company.

1011
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,600
Yeah, it burned down at the start of the year.

1012
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:06,920
You ever told me about this before?

1013
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:09,440
Yeah, it's the T-shirt I have that's like endless summer,

1014
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:12,480
but it's a big hamburger instead of a thing.

1015
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,400
How have we not done an episode on the Hamburger Construction Company?

1016
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,120
I'll tell you what, it burned down at the start.

1017
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,880
Very start of twenty twenty one.

1018
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:23,280
And I was so yes, I was so upset.

1019
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,840
And then this and you forgot.

1020
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:25,760
I don't remember the hamburger.

1021
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:29,280
It might have come up in passing because as soon as I found out the news, it's like,

1022
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:32,520
well, got to record the Avery Monson episode.

1023
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,680
Wow, really? Within minutes.

1024
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,800
Like, yeah, it was a real.

1025
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,960
And also the guy, they're like, we're going to rebuild.

1026
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,960
I'm like, that guy's not going to come back.

1027
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:44,280
He's like my parents age.

1028
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:48,920
And sure enough, like 30 plus years in a kitchen,

1029
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:54,840
an unair conditioned kitchen sweating every summer, he tapped out and decided to retire.

1030
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,040
But better, yeah.

1031
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:02,280
I say all this to say that they would do pork roll on like a nice hoagie roll,

1032
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:07,160
a nice Italian roll, they would also do a Taylor burger, which is a burger patty,

1033
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:10,320
Taylor pork roll and like two things of American cheese.

1034
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:13,960
And then you dress it however you like a burger.

1035
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,280
All that sounds good to me.

1036
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,520
I think it would wreck me.

1037
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:20,360
I think as I said, I'm retiring from you just don't like neon color.

1038
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:21,520
Like you want colors.

1039
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:26,760
You know, maybe the discovery here, Andrew, is that you ask, is it Jason?

1040
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,440
I think I think it might be Mike.

1041
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:33,560
Yeah, I actually think genuine like like if we make you one of those goofy slush

1042
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:38,280
mix in they have in Disneyland, the California Adventure now where it's like

1043
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,280
icy and fruit juice and nerds and gummy bear.

1044
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:45,120
I think maybe we've had it wrong the whole time.

1045
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:50,040
Eating like Jason wouldn't be as bad for me as drinking like Mike.

1046
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:55,680
That is much tougher for me because I do need to taste alcohol in the alcohol

1047
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:58,000
I'm drinking. That is a requirement.

1048
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,840
I don't like I don't like my colors and goose.

1049
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:04,040
Yeah, I don't want gummy worms swimming around in my drink.

1050
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:07,240
Like sprinkles, I guess I can.

1051
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:08,920
Yeah, you would deal with sprinkles.

1052
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:11,760
The last. Yeah, I'll get sprinkle.

1053
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,240
I'll get rainbow sprinkles on the on Disneyland,

1054
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,240
on like whatever the Main Street ice cream is.

1055
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,880
OK, we can work with that.

1056
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:20,800
Would you ever get the sprinkle cone with like the chocolate and sprinkles

1057
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,160
in the waffle cone? I maybe sure.

1058
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,560
That doesn't sound abhorrent.

1059
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,840
But would I get a sprinkled drink?

1060
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:31,960
That's if there's a bunch of sprinkles caking the rim of a beverage.

1061
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,840
I think that's a sprinkle rim.

1062
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:35,280
I like the sound of that.

1063
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,760
You're going to have to stop the record.

1064
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,320
You're salivating on the mic too much.

1065
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,680
Pavlov's dog over here.

1066
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,120
Maybe your sprinkle rim.

1067
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,280
Maybe we can meet in the middle on this.

1068
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:44,680
I sprinkle rimming.

1069
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,480
How do you feel about cake batter flavoring?

1070
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:49,520
Like my friend, I'm drinking it in the coffee.

1071
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:50,720
Oh, hey, man.

1072
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:53,320
You've been having the whole time is cake batter.

1073
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:54,240
Here's what it is.

1074
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,880
I'm drinking a large coffee from Dunkin Donuts.

1075
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:59,520
You can specialize exactly what you want, how much of it you want.

1076
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,480
And I don't put any sugar in it.

1077
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,960
I put some of the natural raspberry flavor in it.

1078
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,520
And then I asked for one squirt of cake batter.

1079
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:09,040
That is not the official.

1080
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:10,360
Squirt of batter.

1081
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:13,960
Squirt one little squirt of batter, please.

1082
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,600
That is not the official branding.

1083
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:21,320
You're trying to mighty a cron the Dunkin ordering system.

1084
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,680
Well, here's the thing.

1085
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:25,360
Now that I'm looking at it, it looks like they put four swirls in,

1086
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:29,880
even though I specified on my app that I wanted one.

1087
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:31,400
I did not check. You're right.

1088
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,320
Now that I'm looking at it.

1089
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:36,400
But have you vocalized out loud, this is the best coffee drink I've ever had.

1090
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:37,440
I have not.

1091
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:38,880
Is it better, though?

1092
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,280
It's good to have a little sweet.

1093
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:44,320
I just don't. Sometimes like McDonald's coffee is very sweet,

1094
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,240
but it is like you're drinking a shake.

1095
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:52,240
So I try to get a good mix of just like, you know, not not something overpowering.

1096
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:55,840
But I guess maybe they overpowered me with cake batter today.

1097
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,840
There are episodes I've recorded where I

1098
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:03,320
have drank a Dunkin peanut butter cup macchiato or Irish cream macchiato.

1099
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:04,480
Yeah, the peanut butter cup.

1100
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:06,520
I guess if you get a small, it would be OK.

1101
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:07,840
But it was it was small.

1102
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:12,880
But it comes separated and like you mix it like you you stir it up.

1103
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,120
And that was pretty good.

1104
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:18,320
But I am just drinking like iced coffee with half and half.

1105
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,720
So Mike's drinking the candy coffee.

1106
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:24,400
Yeah, but it doesn't it doesn't it's not that sweet.

1107
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:25,520
I've had much sweeter.

1108
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:26,960
The McDonald's coffee, if you've ever had

1109
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,760
just an iced coffee McDonald's much sweeter than this.

1110
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:31,080
It's also not great if you don't get it sweet.

1111
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,760
It just doesn't have like much coffee flavor.

1112
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,440
McDonald's. Yeah. Yes.

1113
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:36,240
I concur.

1114
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,120
I kind of need at least get a vanilla.

1115
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:42,600
Yeah, Scott, we'll try you eating free pebbles at a certain point.

1116
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:45,480
The drinking is maybe I can't even agree to the drinking.

1117
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:47,320
Well, we'll see. I'll see what I can find.

1118
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,600
That's where the degree of sugar will have me.

1119
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,320
I don't think you would. I don't want you.

1120
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:56,120
I don't offer my drinks to anyone, but I think you could drink some of this.

1121
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,440
I don't think this would be crazy.

1122
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:58,160
OK, OK.

1123
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:00,640
I don't know when this is coming out or

1124
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:03,760
what orders we're going to choose to put stuff out in.

1125
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:12,000
But I did purchase something for us to consume on air to get in the groove a little.

1126
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,200
OK, we're going to like start piecing this out.

1127
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,080
Yeah, we're going to we're going to build

1128
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:19,200
up your tolerance before we do the full tasting flight.

1129
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:20,800
Yeah.

1130
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,480
OK, Jason, do you have one or do you want me to go?

1131
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,480
You go ahead.

1132
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:27,320
OK, shoot, I had it.

1133
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:28,520
And of course, I lost it.

1134
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,480
Your mind's I got one quick.

1135
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:35,520
King, Koth, can we get Cub reporter Scott's review of the Bugmane live show

1136
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:41,080
he attended recently as you know, we're talking music and artists who we have a

1137
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:45,760
lot of affinity for and I think I think Bugmane is doing things in the hip hop

1138
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:50,800
forum, in the live music forum. I've only seen I want to say I've only seen like

1139
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,040
three or four concerts since concerts have returned post covid.

1140
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:57,280
And two of them have been Bugmane.

1141
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,480
I've not been disappointed by either.

1142
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,960
You said that.

1143
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,720
He's a he's a he's a revelation.

1144
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:08,840
I think P.F. Chang's one of the new songs is an absolute jam.

1145
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:13,760
I loved when he went into the audience and knocked the projector over.

1146
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,720
He

1147
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:20,760
when he took off his shirt, the whole audience was electrified

1148
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,720
and and King Koth is holding it down on the ones and twos.

1149
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,240
So a great live presentation.

1150
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,200
Don't miss this,

1151
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:30,080
this great live package if you have the opportunity.

1152
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,120
OK, great. Yeah.

1153
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:34,200
Check it out, everybody available on all streaming services.

1154
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,120
It's a here to hear Coco Pelli live.

1155
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:41,440
Imagine whatever Mike feels of hearing fix you fix you.

1156
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:42,240
Fix you.

1157
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:46,040
It's imagine one hundred fix yous all at once.

1158
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:49,280
And that's what it's like to hear the icon Bugmane doing the iconic song.

1159
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,000
Coco Pelli.

1160
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,720
Yeah, same thing.

1161
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:53,680
Jason, you got something?

1162
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:56,800
Yeah, this is from at George D.

1163
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Three. Just watch the fake doctor final four,

1164
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:03,600
appalled by Scott's willingness to invalidate the election results.

1165
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,200
So my question is,

1166
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,680
remember where

1167
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,400
where were you?

1168
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,720
Where was Scott on January six?

1169
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,920
Hashtag podcast the riot.

1170
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:15,880
I'll actually answer that.

1171
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:18,840
We were in our respective

1172
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,880
homes recording an episode while most of the January six.

1173
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:26,320
No, I believe we paused it.

1174
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:28,520
I believe I believe the day was pretty intense.

1175
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:31,560
And I think I said maybe we shouldn't maybe we'll record tomorrow.

1176
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:32,920
I thought we paused a different.

1177
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,840
I thought we called it maybe a different day.

1178
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:35,560
It was a different day.

1179
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:36,440
But yeah, you know, you're right.

1180
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:37,440
We did. We did record.

1181
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,800
We did. What episode was I don't remember?

1182
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:40,840
Yeah, no, Jason's right.

1183
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,560
I'm I'm misremembering what bullshit were we talking?

1184
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:44,280
So go back.

1185
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,400
And if there's an episode that came out like

1186
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:49,960
January, mid January, 2021, and it's weird.

1187
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,600
It's like during it's like right after.

1188
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,720
That might I don't know.

1189
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,600
We need to go back and figure out what that was.

1190
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:56,640
But we did do. You're right.

1191
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:57,440
No regrets.

1192
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,880
I think I made the right decision.

1193
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:01,720
I don't remember why I overturned them or what for.

1194
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:05,080
I think maybe I was just bored by the Muppet winning.

1195
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:08,640
And I didn't think it was unique or interesting enough.

1196
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:09,240
Right.

1197
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:12,000
And that wasn't the bold leadership that we needed then.

1198
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,920
It was whoever I chose that I don't remember.

1199
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,880
And Jason and I Jason and I were just, oh, we know it's OK.

1200
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:20,920
There's got to become reasonable again eventually.

1201
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:23,000
That's what that was our our thinking.

1202
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,040
So just let him do this.

1203
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:26,480
What's what's going to happen?

1204
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:30,360
We thought like, oh, everything will go back to normal and we don't need to deal

1205
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:32,000
with the urgency. When was that?

1206
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,160
That was probably that was like the I'm going to guess the date that it was like

1207
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:39,600
March 20th. So when the March 20th hearings have come and gone, well,

1208
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:42,680
we'll get to the bottom of whether I do.

1209
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:43,760
I need to be right.

1210
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:44,160
Right. Right.

1211
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:46,320
Banned from being a podcast host.

1212
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:47,720
Mm hmm.

1213
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,440
OK, let's see here.

1214
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:54,400
I have again lost the thing that I was going to say.

1215
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:58,240
There's a couple of people have asked about sleeping in a theme park.

1216
00:59:58,240 --> 00:59:58,520
I don't know.

1217
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,600
Does everybody have this fantasy?

1218
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:03,600
We've had multiple questions about sleeping in a theme park,

1219
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,720
which I guess is what everybody's just walking around there going, oh,

1220
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:06,600
I could sleep over there.

1221
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,680
You think it's anywhere nice in the treehouse?

1222
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:12,600
I don't remember the Tarzan's treehouse iteration and whatever's coming.

1223
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:17,200
I just like maybe there'll be a nice like under the stars tropical place to sleep.

1224
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:17,880
Yeah.

1225
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:20,840
Hopefully they bring back the jaunty polka music.

1226
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:22,000
Here's a good question.

1227
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,320
They will. Whatever it is.

1228
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:26,960
Here's a good question. What are our first sonas?

1229
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,560
Do you guys know what this is?

1230
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:35,400
I do know what a first sonas is, which I'm I have actually not given this any

1231
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:38,080
thought, so I'm excited to think about it.

1232
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:39,720
I need this defined a little more.

1233
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:44,200
I am not an expert on this, but I believe this is sort of

1234
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,640
adjacent or is the furry community.

1235
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:51,640
And in that you have your own basically like your own animal character.

1236
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:52,960
That's your first sona.

1237
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:55,200
That's your your avatar.

1238
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:57,120
Yeah, exactly. Like your avatar.

1239
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:01,680
And I know I've seen some people online, they have very nice drawings of this

1240
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:05,400
character, and then they sometimes people make an actual suit.

1241
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:06,720
I don't we don't have to do that.

1242
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:09,560
Obviously, we don't have time to make a suit right now, but we could at least

1243
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,360
say what animal you would like to be.

1244
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:12,920
I think there's no real rules to this.

1245
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:13,920
I think it'd be any animal.

1246
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:16,520
I think you could be maybe a hybrid.

1247
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:22,000
So I am intrigued by this question because like,

1248
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:23,640
I don't know what animal do you like?

1249
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:25,480
What would the animal do?

1250
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,000
The animal could I think could have powers.

1251
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,400
If I let's say the animal could have powers.

1252
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:31,160
Sure.

1253
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:35,720
Like off the top of my head, I feel like

1254
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:39,080
I feel like I would like to be like a fox or something.

1255
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,240
Mm hmm.

1256
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:46,720
Kind of like a fantastic Mr. Fox type, maybe with like a kind of a fancy fox,

1257
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:51,080
you know, like dressed like the top hat.

1258
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:54,320
Well, like like Uncle Wiggly,

1259
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:57,840
the rabbit gentleman is one of my favorite board games as a kid.

1260
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:58,920
I don't know if you've ever seen him.

1261
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,560
No, Jason, you know, Uncle Wiggly.

1262
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:04,600
Yeah, we definitely talked about Uncle Wiggly before he has a rheumatism.

1263
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:05,680
Yes, he has.

1264
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,120
Yes, he has trouble walking.

1265
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:08,560
That's true. That's canon.

1266
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:13,440
His nemesis or his antagonist is always trying to give him ear nibbles.

1267
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:14,960
This is a game.

1268
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:16,440
Well, stories as well.

1269
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:19,120
Yeah, Wiggly is now public domain.

1270
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:23,880
It was the thing where like the stories were published in like a weekly newspaper

1271
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:26,040
or magazine and then collected in books.

1272
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:31,000
And I had we used to take the Uncle Wiggly book out from the library.

1273
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,400
And then my mom found one at the garage sale.

1274
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:35,320
And then she found the board game.

1275
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:38,040
So, yes, yeah, we were we were Wiggly House.

1276
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:41,480
So you could say Jason and I, Uncle Wiggly taught Jason and I how to be weird

1277
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,360
in a lot of ways. Yeah.

1278
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:47,960
So Uncle Wiggly, I like I like Uncle Wiggly, all that to say.

1279
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:54,480
But maybe I think like a fancy fox, but maybe more like kind of loose 70s fox,

1280
01:02:54,680 --> 01:03:00,560
like like like like dressed like a Charles Nelson Riley on Match Game Fox,

1281
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:04,480
maybe with like a little more of like a neckerchief or something and kind of like

1282
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:09,880
maybe more of a leisure leisure suit and kind of like with a martini in his hand.

1283
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:14,520
Like, I guess I guess I'm describing like a swarthy fox, which I guess I like.

1284
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:20,880
I guess I want to be a little bit like 70s swarthy fox, 70s Playboy Fox,

1285
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:24,480
a 70s Playboy Fox with sort of a neckerchief.

1286
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:25,720
I could have an ascot.

1287
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:28,840
I could have like a Vincent Price ascot on as well.

1288
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:31,040
And then do we have names for personas?

1289
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,160
Do they have their own names?

1290
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:34,320
I don't I don't quite know.

1291
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,680
I guess, again, we could there's no rules to this, I think.

1292
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:40,160
So we could probably come up with like

1293
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,920
like what would be what would be a fun name for this?

1294
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:44,720
What is the how are they named?

1295
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:45,720
What are I don't know.

1296
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:49,120
I'm sure there's very specific roles depending on what type of persona you're

1297
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:53,400
doing, but maybe

1298
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,720
Foxy.

1299
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:58,520
Wow. With an eye.

1300
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,080
OK.

1301
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:03,280
Sure. That's all that fancies it up, doesn't it?

1302
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:05,960
Foxy with an eye. Yeah, this is pretty good.

1303
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:08,120
I just that's a pretty good persona, honestly.

1304
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:11,760
Yeah. Well, and you're look, you're ahead of me because I'm trying to think about

1305
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:13,760
this and I'm like, I don't like these.

1306
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:15,240
I don't want to be one.

1307
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:18,600
I don't really I don't I don't I've always had a hard time answering.

1308
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:19,880
What kind of animal would you be?

1309
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:21,560
I don't know if I want to be a horrible.

1310
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:23,280
I know. I know. That's a boring question.

1311
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:25,640
I feel like this is a fair to be like, you're right.

1312
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:28,000
I should be an anthropomorphic animal.

1313
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,400
This is everything I ever dreamed of.

1314
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:31,040
This is beyond animal.

1315
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:34,400
I need to be more creative, I guess.

1316
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:37,880
Yeah. Just be like Uncle Wiggly, the rabbit gentleman, which I think is what Jason's

1317
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:42,360
going to say. Well, I was going to say I'd probably be some variety of sleepy bear.

1318
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:44,080
So I don't know if that's a panda.

1319
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:45,640
Panda was where my mind went first.

1320
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:49,200
And then I started thinking about the sleepy time T-Bear, which we needed to

1321
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:51,560
universe of sleepy time T-Bears.

1322
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:52,720
Yeah. Yeah.

1323
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:53,720
Well, what's he what's he wearing?

1324
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:54,600
He's wearing a big night shirt.

1325
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:57,120
Is he wearing the night before Christmas dad outfit?

1326
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:01,040
Yeah. I mean, ever since I was kid, I've always gravitated to like two sizes,

1327
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:02,160
two big sleep shirt.

1328
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:06,200
OK. Or you could have like the old like the kids version with the butt flap to go

1329
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:06,960
to the bathroom.

1330
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:11,600
Yeah. I mean, flaps and zippers and foot.

1331
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,760
When I was a child, I don't think I've ever said this before.

1332
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:17,720
I know there's still some child neuroses we haven't talked about.

1333
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:23,360
I have always I had a very sweaty feet as a child and still do.

1334
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,840
So, oh, wow.

1335
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:27,520
Jason's sweaty feet.

1336
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:32,280
So my you know, footy pajamas, it's a one piece.

1337
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,040
And that includes the feet.

1338
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:37,720
And so at some point, my mom just started cutting the feet off because it's just

1339
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:42,800
like, wow, really, you are going to get you are getting a rash or you're getting

1340
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:43,400
irritated.

1341
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:46,000
Did you get feet rash as a child from your footy?

1342
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:50,120
Probably like whatever version of like athlete's foot or some sort.

1343
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:52,080
Yeah. So started cutting them off.

1344
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:54,400
I still I hate sleeping with socks on.

1345
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:55,280
I do not.

1346
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:58,000
I mean, I don't like that either.

1347
01:05:58,040 --> 01:05:59,160
Yeah. Wow.

1348
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:01,360
Sweating. I do. I do like sleeping with socks on.

1349
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:02,000
Really?

1350
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,360
And I kick them off triumphantly as the night goes on.

1351
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:06,760
I've done that. Oh, sure.

1352
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:07,560
Yeah. Good to me.

1353
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,240
If I fall asleep, I would do that.

1354
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:12,200
I that was another that was a trick in the Boy Scouts.

1355
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:16,720
We go cold weather camp and you put clean socks on for bed because you lose most

1356
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,200
your heat from your head or your feet.

1357
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:22,640
So if you wear a knit cap and you wear socks, you're going to be a lot cosier.

1358
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:25,960
Oh, but don't wear the socks you wore all day because they've absorbed the

1359
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:27,120
moisture from the day.

1360
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:32,760
My gosh. So you would your footy pajamas were just like just water bags by the end

1361
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:33,240
of the night.

1362
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:36,040
Just just a pair of scissors.

1363
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:37,240
Just chop off the feet.

1364
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:38,800
So OK, I got your name.

1365
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:40,520
Your name is Barefoot the bear.

1366
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:41,960
That sounds great.

1367
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,480
So you have you're a bear.

1368
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:46,200
You have some sort of comfortable pajamas.

1369
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:49,400
But then there's kind of like you can see that the feet have been cut off of the

1370
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:50,760
footy pajamas for the bear.

1371
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:55,120
Perfect. So you're Barefoot the bear and you've got a little cap on and you're

1372
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:58,520
sure. I mean, I like the ease of one piece of clothing.

1373
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:05,840
You know, OK, so Barefoot Foxy and I'm thinking like what what if I if we're

1374
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:11,680
using powers, if I could be a zebra, but I'm not limited to black and white, if I

1375
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:16,760
can change those colors, any color in this so I could just like just think it,

1376
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:21,520
manifest it and then go through a psychedelic light show with my stripes.

1377
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:23,720
Like whenever I like fruit stripe gum zebra.

1378
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:24,600
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1379
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:26,680
Oh, I like fruit stripe gum zebra.

1380
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:27,640
Yeah. Yeah.

1381
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:28,240
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1382
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:28,880
And Kate eventually.

1383
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:29,880
What's his name?

1384
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:33,320
I don't know.

1385
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:39,120
So, yeah, but I that I can essentially do like insta heffalump and woozle type

1386
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:45,600
sequences either to impress people or as a distraction, as kind of like a little

1387
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,200
flash bomb that goes off.

1388
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:53,920
So with like with I don't want to just be stripey.

1389
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:57,040
I don't want to I don't want to just be basic here.

1390
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:58,920
How do I do I juice up this name?

1391
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,960
Oh, oh, um, visor.

1392
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:03,360
Oh, juice up the name.

1393
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:07,560
You know, say psycho stripes, psycho stripes is good.

1394
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:12,840
Oh, he's joined the psychedelic record or psychophantic records family.

1395
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:13,840
What about stripe?

1396
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:14,840
Oh, just stripe.

1397
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,280
Oh, that's nice and clean.

1398
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:18,720
I figured you'd have like a little package for me.

1399
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:19,000
Yeah.

1400
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Into the first.

1401
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Well, you've got a first.

1402
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,280
So good.

1403
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:23,240
My name is so good.

1404
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:24,320
Of course, when you started with.

1405
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:26,240
Yeah, I knew we could pass the ball to you.

1406
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:29,720
So Foxy Stripo and barefoot barefoot the bear.

1407
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:30,440
Barefoot the bear.

1408
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:30,960
Perfect.

1409
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:32,280
That's good.

1410
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:33,360
So cute.

1411
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:35,480
I know that all three of them are cute.

1412
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:37,720
Yeah, no question about those.

1413
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:43,360
There was a theme park question if you can imagine.

1414
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:48,320
I think was it just what's what's all of your dream park?

1415
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:49,720
What's the one you haven't been to?

1416
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,800
And now I can't find the actual place.

1417
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:52,800
Yeah.

1418
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:57,680
Like, what's the what's the one that's the white whale at this point that you're dying

1419
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:58,200
to go to?

1420
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:02,840
Oh, well, I guess for me, I mean, I'm the only one who hasn't been to Tokyo at Disney

1421
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:03,120
yet.

1422
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:10,360
But I'm also curious of like some of the smaller parks we talked about, some of the

1423
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:16,880
regional parks with like specific stuff like Lagoon, Salt Lake City, Lagoon and

1424
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,800
it's a can of Kenobi.

1425
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:23,640
Yeah, I've been to Kenobles.

1426
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,160
I haven't been to Kenobie.

1427
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:28,240
I don't think that's how you say it, but that is how you say Kenobles.

1428
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,120
But now you don't say Kenobles.

1429
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,280
You don't put the emphasis on bull.

1430
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:34,800
Oh, I, you know, I can't speak to that.

1431
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:39,600
Hey, Lord, just free theme park or amusement park in America, I think, because it's

1432
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,120
still ticket based systems.

1433
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:45,000
I mean, I either Bore or Dollywood and Efteling, I guess.

1434
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:45,600
Yeah.

1435
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:46,000
Yeah.

1436
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:46,680
You don't have to.

1437
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:47,920
Why are you so down on it?

1438
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:48,720
Because I want to be.

1439
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:50,800
Those are exciting places to go.

1440
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:51,560
I want to be interesting.

1441
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:53,400
Say Dollywood and Efteling.

1442
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:54,720
I don't want to.

1443
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:58,080
I don't want to be interesting in music, but I want to be interesting in my choices for

1444
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:59,400
my dream park visit.

1445
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:01,360
What's your dream song to listen to?

1446
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:02,120
Any song.

1447
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:05,840
I mean, again, if it sucks, that helps put it at the top of the list.

1448
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:07,920
But just songs, any song.

1449
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,160
I've been I'm trying to look.

1450
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:12,480
OK, what I've been listening to is Red Hot Chili Peppers, By the Way, which is the

1451
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:14,640
20th anniversary of By the Way.

1452
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:15,760
You I need to hear.

1453
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:18,880
I don't think I've found all the ins and outs of By the Way.

1454
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:20,280
Well, there's a great.

1455
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:22,280
No, it's got their secrets left to this.

1456
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:25,240
There was a great stereo gum article saying it was their best album.

1457
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:26,960
But then look at I also.

1458
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:28,200
The album, not the song.

1459
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:30,000
Yeah, I've also been listening to Wet Lag.

1460
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:31,160
That's a new band.

1461
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:32,240
That's a cool new band.

1462
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:32,880
OK.

1463
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,440
And Harry's House.

1464
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:36,880
Great.

1465
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,440
You were telling us you like Harry's House.

1466
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:46,840
I I listened to a song earlier when I was exercising, and I don't think either of

1467
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:48,360
you will be happy to hear it.

1468
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:52,920
But do you know the song Uma Thurman by Fall Out Boy?

1469
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:53,880
Yes, of course.

1470
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:57,360
I know Uma Thurman by Fall Out Boy, Jason.

1471
01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:00,840
If you were talking about songs or you're just like, I don't know this very good, but

1472
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:01,440
I like it.

1473
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:02,840
I think that's fine.

1474
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:07,280
There's a lot of monsters talk in the air, so it got caught stuck in my head.

1475
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:08,160
So I put it on.

1476
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:13,400
That song exists for sure.

1477
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:16,160
You might have you're you went a little too far for Mike.

1478
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:20,200
Well, the only reason is just I'm such a traditionalist when it comes to the monsters.

1479
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:21,840
You want to get in the way.

1480
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:22,480
Yeah, yeah.

1481
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:23,040
That's fair.

1482
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:23,840
I'm not against.

1483
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:29,000
I mean, in the instance of that low cash song, the Beach Boys that I that I like.

1484
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:35,080
When it samples another song and yeah, well, yeah, low cash Beach Boys is pretty.

1485
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:36,400
It doesn't get any better than that.

1486
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:43,200
Yeah, there's a lot of there's a hypothetical music podcast we do also where I get to go

1487
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:47,960
through all of this weird stuff like the the Everclear cover of Brown Eyed Girl, where

1488
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:51,800
he adds his own intro, original musical intro to it.

1489
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:55,560
That is really this music.

1490
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:58,800
This music podcast will have different co-hosts.

1491
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:00,080
That's fine.

1492
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,040
Perhaps none, perhaps no.

1493
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:04,760
Go on in, Scott.

1494
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:05,720
The song.

1495
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:06,480
Come on in.

1496
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:08,240
The door locks behind you.

1497
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:09,880
We're going album by album.

1498
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:11,320
They might be Giants.

1499
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:16,520
We're doing a 19 part series on the double Everclear album Songs from an American Movie

1500
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:17,480
Part One and Two.

1501
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:23,160
Maybe it's when bands do their statement about America.

1502
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:24,000
They have a song.

1503
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:28,480
They had a song about being a rock star before Nickelback had a song about being a rock

1504
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,880
star and no one before Everclear.

1505
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:31,440
Yeah, never.

1506
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:32,800
This was a new premise.

1507
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:33,840
And I really like that.

1508
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:34,120
Yeah.

1509
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:36,560
So anyway, Jason, you have something.

1510
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:37,320
Yeah.

1511
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:40,400
From at Mel got served.

1512
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:41,080
Hi Mel.

1513
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:45,640
Thoughts on the carousel of progress wardrobe plus ups in the final scene.

1514
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,920
We addressed it earlier for like them.

1515
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,920
Yeah, that it's more current.

1516
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:53,680
It makes sense.

1517
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,000
I think everyone looks good.

1518
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:56,920
There's some details.

1519
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:59,480
There's some cute little Easter eggs in there.

1520
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:00,040
Moving on.

1521
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:00,320
Great.

1522
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:00,840
Okay.

1523
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:01,360
Yeah.

1524
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:03,960
Let's see here.

1525
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:06,440
What's a cue that Mike and Jason would do.

1526
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:10,600
Thanks for leaving me out knowing that they couldn't ride the ride at the end.

1527
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:11,720
It's from Nick Nick.

1528
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:14,280
Oh, couldn't ride the ride at the end.

1529
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:15,200
We're going to only do the kill.

1530
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:16,080
Oh, it's Guardians.

1531
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:17,080
I think for sure.

1532
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:18,120
I would walk.

1533
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:21,080
You would just willingly do the Guardians queue and not go on the ride.

1534
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:23,400
Well, I would prefer to go on the ride.

1535
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:24,360
But you don't get to.

1536
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:24,880
That's out.

1537
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:25,640
That's the question.

1538
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:29,240
But I like the rocket show so much and I like looking at the stuff in the cases.

1539
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:30,040
How long are we?

1540
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:33,640
So you're you've been told you're going to do this and there is no ride at the end.

1541
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,760
The weight is 45 minutes.

1542
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:39,320
That was was that part of the question was that the weight is intense.

1543
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,040
Is it the waiting is very long.

1544
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:43,440
I don't think the weight is only five minutes.

1545
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:46,440
Then there's no I would do all of them if the way was only five minutes.

1546
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,160
You have to put some stakes into this.

1547
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:48,640
I think.

1548
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:50,320
Well, there has to be going to ask him.

1549
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:51,160
Maybe he'll respond.

1550
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:52,080
30 minutes.

1551
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:53,040
30.

1552
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:54,800
I mean, what else?

1553
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:55,800
And in between.

1554
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:57,480
Hmm.

1555
01:13:58,080 --> 01:13:58,960
Indiana Jones.

1556
01:13:58,960 --> 01:13:59,760
I mean, I like.

1557
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:03,680
I Guardians, I think I think that's that's the bet.

1558
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:06,840
One of the most fun queues and pre shows you can get.

1559
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:08,560
I mean, I guess Rise of the Resistance.

1560
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:12,520
If you can, if you count spoiler alert, spoiler alert two years later

1561
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:16,600
going on Lieutenant Beck ship, I guess, I guess maybe that one then.

1562
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:17,560
I think that's a cheat.

1563
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:18,680
I think that's not that's a cheat.

1564
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:19,320
Yeah, yeah.

1565
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:20,320
Yeah, we need a cue.

1566
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:21,160
That's a ride.

1567
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:22,880
There's there's a ride in the queue.

1568
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,640
There is no no rides.

1569
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:27,080
A lot of good Easter eggs in the amazing spider.

1570
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:29,160
Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man queue.

1571
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:32,280
You go through the Daily Bugle offices and something back to islands.

1572
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:34,440
Back to island time.

1573
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:35,120
You would do that.

1574
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:37,240
You would do that queue and then no ride.

1575
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:37,960
Yeah.

1576
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:40,320
OK, yeah, I would do that queue and no ride as well.

1577
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:41,520
Yeah.

1578
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:42,040
I'll wait.

1579
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:42,440
Let's see here.

1580
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:43,760
I'm going to keep I'll wait 30 minutes.

1581
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:45,320
I'm there for the day.

1582
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:46,520
I'm going to keep I'm going to keep down it up.

1583
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:47,920
Forty five. Same.

1584
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:48,720
You'll do it.

1585
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:51,680
It's because it's hard.

1586
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:54,960
You're explaining to me like what's what's going on there.

1587
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:56,160
The ride is broken.

1588
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:00,520
Yeah, the ride's broken, but they left the they left you open.

1589
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,280
The door is open, but the ride is broken.

1590
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:04,480
And I don't know why all the people are still in it.

1591
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:05,520
I'm bad.

1592
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:06,840
I that I can't account.

1593
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:08,200
That doesn't make much sense.

1594
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:11,120
So the hypothetical a lot of people stuck there.

1595
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:15,120
They're like kind of they're like video game avatars.

1596
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:18,680
They're like from Rollercoaster Tycoon, where they're like kind of

1597
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:21,200
like one cell organism.

1598
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:23,640
You've stuck. They don't they don't know that they can leave.

1599
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:24,880
They it is line.

1600
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:27,440
I must be in line sidewalk and they know there's no way to go.

1601
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:30,560
And you've deleted part of the sidewalk and now they're just stuck roaming.

1602
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:34,280
The only exit, there's no there's a problem with the entrance.

1603
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:36,560
As soon as you're in.

1604
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:38,240
They shut the entrance.

1605
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:41,080
There's a there's a beeswarm at the entrance.

1606
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:43,200
Something that just happened to me at Universal Studios.

1607
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:45,480
There's a beehive, so you can't go out the front.

1608
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:48,040
The only way is out the back.

1609
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:49,360
OK, all right.

1610
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:52,680
I honestly like if.

1611
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:58,440
If they said like Spider-Man is closed for five years or 10 years,

1612
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:01,320
we have a big problem with it.

1613
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:04,520
And you can wait in line and go through the queue.

1614
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:08,360
And I had somebody away with that wasn't going to be was like into it like Jason.

1615
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:11,880
That wasn't going to give you any shit about Everclear.

1616
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:14,880
Yeah, that wasn't going to make was going to talk with me about Everclear

1617
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:18,000
in a real way, in like a reasonable way.

1618
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:20,120
Wait, it was in a real way.

1619
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:23,760
Mean like in a real case, I'm going to do that's real about Everclear.

1620
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:27,440
Jason's got to listen to what Alex Zach has to say about,

1621
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:30,720
you know, growing up and fatherhood and all that stuff.

1622
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:33,120
And he's going to be we're going to be dealing, you know, the real shit.

1623
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:34,400
It's going to get real with you.

1624
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:37,480
Yeah, yeah. It's some real some Mark Maron talk

1625
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:40,480
in this queue about Everclear and their double album.

1626
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:42,880
You know what I'll say on so much for the afterglow Everclear,

1627
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:43,760
so much for the afterglow.

1628
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:46,680
The start of it really sounds with a nice Beach Boys type

1629
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:50,880
kind of riff before they go into the main hard rockin song.

1630
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:56,480
Yeah, but yes, but Beach Boys pastiches and tributes have been perfected by low cash.

1631
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:58,920
That's true. By current country,

1632
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:03,960
60 somethings with dyed goatees, low cash.

1633
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:06,760
So I can't imagine that it tops low cash.

1634
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:07,840
It probably doesn't.

1635
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:11,480
But so, yeah, so, yeah, I mean, obviously,

1636
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:13,600
there's an agenda of stuff you're going to get done.

1637
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:17,040
But here, OK, I've waited for dumber things

1638
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:20,000
than just walking to see the cartoon Daily Bugle.

1639
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,880
Oh, yeah. A lot dumber things for a lot longer.

1640
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:25,160
I've waited for dumber things at Comic Con.

1641
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:26,560
I've waited for dumber comic.

1642
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:29,480
We can do, you know, Captain America's famous line.

1643
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:32,120
We can do I can do this all day while he's fighting, getting beat up.

1644
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:33,800
That's what Jason and I are like with lines.

1645
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:35,280
I doesn't fazes at all.

1646
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:38,440
I would beg my parents to take me to the dirty holiday

1647
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:40,880
and buy the airport because they've set up folding tables

1648
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:43,680
so different vendors can sell comic books and trading cards.

1649
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:46,920
Yeah. Wow. And it smells like cigarettes.

1650
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:48,680
Probably still to this day.

1651
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:50,960
I've never. Yeah, we've never met a line that we couldn't.

1652
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:52,880
We couldn't stand it.

1653
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:55,160
We stood in line for eight hours to meet Springsteen.

1654
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:58,040
Was it eight? I thought it was six.

1655
01:17:58,040 --> 01:17:59,480
We got up at like three in the morning.

1656
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:00,720
Yeah, we kept doing.

1657
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:03,080
We did. Jason did. Yeah.

1658
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:04,920
It was my birthday.

1659
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:08,120
Oh, meeting the day before my birthday.

1660
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:10,520
I think I think it was like October 3rd.

1661
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:13,680
And then the next day you were like, all right, see you in 10 hours

1662
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:16,920
because we were going to Disneyland for my birthday. That's right.

1663
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:20,840
So yeah, I I I Spider-Man or or Guardians.

1664
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:22,680
Geez. Yeah.

1665
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:26,120
It's my take away from that is not only is it yes, you'll do it.

1666
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:28,640
I think you actively want to do it now.

1667
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:31,640
You're now now you seem like you got to a place of like

1668
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:34,400
you want this bonding with your pal Jason.

1669
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:37,720
You want this 45 minutes talking about, you know, no, right?

1670
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,280
It's it's a daily bugle,

1671
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:45,360
open house where you can get real about Everclear.

1672
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:47,400
You seemed wistful for that.

1673
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:48,680
We a little bit. Yeah.

1674
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:50,440
As long as we can talk about the instrumental song,

1675
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:52,760
I'll distort Odey melodica.

1676
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:54,200
That's on so much for the afterglow.

1677
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:58,440
As long as his Internet's working, he can play like 10 or 15 second clips.

1678
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:00,520
That was my entrance music for back at wrestling.

1679
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:01,960
Is that so? Wow.

1680
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:03,920
So instrumental, pretty hard.

1681
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:04,840
It's kind of hard.

1682
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:07,240
So honestly, it's sort of like a tough guy.

1683
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,640
Type song. So.

1684
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:12,400
Let's see, what do we got?

1685
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:16,040
We're both so we're all so blown.

1686
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:17,800
We're so you're mentally there.

1687
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:19,880
We have a lot of treats and sleep questions.

1688
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:23,520
So let me address those.

1689
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:25,680
Live, live, treat, repeat.

1690
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:26,680
That's what I.

1691
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:29,000
Sleep, treat, repeat.

1692
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,960
People ask about a Vegas live show one day.

1693
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:35,000
If you know where we could do it, if you like.

1694
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:37,200
Yeah. And you're in.

1695
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:38,640
Where the park park?

1696
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:40,560
Yeah, the park theater.

1697
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:41,960
Residency. Yeah.

1698
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:43,520
I mean, sounds good.

1699
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:44,640
In theater. Yeah.

1700
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:47,560
In between brutal Mars and Lady Gaga's residences or the

1701
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:50,600
of Aerosmith, I think is coming back in September.

1702
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:54,240
Yes. Because you've been fooled so many times.

1703
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:57,240
This is a Lucy in the football situation.

1704
01:19:57,240 --> 01:19:59,360
There are discounts in those.

1705
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:00,640
My Vegas games.

1706
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:03,200
One of the rewards is Aerosmith.

1707
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,240
But there's no comp tickets.

1708
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:07,400
But there are like 25 percent off tickets.

1709
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:10,120
So you got to work only eighty five dollars.

1710
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:12,600
What are you guys doing the podcast for?

1711
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:14,680
Why aren't you playing this game to get your Aerosmith?

1712
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:16,560
Well, I am playing the game.

1713
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:17,760
I want to get in the pit, though.

1714
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:20,200
I need to be in the pit at the Las Vegas.

1715
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:21,720
Deuces are wild residency.

1716
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:23,760
Steven Tyler, get in the fucking pit.

1717
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:26,760
You want you need to become

1718
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:30,640
COVID eligible again,

1719
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:32,320
because you had your bout with it.

1720
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:34,320
Sure. And you want it to run out.

1721
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:39,400
And then you want to get COVID from Steven Tyler's sweat droplets.

1722
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:41,840
There was going to be a way to catch a new variant.

1723
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:44,000
It would be from Steven Tyler. Yes.

1724
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:48,080
This M.F. gotten monkeypox in the Aerosmith Deuces Wild Pit.

1725
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:53,120
If I could get on stage and play a little harmonico with Steven,

1726
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:54,800
I have his arm.

1727
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:58,480
I'll put my mouth on his dirty spit covered harmonica.

1728
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:03,120
What's gross about that?

1729
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:05,320
What did I say? That was weird.

1730
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:08,880
You managed to top Jason's sweaty footy feet.

1731
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:10,360
The grossest thing thus far.

1732
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:13,760
But then you imagine like Steven Tyler's dirty harmonica.

1733
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:18,440
Yes. I bet it's like he smells like vanilla or something.

1734
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:20,240
But it's fine.

1735
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:21,200
I like this question.

1736
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:23,040
This Dunkin Donuts vanilla that I.

1737
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:26,080
You're the most idealized Steven Tyler I could ever imagine.

1738
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:29,600
He smells nice and he's a wonderful dad.

1739
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:32,880
Steven Tyler smells like my big treat coffee.

1740
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:36,000
Yeah, right. Says Michael

1741
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,160
from at BF Wings 55.

1742
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:41,640
Do you think Beasley Kingdom would have lived up to its height potential?

1743
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:45,640
Would it have been torn down to be replaced by Avatar anyway?

1744
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:47,840
No, not tearing it.

1745
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:49,040
I don't think tearing it down.

1746
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:51,960
They did that like because Beasley Kingdom was the not built

1747
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:55,920
like mythical creature part of Animal Kingdom that had like a dueling

1748
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:59,400
dragon coaster with like a maybe a was it a robot dragon

1749
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:01,520
in the middle of like a castle? I think similar.

1750
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:03,560
Hey, that's a good episode idea.

1751
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:05,320
We should go through that.

1752
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:07,560
But no, there's that was a that would have been a cool

1753
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:10,760
roller coaster, and they generally don't tear down

1754
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:12,720
cool roller coasters that are popular.

1755
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:15,320
Yeah, I don't think that would ever have been torn down.

1756
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:18,920
And especially there is stuff with like big characters, like if they put beast

1757
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:21,440
from Beauty and the Beast or what?

1758
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:22,200
Something like that.

1759
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:23,960
Beasts, where they're going to put beast in there.

1760
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:26,000
That's where my mind goes first.

1761
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:30,120
No, I think it was all like mythical, like dragons in the lore of yesteryear.

1762
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:30,960
Beast is mythical.

1763
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:33,320
Yeah, a prince who is cursed and turned into a beast.

1764
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:36,160
But this wasn't part of the this is never leaked that they were going

1765
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,640
to put beast in Beasley Kingdom.

1766
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:38,600
No, you're making this up.

1767
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:40,240
But I'm making it up.

1768
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:43,760
But I feel like if Disney is making something called Beasley, like

1769
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:47,080
they're going to find a place to put the beast in there somewhere.

1770
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:50,040
Be interesting to go to a realm that's all beasts.

1771
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:52,680
Like, I guess beasts isn't like Wookiees.

1772
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:56,800
It's not a race of it's not like a type of creature.

1773
01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:00,200
Yeah, because that only happens to this this mean prince.

1774
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:07,280
Right. But seeing an entire world of beasts and baby beasts and lady beasts,

1775
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:08,440
I would be interesting.

1776
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:11,160
And what do they eat and what do they do?

1777
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:15,760
Warner Brothers tried that with Fantastic Beasts, and the world said, no, thank you.

1778
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:17,800
They tried three times.

1779
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:19,000
They tried three times.

1780
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,440
Here, let's give it one more go.

1781
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:24,760
But there's a lot of different characters named Beast also.

1782
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:26,320
Obviously, there's an X-Man named Beast.

1783
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,160
There's the Beast from Beauty and the Beast.

1784
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:30,720
There's a Masters of the Universe character Beast Man.

1785
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:34,640
Was it one of those guys who ran the ghost kitchen?

1786
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:36,640
Isn't one of them? Or is it like a?

1787
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:40,000
Yeah, wait, one of those ghost kitchens that Robert Earl runs.

1788
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,000
The Beast. Yeah, Beast.

1789
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,560
Mr. Beast. Mr. Beast.

1790
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:43,200
Yes. Mr. Beast.

1791
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:44,080
They could have updated.

1792
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:46,760
They could have made it cool for the kids by putting Mr. Beast in.

1793
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:48,040
So, yeah, Mr. B. Yeah, yeah.

1794
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:50,800
So they could have just done any character that's ever been named

1795
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,120
Beast or a beast in the name.

1796
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:53,240
Oh, man, that would have been great.

1797
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:56,600
A theme park show that's like the Dick Cabot show.

1798
01:23:56,600 --> 01:24:00,880
It's long conversations between Beast from X-Men, Beast from Beauty and the Beast,

1799
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:05,240
and Mr. Beast Burger just being a scamp like he always is.

1800
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:06,400
Wow. Wow.

1801
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:08,680
Different generations, different perspectives.

1802
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:11,160
I think a lot's going to get accomplished there.

1803
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:13,360
I have a... We should maybe wind it down.

1804
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:17,040
There's two that kind of go next to each other, I think, potentially.

1805
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:19,560
One is from Sabs.

1806
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:22,120
The people want to know when y'all are coming back to Orlando.

1807
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:24,920
We don't have an answer for that, but we'd certainly like to.

1808
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:26,760
And right next to that, Kate Mollo.

1809
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:31,200
And I'm sorry, will Jason Sheridan ever give Lake Nona a chance?

1810
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:34,640
I live there and it's not as bad as he thinks.

1811
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:36,920
Now, I was almost straying away from this, but being that...

1812
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:37,880
Here's what I'm going to do.

1813
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:39,760
I want to put these next to each other and say,

1814
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:41,520
because obviously we'd like to come back to Orlando.

1815
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:43,120
We're trying to figure that out.

1816
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:47,360
But if we do that, I feel like at this point, we have to take Jason down to Lake Nona.

1817
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:48,520
We got to show you around.

1818
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:51,200
I'm sure there's great establishments in Lake Nona.

1819
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:53,640
I will happily give it a chance.

1820
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:54,480
Really?

1821
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:56,320
We're waiting for where you step in it.

1822
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:57,320
Go ahead.

1823
01:24:58,880 --> 01:24:59,880
Whatever...

1824
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:04,120
As video goes up, I'm going to look right in this camera.

1825
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:04,640
Oh, boy.

1826
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:06,720
And I'm talking right to the audience.

1827
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:11,040
Whatever point I was trying to make, I fucked up a long time ago.

1828
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:14,160
So I'm just along for the ride right now.

1829
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:16,120
So, yeah, I will do...

1830
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:17,760
I'll get a shot.

1831
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:19,960
I will go to the...

1832
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,480
It'll be exciting to see Lake Nona's $5 coffee

1833
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:25,960
compares to Burbank's $5 coffee.

1834
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:27,760
It's all the same.

1835
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:32,840
Can I propose a question to Kate or anyone else?

1836
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:36,080
Is there a venue in Lake Nona?

1837
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:37,920
I guess there is live in Lake Nona?

1838
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:42,840
Is there a venue that could house a little podcast show?

1839
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:44,640
All right, a little homework for Kate.

1840
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:45,440
Let us know.

1841
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:46,680
Is it a coffee shop?

1842
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:48,440
Is it in the middle of the lake?

1843
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:50,280
Can they put an aquatic stage up?

1844
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:50,720
Yeah.

1845
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,560
Is it something where the whole town...

1846
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:56,320
If we just put a couple of flyers up, the whole town will gather together?

1847
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:59,760
Is that a certain level of teasing where I'll start to get upset?

1848
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:00,640
Maybe.

1849
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:04,200
Will that lead to a certain level of teasing?

1850
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:06,000
A certain level of razzing where I'm like,

1851
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,240
I don't know what I did, but I feel real bad.

1852
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:13,240
No, what it's going to do is give you the best night of your life in Lake Nona.

1853
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:15,480
It's going to completely reverse your expectation.

1854
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:17,440
And by the way, the point you were trying to make,

1855
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:21,080
which we never disagreed with, was you didn't want these Imagineers to have to move.

1856
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:22,880
And now you won on that one.

1857
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:23,680
They're not doing it.

1858
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:24,240
We think so, yeah.

1859
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:25,200
Maybe ever.

1860
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:26,000
They punted on that.

1861
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,440
They punted on that for a long time.

1862
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:31,240
So I think it's a perfect opportunity to divide the issues.

1863
01:26:31,240 --> 01:26:34,880
That forced relocation is gone great.

1864
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:38,200
Now the place we can reclaim, we can reclaim the beauty and the magic.

1865
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:40,160
Now we can start fresh, fresh start.

1866
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:40,720
Yeah.

1867
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:41,800
You know, fresh start.

1868
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:44,280
We're starting fresh and you're hearing it more and more.

1869
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:48,000
And I think I think really what and I guess I shouldn't give this away on the podcast,

1870
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:52,720
but I think that the podcast should start you coming on stage

1871
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:55,640
and just chastising the audience for 15 minutes about living here.

1872
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:00,280
What are you doing?

1873
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:04,560
So lights down, you're like in full like wrestling heel mode.

1874
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:06,920
I yeah, yeah.

1875
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:10,600
And then you get like visited by like an angel, maybe the mayor of Lake Nona.

1876
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:13,120
It's a full. Yeah, it's a full like it's going to be narrative.

1877
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:14,160
It's not even the regular podcast.

1878
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:15,480
It's going to put on a little play.

1879
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:16,680
I will go full.

1880
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:18,560
I will go full M.G.F.

1881
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:22,560
M.J.F. where like at the start of the eight minutes, the audience is booing me.

1882
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:25,560
And then by the end, they're like just cheering me.

1883
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:27,080
That's yes. That's what we would like.

1884
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:30,440
You want to do a turn like a double turn, not a double turn, a regular turn,

1885
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:35,040
an emotional, a full emotional arc as you've had with the place

1886
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:39,000
as you will end up at like from from despising to loving.

1887
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,120
I think it's I think it's beautiful.

1888
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:43,760
I think yeah, I think this is I think this is a great idea.

1889
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:47,880
If we can make this happen, I think it's something we should put on the high priority.

1890
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:51,760
Can we do a show in the husk of the like hip office space?

1891
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:56,480
This was absolutely that might be the most that we have.

1892
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:57,720
I hear it's free.

1893
01:27:57,720 --> 01:28:01,280
The roof of the building that the Imagineers were going to be working out of.

1894
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:05,320
If we can rent that the company like a Beatles, like Abbey Road rooftop.

1895
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:11,080
The Walt Disney Company decided it might not be pertinent

1896
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:14,360
if the entire government and the residents of the villages

1897
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:17,440
are just frothing at them out to get their hands on their employees.

1898
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:19,480
Yep. Yep. So I don't know.

1899
01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:22,120
That sounds like a great idea and a great place to stop.

1900
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:23,360
We can't get higher than that.

1901
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:27,280
I don't think so. Podcast the ride live in Lake Nona coming.

1902
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:29,240
So, wow, we really cracked it.

1903
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:30,440
That's the way to do it.

1904
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:34,200
And artists, if you're a little stuck on what to work on next,

1905
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:36,240
there's some great for sonas.

1906
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:37,720
It does well. The first one is.

1907
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:39,760
Yeah, I mean, I don't even I was thinking about that, too.

1908
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:41,880
And I feel like we didn't even have to call for that art.

1909
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:44,000
That's coming. They just started.

1910
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,480
People are like furiously scribbling as everybody got the pens out.

1911
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:48,840
OK, well, then do that.

1912
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:52,520
Send it to us on the socials at podcast the ride.

1913

01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:11,720
We get one more bonus episode every month and where your participation

1918
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:17,080
is always key as opposed to these post offices, which now we're shutting.

1919
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:18,800
Shutting by and playing.

1920
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:20,440
No more thoughts.

1921
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:22,080
Keep it. Keep it zipped.

1922
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:25,480
We talk next time as opposed to this.

1923
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:27,920
Oh, yeah. We talk about what we want to talk about,

1924
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:31,800
not with loose suggestions, sometimes staying completely on topic.

1925
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:35,360
We're not going to talk about Everclear Sparkle and Fade album

1926
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:38,600
that has the song Santa Monica and many other.

1927
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:40,800
You keep going if you want.

1928
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:43,600
You should just do a tear and people can turn it off whenever.

1929
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:46,080
Everclear released a song called Volvo driving.

1930
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:48,520
You just go Jason and I in the video.

1931
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:49,760
We'll just get up and go.

1932
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:52,640
Which will this live mic every ever clear song that he when he's trying

1933
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:56,120
to have a single, he goes, Nana, Nana, Nana.

1934
01:29:56,120 --> 01:29:57,440
He like puts that in every song.

1935
01:29:57,440 --> 01:29:59,560
There's a part where he goes, there's like a break.

1936
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:02,320
Yeah, yeah, Nana, Nana.

1937
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:03,720
Like he is. Yeah, Nana's.

1938
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:05,520
And it's like his bag of tricks and he's done it.

1939
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:06,520
Jason, we got to go.

1940
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:09,200
OK, here, Scott, I it is that you have to leave.

1941
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:11,280
So I know I know I'm going to the bit.

1942
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:14,560
Scott, I think Garfield, please don't get crushed by the door.

1943
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:18,040
I play. I know that art is not only one.

1944
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:20,880
He's like the only original member of the band left at this point.

1945
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:22,960
So I don't really know what happened.

1946
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:24,280
I've seen Everclear twice.

1947
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:25,600
I saw them first.

1948
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:29,600
It was a show with Lifehouse, Matchbox 20 and Everclear.

1949
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:33,240
Everclear played second Matchbox 20, of course, was the closer.

1950
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:35,320
Lifehouse played opening and they had just got.

1951
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:36,320
Yeah, we're going to head out.

1952
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:39,640
Had just come out, which was a song that I do still kind of like.

1953
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:41,440
I think it's got a pretty good hook when it comes to the.

1954
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:44,560
I think you're really going to like this live version of Birdhouse

1955
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:46,400
and your soul from severe tired.

1956
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:47,600
Matchbox 20 closed.

1957
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:50,960
And I will say this was, I believe, around the time of the third

1958
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:55,560
Matchbox 20 album and which is actually a pretty good.

1959
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:56,360
It has bright lights.

1960
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:58,400
It is like she got out of town.

1961
01:30:58,400 --> 01:30:59,720
That's the piano song.

1962
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:03,520
And it's it's they sounded great is really what I'm trying to say.

1963
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:06,120
Matchbox 20 sounded great and I haven't seen them for years

1964
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:07,920
and I would like to see them again.

1965
