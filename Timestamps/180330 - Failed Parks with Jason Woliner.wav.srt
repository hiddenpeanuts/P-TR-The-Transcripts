Warning, today's podcast may feature an abundance of minds, urinal humiliation, a bare metal family called Bare Metal Family, and a park built on one man's dream. One man's rock and roll dream. Jason Walliner takes us on a magical mystery tour of the world of Sid and Marty Croft and Hard Rock Park. It's Failed Parks on Podcast The Ride.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Hello, welcome to Podcast The Ride, the podcast about theme parks hosted by three guys who aren't sure God exists, but we know if he does, he looks exactly like Dreamfinder.

3
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We're all just God's figments. You guys concur, I think. You guys, Mike Carlson.

4
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yes, I concur.

5
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And Jason Sheridan.

6
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Hi.

7
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And I'm Scott Gairdner and we're joined by a very special guest. He's a very funny, very talented writer and director from all of the good shows that exist. It's Jason Walliner.

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Hey guys, thanks for having me.

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Hello.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm very excited to be a guest.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yes, yes.

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yeah, thanks for coming.

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm excited to have you. And I'm excited to talk about this area with you. I mean, specifically what we... You proposed this topic for an episode, the idea of covering a couple of failed parks, which we're going to talk about.

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And I was generally excited by the notion of this, but I think you guys will concur that now that we've done the research, that we've put in the time and done the work, I am exploding with excitement to discuss all of these things.

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It really felt like a college exam that I was cramming for. And I was like, oh, I only have an hour left and I won't get this done. I'm not going to fail. I'm not going to pass.

16
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And I was having all sorts of flashbacks to my weather 101 class.

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Weather?

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yeah, I took a weather 101 class and it was...

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Oh great, Mike fucked up weather 101.

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It was very difficult and I never went to class and I crammed the night before the final because the final was the grade and I got a B and I passed. But I had nightmares about it.

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Geez. Well, the standards are higher here, my friend. We all have to collectively get an A plus to properly tribute these topics.

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I was saying before we started, I was feeling the feelings of nostalgia for a place I've never been to before.

23
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Like, oh, I wish I could go back. Wait, let me rephrase. I wish I could have gone.

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
At all.

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yeah.

26
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
At all.

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:57,000
None of us have been to any of these places. They were, well, I mean, one was before our time and another was not open for long enough for anyone to get to go back in 2008.

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yeah, we'll start getting into it. But Jason, you're a perfect person to talk about this stuff with. It seems like you're a fan of, well, it seems like theme parks in general, but also like crazy, poorly conceived disasters.

29
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yeah, I'm a big fan of just bad ideas that have a lot of money thrown at them or really just, I mean, these aren't even necessarily bad ideas, but just kind of things that didn't work out or, you know, just someone's vision that was seemingly executed without limitations and then was gone very quickly.

30
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It doesn't seem like, well, ultimately, like budget problems ended these places, but it seems like there was a lot of money to build.

31
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
There's so much money involved in both of these. Thinking about what good that money could have done for just people, human beings.

32
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What was the, it was like, not to get too far ahead, but like Rock Park, we're talking about almost $400 million.

33
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And also when a movie, I mean, movies don't even cost really that much. That's like on the high end. And also when a movie fails, it just kind of goes away. It's around, you see it like on iTunes, like, oh yeah, that didn't work out.

34
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:27,000
When a thing like this doesn't work out, it's like still physically there in reality. And like, like the, the Croft one, you know, becomes something else. But the Hard Rock Park is still there.

35
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,000
As we speak, it was, yeah, it was briefly opened in 2008 and now is, yeah, the space is obviously there and it's nothing.

36
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:44,000
There's like a, there's a church around there. Some of the land I figured out was bought by Medieval Times because they needed more space for horses to graze.

37
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So it's going to some use, but yeah, $400 million and it like started with stuff that was already there. Like they got it at a mall.

38
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
There's so much to get into. I feel like we should just start diving in.

39
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yeah, where do you even start with these?

40
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Well, I mean, I guess we go, we go backwards in time. I mean, in general, okay, to talk about failed theme parks, I could not make a definitive list of them.

41
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
These might be the two of the most prominent. There's a lot of parks that close after a big run of time.

42
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:23,000
We keep teasing, we've talked to maybe a couple of times about the six flags that shut down because of the hurricane. You know, parks close, it happens.

43
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Disneyland probably came very close to being open for just a few months and then closing altogether.

44
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:38,000
But I think it's very rare that you have parks like both of these that were, neither of which was open for more than six months.

45
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I mean, what a spectacular failure. Just that's insane if you think about how long, how much work goes into that and then it's done in six months.

46
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
How many years?

47
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
That's crazy.

48
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I mean, that seems impossible to be like, we're going to spend $400 million, but if it doesn't work immediately, we're walking away.

49
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Like they almost seems suspicious to me. It seems like maybe something was going on that we don't know about.

50
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
One of these parks did it not just once, but twice.

51
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
That's true.

52
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Oh God, yes.

53
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yeah.

54
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It almost feels like we're, it's like we're obliged to talk about the first one at this point in the way that the theaters before Coco had to show that Frozen short that no one liked.

55
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Like we got to get through it.

56
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Although that's not true, there's a lot to talk about.

57
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Topic number one, failed park number one, the world of Sid and Marty Croft.

58
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:38,000
This was open from May to November 1976. It cost $14 million to build, which in today's money is something like $60 million, maybe more.

59
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm not sure if my inflation is right, but 14 million, a lot of money back then.

60
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So Sid and Marty Croft, you know, as the...

61
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You might not know.

62
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Possibly not at this point in time.

63
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
But if you don't know.

64
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Yeah, well, these characters have not been sufficiently rebooted and are not like constantly part of our lives.

65
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:07,000
But Sid and Marty Croft made all of the crazy, trippy, puppet-centric children's shows from the 1970s.

66
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
H.R. Puff and Stuff, The Bugaloos, Lidsville.

67
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Land of the Lost.

68
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Oh, Land of the Lost. Oh wait, I forgot.

69
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
That's probably the most prominent one because there's been a movie in the last 10 years.

70
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Mm-hmm.

71
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Very well received.

72
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
A well-received film.

73
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
A hard rock park of a film.

74
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
But at the very least, you've heard that title.

75
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Yes.

76
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You've heard it.

77
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And a 90s...

78
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
There was the Nickelodeon 90s one, which I don't...

79
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Yes, that's true.

80
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I didn't care for the actual series, but excellent theme song.

81
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And great performance from Timothy Bottoms, who played George Bush on That's My Bush.

82
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And in a serious George Bush 9-11 movie as well, he was like goofy George Bush and then serious George Bush.

83
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Hey, the guy looks like George W. Bush. Take what you can get.

84
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

85
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
He's got range. He's got range.

86
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You'll joke or you'll cry.

87
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
But so, as I say, The Bugaloos. Anyone know what The Bugaloos actually were?

88
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Sounds like a band.

89
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yeah, they had songs. I've heard...

90
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
My mom has forced me to listen to some Bugaloos, I think, at a certain point.

91
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Are they sort of monkey-esque? Because I know your mom is a monkey's person.

92
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Yeah, she loved the monkeys.

93
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So maybe that was their attempt.

94
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I was just watching one called... there's one that's very much like a love bug inspired, you might say.

95
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You might also say rip-off show. Like an alive VW.

96
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I don't know this one.

97
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's also a bug, I believe.

98
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's called Also a Bug?

99
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Another bug.

100
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
A bug where the rights aren't tied up.

101
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'll say this. And we had a discussion about characters on one of our last episodes with Evan Susser.

102
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I like the way these characters look. This is the compliment I'm going to pay to the Sid and Marty Croft universe.

103
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I like the way they look and I like that they exist.

104
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And that's what I can say about them.

105
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I will agree with that. Because I was just watching a lot of these and not really being too familiar with them.

106
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And they do look really funny.

107
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Yes.

108
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,000
They look really stupid and weird. And there's something naturally funny about them.

109
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And also like H.R. Puff and stuff, which is I think their most well known character.

110
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I noticed he can either move his mouth or his arms.

111
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
That I think when he's talking he has to pull his arm out of his arm and move his mouth with his arm.

112
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And there's always one part of his mouth that kind of bunches in a little bit.

113
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You can see his clenched fist around his mouth.

114
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
There's something very charming and homemade about them.

115
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And by all accounts it looks like that translated to this indoor theme park.

116
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Also a quick note is that McDonald's stole the look of these characters for the McDonaldland game.

117
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
For Ronald and Grimace and the Fry Guys and everything. And they were sued by them.

118
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
If you look at those early 70's commercials it looks exactly like these old Sid and Marty Croft shows.

119
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Even the Mayor McCheese looks exactly like one of these characters.

120
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Well I looked up, this is an actual quote from a legal document that ruled on this.

121
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And the Crofts were victorious by the way.

122
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Of course, yeah.

123
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It worked out better for them than the McDonald brothers in The Founder.

124
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Well that's true.

125
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I would highly recommend, Ray Kroc screwed us again.

126
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
With the little wolf into the henhouse.

127
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Those lines are said every scene.

128
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Pretty much.

129
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
As I said last time, two years ago, we let a wolf into the henhouse.

130
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I love The Founder. I really love The Founder.

131
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:53,000
But there's a, so actual, yeah, the Crofts were victorious. Noting the similarities between Mayor McCheese and H.R. Puff and stuff.

132
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Both lands are governed by mayors who have disproportionately large round heads dominated by long wide mouths.

133
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
They are assisted by keystone cop characters.

134
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Both lands feature strikingly similar scientists and a multi-armed evil creature.

135
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
A judge had to hear that.

136
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And it sounds like he's dealing with a land dispute or some kind of territorial, like, also they will have sashes. Right?

137
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Yeah probably.

138
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Yeah I know Puff and Stuff has a big blue sash.

139
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I don't think I knew till this that Puff and Stuff was the mayor.

140
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Yeah I learned that recently. And that he, I think it's a he, is a dragon. Did you know that?

141
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
What? No. Really?

142
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Yeah it was a full reference, maybe rip off to Puff the Magic Dragon.

143
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Oh interesting.

144
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I saw this in an interview with Marty Croft I think.

145
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
They really didn't even take the Puff out then.

146
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
They took the Puff.

147
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
They just took the Puff and applied it to a different dragon.

148
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Because they, it seems like most of their time is spent denying that these were all references to drugs.

149
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And so people were like, which is, Mr. Show did a sketch called The Altered State of Drug-a-chuicets.

150
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Which is where a lot of people our age I think discovered that.

151
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Even are aware of this stuff at this point.

152
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Yeah. And yeah these shows were just synonymous with psychedelic drug use.

153
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:29,000
And then I think for the last few decades the Crofts main job has been denying that they were drug references.

154
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
But so Puff and Stuff he said was a reference to Puff the Magic Dragon.

155
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Which I think also was a drug reference.

156
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Yes.

157
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Sort of, yeah yeah, like thinly veiled.

158
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Get that in front of kids. Which also a little tease for later.

159
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
The Knights in White set and the trip.

160
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Oh man.

161
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Some druggy stuff being put in front of kids.

162
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
The trip part of that makes me so angry.

163
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Instead of the ride, the trip. I just, I can't.

164
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:06,000
There's a lot of infuriating, there's like 40 things you could name about Hard Rock Park that are without any attitude or addition or infuriating.

165
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Anyway, to keep talking about HR Puff and Stuff.

166
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Well that's one of the things you get to do in this.

167
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You get to go to specifically HR Puff and Stuff's world.

168
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You get to go to Lidsville.

169
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Well so to set the scene a little bit.

170
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:31,000
The world of Sid and Marty Kraft became the centerpiece, the big ticket attraction at an attempt to revitalize downtown Atlanta.

171
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
An area called the Omni Center.

172
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,000
They needed like a big, you know, it was offices and a hotel and stuff and they needed something to pull people in.

173
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
There was an ice skating rink.

174
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
But then the big thing ended up being the world of Sid and Marty Kraft.

175
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Which was famous for having the world's longest escalator.

176
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Escalator to get to it.

177
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Eight stories.

178
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's all indoors.

179
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Right, it's an indoor theme park.

180
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Probably the first.

181
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Their slogan is, now all the fun is indoors.

182
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
What a joyous phrase.

183
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Someone pointed out, as I was reading this, someone pointed out that the cross were responsible, you know, back when there was only three TV channels.

184
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And I guess PBS would have started around this time as well.

185
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:25,000
The cross were responsible for the main kids stuff that wasn't Disney.

186
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
So like, is that why it's so beloved because there just wasn't a lot of other stuff?

187
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Maybe.

188
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Or isn't that beloved? Or as I say that?

189
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
If you didn't want to learn, if you didn't want to sit through Sesame Street because you might learn something.

190
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:47,000
If you just wanted pure escapist, meaningless adventures, then maybe that's where you turn.

191
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:54,000
But yeah, way before, because Disney wasn't making specifically Saturday morning cartoons.

192
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Maybe the only live action kids shows of the 70s?

193
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
There was an article that pointed out there were no kids channels specifically.

194
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I mean, look, IP was scarce.

195
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Let's be honest.

196
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
We didn't have IP coming out the ears at this point.

197
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
So they had to take what they could get.

198
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I don't know what I do with that IP nowadays.

199
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I know. We all love IP.

200
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
There are days I can forget to drink water for hours, but I got to have some IP in there.

201
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,000
But if it's got, you know, turbo the snail on it, you'll drink from a glass.

202
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It'll remind you to stay hydrated.

203
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:36,000
So the picture of this park, park I use it in quotes, looks like the hotel I had my senior prom in, basically.

204
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It looks kind of like a hotel.

205
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I mean, it's a building. It has different offices in it.

206
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's part of a hotel.

207
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
The way it looks.

208
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
It's really weird and gray and miserable.

209
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
And I stayed in this hotel.

210
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
The Conan show did a week from Atlanta, and this is where they put everybody up.

211
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
So I stayed in that hotel for like nine nights or so.

212
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I was there for a long time.

213
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It was weird and sad.

214
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And you felt kind of claustrophobic to be just the, like the balcony of the hotel room overlooked just a big indoor area.

215
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
So it did feel like being inside like a mall with no stores for a long time.

216
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And it's the CNN headquarters now, isn't it?

217
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Now, yes.

218
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
That is what the space ended up being.

219
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It sat, when this thing closed, opened and closed in 1976, sat empty for a decade.

220
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:32,000
And then Atlanta was already the home of Ted Turner and CNN, and they had outgrown wherever they started.

221
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:44,000
And this space was perfect because it was a lot of indoor floors that were very wide and without, you know, like big, you know, without a lot of walls, basically.

222
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:57,000
So that you didn't have to tear a bunch of stuff out because now CNN, like literally CNN, like the headline news is done on the floor where they used to be a pinball machine.

223
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Oh, yeah.

224
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:12,000
In speaking to the general claustrophobia of this complex that exists still today and that you're in like just sort of narrow ceilinged floors on all these rides, imagine being like trapped in a pinball machine.

225
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Also, just for anyone listening who doesn't already isn't very familiar with this park, we both just really laughed at Scott saying pinball machine.

226
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
We weren't laughing at just a pinball machine being there.

227
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
No.

228
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It was their showcase ride was called pinball machine, and it was you are a pinball and you travel through a gigantic pinball machine.

229
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
But you travel through it very slowly.

230
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And often breaking down, apparently.

231
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:56,000
And did you someone I was reading said that it descended like the floors to that one of these like YouTube people remembering it said it like actually went down levels as you as you wrote it.

232
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Oh, the road, the ride itself.

233
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Yeah.

234
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Okay.

235
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Because there's no video of or there's a little video.

236
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
There's like a little second of like this big pinball bouncing.

237
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I will say this, though, full disclosure, this looks like the coolest thing in the whole place.

238
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Oh, yeah.

239
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It's probably a lame it does certainly doesn't like really simulate being inside of a pinball machine.

240
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
That's not it.

241
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
But but the look of it, it's fun looking.

242
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It looks like if it was actually the chrome balls, it looks like.

243
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Yeah, it looks like you're in a giant Christmas ornament or something.

244
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It looks great.

245
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I know that everything here looked really cool.

246
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It does.

247
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
This this thing for me, whatever it pushed my buttons.

248
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I don't know why.

249
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,000
There there was a note in in Jason, I think you sent us this article.

250
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Guests were not allowed to bring cameras in all news footage of the park was destroyed in a fire at the local Atlanta CBS.

251
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:00,000
So I didn't quite reread that chunk a few times and I wasn't quite sure they were talking about the grand opening or ever.

252
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
But like if it was guests weren't allowed to take pictures ever.

253
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:12,000
That is an insane thing for a theme park to you want to preserve like an air of mystery about a theme park.

254
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I guess so.

255
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You don't want anyone to know what's going on.

256
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It's like a Dave Chappelle stand up show.

257
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You got to give everyone lock their phones.

258
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You don't want them taking video room a bit before it goes on Netflix.

259
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
OK, maybe.

260
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Well, can we do you know this was a sequential park?

261
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Yeah. So he rose up the big escalator.

262
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
So what that means is you couldn't decide what you were doing.

263
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
There was an order that you had to do everything in this to me.

264
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And this park does seem really cool.

265
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:55,000
This seems like it might have been a misstep along with the no photography policy that you started on this eight story escalator.

266
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
And then you had to do every ride in order and then you were kicked out and you were done.

267
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
And I found people saying I went there. It was fun.

268
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It was only about three hours worth of entertainment.

269
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Our parents had like dropped us off for the day and we just like had to sit in the lobby for like hours and wait to be picked up because you.

270
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
There was like a very set amount of time that you could experience this.

271
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
The so you ride the escalator up.

272
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
And did you guys see this at the top?

273
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
There was like a strange mime waiting for you.

274
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Oh God.

275
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Okay so there were no there were different things waiting for you at the top because I found a few people who said there was like this terrifying mime who was waiting for you at the top who would bother you and who wouldn't leave you alone until more people arrived up the escalator.

276
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
So he would just like make fun of you.

277
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I guess without using words.

278
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,000
And then another YouTube commenter said there was a spider lady at the top.

279
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I'm just going to read this was YouTube commenter Jason Holliday wrote basically she poked her head through a curtain made up like a web.

280
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
She said What questions do you have for the spider lady in a silly voice.

281
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
We just stood there dumbfounded and she retorted.

282
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Well I don't know what to say if you don't have any questions.

283
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
So you have to have an awkward conversation with the spider lady.

284
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:20,000
The spider lady is not prepared despite the fact that you have no information about the spider lady and did not know there was a spider lady.

285
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
She is not prepared to say well so I'm the spider lady.

286
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Here is the logic of me.

287
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Here's where I came from.

288
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
You have to spur it with a question.

289
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Yeah.

290
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Yeah.

291
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I found I found some I'm honestly not sure if these are postcards or promotional images.

292
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Looking at it now I'm realizing in out of the four pictures there are mimes and three.

293
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:49,000
They are very much in the 70s kind of photography style of there's not enough lighting.

294
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
The mind are you so this guy's a mime you're thinking.

295
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Yeah that is basically guys kind of fucked up.

296
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
But then that is a mime.

297
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:05,000
But that guy's like he's like a mime he has the makeup on his face but then he's got like an open his shirt is unbuttoned three buttons on the top and he's like kind of a swinger mime or something.

298
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Yeah one of them is kind of a swinger mime one of them kind of looks more like a cabaret emcee but it's a red leisure suit.

299
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And then I mean the other thing is in one of these pictures it looks like a little street and people with trees and like you can very clearly see what looks like just a normal industrial ceiling above it.

300
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Which is pipes and vents.

301
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Yes similar to the small world.

302
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Our favorite ceiling.

303
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I like key party mimes basically.

304
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
That's the that's the party.

305
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
City Marty put on stuff not present in any of these photos.

306
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I found one promotional photo where he is doing some kind of a stage show.

307
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I think you would eventually at the end wind up where he lives on his island where he's made.

308
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:18,000
You first passed through the Tranquility Terrace which is the first three floors and which is like the weirdest it's such a Logan's Runny term which and the whole thing it being this indoor atrium and that pinball ride has a super Logan's Run vibe which is I'm giving it points.

309
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Yes yeah yeah yeah it's a good way to put it.

310
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It's so it is so cool.

311
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I wish it was the future crossed with Dallas office parks.

312
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Yeah I think this was a thing in like revitalizing city centers for a while because Baltimore has there's a building and like the inner harbor which if you've never been to Baltimore is kind of like Baltimore's equivalent to Times Square or Hollywood and Highland and eats there's like a handful of malls there used to be a plan in Hollywood there's still a hard rock cafe.

313
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:03,000
And one of the malls has like a hotel and you you can like look out of your room and you're looking down into like a giant open air space.

314
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
It's also very close to Camden Yards the baseball field.

315
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:16,000
So there's this one hotel built into a mall where visiting baseball teams are constantly accosted by people winning autographs.

316
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
But it's the closest hotel the closest nice hotel to Camden Yards.

317
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I thought you were gonna say like angry Baltimoreans accosting.

318
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Oh yeah. No that's the other thing.

319
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:34,000
That was how I knew Baltimore until I saw the wire. I was like oh oh there's other parts of Baltimore like watching the wire.

320
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:45,000
It's like there is one point where McNulty meets an informant at the inner harbor and I'm like oh yeah there's the finally we're on crab Jason's territory.

321
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Four seasons.

322
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
To the window of a chain hotel.

323
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
So scary interiors the Tranquility Terrace.

324
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Which I think was named sarcastically it seems right.

325
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Like it seems like this was like the loudest most terrifying.

326
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Most likely most visually busy.

327
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Yeah you can just go read a book up there.

328
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I don't want to give them too much credit but they did inadvertently predict like scheduling coming here in advance like in the end and which Disney and Universal definitely you have to do and now they really like encourage you to do it by like the tickets cost more on busier days.

329
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:39,000
So this part too was like yes schedule in advance because we're only letting so many people in a day because we can fit six thousand and we will fit six thousand.

330
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Yeah single day.

331
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
They were really confident about that.

332
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:52,000
They seem to have a real fixation on little people performers they boasted of having the shortest living twins in the world.

333
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
John and Greg Rice.

334
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Do you know these guys.

335
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I saw they exist today.

336
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Yeah today I know them today. Patty Maloney was on a craft show called Far Out Space Nuts playing a proto elf looking character named Honk that looks really crazy if you look that up.

337
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And the Rice twins are famous for infomercials for hawking this like cash flow generating system called Seven Small Steps and check it out on YouTube.

338
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Greg is still doing infomercials John passed away in 2005 but yeah there were tons of little people and also a lot of obese performers including a large man dressed as a hippo.

339
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:54,000
There's one YouTube guy talking about so they're just like people walking around and it sounds like a crazy place.

340
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Yeah.

341
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
In like a mall in like a weird or like in like an office building basically.

342
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Yeah what is now literally an office building it's where you know it's where it's where all it's the headquarters of our the fake news and the MSM assaults we are bombarded with each day.

343
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Scott not now not today we don't have time for this.

344
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Just cut it out.

345
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:20,000
All right if you hear an edit know that I in real life I'm talking for an hour and a half.

346
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:33,000
But so the alright so we're back and yeah little people obese people mimes and leisure suits puppets that are famous for being terrifying.

347
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
That's the main way that they're known today.

348
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I also heard that someone had a visit there once where just suddenly they were like maybe they were having a moment of tranquility untranquility terrorists and then they were just tapped on the shoulder and somebody went hey.

349
00:27:48,000 --> 00:28:05,000
And it was Billy Barty who was another dwarf who operated in the craft diverse who played Sigmund on Sigmund and the sea monsters and later was figments of our beloved character who will one day do seven hours about.

350
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Yeah.

351
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:13,000
But so yeah you could run into a famous small people as well as obscure ones.

352
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Oh yeah there was one story about Patty Maloney who was like there's some kid she met and then she's like I have to go meet my boyfriend and ran over to Bob Denver Gilligan who was also hanging out there.

353
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
And I think there's a picture of Jimmy Carter visiting as well.

354
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Did you I don't know if you guys.

355
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
He made it.

356
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Oh I didn't see that at all.

357
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Huh weird checking on the did he like.

358
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Did Nixon use it as- did Nixon went to Epcot? Carter went to eat your puppet stuff.

359
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Oh man.

360
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
He only wanted to pay that five dollar admission.

361
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Yeah.

362
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Do you think he like briefly used in the like month where it was working OK.

363
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Did he use it as like a sign of economic prosperity under his reign.

364
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
And then it closed.

365
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Yeah.

366
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Take that out of the presentation.

367
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:14,000
The Camp David Accords were going to be signed at the H.R. Puffin stuff and then it closed.

368
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Yeah yeah there everyone was going to stay in a different Lidsville lid and then meet in the morning for the peace accords.

369
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:28,000
The spider. They were going to ask questions to the spider woman and that's how we were going to get many peace.

370
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
If their answers lined up.

371
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I there's an observation I have about Lidsville that's confusing to me.

372
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
The residents of Lidsville are hats and they all live in hats.

373
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
What's going on there?

374
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,000
It's a car it's a precursor to Cars because like Lightning McQueen travels in a car in the Cars movies.

375
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Yeah he's in John Ratzenberger the truck.

376
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Yeah.

377
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
He goes inside the body of his friend and gets moved around.

378
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Yes right so I guess I don't know is the answer.

379
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Unless a truck are there I mean there's a lot of Cars logic but is it is the truck body is just the trailer or not.

380
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Is that not part of their physiology.

381
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Like just the engine is like their head and their brain and their nervous system maybe.

382
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Yeah and then the the like flatbed part.

383
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Chassis.

384
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Yeah and the wheels are obviously part of them.

385
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
But is it like if we wore a backpack the backpacks not part of us.

386
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
You know I guess that is probably right.

387
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I guess you know yeah you're right about that.

388
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
But then you can take their wheels off.

389
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Yeah.

390
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
So what is that.

391
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
That's like people with artificial limbs.

392
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I guess those are shoes.

393
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Another topic we could do seven hours about the physiology of the cars.

394
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
The wheels are shoes.

395
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Yeah cars logic.

396
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
But yeah the hats the hats are hats.

397
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Hats live in hats.

398
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Well not to rush us out of Lidsville but I know we're all dying to get to our next park.

399
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Are there any other.

400
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Well it seems to me like this place that goes in descending order with the order you can't control the middle is the pinball ride which is the only ride one of only two I believe.

401
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Well yeah there's the crystal carousel which is also cool.

402
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Yes which is also real strange and cool.

403
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Agreed.

404
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Yeah I think if they'd had a chance to you know expand and add more rides add more experiences clear some of the mines out and put rides in it then maybe it would have stood a chance to close four years later instead of six months.

405
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Just looking at the illustrated map of this park I have found four mimes.

406
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:49,000
There's another four different ones. There's a look like a mime entryway on the top floor and then there's just two mimes hanging out above each other.

407
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I don't know how you just they're everywhere.

408
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Always a mime using one of the urinals station on mimes.

409
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Oh yeah.

410
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:13,000
You can end it in the heavenly slumber cemetery which is full of talking mushrooms with the faces and voices of Cagney Bogart and Edward G. Robinson favorites of kids everywhere.

411
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Those guys would show up it's like Looney Tunes cartoon.

412
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Yeah.

413
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Kids must have loved those like grizzled character actors.

414
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Two of them show up in the great movie ride.

415
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Oh yeah.

416
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Yeah.

417
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Yeah.

418
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Wait. Weird.

419
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,000
And there were also there were puppets of Bowie and Elton John.

420
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Yes and Stevie Wonder.

421
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,000
And I think there's only maybe 17 seconds of footage of this park really that still exists.

422
00:32:45,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Or I didn't see the pinball one that you found but on YouTube there's like a bear puppet wearing either a bow tie or a bikini top jumping rope for 17 seconds and that's all that exists of this 60 million dollar endeavor.

423
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
We had four photos out of it. That's great.

424
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I know these are like in the promo art here.

425
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:13,000
These are probably like Bobby's or policeman but Mario it looks like Mario and Luigi to me doesn't it?

426
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Oh yeah.

427
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Kind of does.

428
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
A little red dwarf from the green dwarf.

429
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Yeah right above the mushroom. Mushroom kingdom. So maybe.

430
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Is that another thing they can sue about?

431
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Yeah maybe.

432
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Can now and is Marty is still alive? Maybe he could sue Nintendo?

433
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Marty Croft v. Shiguru Miyamoto.

434
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Two diminutive characters both of whom wear red and green hats respectively. They are not mayors.

435
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:47,000
You know what I'm thinking on that map you can actually in the lower is it the same map the lower left hand corner you see a mushroom with the face of like an old gangster.

436
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Yeah yeah.

437
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
So that is there is evidence of that.

438
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I think one of them is smoking too. So I think the smoking one is Bogart and the one on the far left is Edward G. Robinson.

439
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Yeah I think they're both smoking. I'm pretty sure they both have a cigarette or cigar in their mouth.

440
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Yeah a lot of kids characters back in the day were smoking.

441
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I honestly think that's fun and I'm kind of bummed out that no one can smoke in movies anymore.

442
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Oh yeah because I always like scenes where a character we like is bombarded with cigar smoke.

443
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Of course.

444
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:22,000
And it lets in they struggle and then it makes you be more on their side and it adds to the stakes lets you know they're in a bad place.

445
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:31,000
You know what cigars in we just covered the American Adventure. You got cigars in that. You got cigars in Pinocchio's Daring Journey.

446
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
So theme parks have not. Theme parks are still doing cigars luckily.

447
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
But after they get rid of the redhead scene and pirates are coming for the cigars.

448
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
What's next?

449
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
In 2018 they're coming for the cigars.

450
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Slippery slope.

451
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Yep.

452
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I was also thinking this is funny past guest Mike Mitchell complained a lot about Guardians as did Doug Jones about Guardians of the Galaxy taking over Tower of Terror which of course is a beloved attraction so it's a little bit different.

453
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:11,000
But like this was a very current like I these were very current characters for the time be like when they built this thing and there was no there was no one should have expected this to last as far as characters that would like stand the test of time.

454
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:18,000
So would a Mike Mitchell at the time have been complaining about well these aren't character no one likes shit and Marty Croft's characters.

455
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
So you would have fought for what was there before.

456
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Yeah yeah.

457
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Which is nothing.

458
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Office buildings.

459
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Yeah.

460
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Yeah that's what I'm saying.

461
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Would he then have been upset.

462
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,000
But then in 80s Mike Mitchell might have been upset that they got rid of Ted Turner.

463
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I don't know the original CNN anchors but let's say Wolf Blit nobody likes Wolf Blitzer.

464
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
You got to keep Jimmy the Lid in there.

465
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Yeah I think that's right.

466
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Keep Edward G. Robinson the mushroom.

467
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
We love him.

468
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
We love Edward G. Robinson mushroom.

469
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:58,000
If he somehow he's hearing this he's just like saying fuck you no one is furious that we're using him as a placeholder for a lot of opinions.

470
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Grumpy Disneyland message board posters.

471
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
And instead of saying that we just say Mike Mitchell.

472
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
He represents all of them.

473
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Yes.

474
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Speaking of Tower of Terror is are there many other things based on T.

475
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I feel like I have heard imagineer talk about this where it's like there's lots of rides based on movies but TV shows just don't have the like emotional cash.

476
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Like they they just don't have the staying power because like every few years that bad like 10 years ago there was rumors of like Disney doing a lost experience or like doing a Phineas and Ferb ride.

477
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:46,000
And like yeah both those things I think Phineas and Ferb still popular with kids but not like the time I went to Disney World like six years ago and we all learned very quickly who Perry the platypus was because he was everywhere.

478
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
He's a lot less everywhere nowadays.

479
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I feel like.

480
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Yeah the less TV show rides probably at these big parks.

481
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Right.

482
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Was there a prominent.

483
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Yeah.

484
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I mean it started.

485
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Yeah there you got there always a little like there's stuff you can take out more easily like there's a Walking Dead made right.

486
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
So the simp the Simpsons.

487
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
But so you have to your show has to be on for 25 years.

488
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Once these shows are no longer airing it feels old where it's like a movie just exists or and it's kind of around.

489
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:24,000
But it's probably an old it's probably an old feeling that probably should go away because it because at the time TV was always more disposable.

490
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Then that was a dip that was everyone's like perception of it.

491
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Do you remember you must remember a universal part of the tour was like they would take you into a Battlestar Galactica room.

492
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Oh yeah we haven't really talked about that much.

493
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Yeah yeah.

494
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I didn't know what that was when I came out here in the 80s and.

495
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Yeah yeah I think I must have taken the tour at one point and not known what that was even supposed to be.

496
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
It's like a bunch of mannequins.

497
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I'm sure that.

498
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,000
It felt like just a generic space adventure as far as I knew but you know it wasn't too plot deep.

499
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,000
It's not it wasn't you know it didn't have care beloved characters like the new Battlestar.

500
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
You didn't have to represent Edward James almost or.

501
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Right this was this was old Battlestar.

502
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Yeah and they had my and there was the Miami Vice stunt show but yeah more temporary things I feel.

503
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Yeah because TV shows don't have the staying power of rock bands.

504
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,000
All right here we go.

505
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Pull aside the beaded curtain and put on your prism glasses as we go to.

506
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Where rock comes to play.

507
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
The Hard Rock Park.

508
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Hard Rock Park.

509
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
In Myrtle Beach South Carolina.

510
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Here we are entertain us.

511
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
That was said on the gate as you walked in.

512
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Which did look a little bit like the gate to Auschwitz.

513
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:54,000
When they have that sign that says work equals freedom.

514
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
The march begins.

515
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,000
This is of course the park we were saying opened and closed within six months.

516
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:07,000
It opened in 2008 in the spring of 2008 and closed in the fall of 2008.

517
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
150 days.

518
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
150 days.

519
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:19,000
And then miraculously a year later opened as the kind of more generic freestyle music park in 2009.

520
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
And then closed in the fall of 2009.

521
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
So not only did it open and close quickly once but as we said it did it twice.

522
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Wow that's a theme park rarity.

523
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Yeah.

524
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
And probably never to be achieved again.

525
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I mean there are stories of like parks opening and closing and then reopening and closing.

526
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:46,000
The North Jersey urban legend Action Park comes to mind.

527
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Sometimes called Traction Park.

528
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Due to so many horrifying injuries happening at it.

529
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
But yeah this.

530
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,000
But that didn't cost 400 million dollars like the Hard Rock Park did.

531
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Oh man.

532
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
The crazy.

533
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
All the footage.

534
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
This happened in 2008 and everything you watch.

535
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
It's so crazy how something so recent looks like it was like 50 years ago.

536
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Yeah it was right on the line of like everyone having standard.

537
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Or high def cameras on them at all times.

538
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Everything's in standard def.

539
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Oh yeah true.

540
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Well and just stylistically.

541
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I was showing my wife a lot of.

542
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I made her watch.

543
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
We'll get into all the pieces of it.

544
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:33,000
But there's a stunt show that is set all to like rock you like a hurricane and rat and stuff.

545
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,000
And then I showed her like just an outfit of what like what women had to wear if they worked in the park.

546
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Oh my god.

547
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Which is like short leather skirt and like fishnets.

548
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
And she was.

549
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,000
She just made some comment about like god this is the most 90s thing I've ever seen.

550
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
And then I was like no no 2008.

551
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
This was seven years after the events of 9-11.

552
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Which impacted this park.

553
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
It is part of the tale.

554
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I don't know if you saw the correlation between 9-11.

555
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
No I didn't.

556
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
That's just how I think of things like.

557
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Yeah.

558
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
In terms of like.

559
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
DC and AG.

560
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Yeah like it's happened.

561
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
That recently this happened.

562
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Yeah.

563
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
A couple of years ago.

564
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Really recently.

565
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Really recently also the 2008 recession had a big.

566
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
A big part to play in this.

567
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
It didn't help.

568
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Listen listeners we should tell you we all spent like the whole day in gross at least

569
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,000
it like what it's like you would just pull back a layer of the onion and there would

570
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
just be more onions.

571
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
And so we're more there.

572
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
There's so that's true.

573
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Yeah.

574
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Multiple on the onion.

575
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Yeah not layers just new onions.

576
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Yeah that's that's accurate.

577
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I am honestly a little intimidated.

578
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I'm not even sure how to talk about the genesis of it.

579
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
What we've discovered about.

580
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Yeah.

581
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Well let's set the scene.

582
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Someone set the scene.

583
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
We're in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.

584
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
A place we've not yet talked about on the podcast.

585
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,000
And this is one of those meccas of tourist trap insanity.

586
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
I was there probably in the late 90s.

587
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I don't remember it very well.

588
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I was more recently in Niagara Falls and it feels a lot like Niagara Falls to me where

589
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
it's not just two of the tourist trap chains it's all of them.

590
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:25,000
They have Planet they had at one point Planet Hollywood the all star cafe the sports restaurant

591
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
that was around for a little while.

592
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
There's an M&M thing medieval times is Margaritaville.

593
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
There's something called the Ripken experience like a Cal Ripken ball.

594
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,000
It has 10 replicas of different great ballparks across the country.

595
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Insane how much tourist trappy stuff.

596
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
And then of course there is a hard rock cafe.

597
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
So they planted seeds in this area a little bit.

598
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
And it's all very close to the ocean.

599
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
It's like there's an amusement park pier and stuff.

600
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
So it's this very like amusement heavy area as is.

601
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
This was not close enough to the ocean.

602
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
That was something that did it in.

603
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
It was kind of a little more on the outskirts.

604
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Originally conceived as a place called Fantasy Harbor that was going to be themed to the four seasons.

605
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Yeah well I think we have to start getting into the protagonist of our story whose name is John Binkowski.

606
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
John Binkowski.

607
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Because strangely this park did not start with the hard rock cafe deciding to open a theme park branch.

608
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Even though they were already in Myrtle Beach it began with the vision of one man.

609
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:37,000
By all accounts the hard rock cafe seems to have been dragged into this and wanted nothing to do with it.

610
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
It was literally like a coincidence that brought all this together.

611
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Yeah it was a neighbor.

612
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Okay so I'll try to say it fairly quickly.

613
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
John Binkowski was a guy in the theme park world.

614
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:56,000
He worked at a company, it was his company I believe called Renaissance Entertainment.

615
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Which was still around.

616
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Centralized in Celebration Florida which is the Disney built planned community in Florida.

617
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
And his company did a lot of attractions and shows.

618
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
They did a Baywatch stunt show that was in a lot of sea worlds across the country.

619
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Did they have anything to do with the water world stunt show?

620
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
There's like concept art on their website.

621
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:28,000
On their website yeah I think they did concept arts and some original like scripting or blocking or the stunts.

622
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
They blocked the water world.

623
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:39,000
There's a weird word used but one of the Batman stunt shows, the Lethal Weapon stunt show which I saw a couple times at Six Flags Great Adventure.

624
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Very short lived. There was a Lethal Weapon stunt show on a body of water.

625
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
It's unclear a lot of the when you're talking about all these companies that do this type of work.

626
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
It is a bit unclear like what they actually did.

627
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Well I think it's like.

628
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Somebody could have planned the whole ride and then as you said someone could have just blocked a show.

629
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Somebody could have just told the actors where to stand.

630
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Their websites are pretty much glorified. Minimal portfolios or business cards.

631
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Like the resume CV's. You gotta be in the business to see the nitty gritty.

632
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
And to know who's who.

633
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,000
So did you read about John in 97, the UFO encounter thing that he did?

634
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
No.

635
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,000
That's all over his YouTube channel which I was checking out today.

636
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
It's called UFO Encounters.

637
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:31,000
There's a really long video about it. It looks like it only appeared at the LA County Fair.

638
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:38,000
And then Never Again. But it was intended to be like a touring attraction where families can go and be abducted by aliens.

639
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
And like experimented on by aliens.

640
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Experimented on.

641
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Yeah like and you're like there's a. You go in a replica of a craftsman home.

642
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,000
And like things shake around. And like there's different phases you go. It looks really cool.

643
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
It looked like a fun thing. And I guess it didn't really take off.

644
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:05,000
But yeah so this is a guy that's really kind of had a bunch of themed entertainment projects for a long time.

645
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
By the time. At least 20 years by the time this park got off the ground.

646
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Directed something called Pirates 4D. There was a movie that's played in a couple theme parks.

647
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:25,000
But so the as alluded to on the terrible day of September 11th 2001. It sends the theme park industry into a spiral.

648
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Kills tourism. People don't want to fly.

649
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:33,000
He had been doing a lot of work for the bigger name theme parks. Sometimes Universal. Sometimes SeaWorld.

650
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
And all of his clients have bailed on him because nobody's investing new money in anything.

651
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:45,000
And he is left with his sole thing that he has investments in which is a Myrtle Beach ice skating theater called the Ice Castle Theater.

652
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Which was mostly known for a show that they did that I looked into called.

653
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Maybe I'm getting the name wrong. But it's something like you know the like haunted ice haunted ice show with Nancy Kerrigan.

654
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Halloween on ice.

655
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
There was also a Christmas variation.

656
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
And also with Miss Kerrigan. Oh really. Okay. So she was a frequent client of the theater.

657
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I think it would be like her and a Frankenstein doing an ice skating routine.

658
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:20,000
That's exactly it. I saw one where they they invoked some of the most the spookiest characters in all of Halloween.

659
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Batman and Robin. Batman and Robin are skating around and then the villains show up and Nancy Kerrigan is Catwoman.

660
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Oh she's in character. Yeah. So Nancy Kerrigan is performing in the show every show. Yes.

661
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
So it's like Elvira at Knots or something. There's not an actress playing Nancy Kerrigan.

662
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:47,000
No. No no no. The real deal. And but she also I don't think all of her Halloween on ice work was at this place.

663
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Because I saw footage of something that happened in Boston. A haunted show. Which I if I could describe it.

664
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Nancy is skating free in a flowing dress of virginal white. She is very innocent as we always picture her.

665
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:11,000
And then she gets in a bed that's on the ice and goes to sleep. And then the skeletons come out to play.

666
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Like eight skeletons like surround her bed and taunt her. And then she wakes up and oh my God she's in a nightmare.

667
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:24,000
And then like 50 more skeletons all skate in and she has to skate around and avoid them.

668
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
And they just do circles around her and like what's the bit when all the skaters line up.

669
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:33,000
They just like do a big line. A synchronized line. Like Nancy there's only so many.

670
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:38,000
That's not a bit. Not traditionally. Like a can can sort of.

671
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Like a skating move that when all the skeletons skate in a line.

672
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:50,000
You guys know the term. It's a whip. They all like are all whipping around and around.

673
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
There's only so many ways that skating skeletons can haunt somebody.

674
00:48:53,000 --> 00:49:00,000
But she's trying to avoid them in every way but jumping because she is pregnant at the time of this video that I watched.

675
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,000
What? Yeah. She's doing a haunted ice show while pregnant. She shouldn't skate.

676
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
She shouldn't be on the ice. She should take a little break.

677
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:16,000
For our younger listeners you're probably thinking like oh as I'm hearing that well the Olympics will probably be over by the time this is released.

678
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:23,000
They're still going as we're recording in the 90s figure skating was insanely popular.

679
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Like there was a boom and bust similar to the stand up comedy boom and bust of the 80s and 90s.

680
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:36,000
And the current comedy bust 2018 through forever.

681
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,000
But yeah. By the time you're listening to this comedy will be done.

682
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Yeah. Some article recently about like I don't know if it was an interview with Scott Hamilton but just like talking about like skaters were making insane amounts of money in the 90s and then kind of quickly faded to the background.

683
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
But at the time she skated to glory.

684
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Wow.

685
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Not just in her famous Olympic appearance but.

686
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Yeah. Did she let me ask a question. Did she have the was she still in the white dress while she was being chased by the skeletons or it was a different was it an outfit change.

687
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Yeah it was very they are there in black and she's in white and it's the good versus evil.

688
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,000
You know some people in the cheap seats can tell who's good and evil.

689
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Sure.

690
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Because confusingly she was also Catwoman one of history's greatest villains.

691
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Anyway.

692
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
OK. So this ice theater.

693
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
So John.

694
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Had a failed mall next to it.

695
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Yes. Yes. There is this weird there's this weird area that this guy has land deals in. That's an ice theater a failing mall and like the back of a medieval times where they were grazing horses and now are again.

696
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:47,000
So the guy his work options are limited and he's like I have to make my own opportunity.

697
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Look there's a big lake here as well that's the other thing which is you know very similar to California Adventure is a big lake that was actually just a clay quarry that got filled up with rainwater and then it stayed.

698
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:04,000
So you know I got a quarry I got an abandoned mall. This is the beginnings of a theme park obviously.

699
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
So he set out to get funding from banks.

700
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:15,000
He went out with an idea that's the four seasons not the band Jersey Boys but the four seasons of a year.

701
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:27,000
And he we watched this I think we all watched part of a presentation that he gave where did you guys see where he like showed the characters who would be fundamental in the seasons park who were like the Easter Bunny for spring.

702
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Yes.

703
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Uncle Sam for summer.

704
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Of course.

705
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:38,000
And then for another great Halloween character like Batman and Robin Jack Pumpkinhead.

706
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Jack Pumpkinhead.

707
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
He just presents confidently.

708
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
And then obviously Jack Pumpkinhead.

709
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Is Jack Pumpkinhead a character from the other Wizard of Oz books like that Jack Pumpkinhead.

710
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Well he says he makes a point that these are all public domain characters.

711
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:58,000
And all the Wizard of Oz characters are are in not still but of course in the public domain.

712
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Uh huh.

713
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Oh okay.

714
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Winter.

715
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Santa.

716
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
He has Santa in there right.

717
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Santa is still allowed.

718
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Santa on the PowerPoint I think.

719
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
It's Jimmy Icicle.

720
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Ironically public domain for how much licensing would end up fueling the actual park.

721
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Yes that's true.

722
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Oh yeah exactly.

723
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Well so the bank tells him like the seasons aren't enough to get a park financed you need some IP that beloved IP that we love so dear.

724
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
So he goes to some of these other places he goes to MGM.

725
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
He tries to get them to sponsor a park.

726
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:38,000
And he makes a big map with all of the MGM properties and then that they aren't interested in getting they already had an experience in Las Vegas.

727
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
They don't want to get back into the theme park game.

728
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:48,000
So he's like Binkowski is not sure what to do what theme could what brand could I get involved to get this place built.

729
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
And then he somehow miraculously thinks of hard rock.

730
00:52:51,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Well someone tells him the way I read it is that someone tells him you should talk to your neighbor next door your next door neighbor.

731
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:07,000
He is an executive or was an executive at Hard Rock and that would be Steve Goodwin.

732
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:12,000
No wait no I'm sorry he's he's also involved but this is this is Oliver Munday.

733
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Yeah I was in my head I was like oh is it Goodwin like I all of these characters live in my head now.

734
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
I knew it was Oliver Munday.

735
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I knew it was Munday because that's what my boss at Conan Mike Sweeney called Nick Mundy an actor or friend who was often in sketches and he never learned the name correctly.

736
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Can we get Munday?

737
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
So no relation Oliver Munday.

738
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Power play.

739
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
It might have been he was up to something.

740
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:53,000
So they go to the do you have the official corporate owner the hard rock brand and the cafes and hotels and everything is owned by the Seminole tribe nowadays right.

741
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Yes I read that yeah.

742
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:08,000
And they Hard Rock of course like operates some of these and then they license out the name for stuff too and they seem pretty on board pretty quickly for this theme park right.

743
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Well they had him he went over with a bottle of wine to his neighbor's house and presented him with like a two page outline explaining that it will the park will have all the tenants of rock music and it'll be a family friendly place where kids and adults can rock out.

744
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Together and this was this string of words was enough to get him in the door although it went away he never thought about it again.

745
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:42,000
And then the Oliver Munday calls him and says hey I talked to my bosses they're in actually they're interested so can you come back in 48 hours like with your plan and all the specifics.

746
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Yes sure can do.

747
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:48,000
He has no specifics is nothing figured out but he talks to his friend this might be Goodwin.

748
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
This is Goodwin they went to Kinko's that's where.

749
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Yes they went to Kinko's.

750
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:59,000
They had this very fateful jam session at Kinko's.

751
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Where they're just putting labels over the old they're taking MGM they're taking what was probably a James Bond ride and then just and then putting like Dixie Chicks ride over it.

752
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:14,000
James Blunt.

753
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Which actually like this is like kind of prophetic in like how quickly they would have to re-theme the park later on once Hard Rock pulled out.

754
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Yeah we'll get to that.

755
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:32,000
So he quickly mods out the makes it rockified.

756
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:41,000
But there's something that I noticed that he like there's he's just hypothetically throwing out bands that made or may not be of course I can get the Beatles involved.

757
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:54,000
And I saw I looked at the map of the kid with the Kinko's labels and there's a plot of a dark ride and he just put he puts like the different eras of the Beatles into different rooms on the on the dark ride.

758
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:09,000
And it's like you know probably the more visual like eras of the Beatles it's you know here will be it you know will be in the Liverpool era or in the Cavern Club and then we'll go to the Yellow Submarine and Magical Mystery Tour and then the last room is Anthology.

759
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Like there's gonna be a room in the ride based on like so I guess that section would be a bearded Ringo Starr reminiscing in a pasture.

760
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,000
George just glaring at Paul not wanting to be there.

761
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Sean off with his old assistants that Yoko was like go live with this assistant for a year and then I'll send you back.

762
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
You gotta cover the lost year in the ride.

763
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
I thought you were gonna say John is off with God.

764
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Yes.

765
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:48,000
A nice ending to the ride like the Blue Fairy granting life to Pinocchio.

766
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Perhaps the ride ends with John granting his blessing for free as a bird to be recorded for the Anthology.

767
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Sounds good.

768
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
I love that old dune.

769
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:09,000
In 2007 Hard Rock Cafe Inc. was sold to the Seminole Tribe of Florida and it is headquartered in beautiful Orlando, Florida.

770
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:20,000
As of December 2015 there are 191 Hard Rock locations in 61 countries that includes 173 cafes, 23 hotels and 11 casinos.

771
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Jesus Christ.

772
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:29,000
And so the Seminole Tribe came into this very late in the game because this was happening it took like six years to open.

773
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Yeah so like they did get this park open while a corporate like ownership sale of the Hard Rock Company was happening.

774
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:46,000
And I guess it was just moving so along at that point the park that they're like okay I guess we have a theme park now.

775
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,000
The Seminoles are looking forward to that they want to go on Led Zeppelin the ride.

776
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:56,000
This really makes me think that if we just find like a millionaire we could just get a theme park open.

777
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Like let's find a company that has like anything movies a play maybe famous plays I don't know.

778
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Like somebody owns a bunch of plays and we'll make a theme park.

779
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
So you own Gypsy.

780
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Yeah well.

781
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:17,000
That is what's like kind of incredible about this story is like this guy that has bounced around in that world got to open a 400 million dollar theme park.

782
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
I know.

783
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,000
It seems unfathomable that you would like have an idea and be like yeah there's land here.

784
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Get this like you know license to do this and make some calls in like six years.

785
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:33,000
But eventually it's like yeah I've got 255 million dollars lined up.

786
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Like completely forgetting that it didn't last very long.

787
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
This is still like an incredible achievement.

788
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
It's pretty amazing.

789
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
He's credited as such in the theme park world.

790
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
People like are very complimentary of this park.

791
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Yeah and that he did it like yeah he had no connection to any of this to Hard Rock whatsoever.

792
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Suddenly he's with them.

793
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
They're branding everything.

794
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:56,000
He went to talk to Led Zeppelin and shit and then and then it's gone and it falls apart.

795
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
And all of this happened and he didn't like go to jail.

796
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Like not that he should go to jail.

797
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
I don't think he did anything wrong.

798
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:07,000
But like that this wasn't the kind of situation where somebody like screwed up so bad.

799
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,000
This is the kind of story where they're usually like bodies at the end of it.

800
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:15,000
And then it got really bad. Like this just like didn't work out.

801
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
He seems to be fine. He moved on.

802
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:23,000
In an interview a few years ago he said like oh yeah Renaissance we're working on stuff for Shanghai Disneyland.

803
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
And it's like oh my god.

804
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
He's doing fine.

805
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
He's doing fine.

806
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
He's thriving.

807
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Are we saying this because we think John is listening?

808
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Yeah.

809
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,000
No he seems like a nice guy.

810
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Our fans we do we're all sad we didn't get to go to this park.

811
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
We definitely need to see it accurate.

812
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
And we are being honest.

813
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,000
I'll say this if John's listening let's give it another go.

814
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Let's get us involved.

815
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Let's get us involved. Go back to the Seminole tribe.

816
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:53,000
We got some ideas. Maybe we'll say them at the end of this whole segment.

817
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Absolutely.

818
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,000
We'll just find a new quarry to build around.

819
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
It's got to be an abandoned quarry somewhere.

820
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Where's the new tourist I don't know in Mississippi?

821
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Just get a Skrillex coaster going.

822
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Yeah.

823
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Guys I know I have the lead on a plot of land outside of a vacation spot in South Carolina

824
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
that is currently occupied.

825
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Oh wow.

826
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
You actually do?

827
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Yeah.

828
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Okay.

829
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Well let's start talking finances.

830
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
The old freestyle music park.

831
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Oh I remember the old freestyle music park.

832
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Whatever happened to that?

833
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
So that needs an owner?

834
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Alright.

835
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Yeah.

836
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Let's buy it up.

837
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:35,000
So there was this long money raising period where it says he got seed money from Israeli firms

838
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:40,000
and was able to sell 255 million dollars worth of bonds.

839
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
And so he had hundreds of millions of dollars.

840
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Oh yeah.

841
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Specifically because you brought up the Israeli firm.

842
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Oh boy.

843
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
I even know it about this.

844
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:57,000
This is not quite, no one is in jail but there is some legality stuff.

845
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:02,000
One of the investors in the park is named Africa Israel Investments.

846
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Their American branch owns the New York Times building which I just think is an interesting fact.

847
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:17,000
This company, to allude to what happens at the end of this park, this company just wrote off its 10 million dollar investment.

848
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
They just wrote it off.

849
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:24,000
This company also in 2008 dealing with some controversy.

850
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:31,000
They got a lot of newspaper coverage for its association with the construction of Israeli settlements in the West Bank.

851
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Oh my goodness.

852
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
In A'amahit territory.

853
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
All like rock themed.

854
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,000
All rock themed settlements.

855
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Yeah.

856
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:43,000
The Wailing Wall like the Pink Floyd Wall.

857
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Nice.

858
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,000
So numerous investors.

859
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:55,000
This is all in this park. You don't raise 400 million dollars without making a few compromises ethically.

860
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Apparently not.

861
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:07,000
This is all making me think why the fuck didn't circa this time, like in 2006, riding high on The Apprentice, why didn't Trump just start Trumpland?

862
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
I think we could have missed all of this.

863
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Like it's a great shady investors and stuff. This is so up his alley.

864
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Again, if we kept reading for another few hours, we might have found out like, oh, okay, 20 million from Trump International.

865
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Sure.

866
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Yeah, that makes sense.

867
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,000
He was involved in the weird failed Warner Brothers stores, we found out.

868
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Really?

869
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,000
But didn't his family crush a local theme park? Isn't that what happened?

870
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
There was some story about...

871
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Oh, in Atlantic City?

872
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Yeah.

873
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Something like that.

874
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Yeah, it's part of Coney Island.

875
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Coney Island.

876
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Yeah, yeah.

877
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Oh, yeah, in Atlantic...

878
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Oh, yes.

879
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
The Trumps outlawed fun on the boardwalk.

880
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
That's why this never happened.

881
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:49,000
But he is the president of Trumpland of a failing theme park.

882
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
He would be having so much more fun than being the president of a failed country.

883
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:57,000
But also he is the president of Trumpland of failing theme parks called the United States of America.

884
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:04,000
But he hasn't gotten to design any coasters on a cocktail napkin and then make people figure out how it works.

885
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,000
People are going to fall out of it. It's going to catch on fire.

886
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Who do we think is a better leader? Trump or H.R. Puff and stuff?

887
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,000
As far as him treating his people well.

888
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,000
I'd have to look into his policies, the specifics of his mayoral run.

889
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Yup.

890
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
All right.

891
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Plus his father and the Klan.

892
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Both their fathers were in the Klan.

893
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,000
A giant wide hood over his giant wide head.

894
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Yeah, like an archival photo and one of the Klansmen has a giant head.

895
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,000
A very wide mouth.

896
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Which one was your dad?

897
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
I don't think he's in there. I don't see him.

898
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,000
He was arrested nearby but he had nothing to do with it.

899
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,000
So yeah, they scared up this investment.

900
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Yeah, where are we?

901
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,000
I know, we're not even in the park yet.

902
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:58,000
In the investment, which the investment, I mean if you're talking about the successes and failures of the park,

903
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:06,000
the investment, the money being divided up, the thing that kept coming up is that like they got this money,

904
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
but then there was no more money.

905
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
It's like this is your allowance for the week.

906
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Yeah, that is so crazy.

907
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:19,000
And that is like I think maybe jumping ahead a little bit, but they had apparently 400 million dollars

908
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:23,000
and then all these stories say but they had no money to buy any advertising.

909
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Yeah, the advertising got mucked up somewhere.

910
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Now there are commercials you can find online which are something else.

911
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:37,000
It's usually people in normal settings and then they start acting like rock and rollers and a logo comes up

912
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:43,000
and an announcer goes like, must have been to Hard Rock Park.

913
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:51,000
There's one that Binkowski presents as having been banned where a waiter comes up to a group of off-screen women at a table

914
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
and says, so can I get you ladies anything else?

915
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:59,000
And then they all throw their panties at his face and then, must have been to Hard Rock.

916
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:04,000
He might be mixing up band with like just people who didn't want to air it.

917
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Just rock and roll.

918
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Just bummed out.

919
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Comedic taste didn't align.

920
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Maybe, oh sorry.

921
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Oh no, I was going to say that reminds me, like the panties thing reminds me.

922
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:26,000
This is also like it's hard rock, but I mean the hard rock cafes and the hard rock hotels kind of encompass a lot of popular music.

923
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:32,000
There is like, you know, there's folk stuff in there. There's hip hop stuff in there. There's a lot of memorabilia.

924
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:39,000
This hard rock park is very specific in its definition of rock and roll.

925
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:44,000
I think I wrote down the note somewhere, white baby boomer nonsense.

926
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Like a very specific kind of like, yeah, Zep and Moody Blue and oh man, Arlo Guthrie was so funny my man.

927
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:01,000
It's very narrow focused in its definition of rock and roll.

928
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:06,000
And nothing I would ever think that you would think like kids would be psyched to go to.

929
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
No.

930
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Which you would need on board to support a thing like that.

931
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Yeah, a reminder, 2008.

932
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
2008.

933
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
This is 10 years ago.

934
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:23,000
It's not like this was 85 or 92. A time maybe when you go, okay, those bands were popular 20 years ago.

935
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:28,000
We're talking like 30, 40 years ago when these bands were like having hits.

936
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,000
So it's even more insane to think about building an entire theme park around them.

937
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Building a multimillion dollar Moody Blues ride in 2008.

938
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
2008.

939
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Moody Blues who my main association with is that Simpsons gag about like,

940
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,000
it's like, who are the Moody Blues?

941
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,000
The Moody Blues are just getting into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame this year.

942
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
This year.

943
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Oh boy.

944
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
That's finally happening.

945
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
They were on The Simpsons though.

946
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Like when The Simpsons just became like a checklist of who do we want to meet.

947
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Like they show up in a Las Vegas episode and talk to Homer and Flanders.

948
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:05,000
You know, because like you got to get some of the big famously Vegas centric bands like the Moody Blues.

949
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
I don't understand.

950
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,000
It's also like crazy because this is like, we're getting I guess ahead of ourselves.

951
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:16,000
But this this Moody Blues ride, which is the crown jewel of Hard Rock Park.

952
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:25,000
I've restrained myself from making this joke before, but we might need to put on a pot of coffee.

953
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:29,000
I other topics we've been like, oh yeah, this is going to be a while.

954
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
We might talk about this for a while.

955
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
But this I'm like, I might need to.

956
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,000
So this was supposed to be the Beatles ride.

957
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,000
This is the first idea was a fun magical mystery type thing.

958
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:44,000
But the Beatles people were like, it's got to be a whole Beatles land, which it's crazy that they didn't go.

959
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Yes, that's let's make the Beatles land because that's the most popular band.

960
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,000
That's actually still a relevant band in 2008.

961
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Instead, he was like, no, thank you.

962
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:56,000
No, thank you. We don't want your Beatles license.

963
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Get the hell on the list.

964
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
The Moody Blues.

965
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Get them on the phone.

966
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
What about the kinks?

967
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
What about why do why don't we go to another band?

968
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Like they did try Pink Floyd.

969
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
They did try Pink Floyd.

970
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:13,000
They said no, but like there are twenty five to fifty bands that are bigger than the Moody Blues.

971
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
No offense to Moody Blues are good.

972
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Yeah.

973
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,000
But if you're doing something that people are going to recognize.

974
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,000
I'm not sure I've heard the song Knights in White Satin.

975
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:26,000
I thought it was Procol Harum's.

976
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Yeah.

977
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Wider Shade of Pale for the longest time.

978
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
They occupy kind of the same space and then culture.

979
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,000
And then I thought it was White Room as well.

980
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
I thought that the Cream song.

981
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Mm hmm. I get no word.

982
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Black curtains.

983
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
I was like, oh, that's what that song is.

984
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
And I thought it was White Rabbit.

985
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Yeah. Yeah.

986
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Until yesterday, I thought it was Knights with a K in White Satin.

987
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:55,000
And then I looked up the song and it's like the inspiration for the song was one of the members of the Moody Blues got a set of satin sheets as a gift.

988
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:01,000
And I read this and I thought this is what Jason Sheridan would write a song about his sheets on his bed.

989
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Oh, he's like in the house.

990
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Soft the sheets are.

991
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Wait, is it really not Knights with a K?

992
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
It's not Knights with a K.

993
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
No, it's Knights.

994
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Because it's like.

995
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,000
But there is a knight in the lobby.

996
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
That's the right interpretation of it.

997
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
It's not.

998
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,000
It's about him just having a nice night on nice sheets.

999
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
You know why?

1000
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Because you see that quote they asked the guy who wrote it and they're like, what do you think of the ride?

1001
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,000
He's like, well, that wasn't really what that song was about.

1002
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Ha ha.

1003
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
It's like implying that it was about fucking.

1004
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Like, yeah.

1005
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
No, Knights in White Satin in that.

1006
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Yeah.

1007
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Yeah.

1008
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:37,000
It's like, yeah, like I'm in bed with a real Nancy Kerrigan as babe.

1009
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Just another knight in white satin.

1010
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
So this ride is like.

1011
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:46,000
So this ride, we'll circle it back around to the creation of the park and the opening.

1012
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
We do have to cover the groundbreaking.

1013
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Oh yeah.

1014
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
We'll get back to that.

1015
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
But yeah, let's bang out.

1016
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Let's bang out.

1017
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Mike, do you happen to have the name of this ride on hand?

1018
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Knights in White Satin, the wait, it's the trip.

1019
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
The trip.

1020
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Yeah, the trip.

1021
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
It's not Knights in White Satin, the ride.

1022
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
No.

1023
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Knights in White Satin, the trip.

1024
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,000
We should change the name of the podcast.

1025
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
The podcast, the trip.

1026
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,000
The trip.

1027
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Just for this episode.

1028
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
For this episode.

1029
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,000
New logo and like a man put over, paced over at a big trippy.

1030
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
You see the entrance.

1031
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
The entrance is crazy.

1032
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
I mean, we'll post all of this on Twitter.

1033
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Showing us the facade and it is like.

1034
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,000
You're being summoned into a room by a psychedelic wizard.

1035
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,000
This flames of fire.

1036
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
And you know what?

1037
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:33,000
I don't know if you can see it in this, but there is apparently a poster for this ride

1038
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:36,000
that has a lot of weird little hidden imagery.

1039
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:42,000
And in John Benkowski's corporate presentation, he points out that you can see the ultrasound

1040
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:47,000
photo of a baby of an employee who was working on this ride.

1041
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Like she lent a photo of her fetus to be a trippy visual.

1042
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Now what we're kind of glossing over is the fact that everyone who went on it says it's

1043
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:03,000
the greatest dark ride that has ever been built.

1044
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Here's the thing.

1045
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Just reading the name of the ride.

1046
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Every time I would come across the trip part of the ride, I would get viscerally angry.

1047
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Once I hit number three on journalists who said this is the greatest dark ride ever,

1048
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:20,000
I was just like, I need to step away for a few minutes.

1049
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:25,000
So there's a guy named Jeremy Thompson who has a website called Roller Coaster Philosophy,

1050
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,000
I think.

1051
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Have you guys ever seen that?

1052
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:32,000
And he writes these really, really long in-depth reviews of theme parks.

1053
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Very thoughtful.

1054
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Very thoughtful.

1055
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:43,000
And just really, really long, well thought out stuff that treats dark rides as an art

1056
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
form.

1057
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
And he's also very hard on everything.

1058
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
He kind of hates everything.

1059
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:53,000
And this is how I discovered this park is because he had his list of top ten dark rides

1060
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,000
of all time.

1061
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:59,000
He's been at every theme park in the world and he ranks this as the number one.

1062
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:05,000
I mean, I looked at those ride-through videos and it does not do it justice if it's truly

1063
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,000
that great.

1064
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,000
It looks like a better version of the Garfield's Nightmare.

1065
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:14,000
It really looks like, I don't know, I'm missing something.

1066
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
There's no story.

1067
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:23,000
It's like if you were making a 60s mini-series and one of the characters had a psychedelic

1068
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:27,000
trip, that's what they tried to recreate for this ride.

1069
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,000
You're going through it and there are knights in white satin.

1070
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,000
In white satin, yeah.

1071
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
UK knights.

1072
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Yeah, and they take a swing at you on the ride and then you keep going and there's floating

1073
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
stuff.

1074
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
There's floating candles.

1075
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:44,000
And it's like, it is what he wanted a magical mystery tour ride, I guess, to be, but then

1076
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:49,000
he just put this whole druggy narrative on this song that's just about having sex on

1077
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
a nice bed.

1078
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Oh wait, which also is...

1079
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:59,000
The best part of great sex is when you're on a really nice bed.

1080
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:03,000
That's what the songwriter was trying to highlight specifically.

1081
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Bed quality.

1082
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Lumbar support.

1083
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Look, the trippiness starts in the queue where you go through a beaded curtain and then you're

1084
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:19,000
given prism, like weird prism glasses, and you go through some dark, dark black light

1085
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:26,000
hallways and then you ride through the satin night room and then there's a floating candle

1086
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:30,000
room and then bang, the ride becomes a screen ride.

1087
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Yeah, once you're past some optical illusions, like I think I was a little more with it for

1088
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:40,000
the first minute and then it does seem to become just like lights, just a candle.

1089
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:47,000
A screen ride where they did not bother to put a screen portion over the tunnel.

1090
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Like in a lot of rides, the screen will cover doors and then the doors will open up and

1091
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:57,000
you'll go through, not this, you can see the hole you're about to go through and then you

1092
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
go through a tunnel with lights.

1093
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:04,000
And I'm also glossing over the fact that as I'm watching this, I think like, oh, there's

1094
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
a spoken word interlude?

1095
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:11,000
No, it is not a spoken word interlude, it's a spoken word ending.

1096
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,000
What?

1097
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Oh, it-

1098
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,000
That the ride ends with-

1099
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Yeah, with this weird poem.

1100
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
With a weird poem, no music.

1101
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Oh, which includes the line, new mother picks up and suckles her son.

1102
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Senior citizens wish they were young.

1103
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,000
You're hearing this, you're on a ride with a child hearing these lyrics.

1104
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,000
I feel like everyone walked out of this ride in tears.

1105
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Like, I think we will never in our lives understand how powerful this was.

1106
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Every single person is like, this is the greatest ride I've ever been on.

1107
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:49,000
I mean, you sent us that rollercoaster philosophy website and I'm like, okay, well, this is

1108
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,000
just one blogger.

1109
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:56,000
And then the slightest bit of research got me to a write-up about the park from Beth

1110
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:03,000
J. Harpas, the Associated Press travel editor, who also said it was one of her all-time favorite

1111
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:09,000
theme park rides right up there with Disney Soarin', which again, also kind of a weird

1112
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,000
statement.

1113
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,000
That's weird.

1114
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
That's weird.

1115
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:19,000
And then I got to give credit, a lot of my knowledge of this park comes from a theme

1116
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:23,000
park university, a great blog that I've read for a long time.

1117
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,000
And I had never gotten around to reading their hard-

1118
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:31,000
They wrote a 10-part series on the hard rock park.

1119
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,000
And I thought like, well, I'll speed through the end.

1120
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
I did not speed through this.

1121
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:40,000
I spent a day reading this part because I found it so encroasing.

1122
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:48,000
But then even at the end of this 10-part series, he shouts out, he says it's one of his favorite,

1123
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
it might be his favorite turn-grider at all times.

1124
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
It does feel like we're being gaslighted or something.

1125
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,000
It feels like everyone's like, yeah, this is the greatest ride.

1126
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,000
And then we look at every piece of information about it and go, what are you talking about?

1127
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Maybe there was some kind of hypnotism kind of thing when you get off of it that makes

1128
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:09,000
you walk away thinking you've had this incredibly transcendent experience.

1129
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,000
A gas was released into the room.

1130
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Apparently the audio quality was very good.

1131
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,000
I don't think that's enough for me.

1132
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Oh, John talks a lot about the audio quality.

1133
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,000
JL Audio.

1134
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Shout out to JL Audio.

1135
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
He talks a lot about the audio quality at the park.

1136
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
The PV amps that were everywhere.

1137
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:29,000
He said, we're not hiding these amps, and then he said, we want to have the logos bigger.

1138
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:34,000
So PV made special logos to make their logo bigger on the amps around the park.

1139
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,000
The park was more, when you're walking around Disneyland, all the speakers are hidden.

1140
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Yes.

1141
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,000
And they were proud to have them all out and like, labeled, heavily labeled.

1142
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Funny that you guys mentioned the speakers.

1143
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:47,000
I don't know if you watched the safety video for Led Zeppelin, the ride.

1144
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,000
I couldn't find it.

1145
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Oh, I found it.

1146
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,000
No, John put it on YouTube.

1147
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Oh.

1148
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
And the safety video.

1149
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,000
The safety video, not the preshow.

1150
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,000
The preshow.

1151
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,000
The preshow is not online.

1152
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,000
I spent an hour trying to find it.

1153
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:03,300
I think because I learned it's the first three minutes of the song, so it probably was just

1154
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:05,000
taken down for copyright immediately.

1155
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Yes.

1156
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,480
That was the big, not to keep jumping around, but that was the big complaint about Led Zeppelin,

1157
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:14,180
the ride, is that you had to watch a five minute preshow of them performing this song

1158
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:16,000
every time you wanted to just ride this roller coaster.

1159
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,820
Yeah, because they insisted a full song.

1160
01:17:17,820 --> 01:17:20,000
You had to get a full song.

1161
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:26,000
You couldn't, as pointed out by theme park university, you could not do a five minute

1162
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:32,640
70 mile per hour roller coaster because people would die.

1163
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:38,280
So you get like the first 80 percent of that song in the preshow and then the song.

1164
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:39,280
And then there's a break?

1165
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:41,480
And then you get in the car and then it finishes.

1166
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:43,480
I think the song continues as the door's open.

1167
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:45,080
As the door's open, you get in.

1168
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:46,080
And what is the song?

1169
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:47,400
I'm forgetting the song now.

1170
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:48,400
Whole Lotta Love.

1171
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:49,400
It's Whole Lotta Love.

1172
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:50,400
It's Whole Lotta Love.

1173
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:51,400
It's Whole Lotta Love.

1174
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:52,400
It's Whole Lotta Love.

1175
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:53,400
Go ahead.

1176
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:54,400
I know what you're going to say.

1177
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:58,680
Before you see that, you watch this safety video, which is so confusing and convoluted

1178
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:02,120
because it's about what like numbers to stand on if you want to stay with your party.

1179
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:04,340
It's like this computer animation.

1180
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:10,820
But they're saying you get into the roller coaster and it says, make sure you don't damage

1181
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:16,040
the high fidelity onboard audio speakers when you get into the ride, which I've never seen

1182
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:17,040
any of these things.

1183
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:20,600
And you like, this guy was so concerned about the speakers.

1184
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:24,880
Like make sure everyone, these fucking idiots know, don't touch the speakers.

1185
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:26,320
He was very proud of it.

1186
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:28,200
Like you can see he's in this presentation.

1187
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:31,560
He's like beaming when he's talking about the PV amps and speakers.

1188
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:32,560
Yeah.

1189
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:38,500
Well, another thing that's touted about the park is that there's seamless transitions

1190
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:42,960
from the music on the ride to the music out in the park.

1191
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:50,320
So if you're in a restaurant and you're listening to, you know, Do You Think I'm Sexy?

1192
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:55,540
Then you go out into the park and it is a Calliope version of Do You Think I'm Sexy?

1193
01:18:55,540 --> 01:18:56,660
And they're all synced up.

1194
01:18:56,660 --> 01:19:01,320
So one, they're all playing right on top of each other and there's a smooth transition.

1195
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:03,280
To which I say, who cares?

1196
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:04,280
Right?

1197
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:09,560
Like, why does it really bother anybody at a theme park that a different song is playing

1198
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:10,560
now?

1199
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:11,960
Like it's just part of what happens.

1200
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:17,800
On the Harry Potter episode, I do find that when you're sitting at the Hogs or the three

1201
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:24,160
broomsticks, you're sitting out at a Hollywood Universal and you hear loudly playing Do The

1202
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:26,380
Bart Man in the background.

1203
01:19:26,380 --> 01:19:28,680
Little bit, a little bit of a problem.

1204
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:31,160
That's more of a bleed problem.

1205
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:37,440
But there's, John specifically says he doesn't like when there's a sound bleed.

1206
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,440
No, I don't like it either.

1207
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:43,700
I think it's, I don't know that I care that much, but I do think it's thoughtful.

1208
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:46,120
Like there are thoughtful stuff involved in this park.

1209
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:52,300
Like how each land has like, there's a, there's like a thrill ride for adults and then there's

1210
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:55,100
kids stuff and there's shows and there's restaurants.

1211
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:59,960
So that way if people don't want to ride the big rides, there's stuff close by for the

1212
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:01,080
rest of the family to do.

1213
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:03,760
Like I do think that is a thoughtful design element.

1214
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,560
He is very proud of that.

1215
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:06,740
He's so excited.

1216
01:20:06,740 --> 01:20:08,840
You can tell about that sound bleed issue.

1217
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:12,420
Like that was just like, I'm most proud of, not of the rides, but of like the sound and

1218
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:14,080
what I did in the bathroom and stuff.

1219
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,080
But that's a whole nother.

1220
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:16,080
And you know what he did with the urinals?

1221
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:17,080
Yeah, yeah, the whole, yeah.

1222
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:18,080
Oh yeah, the urinals.

1223
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:19,080
I'll say that.

1224
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:26,840
There is, you can see a photo of, in this park, in the, in the whammy bar area, I believe,

1225
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:28,880
the bar called the Whammy Bar.

1226
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:30,720
We're up above the urinals.

1227
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,600
I've got it right here, Scott.

1228
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:36,880
There is artwork of women looking down.

1229
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:39,720
We all have it, we all have it at once.

1230
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:42,760
There's women looking down at where you are peeing.

1231
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:43,760
Looking at your penis.

1232
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:44,760
Yeah.

1233
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:45,760
And pointing and laughing.

1234
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:52,040
So there's two blonde ladies, a black lady who I think is the only person of color represented

1235
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:53,040
in the park.

1236
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:54,040
Anywhere.

1237
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:58,900
No Aretha, no Beyonce, but this lady in the bathroom.

1238
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:04,480
Two country ladies and an old lady with a magnifying glass because your penis is so

1239
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:05,480
tiny.

1240
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:11,720
So this is the wit, this is the acerbic wit that the Times of London talked about.

1241
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:17,300
The African American lady though seems pleased with the size and the old lady seems like

1242
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:20,500
she's got the magnifying glass and she's kind of judging it.

1243
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:22,800
So like everyone kind of has a different face on.

1244
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:27,140
So either if it's, if everyone's dick is small, everyone has a different feeling about dick

1245
01:21:27,140 --> 01:21:28,320
size is what I'm saying.

1246
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:29,320
Yeah.

1247
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:30,920
Honestly, the old lady looks like she's pleased too.

1248
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:32,520
Like, Ooh, what a great small dick.

1249
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:35,600
Yeah, she might just need the magnifying glass to see.

1250
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:36,600
Yeah.

1251
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,160
It might not have anything to do with the size.

1252
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:39,520
Honestly, a vision issue.

1253
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:45,440
Or maybe she's trying to get a look on how big it trying to take a, you know, a seven,

1254
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:49,400
eight incher and make it look like a three footer just for fun.

1255
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:54,000
Or she's using the magnifying glass as a barrier because it's so big.

1256
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,780
She's like, maybe I can squat it out of the way with this.

1257
01:21:56,780 --> 01:21:58,600
Don't poke me in the eye.

1258
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:03,840
There's also photos on Google image of like people like pissing in these urinals where

1259
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:08,200
like, like this only encourages people to take photos in the men's restroom.

1260
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:09,200
Yeah.

1261
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:10,640
People are using it.

1262
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:13,000
This wouldn't fly in most strip clubs.

1263
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,000
This is crazy.

1264
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Yeah.

1265
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,000
This is like last resort level.

1266
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,880
Also, what does this have to do with hard rock?

1267
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:20,080
Yeah, no, I know.

1268
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:24,160
Well that's the, that's what we call the sub game of the park is horniness.

1269
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:28,560
Like there's a very wordy like for this is, I gotta say, this is.

1270
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:34,400
The main, this is number one, just like nights and white satin is number one at some people's

1271
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:35,760
dark ride lists.

1272
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:40,520
This is number one in terms of theme parks that catered to dad because there's a lot

1273
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:43,480
in this park for dad.

1274
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:50,800
Not a real dad who you would meet in reality, but like Madison avenues concept of dad.

1275
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:57,640
A, uh, of an Al Bundy, a guy who's frustrated in a sexless marriage and super horny and

1276
01:22:57,640 --> 01:23:00,880
he can't express it to his own wife.

1277
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:04,280
Ever since the kids showed up, I can't get my rocks off.

1278
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:09,040
But these little, like the little teases throughout the hard rock park, tantalize him and get

1279
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,040
him through the day.

1280
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:17,480
Like for example, there was a British style phone booth with fake like business cards

1281
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:18,480
and stuff in it.

1282
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:22,440
And there was a pressure mat on the ground and you would walk in and the phone would

1283
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:25,640
ring and you would hear like the conversation between rockstar and his manager.

1284
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:27,400
I don't really give a shit about that.

1285
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:31,880
What I do give a shit about is this fake business card for Dean's dry cleaners that has a picture

1286
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:39,520
of a washing machine and the business tagline next to it says, give us your load.

1287
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:42,520
Why is give us and your load in two different fonts?

1288
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:43,520
Two different fonts.

1289
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:46,600
I guess that's, you know, just graphic design of the day.

1290
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:49,920
I guess it was 2008.

1291
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:51,320
It was different times.

1292
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:55,200
We did again, a little grass for a strip club.

1293
01:23:55,200 --> 01:24:03,320
Did anyone see the statue that is called the birth of rock in which there's sort of an

1294
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:10,480
abstract amorphous, but obviously female body with breasts and then a, it is not what you're

1295
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:11,480
currently showing me.

1296
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:12,480
That's another thing, Jason.

1297
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:15,200
Yeah, that's not that different.

1298
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:20,260
The birth of rock, a statue at a time, the birth of rock is there's like a female body

1299
01:24:20,260 --> 01:24:25,480
shape and then, and she's sort of like thrusting her legs towards you, but her, her, her, you

1300
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:27,280
know, her actual genitals are not represented.

1301
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:31,000
Instead, just a hand is coming out of the genital.

1302
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,400
Still different statue, right?

1303
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:33,400
That's not it, right?

1304
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:35,840
It's also a disgusting statue.

1305
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:40,480
Where the woman's vagina should be instead of hand is emerging, making a devil sign.

1306
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:41,480
Oh, I did not see this.

1307
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:42,480
This is horrendous.

1308
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:46,280
This might be a good thing that this part doesn't exist in this era.

1309
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:48,520
I don't think it would have lasted.

1310
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:51,520
Even if it had like done well, I don't know how long it would have lasted.

1311
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:56,440
I got to say my criticism is that that birth of rock is a real missed opportunity to tie

1312
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:59,960
it into the hit song by live lightning crashes.

1313
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:04,400
I don't think I read the lyric.

1314
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:08,620
Her placenta falls to the floor.

1315
01:25:08,620 --> 01:25:10,560
Lightning crashes and new mother cries.

1316
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:15,960
Her placenta falls through the opening lyrics of the song.

1317
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:19,360
So I feel like there is a live tie in the birth of rock.

1318
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:24,320
New mother picks up her son and suckles her son.

1319
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:27,640
This park is about birth and rebirth.

1320
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:33,360
The statue I was showing Scott was of a, I guess a cow dressed as like a rockabilly guy

1321
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:35,820
or Elvis maybe.

1322
01:25:35,820 --> 01:25:40,400
But it's also a fountain and its udders are spraying on two women.

1323
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:41,400
Just freezing.

1324
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:44,640
You could easily get splashed by a cow's udders.

1325
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:49,760
And my statue was just a big open mouth, like the rolling stones lips, but like dirtier

1326
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:51,000
and grosser.

1327
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:55,480
And then it has piano keys is like it's lower, like a lower set of teeth, but it's like lower

1328
01:25:55,480 --> 01:26:01,160
lip is also it's groin and it's thrusting it out and it has two legs and I it's just,

1329
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:02,160
it's really obscene.

1330
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:04,120
It's like a pure rock creature.

1331
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:05,120
Yeah.

1332
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:06,440
I've got stuff on both these statues.

1333
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:07,440
Okay, go ahead.

1334
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:12,320
Uh, so the cow statue is, it works similar to the statue in the lost continent at islands

1335
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:16,720
of adventure where there's someone sitting in the theater behind it who can see through

1336
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:23,240
cameras and that cow and like, so we can talk to you and, and shoot water at you.

1337
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:26,200
So like when to eat, knows when people are there walking by.

1338
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:34,840
Um, Mike, your weird teeth statue, um, that you designed and are very proud of.

1339
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:40,160
I forget the name of that section of the, is it like the graveyard of rock or something?

1340
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:46,000
Whatever it was, future plans called for that statue garden of upsetting statues to be the

1341
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:52,920
entrance of the park exclusive you exclusively used by the hard rock hotel guests.

1342
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:56,520
The hard rock hotel never built, but now it's going to be very exclusive.

1343
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:59,440
Entrance of the park was through this upsetting statue garden.

1344
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:01,320
That was their treat for staying on site.

1345
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:02,840
That was their treat for staying on site.

1346
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:06,000
I get immediately accosted by a lips creature.

1347
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,480
Um, oh, sorry.

1348
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:08,720
Should we talk about like the light?

1349
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:10,200
Lisa mentioned the lands.

1350
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:11,720
Yeah, well, you know what?

1351
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:15,920
There's even, we still aren't done with everything because, well, let's hear, we can start talking

1352
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:19,440
about whatever the London, Mount Rockmore.

1353
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:20,440
Yeah.

1354
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:21,440
Mount Rockmore was in the open.

1355
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:24,520
We aren't even close to done.

1356
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:25,520
That's right.

1357
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:27,240
We aren't even close to done.

1358
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:28,240
Yeah.

1359
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:31,880
If you think the rock's gonna stop, think again, brother.

1360
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:34,540
We jammed too long for one pod.

1361
01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:40,480
That's why this is the first podcast, the ride double album tune in next week when we

1362
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:47,760
spin disc two of our Magnum Opus podcast, the ride failed parks until next week.

1363
01:27:47,760 --> 01:28:03,109
Come on, man.
