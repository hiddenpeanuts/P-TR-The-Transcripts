1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,560
Welcome to the magical world of Podcast The Ride,

3
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,960
The Second Gate.

4
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,280
This Barbie loves pink, mainly in rosÃ© form.

5
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:34,080
I'm Scott Gardner, joined by this Barbie,

6
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:39,080
who shares his dream house with 900 other action figures.

7
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,120
Mike Carlson.

8
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,400
That's right, I'm here and this Barbie loves sharing

9
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,400
his space with other little friends.

10
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,680
This Barbie has a very crowded dream house.

11
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,140
And this Barbie also loves pink,

12
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,840
but he doesn't give a shit if it's in grapefruit.

13
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,400
Jason Sheridan.

14
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,120
I was wondering what the very specific thing for me

15
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,960
was gonna be.

16
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,460
We have a history with a pink fruit.

17
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,000
Hey, folks, Greta Gerwig's highly anticipated

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,060
Barbie Hits Theaters this week.

19
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,720
And people are excited for this.

20
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,720
It's gonna do great, I'm sure.

21
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,960
But the true heads know that there is already

22
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,380
a primary piece of Barbie media out there.

23
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,220
It is a VHS tape called Barbie Birthday Party

24
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,100
at Walt Disney World, FGod 94.

25
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,980
And that's what we're here to talk about.

26
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:36,660
A long-awaited topic, as anticipated,

27
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,920
in the microcosm of Podcast The Ride listeners,

28
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,260
maybe this is the Greta Gerwig Barbie.

29
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,100
Yeah.

30
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,620
I think that's right.

31
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:48,020
I was gonna say, I'm excited for a new Noah Baumbach movie,

32
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:52,220
but I'm afraid I'll wedgie myself if I say that, you know?

33
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,860
As if you don't wedgie yourself once a Podcast The Ride

34
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,860
episode in some way.

35
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,060
I do, yeah, yeah.

36
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,900
I love it.

37
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:00,720
We all do.

38
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,560
Keep yourself humble.

39
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,380
The Squid and the Whale has some amazing performance

40
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,580
at just pulling it over my head.

41
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,220
Just pulling my own underwear over my head.

42
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,060
It's like, come on, man.

43
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,460
How long have you been watching Squid and the Whale?

44
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,020
I haven't watched it in a long time.

45
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,860
But when it came out, I remember really enjoying it.

46
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,660
You call it Barbie, I call it Squid and the Whale 2.

47
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,180
Another Squid and another Whale.

48
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,220
But yes, Barbie birthday party.

49
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,980
And we are so excited to talk about this

50
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,800
with a verified super fan of this video

51
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,500
and a first time guest, a writer for This Fool on Hulu

52
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,060
and corporate, this Barbie's name is Caroline Anderson.

53
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,820
Hi, thank you so much for having me.

54
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,900
I'm so excited.

55
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,580
We are thrilled about this.

56
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,140
Really excited you could do this.

57
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,100
And this also, just really quick,

58
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,860
a couple people to thank for putting this together.

59
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,380
We were being fools.

60
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,220
I say this fool to show you where it's on,

61
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,660
but these fools forgot that,

62
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,860
we were busy with our Las Vegas schedule

63
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:04,300
and we were ignoring this Barbie timing,

64
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,260
this once in a lifetime Barbie timing.

65
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,700
And thankfully Amanda Hasaka alerted us

66
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,260
to what we were ignoring with the tweet.

67
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,420
If Podcast the Right doesn't do a Barbie Epcot episode

68
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,780
on the day Barbie comes out, what are we doing here?

69
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,700
Including a clip that completely spelled out the point

70
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,420
and I realized Amanda is correct.

71
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,540
We have neglected this.

72
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,180
Because we've talked about doing this thing before,

73
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,460
but we wanted to do it with a super fan.

74
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,700
That was the only way this was gonna work.

75
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,380
And for some reason it occurred to me to ask Griffin Newman

76
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,860
and Griffin Newman spit out the answer immediately,

77
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,220
Caroline Anderson.

78
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,620
So thank you, Griffin.

79
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,980
And I'm just curious to know how does he know that?

80
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,740
How deep does this go?

81
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,540
Can you pull us into your affection

82
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,660
for Barbie birthday party?

83
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,740
I grew up with tapes.

84
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,900
I had 15 tapes and those tapes were just my everything.

85
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,780
Your entire world was these two.

86
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,780
I was an inside kid who didn't have cable

87
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,860
and we didn't have money.

88
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,780
So I had the tapes that my aunt video recorded

89
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,620
and gave to us.

90
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,980
And so one of those tapes,

91
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,940
it's like the Super Mario Brothers movie,

92
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,900
Mixed Nuts, the Steve Martin Nora Everett movie.

93
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,900
Oh wow.

94
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,980
It's a real hodgepodge,

95
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:23,100
Miss Austin Powers that was recorded off of TV.

96
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,300
So it has that warp effect and it has edits.

97
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,980
Whoa, oh and probably like dub overs of profanities.

98
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,020
There's no profanity in the movie.

99
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,500
What are you talking about?

100
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,340
Oh yeah, there probably is.

101
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,180
But does it just go to like?

102
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,000
No, there's a lot.

103
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,020
There's penis jokes all the time,

104
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,140
which for TV they would be like, that's not my bag.

105
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,020
That whole scene is just, he gets his bag.

106
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,100
It is his bag.

107
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,900
They don't show.

108
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,580
He just successfully gets his little items back.

109
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,260
Do I make you, what was yours?

110
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,100
What was it?

111
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,220
Do I make you interested, baby?

112
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,140
Do I make you happy, baby?

113
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:57,980
That's good too.

114
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,820
Both good.

115
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,640
Jason, you have a pitch on that?

116
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,480
Logistically.

117
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,300
You have a pitch on that joke?

118
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,140
Ooh.

119
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,140
That's all right, you don't have to.

120
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,780
Yeah, I'm gonna think on it, come back.

121
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,180
I'll edit it in later.

122
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,420
Just a really cumbersome edit, yeah.

123
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:14,820
Yeah, so one of these VHS tapes was this Barbie Epcot

124
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,940
birthday, in my world it is connected

125
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,380
to the Barbie dance workout 92.

126
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,020
For a lot of people, I know this is,

127
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,060
because I will bring it up with people a lot of,

128
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,940
was that a part of your life?

129
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,860
And for a lot of people it is an associated thing.

130
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,140
I don't know if there was a two for one special

131
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:33,500
at the Toys R Us or anything, but very connected.

132
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,880
And so yeah, it was just one of the only things

133
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,180
that I watched and I probably watched it once a week

134
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,620
for 10 years and so it is very much a part of my life

135
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,900
and especially with Barbie being in the cultural,

136
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,260
to me, we should all be talking about this all the time.

137
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:53,820
I went to the Barbie installation in Santa Monica,

138
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,340
the Barbie museum or whatever.

139
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,180
Oh right.

140
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,500
And there was just nothing about it.

141
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,940
I couldn't believe no one was talking about it.

142
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:04,560
This is such an important piece of history.

143
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,300
Well yeah, okay, because you had other,

144
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,520
Barbie is interesting that there hasn't been,

145
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,240
this movie in 2023, this is the Barbie movie

146
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,600
and it's kind of weird that there hasn't even been any,

147
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,800
there wasn't some low budget attempt at this in the 90s

148
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,040
and there probably were various,

149
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,560
I know that there's kind of some Princess Adventure VHS

150
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,520
and you just mentioned this Dance Workout one

151
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,240
which I didn't know, but it really,

152
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,160
I guess it makes this Epcot video

153
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,120
and any others around this time,

154
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,440
genuinely the definitive Barbie media for a while.

155
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,680
Yeah, well and I also know from listening to an interview

156
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,440
with Beth who was the Barbie for the Epcot show

157
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,520
that Mattel and Disney had a really hard time

158
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,600
getting on the same page and there was a lot of rewrites

159
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,720
so I think Mattel takes this property very, very seriously

160
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,760
so it's challenging.

161
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,600
Wow.

162
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,920
It came along at a very interesting time

163
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,680
as a part of Epcot 94 and later Epcot 95,

164
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,240
they say in the one video of the show

165
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,920
and it does seem like at the time they were like,

166
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,960
we gotta get these kids interested in Epcot.

167
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,120
What are they like, Barbie and video games?

168
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,960
All right, do it.

169
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,640
So they put the Barbie show in World Showcase

170
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:23,000
and they just put rows and rows of Sega testers

171
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,640
in the brand new Innoventions.

172
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,480
Yeah.

173
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,320
And it worked.

174
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,160
Boys, girls, check.

175
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,980
Yeah.

176
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,840
Yeah, boys like video games, girls like Barbie, right?

177
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,080
That's how it's, that's the gender binary, yeah.

178
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,240
Can I ask, like as far as the toys and Barbies.

179
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,400
Couldn't give less of a shit.

180
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,240
Wow, interesting.

181
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,560
I'm not a Barbie person.

182
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,040
That's interesting.

183
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,040
I like to like a plush elephant.

184
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,960
Like I love just like an animal,

185
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,160
a photorealistic plush animal.

186
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,040
I think I owned a handful.

187
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,720
I know I had a vet Barbie at a certain point

188
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,920
because she came with little plush animals.

189
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,320
But yeah, her as a concept, you know,

190
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,200
I'm much more like I love Malibu Stacey.

191
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,000
I love all of the, you know, the fake versions.

192
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,880
But yeah, I don't know that I have like a particular

193
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,520
affinity for the doll.

194
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,000
I like a show.

195
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,840
Sure.

196
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,120
I love the, as somebody who I talk a lot about

197
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,560
for a long time, well look still,

198
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,840
Star Wars is fine, but Star Tours is the definitive

199
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,240
canon for me.

200
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,880
And truly I saw, I went on Star Tours

201
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:32,240
and was a Star Tours years before I even watched

202
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,840
the Star Wars movies.

203
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,920
So I like a good like pop cultural reroute,

204
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,040
a good out of order.

205
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,360
Yeah, one of the tapes that I loved as a child

206
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,200
was troll radio sing along.

207
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,320
I don't know if anyone's familiar,

208
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,360
but it's, you know, it's trollies, you know, little trolls.

209
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,280
And they sing sort of trollized versions of like

210
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,040
do wa diddy diddy dum diddy do.

211
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,920
But then when they started making trolls movies

212
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,520
with, you know, like can't stop the feeling,

213
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,040
I was like, but they love like old standards,

214
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,480
but they love oldies.

215
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,960
The trolls sing oldies.

216
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,240
That doesn't fit in the canon.

217
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,320
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

218
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,440
That actually, that reminds me, I,

219
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,440
on the troll subject, I watched, there's this video,

220
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,720
Barbie birthday party, and I looked up the credits

221
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,880
of the writer and director, and the credits are one other

222
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,920
Barbie video called Barbie fashion secrets.

223
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,640
And this is a good video.

224
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,720
I thought about bringing in some clips,

225
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,640
but it's so visual if you can imagine,

226
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,560
because this is a video where they go to like

227
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,640
the headquarters and they talk to who designs Barbie's clothes,

228
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,360
who does the hair, and who, so, I mean,

229
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,440
I just recommend watching the entire thing,

230
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,320
but it's from around the same time,

231
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,120
a wraparound of like a stop motion Barbie,

232
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,880
so it has that in common, but the highlight of it

233
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,880
is a Barbie troll crossover where Barbie,

234
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,880
worthy guess, that's the correct guess,

235
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,360
because it's a Barbie that comes with trolls

236
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,080
that are her size, so it would be a troll to her,

237
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:07,120
so it's a little puff of hair that she can play with,

238
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,960
but also put into her own hair,

239
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:14,280
so she can use colorful troll hair as like touch-ups

240
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,200
and extensions of herself.

241
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,800
Did she have a little gem in her belly button?

242
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,480
Ooh, I don't think they went all the way,

243
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,840
either it was before the existence of the treasure trolls,

244
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,160
or they were like, we got a lot going already,

245
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,360
we're gonna break the bank if we also put a,

246
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,880
those are real gems, we actually mined those.

247
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,120
I feel like with Barbie, just looking around

248
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,320
at all the different Barbie stuff,

249
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,120
because obviously Barbie's been around for decades,

250
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,280
there's so much, I'd like to call a shot

251
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:48,160
for the next five years of just discussing Barbie's

252
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,040
side characters, because when you look through the list,

253
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,920
it's nuts of characters that have been disused.

254
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,760
You did this too?

255
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,120
I did this too, well, I started, as we were watching

256
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,040
Jane, I was like, she didn't know Mitch,

257
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,880
and I was like, come on, it's Mitch, you know.

258
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,720
Well, you gotta know Mitch.

259
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,480
And I started reading that, like, oh, Mitch has a

260
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,760
very complicated history of being on sale,

261
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,600
being not be on sale. She's been in and out,

262
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,600
and she's been siblings, and she's been friends.

263
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,240
Yes, and that's what I wanna track one of these days.

264
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,560
Alan in the 90s, and then they have kids?

265
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,400
Not Alan.

266
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,720
So first you, first.

267
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,960
I'm just learning now that Mitch exists,

268
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,040
and now you're telling me Mitch is complicated.

269
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,280
Mitch is so complicated.

270
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,520
Mitch is really complicated.

271
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,240
And like, I'm just sorry, you continue.

272
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,840
We're both excited to say names.

273
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,680
I am Mitch.

274
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,040
Watching the video too, we got very excited.

275
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,520
She was like, oh, I didn't know this was like,

276
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,800
set up like a Mary-Kate and Ashley video.

277
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,480
Not the movies, like not the A to B, like three act movie,

278
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,760
but the like kind of interactive, like pizza, P-I-Z-Z-A

279
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,800
kind of videos.

280
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,320
There's just so much here, and I know we can't do it,

281
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,040
but like Skipper is Barbie's kid sister.

282
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,920
And Skipper has her own series of friends of,

283
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,640
on Wikipedia it just says friends of the family.

284
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,600
So Skipper had a friend named Scooter, Ricky, Fluff,

285
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,000
Tiff, Ginger, and these were like discontinued characters

286
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,280
that existed from like,

287
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,880
Scooter was active from 1965 to 1968,

288
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,760
and then 1975 to 1976.

289
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,240
So they would like bring these dolls

290
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,320
in and out of production.

291
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,560
But there's so much stuff like the Generation Girls.

292
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,600
I don't know what that is.

293
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,240
The Rockers and Sensations, which was like Barbie,

294
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,040
Josie and the Pussycats style band, I think is what.

295
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,480
Yes, Barbie and the Rockers was a

296
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,880
Jim and the Hawks era thing, I think.

297
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,240
Yeah, so there's just so much stuff to do on Barbie

298
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,640
in general. Not to skip to the Epcot show,

299
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:51,360
but when the opening of the actual show itself,

300
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,880
which you can watch on YouTube,

301
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,600
the MC introduces all of these characters

302
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,960
to just the weakest applause.

303
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,840
He's like, who else gonna be here?

304
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,680
Mitch!

305
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,920
Jesse!

306
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,160
Well, he also before that has a little display

307
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,360
where he puts down the wall and it's like all the dolls.

308
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,200
I feel like the display of dolls maybe gets more applause

309
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,600
than the performers.

310
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,400
Than some 18 year old.

311
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,080
Jason, you forgot to mention Alan's last name,

312
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,360
Alan Sherwood.

313
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,960
Sorry, you can buy a doll that's named Alan Sherwood?

314
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,240
Alan Sherwood, he started out as Ken's buddy,

315
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,840
and then he was paired with the Mitch doll

316
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,040
from the beginning, or was, excuse me, it was paired.

317
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,920
And then in 1991, a line of dolls was created

318
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,560
depicting a wedding for Alan and Mitch.

319
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,440
Later, a family themed line of dolls,

320
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,640
much like the earlier Hart family,

321
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,160
had the two characters raising a family.

322
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,000
So that's what Alan Sherwood was all about.

323
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,720
Was it Skipper who had the baby and it was a controversy?

324
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,560
I think so, or was that a joke?

325
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,400
That was Mitch.

326
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,240
I forget.

327
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,880
This is an auto fill in right now,

328
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,600
Mitch, Barbie, pregnant, controversy.

329
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,440
So there we go.

330
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,240
In the movie, I think, the Mitch character

331
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,560
is pregnant, Alan is, Michael Cera is Alan

332
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,400
in the movie, I believe.

333
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,760
Yes, Michael Cera is Alan.

334
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,880
So they're really deep into this canon.

335
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,720
Yeah, yeah.

336
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,320
So I'm interested to see what characters they use.

337
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,320
There's no way they can use all the characters

338
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,920
on the Wikipedia though, because it's-

339
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,360
It's a pretty big cast.

340
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,200
Yes.

341
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,040
Yeah, it is.

342
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,880
We've got a lot in there.

343
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,720
Yeah, yeah.

344
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,880
Does that make you, are you then excited for the movie

345
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:30,720
or worried that it will not live up to the vibe

346
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,600
of Barbie birthday party?

347
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm, great question.

348
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,040
I think there's gonna be a lot less screaming and yelling,

349
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,160
which is gonna be hard.

350
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,120
Probably less like sped up slurping of spaghetti

351
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,240
to sort of an off brand Tarantella.

352
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes.

353
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,160
I think the cell phones will probably be better.

354
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,400
But yeah.

355
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,640
And it does, Will Ferrell's in it,

356
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,320
so you're gonna get yelling, but is that,

357
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,000
that's not the same as the yelling of Lisa and Stephanie.

358
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,840
Yes.

359
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,680
It's a distinctly different tone of yelling.

360
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,800
Yeah.

361
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,000
Well, let's talk about this tape a little bit

362
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,920
and the show too.

363
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,760
I know it sounds like you guys thought

364
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,800
to watch the entire thing, like full performances of the thing.

365
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,040
So fill in gaps when we get to the show part.

366
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,880
Yeah.

367
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,080
But kind of the dry history here,

368
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,440
I mean, Jason, you said some of it.

369
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,640
There was already, there was a Disney-Mittell relationship.

370
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,320
Mattel was sponsoring It's a Small World,

371
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,560
and I think some other stuff,

372
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,080
and there's a Mattel store somewhere.

373
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,800
So that relationship was there already,

374
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,760
and they wanted to do a lot for Barbie's big birthday, 35.

375
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:47,160
I mean, they had just come from Disneyland's 35th birthday,

376
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,000
which is oddly the biggest blowout birthday

377
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,200
in Disneyland history, so I guess that was a big,

378
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,280
everybody's just looking for anything.

379
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,240
35, close enough, let's do a bunch of Barbie crap.

380
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,120
So Barbie's coming 35, so thus,

381
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,320
and then they're triangulating,

382
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,560
okay, Epcot's not doing the best right now,

383
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,920
and maybe is not well-liked among kids,

384
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,080
regarded as boring among kids.

385
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,040
If you can believe that, if you could possibly imagine

386
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,120
the dumb children, including us,

387
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,120
who felt this way at the time.

388
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,920
So let's put Barbie in there,

389
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,200
use the international aspects of Barbie,

390
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,800
we got the World Showcase thing in Epcot,

391
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,160
so Barbie will go around the world

392
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,840
and wear different outfits, mainly,

393
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,520
and yeah, make friends, I guess,

394
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,680
cool, and I'll go, look, it's more about the clothes,

395
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,880
it's gonna be more about the clothes.

396
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,840
And the big overlay of this was that Barbie

397
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:47,480
is the ambassador of friendship in Epcot for 94,

398
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,320
that is the big theme, and who better,

399
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,000
I don't know if they ever renewed

400
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,960
the ambassador of friendship program

401
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,280
and named any others.

402
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,520
I think it was Richard Nixon up until 1993,

403
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,720
and then Barbie took over from him.

404
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,680
Post-presidency, they had different philosophies

405
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,240
regarding friendship and how friendly to be.

406
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,720
The ambassador of friendship.

407
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,680
He announced that in the contemporary.

408
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,280
The ambassador of friendship can drop a few bombs, why not?

409
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,520
If the ambassador of friendship does it,

410
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,680
it's not illegal.

411
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,480
Barbie was gonna run for president,

412
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,000
but then she dropped out so that the president could win,

413
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,200
and then she was promised the ambassadorship spot,

414
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,360
it was all really messy.

415
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,440
Oh, sure, yeah, backroom deal, yeah, yeah, yeah.

416
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,480
She had a talking to.

417
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,720
She was communicating with the White House plumbers,

418
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,360
the character is Justin Theroux,

419
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,920
Woody Harrelson play.

420
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,320
So you had a couple of aspects to this,

421
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,440
and the main one being the big show,

422
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,600
The Magical World of Barbie,

423
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:57,600
show that ran from January 94 to May 1995,

424
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,240
and it is a show, of course, Barbie and Ken are there,

425
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,600
this we know, but then there is this expanded lineup.

426
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,680
It's not everyone in the Wikipedia,

427
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,480
but you do have, okay, we got Skipper, we got PJ,

428
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,200
we got Todd, we got Brad, we got Midge,

429
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,320
we got Stacey, and we got Jazzy.

430
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,840
Now, I don't know one of these names.

431
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,360
Jazzy was the most interesting to me.

432
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,440
I learned that Jazzy had been discontinued.

433
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,760
Jazzy was a cool teen cousin

434
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,800
who was discontinued in 92.

435
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,640
Discontinued.

436
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,480
So actually it was a big return.

437
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,440
Because they caught him with weed.

438
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,840
And that's.

439
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,680
Too cool.

440
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,280
Jazzy, be cool, but not that cool.

441
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,360
Does anyone have any memories associated with any of Skipper?

442
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,400
We know, but is there anything in your Rorschach test

443
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,120
for PJ, Todd, Brad, or Stacey?

444
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,480
Sorry, does anybody else?

445
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,840
I was lectured.

446
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,760
Don't jump in all at once.

447
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,960
In the same way that you talked about

448
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,200
how you were lectured about Mary Martin

449
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,280
and the Peter Pans by your mother.

450
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,360
I was also kind of lectured about Midge and Skipper.

451
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,360
And I do believe PJ was in the mix early on

452
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,320
because I think my mom had some old Barbies.

453
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,760
Can you say lecture to be like,

454
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,400
this is something you, my son in the 90s,

455
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,240
need to know about.

456
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,880
I needed to know about Mary Martin and Sandy Duncan

457
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,120
and all the great Peter Pans.

458
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,960
My mom said the words Mary Martin last week too.

459
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,400
I forget what context it was.

460
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,720
But she said, Mary Martin.

461
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,120
And she was talking about something from the 70s.

462
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,880
So, but I was, yeah.

463
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,040
She must be proud that we're proud.

464
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,440
We might be the podcast where Mary Martin

465
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,560
comes up the most.

466
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,440
Yeah, if she paid attention to this show

467
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,280
when she's listening to it,

468
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,960
she would definitely be proud of that.

469
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,360
She wasn't distracted by the swears.

470
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,960
Or distracted by the way my voice sounds.

471
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,760
How I enunciate is sort of what she's focused on

472
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,400
versus the quality of the show

473
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,200
or funny or informative.

474
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,840
But ever since the Martin cast went on hiatus,

475
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,760
she's happier carrying the torch.

476
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,160
The Martin from the?

477
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,760
The Mary Martin podcast.

478
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,080
I thought you meant Martin the sitcom from the 90s.

479
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:55,920
Oh no.

480
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,360
I mean, they're probably one of those.

481
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,440
Someone's probably going episode by episode through Martin.

482
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,400
So, yeah.

483
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,200
So I heard these names

484
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,520
and I can't remember which dolls my mom had

485
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,640
or still has maybe.

486
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,000
But I knew the basic characters because of that.

487
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,840
I see.

488
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,160
Okay.

489
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,280
But I guess, I mean, we're finding that maybe

490
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,280
that there's not as much stock as they think.

491
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,520
And everybody's gonna be there.

492
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,360
Brad.

493
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,200
Yeah.

494
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,280
Oh no, Brad.

495
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,360
Brad feels like newer.

496
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,160
I can go back to the list and see when Brad was introduced.

497
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,800
Because I like.

498
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,760
So, yeah.

499
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,480
All the side characters.

500
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,960
Barbie and Ken, yeah, were,

501
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,800
obviously they had the staying power.

502
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,880
But I feel like they didn't,

503
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,360
other characters maybe didn't ever resonate.

504
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,720
Just in doll form, I guess, really.

505
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,360
I feel like the vehicles in the house,

506
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,320
like the dream house is so much more iconic than poor Midge.

507
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,520
Well, yeah, that's true.

508
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,560
Well, it's all, I mean, I feel like it's places and clothes.

509
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,040
That's what you want in a Barbie experience.

510
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,720
And I've said this before on the show.

511
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,800
I liked the Barbie vehicles, but it was pink

512
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,080
and I was told that was not for boys.

513
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,360
So I would lie and say my sister wanted it.

514
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,240
My sister was one.

515
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,720
And I would circle stuff in the catalog,

516
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,760
like the Barbie camper,

517
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,880
because I was obsessed with the idea

518
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,920
of driving your house.

519
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,320
And I would say to my mom,

520
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,000
well, Katie wants the Barbie camper.

521
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
My mom, like I thought I was pulling a fast one at age four

522
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,200
because I knew that this was for girls.

523
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,040
So why would-

524
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,880
It's so beautiful.

525
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,280
Yeah, so we didn't get it.

526
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,240
We had to resort to it.

527
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,080
I didn't get it.

528
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,280
Kids of that era.

529
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,120
But guess what?

530
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,920
Now you're a grownup with autonomy.

531
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,800
I hope that after this record, you go pick one up

532
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,640
for yourself.

533
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,760
I don't have the room because all the boy toys I have

534
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,160
in my office are taking up too much space.

535
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,760
You have four boy toys that could sit in the car.

536
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,360
Oh yeah, you might clear up a space.

537
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,640
Well, Scalato, Donatello, Raphael, Scalantula.

538
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,800
Scale-wise, Barbie is a doll.

539
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,920
So I'm trying to think, do I have any?

540
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,240
The closest thing I have is my first contact,

541
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,280
Lieutenant Commander Data doll

542
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,440
that's standing on my desk right now.

543
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,600
So he probably could fit in the camper or the car.

544
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,480
Well, and I'm sure you guys all know this,

545
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,960
but canonically, Jordy LaForge and Vet Barbie

546
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,640
are a couple on account of my brother

547
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,320
headed Jordy LaForge and I had Barbie.

548
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,160
Oh wow, okay.

549
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,000
So they are.

550
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,960
That's a good relation to know.

551
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,520
It happened in your house, so it's canon.

552
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,160
Call so long, what you least expected.

553
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,480
Edit the Wikipedia real quick

554
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,600
to make sure that is reflected in there.

555
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,240
So you know what caught my eye?

556
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,160
I was at, I don't, when this comes out,

557
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,640
I don't remember if this thing will be done or not,

558
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:44,640
but currently Burbank has this Disneyland auction gallery.

559
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,680
And I went earlier today and just in the like,

560
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,560
store area, they had Disney fun Barbies,

561
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,880
which I imagine were, no price was listed.

562
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,920
So I was like, I bet this is insanely marked up.

563
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,520
But this is, I forget if this was part

564
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,240
of the same partnership or era, but they're pretty good.

565
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,200
I mean, I feel like, you know what, as I'm looking at it,

566
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,880
I think maybe my sister had one of these

567
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,000
because she's in mouse ears and then in a very like

568
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,920
Gloria Estefan, Paul Abdul kind of ensemble, which is great.

569
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:20,520
Like yellow that is so neon that it's almost green.

570
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,440
And then, but I think I had this,

571
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,520
I think I took the Mickey Mouse balloon from this set

572
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,440
because I was a theme park kid.

573
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,680
And if I just abscond with this from Disney fun Barbie,

574
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,880
will my sister notice?

575
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,040
Knowing her, she probably did.

576
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,240
Where's my balloon?

577
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,520
Have you ever gotten lost on doll YouTube

578
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,880
where people like kind of wash the makeup

579
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,200
off of like ugly Barbie dolls basically

580
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,600
and take their hair out and like replant better,

581
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,160
higher quality hair and do better paints on them?

582
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,520
That's a lot of YouTube channels.

583
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,520
I feel like a lot of them are like Soviet.

584
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,880
So I'm a K-pop fan.

585
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,440
It'll not come up again, I promise.

586
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,680
But we have the, you know, Mattel made some pretty awful

587
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,240
BTS Barbies six or seven years ago.

588
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,800
And so there's a lot of people making them be better,

589
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,480
like taking the existing molds and drawing them better,

590
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,320
putting them in them.

591
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,040
There are YouTube channels that I watch

592
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,640
that sound like what you've described for different things,

593
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,240
but now I will watch what you're talking about as well.

594
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,080
So yeah.

595
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,760
There's so many toy modification like channels.

596
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:31,160
Yes, there is a, I'm in a lot of toy Facebook groups

597
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,040
and you get, I'm in, we need to do another,

598
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,680
we did Cabbage Patch Doll episode

599
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,560
about the baby land general.

600
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,880
I'm in a Cabbage Patch Doll Facebook group

601
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,920
that is terrifying.

602
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,960
People are just offering up the scariest looking dolls

603
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,120
for like a lot of money or asking for help

604
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,960
about how to repair the dolls.

605
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,960
And the dolls, they're all haunted in some way.

606
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,040
But then there's other sites, or excuse me, other groups

607
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,800
that will, somebody will be like customizing figures,

608
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,680
which people do and some people are really good at it.

609
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,440
And there's this one guy, God bless him.

610
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,680
He is the shittiest figure customizer.

611
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,200
And he posts these things that look like

612
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,400
like a five-year-old did them.

613
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,640
And he goes, so how am I doing?

614
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,280
I'm just starting out and people,

615
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,240
some people are really nice.

616
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,560
And then there'll be one guy, looks like shit.

617
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,960
And you just thumbs up that comment.

618
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,800
Yeah, yeah.

619
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,880
I don't know.

620
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,400
Subtle suggestion that way.

621
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,400
But I love the idea of like, what's the car term

622
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,520
when you go back in? Modding.

623
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,520
Modding or something.

624
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,360
Yeah, like.

625
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,560
At one point in time it was pimping.

626
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,400
I don't know if it is a mold.

627
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,720
Pimping my Barbie, that sounds wrong.

628
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,560
That sounds like the wrong phrase.

629
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,880
Yeah, yeah, I don't like none of that.

630
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:45,960
I just discovered the dog grooming YouTube channel.

631
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,280
Like people cutting dogs and like dog groomers and stuff.

632
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,120
So it's like what you're saying.

633
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,200
And it's kind of like, I mean that

634
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,760
and then the slot machine influencers.

635
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,240
Like those are really addictive.

636
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,520
Jason loves slot machine influencers.

637
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,000
There are more and more slot,

638
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,680
like now there are some casinos in Vegas that have like,

639
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:07,080
and this part of the casino is the Brian Christopher slot.

640
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,800
Like the slot machine guy who lost $300,000 gambling.

641
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,880
And he writes it, he can write it off

642
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,880
because that's his job.

643
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,400
That's pretty good.

644
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,080
Sounds like, you should do that.

645
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,200
That's it.

646
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,200
If this was the beginning of that,

647
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,680
Jason then becomes one.

648
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,520
I mean, I can.

649
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,960
He loved them and then he became them.

650
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,200
Do you, oh sorry.

651
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,400
I can do what I haven't seen represented,

652
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,600
which is just people silently playing.

653
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,280
Because so often people are like, oh, come on,

654
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,240
almost got it.

655
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,480
Oh, that's a bonus.

656
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,680
Oh, I just needed one more.

657
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,080
Like they're narrating what's happening.

658
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,000
No, I just want to hear the effects and the music.

659
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,840
Oh, you don't want to hear the commentary.

660
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,680
Yeah.

661
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,840
What a pickiness.

662
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,640
I don't want to hear about you.

663
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,480
I want to hear the noises, the sound effects.

664
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,040
I want to hear the pleasing noises, like I'm there.

665
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,400
Well, there's gotta be a loop

666
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,040
that you can just fall asleep to of casino noises.

667
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:58,880
Oh, probably.

668
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,480
Casino ASMR, I'm sure.

669
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,320
Yeah.

670
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,160
That's good.

671
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,840
Oh yeah, like slowly like pulling the lever and stuff.

672
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,480
That's probably the code.

673
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,160
Yeah, casino ASMR is probably the thing to look for.

674
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,840
Putting the coin in slowly, hitting the button.

675
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,800
Jason's right asleep.

676
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,000
I also have the ASMR channel,

677
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,040
this is you describing the things there's no sound effects.

678
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,600
Yeah, that's calmer than what you're gonna.

679
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,440
There's a card.

680
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,960
Do you have any Barbie anything at the point,

681
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,920
like in a display or in an office or anything?

682
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,000
I have Jimin from BTS Barbie.

683
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,520
I have a Riverdale Barbie that was a Christmas present.

684
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,800
Do you remember a couple years back when they're like,

685
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,400
we're introducing a fat Barbie?

686
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,400
Do you remember this?

687
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,240
I don't.

688
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,080
So they were like, we have a problem with diversity.

689
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,000
So we're gonna introduce like short, tall, fat,

690
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,880
and maybe one other body type.

691
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,240
She's like a four.

692
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,600
She's like not a fat Barbie at all,

693
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,520
but I think someone was excited for me

694
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,840
that there would finally be some fat Barbie.

695
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,200
So she's somewhere in my home.

696
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,000
You would not see her and go, oh, fat Barbie.

697
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,400
You would go, that Barbie doesn't look like Barbie.

698
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,200
Slightly wider hips Barbie is what I'm seeing.

699
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,120
But it is Barbie.

700
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,200
It's not a different character.

701
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,680
It is the woman, it's Barbara.

702
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:18,200
Barbara Millicent was her middle name, I believe.

703
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,080
Millicent.

704
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:19,920
Oh, I don't know.

705
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,400
Sorry, this is the creator?

706
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,440
No, Barbie herself.

707
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,560
Barbara herself.

708
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,400
What?

709
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,360
Her name is Barbara Millicent Roberts.

710
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,200
I forget her last name.

711
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,640
I never heard to me that her name is Barbara.

712
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,480
Oh yeah.

713
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,240
Barbara Barbie Millicent Roberts.

714
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,840
Barbara Roberts, the doll.

715
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,640
Alan Sherwood.

716
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,800
Alan Sherwood.

717
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,800
The doll.

718
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:45,680
No, yes, your sister grew up playing Barbara and Alan toys.

719
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,280
Mommy, mommy, I want a Barbara Roberts toy.

720
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,680
Barbara Millicent Roberts.

721
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,680
All the Barbies obviously would keep the hair

722
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,160
the same color or the height.

723
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,080
It was just, they were just taking Barbie

724
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,920
and making different versions.

725
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,520
They're new characters seemingly from what I'm looking at.

726
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,640
But they are not named.

727
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,880
They are not given like, you know.

728
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,720
Oh really?

729
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,560
Well that's not good.

730
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,400
That's weird.

731
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,840
They just are all still Barbies.

732
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,040
Okay.

733
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,960
Names would probably be helpful.

734
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,120
A little humanizing perhaps.

735
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,840
Yeah, he has one humanizing.

736
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,520
An easy way to humanize.

737
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:24,520
Oh wait, yeah, wait, their names are petite, tall, curvy,

738
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,080
and original.

739
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,120
I am original.

740
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,640
They're like, that's crazy.

741
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,000
So interesting.

742
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,200
Wanna feel empowered?

743
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,040
Go buy the word that people might describe you by.

744
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,480
Use it as your name.

745
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,320
Okay.

746
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,680
Wow.

747
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,320
I have another question about your experience

748
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,520
with this tape.

749
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,280
And that like, I don't know in what year

750
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,800
you're actually watching it.

751
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,480
But so I'm curious if, you know,

752
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,560
this show ran for like a year and a half.

753
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,040
It wasn't the longest amount of time.

754
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,480
But were you either aware that maybe you could go

755
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,840
and see it or were you aware that it was in the past

756
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,240
and you missed your opportunity

757
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,920
and you couldn't live in the tape?

758
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,800
And is that upsetting?

759
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,040
Great question.

760
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,920
It definitely did not work as marketing.

761
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,360
If that was the job, it was just like,

762
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,120
oh, the tape that I'm gonna watch.

763
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,800
I come from a theme park family.

764
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,160
I have a theme park father

765
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:24,240
and specifically like a theme park show father.

766
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,080
And those aren't really for very young children.

767
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,840
So like, and especially the kind that my dad liked,

768
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,080
which is like David Bowie presents the,

769
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,200
or not David Bowie, but who's the,

770
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,200
I'm from Texas.

771
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,360
Who's the Bowie, the famous Bowie from Texas?

772
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,560
Oh, the Bowie Knife.

773
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,520
Yeah, exactly, that guy.

774
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,240
But it's like him telling you about

775
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,360
what happened at the Alamo.

776
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,560
Like that's sort of the kind of theme park show

777
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,400
that I was familiar with as a child.

778
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,040
And so I was like, yeah.

779
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:54,040
It did not, it did not do its job

780
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,880
making me wanna go to the theme park.

781
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,280
I have been to Epcot.

782
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,920
I went around the time that I had this tape.

783
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,440
My big memory was that the butter

784
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,640
was shaped like Mickey's head.

785
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,880
That was like what I remembered from Epcot.

786
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,720
So.

787
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,560
Oh, the little butter balls?

788
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,400
Yeah.

789
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,240
There were three of them?

790
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,080
It's for kids, yeah.

791
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,000
Oh, that's fun.

792
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,600
Did it occur to you like, is it here?

793
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,040
Did they still do, or were you,

794
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,000
or even like, I'm in the America area

795
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,800
where the show, the hallowed show happened?

796
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,760
Absolutely not.

797
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,040
I think in rewatching it,

798
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,160
well, I probably watched this special once a year or so.

799
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,600
Like it's one that I revisit a lot.

800
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,000
And watching it this last time as like,

801
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,160
a person who's more secure in my queerness

802
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,400
than I have been at various times,

803
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,480
I'm like, oh, this tape made me gay.

804
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,640
Like this obviously made me gay.

805
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,560
It's like beautiful, what would have at my time

806
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,240
been like adult women with like,

807
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,360
skin tight leggings and swimsuits

808
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,560
and very like ultra feminized features.

809
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,200
And then just like the ugliest men

810
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,040
you've ever seen in real life.

811
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:54,880
Yeah.

812
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,640
Just really awful looking guys.

813
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,560
Wearing like loose fitting shorts and baggy shirts

814
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,440
and like backwards baseball caps.

815
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,640
And I said, oh, okay, I get it.

816
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,360
Women pretty, guys, that's what they are.

817
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,200
Yeah, wow.

818
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,920
In a show that is meant to be the most glamorous man

819
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,400
and woman you could imagine.

820
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:15,120
And then the woman is a literal beauty pageant winner.

821
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,960
And then Ken is just,

822
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,080
Ken's just there.

823
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,040
And Alan, Jazzy, all of them.

824
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,760
I'm doing my thing today.

825
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,280
He's fine, he's fine,

826
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,360
but it's nothing to write home about.

827
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,200
Yeah.

828
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,240
And a lot of the women are doing very intense choreography.

829
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,080
Yes.

830
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,800
Like this is not phoned in like,

831
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:38,800
bounce jazz hands kind of like lazy theme park show.

832
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,920
This is like an intense show with like costume changes.

833
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,440
There's acro, there's like jumping

834
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,840
and flipping women over onto their shoulders and stuff.

835
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,280
Yeah, there's little, I don't know what to call it.

836
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,160
Little cars, little floats.

837
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,240
Multiple ones.

838
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,840
Little cars.

839
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,000
One aspect of Barbie's presence at Epcot

840
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,200
I wanted to mention was a big Barbie car.

841
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,600
There may have been a few.

842
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:06,000
I know that it's featured in this special.

843
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,440
It's what the hosts, Lisa and Stephanie, pull up in.

844
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,960
And I think that Barbie would get taken around in it too.

845
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,040
But they had a couple of bright pink vehicles.

846
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,680
One a little smaller and maybe open the top.

847
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,560
And then one, well I got a gigantic,

848
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,640
a really, really long limo.

849
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,040
Which I think was once Mickey's limo.

850
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,520
There was something called the limousine

851
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,040
that was used a lot around that time

852
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,600
and maybe went around the country too.

853
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,040
So I think they painted it pink.

854
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:33,880
But I think the other one, okay yes.

855
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,760
A 1970 Cadillac convertible that was used

856
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,320
to transport Barbie around Epcot

857
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:43,320
is now at the Volo Auto Museum in Volo, Illinois.

858
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,280
This is this car museum that we've talked about

859
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,600
near where Mike grew up that has,

860
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,280
so it has a lot of the like Chuck E. Cheese remnants.

861
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:58,280
And the like outcast strays of the animatronic world.

862
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,880
And I once again am bummed that you have no,

863
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,320
you're only, basically at some point,

864
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,320
Mike could have gone to visit his parents

865
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,560
and then gone to this.

866
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,200
And now his parents have moved.

867
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,440
So you would have to go only for,

868
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,080
which I do want you to do.

869
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:17,040
Well, maybe, did they have a performance space?

870
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,480
Could we do a live show from the Volo?

871
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,480
From the museum?

872
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,360
From the car.

873
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,160
Yeah, from the cars.

874
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,280
We drive the car around with mics?

875
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,600
Oh my God, to sit on, maybe not a seat,

876
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:32,040
but like sit on the top of the car

877
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,840
that Barbie had to carefully sit on

878
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,720
and not fall off of and do our show there.

879
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,560
That sounds great.

880
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,480
What's the black box theater situation at the Volo Museum?

881
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,840
What's the DIY venue?

882
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,560
I'm asking the same questions you are, sir.

883
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,280
We provide our own folding chairs.

884
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,160
Yeah.

885
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:50,120
We kicked off our live performance career

886
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,380
at a former sports authority

887
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,660
with a bunch of folding chairs.

888
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:56,620
So if they can do that, who knows what's

889
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,260
in the magical world of Volo?

890
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,020
Are the four little shavers there?

891
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:00,860
I think that's the garage.

892
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,700
Yeah, they are.

893
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,540
Yeah, other ones.

894
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,380
Yeah, yeah.

895
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,940
Those, they were original Chuck E. Cheese characters.

896
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:05,780
They were like a barbershop quartet.

897
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,260
Barbershop quartet, yeah.

898
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,140
So it's a multifaceted,

899
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,380
I think they would sometimes drive Barbie around

900
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:15,300
and you could meet Barbie in Barbie's car

901
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,740
that was refurbed from Mickey owning it.

902
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,220
Bunch of liquor stains.

903
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,980
You're gonna have to buy the lease.

904
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:27,340
I don't know how it works.

905
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,580
I'm gonna hardball.

906
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:33,420
But the main thing obviously is the show,

907
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,220
which is previewed a little bit

908
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:38,820
in the 1993 Disney Christmas Parade special,

909
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,900
which is the same one where they previewed

910
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:45,620
Epcot's Splashtacular, which we did an episode about.

911
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,780
That was just released on the main feed.

912
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:52,420
This insane show with the big robot dinosaurs

913
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,780
that came out of Planters

914
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:56,540
and Mickey had a gun called the Exterminator

915
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:59,380
that he would murder robot dinosaurs with.

916
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,820
And he has guards.

917
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,300
For Christmas.

918
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,620
Yeah, yeah, well, yes.

919
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,460
It was around.

920
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,380
I mean, it was mainly featured during the summer,

921
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,580
but they had to stop, like Santa's coming up,

922
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,980
but first, murderous Mickey.

923
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,540
Don't get too close, Santa.

924
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,620
Maybe hover around the Orlando area.

925
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,380
Maybe stay up above it.

926
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:21,780
It's very Mickey by way of Power Rangers or Common Rider.

927
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:26,780
There's like Starlight Express kind of metal guards.

928
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,140
What a time.

929
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:31,940
At the same special, Epcot's gonna have Splashtacular,

930
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:35,140
most bonkers show they ever did, and the Barbie show.

931
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,380
What, it's Epcot 94 peak.

932
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,420
We should just do an entire,

933
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:41,740
figure out what the hell else is going on at Epcot 94.

934
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,180
But of course, okay, so the show,

935
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,020
and we'll talk about the show

936
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,060
because it factors into the tape,

937
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:48,820
but the tape is the main thing and the main way

938
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:52,140
we remember it, which has a bunch of other facets to it too.

939
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,580
You can watch this on YouTube.

940
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:56,100
The user Rare Disney Treasures.

941
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:59,300
The tape could be achieved for one cent,

942
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,740
along with certain Barbies, Camp Barbie,

943
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:05,660
Happy Birthday Barbie, Glitter Hair Barbie,

944
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,300
which they show at the end of the tape.

945
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,860
It is most of the Barbies from the very end of the tape.

946
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,620
Are these at all of, oh, it is Bedtime Barbie.

947
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,580
Yes, they show them all.

948
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,820
Yeah, yeah, oh, right.

949
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:17,500
Glitter Hair Barbie seems like a disaster.

950
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,460
Oh yeah.

951
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,260
I believe my cousin had Glitter Hair Barbie

952
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,440
because I can smell it.

953
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,020
When I look at it, I can smell

954
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:25,420
that plastic glitter smell of it.

955
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:28,300
Was it, was now, did her hair just have a glitter effect

956
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,620
or was there actually loose glitter?

957
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:32,220
It's not loose, it's like a tube of goop,

958
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,920
of glitter goo with a little comb attached to the end

959
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,300
that you could brush so beautifully.

960
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,140
Yeah, it would work really well.

961
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,580
It works great, yeah.

962
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,420
And into your own hair, probably.

963
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,980
Yeah, I was gonna say, it would work, yeah, yeah.

964
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,500
I would imagine.

965
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,340
Locket Surprise Barbie, Bedtime Barbie,

966
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,140
and those are all plugged at the end.

967
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,900
It would be funny if you tried to do it on human hair

968
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,420
and it just dissolved.

969
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,900
Not ready for human hair.

970
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,340
Like highly alkaline or something.

971
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:57,340
Just turns into a gas and swirls away.

972
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,700
Turns your hair white, maybe.

973
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,940
Yeah.

974
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:04,940
The opening of the video, I mean, this thing comes in hot.

975
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,660
It comes in real high.

976
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,060
Wait, I forget, is there any appearance

977
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,020
of like stop motion Barbie at the beginning?

978
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:13,300
Or is that, you know, you wait to the end for that, right?

979
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:14,940
At the end for that, yes.

980
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:15,760
Okay.

981
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,600
She says goodbye to you, yeah.

982
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,060
Okay, yes, yeah, yeah.

983
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:21,060
Hosting a show called Barbie Today.

984
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,980
Hosting a morning show.

985
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,820
But it kicks off with this

986
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:29,700
and let me just do a little blast of this music.

987
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,460
["Barbie Today"]

988
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,220
["Barbie Today"]

989
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:44,780
That piece of music plays in a half hour video

990
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,820
approximately 400 times.

991
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,140
Yeah.

992
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,500
It's really great.

993
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,900
It does keep the energy up.

994
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,940
I was making me think a typical podcast,

995
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,660
the ride episode, we just sort of talk

996
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,420
and we move from topic to topic,

997
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:01,180
but I almost wanna try this as like if we're shifting topic,

998
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,260
it's like, well now, we're like,

999
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:06,020
okay, now let's talk about when Barbie stops

1000
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:09,220
by all the nations in World Showcase.

1001
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,980
["Barbie Today"]

1002
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:18,540
Call for the transition music, please, if you want,

1003
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:21,460
or if you're feeling like kind of low on dopamine.

1004
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,300
Okay, yeah.

1005
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,820
In the special, it's really only interrupted

1006
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:28,820
for kind of stereotypical ethnic stock music

1007
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,460
to represent the various locations.

1008
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:34,660
Like just if you typed Japanese music

1009
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,460
into a sound effect library,

1010
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,300
and it'd be like, okay, this is music.

1011
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,940
The very first.

1012
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,780
Yes.

1013
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:44,180
Yeah, there's a lot of, there's one,

1014
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:46,660
I think when they go to the China Pavilion,

1015
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:49,780
there's a man doing beautiful calligraphy.

1016
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:50,620
Yeah.

1017
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,540
And it's like, could you make it say

1018
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,580
happy birthday, Barbie, double happiness.

1019
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,180
Double happiness.

1020
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:59,580
On like a Hanes white t-shirt with the cardboard showing,

1021
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,700
like the tape to cardboard,

1022
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,620
and it's a size three X t-shirt for Barbie.

1023
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,980
I don't know, she's gonna sleep in it or something.

1024
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,300
She can cut other shirts out of it.

1025
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,540
As my mother would often say when we were growing up,

1026
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,460
it's like, oh, you can get it,

1027
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,940
you can wear it around the house.

1028
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:14,780
Like that.

1029
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:15,860
Exactly.

1030
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:19,220
We still do, Erin and I both get big old shirts.

1031
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:21,020
I'm addicted to buying,

1032
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:23,900
Jayden got me on buying vintage shirts.

1033
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,420
I think I have a Tower of Terror one

1034
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:27,620
and a Venom one coming.

1035
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:28,660
How big are they?

1036
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,620
Like XL.

1037
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,460
Okay.

1038
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:32,940
Yeah, X or double XL, something like that.

1039
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:33,780
Yeah.

1040
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,620
They're comfier.

1041
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:38,660
But so that music, which is banging,

1042
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:41,660
then in this case underscores,

1043
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:42,500
we're getting our Epcot,

1044
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,940
we're getting our flyovers of Spaceship Earth

1045
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,140
and all the shots that I've seen so many times

1046
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,820
because they're in every single thing.

1047
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,500
All of the many, many videos

1048
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,020
Disney produced around this time.

1049
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:56,100
But then we get to our pink limousine

1050
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:59,140
and we're like jump cutting through its arrival

1051
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:02,860
and we meet our hosts, Lisa and Stephanie.

1052
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:07,860
And here is a taste of their vibe.

1053
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,460
Hi everybody, I'm Stephanie.

1054
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,540
And I'm Lisa.

1055
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,940
Are you ready to party with Barbie?

1056
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,740
Party, party, party.

1057
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,260
This is not just any party,

1058
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,620
this is a birthday party for Barbie.

1059
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,260
Barbie decided the best,

1060
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,220
because her birthday celebration

1061
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:25,100
was right here at Walt Disney World Epcot.

1062
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,740
And best of all, we're going to watch a sneak preview

1063
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,940
of an incredible new show,

1064
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:32,580
the magical world of Barbie.

1065
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:33,420
Love them.

1066
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,260
Love them.

1067
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,420
Queens, incredible.

1068
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,340
I like to think that they gave really beautiful,

1069
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:40,420
nuanced auditions and performances.

1070
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,900
And then on the day the director was just like, more.

1071
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,300
Give me more.

1072
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:47,420
Scream the lines, blow out the microphones.

1073
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:48,540
I can not hear you.

1074
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:51,020
You're outside, project.

1075
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:51,860
We were talking about this

1076
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:54,140
with Jonathan Taylor Thomas recently,

1077
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:58,300
where I was like, I miss a level of kid performance

1078
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,140
where like obviously those kids

1079
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:03,020
are comfortable delivering lines,

1080
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,940
but they still sound like kids

1081
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,260
versus like Disney Channel kids now

1082
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,900
who have to be like very non-C, very well.

1083
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,300
They have to be able to really know dynamics

1084
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,180
as far as, they're too polished.

1085
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:16,380
I miss the days of a screaming child.

1086
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:19,260
I love specifically Stephanie's,

1087
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:21,660
like she kind of misses a few.

1088
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:22,500
Yes.

1089
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,820
I'm so hungry.

1090
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,820
I started to be, I started to love it.

1091
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:26,660
Barbie's a good girl.

1092
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:28,060
She's a good girl.

1093
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,980
I love those, God.

1094
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:33,460
And just like, boy, what a wall of screams.

1095
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,260
It's just, oh boy.

1096
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,580
That was exciting when you were a kid

1097
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:39,340
and you saw other kids screaming about something.

1098
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:42,340
Also, they get out of this beautiful limo

1099
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,860
and then one of them,

1100
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:44,940
I forget if it's Stephanie or Lisa,

1101
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:48,700
is wearing like a denim vest with like rickrack

1102
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:51,620
that like zigzaggy, like cheapo.

1103
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:54,620
Like their outfits are cheap and ugly

1104
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,820
for Barbie's big birthday.

1105
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:59,860
They are not having them in sparkly pink outfits.

1106
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,180
Like they can't overshadow.

1107
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:02,780
Can't overshadow, yeah, yeah.

1108
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,100
I do like them as kind of,

1109
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,460
it feels like arts and crafts that they made.

1110
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:08,740
It's like they made their clothes in school.

1111
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:09,580
Yeah, big time.

1112
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:10,900
I mean, I love the general,

1113
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:14,020
it's vests both, one denim and the other

1114
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:16,380
is like a quilt vest.

1115
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,300
And then she, and that,

1116
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:20,940
the quilt vest is over a pink shirt,

1117
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,220
which is over a yellow shirt.

1118
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:24,740
So we have so much going on.

1119
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:27,140
And in the hair, like they have,

1120
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:30,100
they each have five hairstyles going on

1121
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,900
in different sectors of the head

1122
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,180
and then a big scrunchie too.

1123
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:35,260
I do love it.

1124
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,100
It's big in my heart.

1125
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:39,140
Does it beat blossoms, is like blossoms vest better?

1126
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:41,380
I'm trying to remember what blossoms vest looks like.

1127
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:44,020
I don't know what the general veneer of blossoms vest.

1128
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:45,180
I'm not sure.

1129
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:49,100
Blossoms was kind of a lot wardrobe wise.

1130
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:49,940
Yeah.

1131
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:52,500
That's a costume designer ensemble.

1132
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,660
Like these look a little more janky,

1133
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:55,500
a little more true.

1134
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,340
Yeah, of course, of course.

1135
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:57,180
They brought options.

1136
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,020
They were not provided with wardrobe.

1137
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:01,540
It was sort of, is it,

1138
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:02,940
what was Clarissa's wardrobe?

1139
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:06,140
Clarissa's wardrobe was pretty crazy.

1140
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:06,980
Yeah, blossoms.

1141
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,420
Blossoms have fun hats.

1142
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:10,940
Yeah, blossom, but I think it was more of a simpler

1143
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,060
kind of a vest situation.

1144
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:16,020
But the clothes themselves were a little more understated.

1145
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,020
Clarissa, I feel the, yeah, look,

1146
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:20,900
she's wearing like five different vibes.

1147
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,820
Yeah, that's much closer.

1148
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:23,660
Which I liked, that was the room too.

1149
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:26,780
She was the coolest kid on TV.

1150
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:28,660
Yeah, the neighbor.

1151
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:30,940
Allison, Alex Mack?

1152
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:32,780
You thought she was cooler than Alex Mack?

1153
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:34,100
Alex Mack came along later.

1154
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,220
I think Clarissa had been-

1155
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:36,540
I like Alex Mack too, absolutely.

1156
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:37,380
Yeah, I liked Alex Mack too.

1157
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:38,300
Clarissa was cooler,

1158
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,940
but you might be talking to some older men here.

1159
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:41,780
I think that might be part of it.

1160
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:42,940
What was the hang on?

1161
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:45,340
I don't think that applies here.

1162
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:47,820
No, Alex Mack clothing wise is a little more like

1163
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:50,140
big flannel, big backwards cap.

1164
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:50,980
Yeah, she was cool.

1165
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:51,900
I'm not saying she wasn't cool.

1166
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,380
I liked the, yeah, yeah,

1167
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:55,860
maybe not as like stylistically old

1168
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,540
is what I'm remembering.

1169
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:00,660
But I'd have to look at all the,

1170
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:02,500
I'd have to see all the wardrobe cap.

1171
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,700
They were all cooler than me, that's for sure.

1172
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:07,100
I admire their coolness. No doubt about that.

1173
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:10,620
And her power, her struggle with her powers.

1174
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:13,020
I don't think I would have handled having powers

1175
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,260
as well as she did.

1176
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:17,140
I would like to personally commend Alex Mack

1177
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:19,620
on her handling of her powers.

1178
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:23,060
Despite she had the chemical plant after her too.

1179
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:25,580
So she's handling the pressure that comes from the powers too.

1180
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:27,700
Alex Mack was just a T1000, right?

1181
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:30,980
Well, and Blossom's brother was struggling with addiction.

1182
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:33,060
So she also had challenges.

1183
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:33,900
Yeah, that's true too.

1184
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,020
And that's just as hard.

1185
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:35,860
Wow.

1186
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:38,060
And Clarissa always had a drifter

1187
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:39,700
putting a ladder up to her window.

1188
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:40,540
That's right.

1189
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:42,500
So they all had their problems.

1190
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,740
That I love their love.

1191
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:45,860
I thought that was cool.

1192
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:48,460
Like, oh, look, they're both kind of weird.

1193
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:49,300
That's fun.

1194
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:50,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1195
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:52,380
No, I loved, as Clarissa,

1196
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,860
as the word Clarissa never been said on this show.

1197
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,580
I don't think we've ever talked about Clarissa

1198
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:57,780
and we've been doing this for six years.

1199
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:59,340
Years after the fact.

1200
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:01,580
Yeah, I agree with you that Jason,

1201
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:03,340
I was like, I'm not nearly as cool as her,

1202
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:07,100
nor will I ever meet a girl as cool as her.

1203
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,860
I set my standards.

1204
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:11,220
How did you feel about Sabrina then?

1205
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:12,900
Did it transfer over?

1206
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:14,740
Yeah.

1207
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:16,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1208
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,740
I was gonna say, I don't think it did.

1209
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:19,580
Yeah, yeah, I don't know.

1210
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:20,420
Really?

1211
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:21,460
I don't know, was Sabrina cool?

1212
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:22,300
I don't know if Sabrina was cool.

1213
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,140
Sabrina wasn't not cool.

1214
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:25,580
Sabrina hung out with Britney Spears though,

1215
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:26,420
which is cool.

1216
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:27,260
Yeah, that is cool.

1217
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:28,260
I didn't watch Sabrina,

1218
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:29,100
I didn't watch the show very much.

1219
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:30,380
She has magic powers.

1220
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:31,460
And you don't think she's cool?

1221
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:32,300
But she didn't have the vibe.

1222
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:34,020
What's the different category of cool?

1223
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:35,740
We're talking about the more worldly cool,

1224
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:37,060
like do you dress cool?

1225
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:39,020
Well, of course powers are cool.

1226
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:39,860
I like Sabrina.

1227
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:41,260
But we were just saying Alex Mack is cool,

1228
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:43,260
that's what power is.

1229
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:44,620
I'm almost like branching,

1230
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:45,780
this is so insane to do.

1231
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:47,740
I'm almost branching different connections,

1232
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:50,060
different definitions of cool.

1233
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:52,500
Of course power, what's cooler than powers?

1234
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,580
Yeah, what's the X axis and the Y axis

1235
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:56,980
of like having power, real world cool,

1236
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,660
where do they all land?

1237
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:02,260
The cool, the nexus of that is cool clothes and cool power.

1238
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,060
If you have all of it, you got everything.

1239
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:08,940
I like Sabrina, but I loved Caroline Ray and Salem

1240
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:10,100
because they were funny.

1241
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:11,420
What about Anna Hilda?

1242
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:13,100
Just Zelda?

1243
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:16,500
Beth Broderick, that's her name, Beth Broderick.

1244
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,620
The other aunt was very funny too.

1245
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:20,180
I think I like the supporting cast more.

1246
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:21,020
But you're not talking about cool now,

1247
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:22,700
you're just saying you enjoyed.

1248
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,020
Or you're saying you like the supporting cast more,

1249
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:26,540
which I think proves that it didn't fully transfer

1250
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:28,340
the coolness as far as close to Sabrina.

1251
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:29,580
She had pretty good timing.

1252
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,180
Oh, you're saying because same actress.

1253
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:33,020
Yeah, that's what we're talking about.

1254
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:34,340
Okay, all right, I see.

1255
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:38,620
I was focused on the fictional persona,

1256
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:39,460
I was just like, well.

1257
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:42,500
And then you so definitively said, yes, it did transfer.

1258
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,580
Well, I think it turns a vibe.

1259
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:47,260
I think the vibe transferred.

1260
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:49,460
This is Jason's learning about actors today.

1261
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:53,380
I totally forgot, I was just as a kid

1262
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:55,180
and I just was so into the show,

1263
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:57,420
I just bought the reality so hard.

1264
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:58,780
That is Sabrina.

1265
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:00,700
I think Clarissa might be the coolest.

1266
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,660
I'm really trying to figure this out

1267
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:05,180
as there was a cooler girl on TV.

1268
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:07,900
Punky, Punky's too young.

1269
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:09,180
Punky's not a part of this.

1270
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,820
Yeah, I didn't watch that.

1271
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:13,700
Maybe it's syndication, but I don't know if Punky's cool.

1272
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:15,100
You haven't seen the one where she learns

1273
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,580
about how you should say no to drugs.

1274
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:18,260
Because that was pretty cool of her to stand up

1275
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:20,060
to the popular kids and say no to drugs.

1276
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:21,340
Yeah, you're right.

1277
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:23,540
The coolest thing at the end of the day,

1278
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:26,700
if I learned anything from NBC president Brandon Tartakov,

1279
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:28,340
saying no to drugs.

1280
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:32,380
Was there an Alex Mack gag early on

1281
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:34,260
where she transforms into a puddle

1282
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:37,620
and then she re-transformed into a human

1283
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:40,220
but is naked behind barrels?

1284
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:41,820
She didn't know how to transform into clothes.

1285
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:45,460
I think that was probably a pivotal coming of age moment.

1286
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:47,980
I certainly don't know what you're talking about

1287
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:51,780
and that didn't also occur to me as a major moment.

1288
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:55,140
I wanted that episode to be back on.

1289
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:56,700
Oh my gosh.

1290
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,660
Keep in mind, this is the most innocent,

1291
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:04,100
this is the most covered from below shoulders situation

1292
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:04,940
you've ever seen.

1293
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:06,580
We were young.

1294
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:07,820
I'm a year older than you guys,

1295
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:11,140
so I don't remember the thing they're talking about, actually.

1296
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:12,700
So I think I just didn't watch it as much.

1297
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,860
You should think that Sabrina is cool

1298
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:18,660
because the Sabrina soundtrack has your favorite songs,

1299
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:21,620
the Sugar Ray, no, who does the cover of Abra Cadabra?

1300
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:22,460
Sugar Ray.

1301
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:23,300
It is Sugar Ray.

1302
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:24,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1303
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:26,420
It was a band, 10,000 Maniacs?

1304
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:27,260
Is that what they're called?

1305
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:28,100
That's a band, yeah.

1306
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:29,740
Do you remember the episode of Sabrina

1307
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:30,580
with 10,000 Maniacs?

1308
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:31,420
I don't.

1309
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:34,220
10,000 Maniacs was in it?

1310
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:36,660
It's Halloween, obviously a huge day for Sabrina

1311
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:38,140
but all the popular kids are going

1312
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:39,740
to the popular girls party

1313
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:41,900
and so Sabrina does some magic to get people

1314
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:43,820
to come to her party.

1315
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:46,700
Meanwhile, the aunts have bought new furniture

1316
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:48,780
for the house and it's talking furniture

1317
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:49,620
and they didn't know.

1318
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:52,300
And so the furniture's can't stop talking.

1319
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:54,420
So Sabrina's trying to have this cool party

1320
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:55,820
but the furniture can't stop talking.

1321
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:57,060
You know who will fix this?

1322
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,580
10,000 Maniacs.

1323
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:02,140
So she zaps them in to perform for the party.

1324
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:03,660
I gotta catch up on Sabrina.

1325
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:04,500
Yeah.

1326
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:07,060
Is that an, I mean, covering all of Sabrina

1327
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:10,580
is very daunting but musical cameos.

1328
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:11,580
Yeah, please come back.

1329
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:13,820
We'll schedule your next one right here and now.

1330
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:15,220
Animal Kingdom episode.

1331
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:16,540
There was an Animal Kingdom tie in.

1332
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:18,260
Yes, Sabrina wins Disney World.

1333
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:20,260
You're correct, it is on topic.

1334
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:22,340
They did get musical acts in it

1335
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:25,580
because wasn't Britney there in a magic way?

1336
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:27,100
Did NSYNC show up?

1337
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:27,940
I don't know.

1338
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:29,260
They had a lot of musicians, I feel.

1339
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:30,700
I didn't even know what this 10,000 Maniacs was.

1340
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:34,300
RuPaul, RuPaul is like the judge in the other realm.

1341
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:35,140
Yeah.

1342
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:35,980
Wow, okay.

1343
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:37,980
Was Brian Setzer ever on?

1344
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:38,860
If so, I'm out.

1345
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:39,980
Episode canceled.

1346
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:42,140
No more of that.

1347
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:47,900
Okay, so Lisa and Stephanie tell us a lot

1348
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:49,740
very quickly and very loudly

1349
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:51,940
but if you go back and re-listen a couple times

1350
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:56,700
and just try to maybe slow it down, do it at .5%,

1351
00:50:56,700 --> 00:51:01,420
then you know that Barbie's going on a world tour

1352
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:04,140
which is that world showcase at all the different nations

1353
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:06,820
and this point Lisa and Stephanie split up

1354
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:08,460
and Stephanie is gonna go cover

1355
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:09,940
all the world showcase stuff.

1356
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:12,580
She's gonna see what, find some gifts for Barbie

1357
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:14,860
around the world and Lisa's gonna focus

1358
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:17,140
on the behind the scenes of the stage show

1359
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:19,380
and you might think, well, they're screwed.

1360
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:21,140
They're never gonna find each other again.

1361
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:22,780
No, they thought of this.

1362
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:25,180
They have bright pink cell phones.

1363
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:26,300
Got your Barbie cell phone?

1364
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:27,380
Check.

1365
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:31,300
They like suit up kind of sequence and then.

1366
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:32,900
And Stephanie has a camcorder

1367
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:36,940
and Lisa does not wanna be recorded by that camcorder

1368
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:38,940
even though they are being televised.

1369
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:41,180
There are multiple cameras on them

1370
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:42,340
in a professional capacity.

1371
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:45,100
She's talking to a bigger, more intimidating camera

1372
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:48,060
but maybe the more intimate one makes her uncomfortable.

1373
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:50,780
Very strange.

1374
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:53,460
Well, I guess with that, let's talk about some of the scenes

1375
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:55,700
where Lisa goes behind the scenes at the show.

1376
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,220
Hi everybody, I'm Stephanie.

1377
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:58,060
Oh, wrong one.

1378
00:51:58,060 --> 00:51:58,880
I didn't do the instrumental.

1379
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,900
Okay, look, I'm gonna get this down to a science, I will.

1380
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:05,340
Okay, well, I'll get my clips together.

1381
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:09,660
So Lisa says, I can't think of anything more exciting

1382
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:12,620
than a large musical stage show starring Barbie

1383
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:14,340
and she has me there.

1384
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,980
Absolutely and then she gets to go talk

1385
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:20,620
to the art director of the show, Rhonda Counts.

1386
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:21,460
Incredible name.

1387
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:22,300
Really good name.

1388
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:23,660
Yeah, yeah.

1389
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:25,340
I mean, I don't remember anything in particular about that

1390
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:28,980
other than that you work at Disney, you're an Imagineer.

1391
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:31,020
You work at Disney World and on top of that

1392
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:32,700
you get to do a Barbie thing.

1393
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:35,540
You get to design, both of these costume designers

1394
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:37,620
because the costumes are stellar.

1395
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:40,460
I think they completely, of course everybody's freaking out

1396
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:43,820
about any shots you're seeing of the Greta Gerwig

1397
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:46,460
but it's not the excitement that they are tapping

1398
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:49,580
into this early 90s thing in such a big bold way.

1399
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:53,340
They're doing it straight to the source.

1400
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:56,980
This wardrobe is, they really nail it.

1401
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:03,180
They don't have the most production value maybe,

1402
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,180
they don't have the biggest budget

1403
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:07,100
in terms of giant stage pieces

1404
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,640
but there is just a really good kind of flat

1405
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:13,620
with a couple of pillars and a couple of spheres on top

1406
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:15,980
in pastel colors and that's all I need.

1407
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:19,260
I love them and Jason's little cars that he mentioned.

1408
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:20,580
Very little, there's like a coach

1409
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:21,980
that turns into something else.

1410
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:24,820
I love those little, Barbie's entrance in the little,

1411
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:29,100
like Ken kind of peels out a little in the little car.

1412
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:32,780
Yeah, I would say, this might land more

1413
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:36,500
in the full video of the show.

1414
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,380
Oh, okay, yeah, yeah.

1415
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:41,200
Because I only saw the cut down in the VHS.

1416
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:45,700
But what, all right, so we see some behind the scenes stuff.

1417
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,860
Then we get some like regional flavor.

1418
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:53,020
We get pinatas in Mexico and origami in Japan.

1419
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:57,000
Stephanie says that the origami is really beautiful

1420
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,240
just like Barbie.

1421
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,440
Oh, and then there's a part where she's showing

1422
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,920
the like mobile that she has made of origami

1423
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:10,360
and she goes, it even has a colorful ball at the end.

1424
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,280
The most exciting thing is that there's a colorful ball.

1425
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,120
Like Epcot.

1426
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,320
It's very, it's a pink, gray ball.

1427
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:20,160
It's colorful.

1428
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,760
It's the Geodesic Dome, do you get it?

1429
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,560
There's impressive balls everywhere here.

1430
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:30,080
This is another great clip where then Lisa

1431
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:33,640
goes to get her hair done backstage

1432
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:37,840
or she's like checking out how Barbie's hair gets done

1433
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:41,520
and then the hair person makes her the offer of a lifetime.

1434
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,320
Wouldn't it be fun to have someone fix your hair

1435
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:45,640
all the time?

1436
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,120
I heard what you were saying.

1437
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,920
I wanted the hairstylist for the Barbie show.

1438
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:50,760
I have some free time now.

1439
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,200
Would you like me to fix your hair?

1440
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,520
Wow, how cool.

1441
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,200
Could you really do that?

1442
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,000
Sure, let's look at it.

1443
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,760
I have a fun idea.

1444
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,320
This is too cool.

1445
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:05,040
Stephanie will be so surprised.

1446
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,660
While I get my hair done,

1447
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:09,180
let's see some of Barbie's new looks for a show.

1448
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:13,300
I'm curious if any of you remembered

1449
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:15,900
the difference in her hair before and after

1450
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:17,100
she got her hair done.

1451
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:19,660
No, that's exactly what I said.

1452
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:22,380
There was a big reveal and I didn't know

1453
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:23,860
what was different about it.

1454
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:25,700
Slightly curly.

1455
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:26,540
Yeah, okay.

1456
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:28,260
Because you're expecting like a beehive or something.

1457
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:29,740
Yeah, yeah.

1458
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:30,900
Colors or something.

1459
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,580
Yeah, glitter in her hair.

1460
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:36,620
No, yeah, so mild makeover,

1461
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:39,180
but then the excitement doesn't stop

1462
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:40,420
because then Stephanie's calling

1463
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:41,900
because there's a surprise

1464
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:43,500
and you gotta get over here.

1465
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,020
Okay, what's the surprise?

1466
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:46,900
I got here as fast as I could.

1467
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:51,540
And then this is where Lisa and Stephanie's interests

1468
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:53,060
dovetail with Jason's interests

1469
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:57,260
because they realize they get to go on a boat.

1470
00:55:57,260 --> 00:56:01,220
They go on an Epcot boat, the friendship boats.

1471
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:03,140
And I was watching this like,

1472
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:04,940
this is I think is as excited as Jason

1473
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:06,820
would have been then or now.

1474
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:10,660
Yeah, for the boat, the friendship boats,

1475
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:12,580
not the one that goes to the hotels

1476
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:13,700
and has lots of stuff,

1477
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:16,020
the one in Epcot that just goes pretty much

1478
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:18,740
in a straight line across the water.

1479
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:20,780
They also include the audio of them being like,

1480
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:22,500
we gotta get on that boat,

1481
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:25,540
but the boat's gonna leave in like 30 seconds.

1482
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:27,300
I'm like, stop, don't leave without us,

1483
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,140
we gotta get on that boat.

1484
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:30,500
There's no one in line.

1485
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:31,580
There's a couple.

1486
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:34,500
There's never anyone in line for that.

1487
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,500
It takes longer to get to the other side

1488
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,700
if you go on the boat than it does to walk.

1489
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:42,940
Wait, Jason, could you say another,

1490
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:46,180
a fact or something about those boats,

1491
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:49,340
but really any boat that you like,

1492
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:52,060
and then say, but just like really high energy

1493
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:53,940
and then end it with let's go.

1494
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:56,500
Whatever you say, just end it with let's go.

1495
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:58,780
Can I say the actual fact I said

1496
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:00,220
that Jane and I were watching this

1497
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:02,500
and she is literally falling asleep

1498
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,820
and I just real excitedly went,

1499
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:08,140
did you know you can fish in Epcot on that body?

1500
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:11,020
What if you can schedule it and get there?

1501
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:12,940
It's before the park opens.

1502
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:13,780
Let's go.

1503
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:16,800
Ketch and release.

1504
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:23,940
There's lots of places you can fish

1505
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,660
around Walt Disney World.

1506
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:28,180
Wow, Jason, I was so excited that I got to see

1507
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:30,060
all the incredible spots where you could fish

1508
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:31,740
and hear it at Epcot Center.

1509
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:32,560
Yeah.

1510
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:36,220
That's what we should do when we do a redo port of entry.

1511
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:37,980
That's how we should do it the format.

1512
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:41,020
Jason just shouts stuff about port of entry.

1513
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:42,860
At island of adventure.

1514
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:43,700
Wow, let's go.

1515
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:48,060
Wow, a Cinnabon, you can get a sweet roll

1516
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:49,620
with a bunch of goo on top.

1517
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:50,860
Let's go.

1518
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:52,140
I'm gonna put it on the end of a hook

1519
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:54,160
and try to catch any number,

1520
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:57,940
catch any number of bottom feeders in this water,

1521
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:59,660
which has not been cleaned.

1522
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:02,420
Jason, have you ever been in the Starbucks

1523
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:03,980
or Cinnabon that you're talking about?

1524
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:07,140
No, I've never stepped foot in any of the buildings.

1525
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:08,300
All right, let's go.

1526
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:10,300
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

1527
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:11,140
Uh.

1528
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:13,940
And well, and then like you would think

1529
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:15,840
that they would need to take it down a notch

1530
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:18,420
after the trip on the boat during which

1531
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:20,860
that music plays the entire time.

1532
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:25,520
But as they land and the excitement only has to ramp up

1533
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:27,820
because you'll never guess what they find.

1534
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:30,660
Happy birthday, Barbie.

1535
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:34,340
Wow, look at all these friends of Barbie.

1536
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:36,020
They're here for Barbie's birthday.

1537
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:37,500
And guess what?

1538
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:41,300
They're making their own personal birthday card for Barbie.

1539
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:43,860
What a great idea.

1540
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:46,340
What a great surprise, Stephanie.

1541
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:47,180
Thanks.

1542
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:48,020
You're welcome.

1543
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:48,840
Thanks.

1544
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:53,500
There's some like specific tones that are so unpleasant

1545
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:54,860
just like separated.

1546
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:56,720
It's fine when it's a full sentence,

1547
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:57,720
but like, thanks.

1548
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:00,080
There's like a, there's one part of it where you go,

1549
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:02,440
ooh, that's too much for my ear.

1550
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:03,680
Imagine your loved one being like,

1551
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:04,960
I have something really special for you

1552
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,640
when I sort of four children do the craft.

1553
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:08,480
Thanks.

1554
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,960
Happy birthday, cards for you.

1555
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,200
Wow, what a great idea.

1556
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,760
It's always nice to get cards,

1557
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:19,160
but I wish that were screaming at me less.

1558
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,760
Could they make me maybe some special ear muffs?

1559
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:26,800
And these cards that they're making,

1560
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:28,440
they're not art directed.

1561
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,920
They're the cards of a child.

1562
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,680
They don't look good.

1563
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,600
There's a lot of lifting of them.

1564
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:36,020
It's like, wow, it's so pink.

1565
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:37,600
Barbie's gonna love that.

1566
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:40,640
It's just like some trash glued to construction paper.

1567
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:43,240
This card is 70% glue.

1568
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:46,960
The card is soggy.

1569
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:49,120
Let's go.

1570
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:51,360
It'll never survive in the floor to eat.

1571
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:53,440
I made you this card.

1572
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:54,520
Please take it off my hands.

1573
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:56,120
I'm getting dizzy.

1574
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,120
Glue doesn't work in Orlando.

1575
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:03,760
The glitter glue is even more toxic than the Elbers.

1576
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:09,800
And the excitement only continues

1577
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,880
because then you head over to Italy

1578
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:15,320
and we get a big eating spaghetti montage.

1579
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,400
My God, sped up.

1580
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,520
Yeah.

1581
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:20,480
I've talked to at least two other adult women

1582
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,360
who learned how to eat spaghetti from this special.

1583
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:24,200
Wow, really?

1584
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:27,520
So you put the spin on your fork and on your spoon.

1585
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:28,360
And that's how you do it.

1586
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:30,120
And then I didn't eat spaghetti as a child.

1587
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:30,960
It's a whole thing.

1588
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:31,800
We don't have time for it.

1589
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,920
But the first time I had long pasta,

1590
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,360
they served it to me with a spoon on the side.

1591
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:37,960
I said, oh, you put the spin on your spork

1592
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:38,800
and on your spoon.

1593
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:39,760
And I did it.

1594
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,600
And then I read that that's for children.

1595
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,080
So I stopped doing it.

1596
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:44,160
Whoa.

1597
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,160
Oh, is that right?

1598
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:46,640
Is that just to like, I mean, I guess

1599
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:50,120
I'm not typically doing the spoon along with the fork.

1600
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:53,120
That is just to make it controlled for children

1601
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:53,960
to learn that.

1602
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:57,520
Jason, how are you doing that when you're eating spaghetti?

1603
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:58,480
Please be good.

1604
01:00:58,480 --> 01:00:59,320
Please be the same.

1605
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:00,320
Please be not normal.

1606
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:04,640
I was just kind of cutting a little,

1607
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:07,760
like he cut a salad so the pieces are not as long.

1608
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:08,960
Damn it.

1609
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:12,680
Not just not big slurps like a cartoon dog.

1610
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:15,640
Well, there's probably some slurps, you know,

1611
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:17,080
depends on how saucy.

1612
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:18,000
No, it's all right.

1613
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,240
Sounds like a normal way to say it.

1614
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:20,480
Sorry to disappoint you.

1615
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:21,520
For an adult man.

1616
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:25,000
I don't have the coordination to do the fork and spoon thing.

1617
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,760
I was always jealous.

1618
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:28,600
I mean, we were really hoping,

1619
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:30,360
well, I put my head into the plate

1620
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:31,640
and I just start sucking.

1621
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:34,520
Like we were hoping for something as insane as that.

1622
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,120
Like a slob.

1623
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:38,040
You were hoping like I was like a little baby slob.

1624
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:40,960
Well, that was just one version of what it could have been.

1625
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:43,160
It didn't necessarily need to be a slob.

1626
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:44,000
But like, oh, it was like,

1627
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,360
well, I take out my spaghetti fork and then we're like,

1628
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:48,200
well, what's that?

1629
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,040
And it's a different fork you had like commissioned

1630
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:50,880
or something.

1631
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:53,520
That's another version that would have been great.

1632
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:54,360
I would have been happy with that as well.

1633
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:58,200
I think I was a tri-color routine kid, mostly.

1634
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:59,040
What is that?

1635
01:01:59,040 --> 01:01:59,880
Tri-color routine.

1636
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:02,600
It was like the school lunch pasta.

1637
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:04,040
That's how it was.

1638
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:07,240
The spiral yellow, red, green.

1639
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:09,360
It's a way to get just the smallest amount of spinach

1640
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:10,400
in your child's diet.

1641
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,240
Yeah.

1642
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:12,080
Otherwise not.

1643
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:12,920
I love the spinach ones.

1644
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:14,120
Didn't really like spinach,

1645
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:16,040
but I liked the spinach pasta.

1646
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:18,960
Oh, I thought I might've fallen for the trick

1647
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:19,800
the whole time.

1648
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:21,680
I like maybe didn't know till right now.

1649
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,640
I'm learning all kinds of.

1650
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:27,320
Caroline, you're teaching us so many good spaghetti mix.

1651
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:28,160
Let's go.

1652
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:33,560
I mean, I can't believe this,

1653
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:36,360
but I think if you're narrating the events of the tape,

1654
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:38,960
we're kind of at the show,

1655
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,680
unless we missed anything.

1656
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:44,960
But I think, cause they got to devote some time to that.

1657
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:45,800
Ultimately you got to see part of these.

1658
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,240
Yeah, there's just the four countries,

1659
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:48,840
Mexico, Japan, China,

1660
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,600
and Italy.

1661
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:51,800
We got them all.

1662
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:53,760
There is a town crier.

1663
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:54,600
Oh yes.

1664
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:55,440
Oh yeah, yeah.

1665
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,600
I feel like I didn't care for that part.

1666
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:58,840
I didn't want to listen to this type.

1667
01:02:58,840 --> 01:02:59,680
Maybe I like,

1668
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:03,840
one kind of yelling in this was charming enough,

1669
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:04,840
but that his kind,

1670
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:06,840
I can't deal with a different type of yelling.

1671
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:08,320
An adult yelling is less appealing.

1672
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:09,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1673
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:11,760
I can't switch between the registers.

1674
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,200
But we now get to the show.

1675
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,800
We get to the magical world of Barbie,

1676
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:17,960
which I really like the choice

1677
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:22,960
that Lisa and Stephanie narrated from a pageant.

1678
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:28,040
They're at the table that's arbitrarily up in the audience.

1679
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,120
That's always the move.

1680
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:31,960
Yeah, yeah.

1681
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:33,440
They're so excited to go see it,

1682
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,320
but then ultimately they,

1683
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:36,360
yeah, we got to work.

1684
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:37,560
It's for work.

1685
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:39,480
They have to turn their backs to it

1686
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:42,360
and run it like the Macy's parade.

1687
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,360
But they're dedicated broadcast professionals

1688
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:46,360
and they do it.

1689
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,320
But the,

1690
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:51,720
I mean, the song is at the beginning, right?

1691
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:52,680
Isn't it?

1692
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:56,680
I mean, so we got to talk about the song.

1693
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:59,520
And I guess I will play a clip of-

1694
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,840
Some kind of sample throughout.

1695
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,720
Yes. Yeah, yeah.

1696
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:04,560
Okay.

1697
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:05,760
["Barbie's World"]

1698
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:08,120
Barbie's world,

1699
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:10,200
there's no limitations.

1700
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:12,360
Barbie's world,

1701
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:14,680
there's nothing you can't do.

1702
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:17,040
Barbie's world,

1703
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:19,120
use your imagination

1704
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:22,120
and make your dreams come true.

1705
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,160
Come with us right this way.

1706
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:29,160
Come with us, let's go play Barbie's world.

1707
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:42,200
It almost sounds like a Sonic the Hedgehog level

1708
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:43,200
like background music.

1709
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,480
And I mean that in a good way.

1710
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:46,560
Because they'll have those like little subtle horns

1711
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:48,560
and sometimes in a Sonic background.

1712
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:49,680
You guys know what I'm talking about?

1713
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,600
I know what you're talking about.

1714
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:55,320
Just, it's a high compliment to a piece of music.

1715
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:56,640
Well, it reminds me of all any of them

1716
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:59,520
like late 80s, early 90s music I like with horns.

1717
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:02,840
It's like Toto and Go West and the DuckTales theme.

1718
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:07,200
And if Disney was getting a horn section around this time,

1719
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,320
you knew they meant business.

1720
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:11,080
I mean, what a song.

1721
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:14,240
I mean, when we were talking about doing this, Carol,

1722
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:19,320
you sort of proved your fan merits

1723
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:24,240
with Instagram message of yes, yeah, yeah.

1724
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:28,800
A great acapella rendition of the song.

1725
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:31,400
So clearly this part blingers with you.

1726
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:33,120
This is a great song to you.

1727
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:34,920
And as Jason can confirm in the show,

1728
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:37,760
this is the hook for every transition.

1729
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:40,600
I think there's like two or three other songs that they do,

1730
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:43,120
but it's mostly just this song

1731
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:45,080
through the whole 30 minute show.

1732
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:48,080
Okay, well, I guess get your money's worth out of it.

1733
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:49,480
If you wrote a great one.

1734
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:50,320
I like it a lot.

1735
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:51,680
And it has that, I mean, I love it

1736
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:53,160
because it's Barbie vibe,

1737
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:56,000
but it's so Disney around that time too.

1738
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,680
Like DuckTales, it sounds a lot like a lot of those,

1739
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:02,080
but there's some of that like phantasmic,

1740
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:06,080
like your dreams coming true and that style of harmony.

1741
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:10,560
And I feel like they deployed some real enunciating singing,

1742
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,800
come with us right this way,

1743
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:15,520
come with us, let's all play.

1744
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:19,200
The male singers especially just really,

1745
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,520
little nasal really pronounce all that.

1746
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,520
There's a lot going on in that.

1747
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:24,480
Really love it.

1748
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,520
That's pure magic.

1749
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:28,240
And that's part of the theme park experience,

1750
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,760
I feel like is like you're going to a special place

1751
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:33,160
that is not where you get to spend all of your childhood.

1752
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:35,400
It's just only on the most special days.

1753
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:39,360
And the songs remind you about how magical your day is.

1754
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:41,760
The wonders and the sights you're seeing.

1755
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:44,440
Those songs like this are so pure.

1756
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:47,360
I do love to imagine the composer thinking about all that

1757
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:48,560
as he's like putting it down.

1758
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:50,000
He's like, this is going to be the best day

1759
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,480
of this child's life.

1760
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:53,200
I need this to stick with them.

1761
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,920
I need it to.

1762
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:57,320
Yelling at the horn section during the recording.

1763
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:59,480
Kids need to hear these beautiful horns

1764
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:02,240
and you're fucking up, not magical enough.

1765
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:03,760
Make it magical.

1766
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,040
Gun like Phil Spector.

1767
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:05,880
Yeah, yeah.

1768
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:10,880
It's so great.

1769
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:14,840
Barbie arrives and I don't, let's, okay.

1770
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:21,400
If I say loaded, tough to choose,

1771
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:24,280
best wardrobe of the show.

1772
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:28,640
Because I think it might be, though the gown at the end

1773
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:31,000
is really, the pink sparkly gown

1774
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,880
is pretty perfect and classic.

1775
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:37,040
What she comes out in, this pink denim,

1776
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:42,040
bolero cutoff top, underneath she's wearing a shirt

1777
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,400
that Prince would wear.

1778
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:47,720
Yeah, that Prince wore in the mountains music video.

1779
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:51,080
But then on top of that, perfectly flared,

1780
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:53,720
achy breaky heart era, butt pink.

1781
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:58,120
The first wardrobe, oh my god.

1782
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:01,120
Yeah, ankle socks and a platform sneaker.

1783
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:02,600
Just total, yeah.

1784
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,120
Perfect, perfect.

1785
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:09,120
But does any other wardrobe top that in anyone's eyes?

1786
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:14,440
I, well, the last song, the gown she comes out in at the end,

1787
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:16,240
I know it makes sense for the top,

1788
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:20,880
but everyone else is wearing very fashion show.

1789
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:21,720
Like Euro.

1790
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:23,880
Kind of Euro outfits and then she comes out

1791
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:25,720
dressed like Linda the Good Witch.

1792
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:28,440
So it's a little.

1793
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:29,840
Yeah, it's not that one.

1794
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:32,560
That one's too generic, I feel.

1795
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:36,120
But of course, I mean, big one to go out on.

1796
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:36,960
Yeah, of course.

1797
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:37,800
Yeah.

1798
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:39,600
Yeah, the first one is the coolest one.

1799
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:40,440
Yeah.

1800
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:41,280
Yeah.

1801
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:42,120
I don't think.

1802
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:45,000
That's one of those, I don't know.

1803
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,560
There's just like in 90s stuff

1804
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:48,800
because it's what you grew up with.

1805
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:52,080
And then you look at that and I think just objectively,

1806
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:55,640
we lived in that world where people dress like,

1807
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:57,720
maybe only Barbie in a theme park show,

1808
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:00,040
but where it was possible to put that wardrobe together

1809
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:03,760
and we threw that world away for what?

1810
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:05,440
What did we choose instead?

1811
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:07,080
This is where I commend Greta Gerwig

1812
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:09,440
for styling the movie in this way.

1813
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:11,160
You could see everybody's losing their minds

1814
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:14,480
to see giant movie stars in clothes like this.

1815
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:17,520
And with good reason, it's a hell of a style.

1816
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,760
It is funny, I didn't even think about it until just now

1817
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:22,960
that it's obviously firmly in the 90s Barbie,

1818
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,880
which there's like a classic Barbie

1819
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,960
that was iconic in its own way,

1820
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:29,520
but clearly the 90s one is,

1821
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,360
obviously you're doing it for younger people,

1822
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:32,960
not people that are 70 or 80,

1823
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:36,080
but that still does sort of prove what you're saying

1824
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:38,560
that how impactful that fashion

1825
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:41,960
and the colors of the 90s were to do it specifically there,

1826
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:44,400
which is the right decision.

1827
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:46,360
Well, it reminds me of earlier in the special

1828
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:47,560
when she's talking to the art director,

1829
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:50,880
she's like, well, we made all of the vehicles transform

1830
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:53,000
because all of Barbie's things transform.

1831
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,200
It's like, I think just all toys

1832
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:56,160
in the late 80s, early 90s transformed.

1833
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:57,400
I don't think that's a Barbie thing.

1834
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:58,560
I think that's just like,

1835
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:00,440
that was what toys had to do at the time.

1836
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:02,480
Barbie transformed, there were no other toys

1837
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:03,640
that transformed.

1838
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:06,880
Nothing I can think of.

1839
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:10,640
You think of the word transform, you think of what toy.

1840
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:11,760
Barbie, of course.

1841
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:16,760
Yeah, I mean, so vehicles are great, clothes are great.

1842
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:22,720
This was the clip that Amanda was like,

1843
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:24,720
well, you have to talk about.

1844
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:30,080
She posted the, the living in the land of Oz song.

1845
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,320
This is time for Jason and I.

1846
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:35,160
So that song was much different in the actual show.

1847
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:39,120
So in the VHS tape was filmed during previews

1848
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:40,920
before Thanksgiving 93,

1849
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:43,440
and then went through a huge amount of rewrites.

1850
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:46,120
That song hugely different.

1851
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:49,040
And the main difference is that they're sort of

1852
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:52,880
a rock and roll koala with sunglasses

1853
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:54,480
and two stars in the number.

1854
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:58,760
I'm making a, here, let me get it right.

1855
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:02,240
I'm making a Macaulay Culkin face.

1856
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:04,560
Are you happy motherfuckers?

1857
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,920
So many comments, Lord.

1858
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:08,000
What had you been saying?

1859
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:08,840
Macaulay.

1860
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:11,000
And you guys never brought it up,

1861
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,360
I think partially because who gives a shit.

1862
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:16,600
I noted it during the episode,

1863
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:18,800
but I actually doubted my own pronunciation.

1864
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:19,640
Yes, nobody.

1865
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:20,480
Macaulay.

1866
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:22,920
I acted like that was the most obvious one in the world.

1867
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,400
Caroline, I'm fine about this.

1868
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:25,880
I'm fine about these.

1869
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:26,720
Clearly. Sit down.

1870
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:28,120
I'm well adjusted.

1871
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:28,960
Sit down.

1872
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:32,040
No, I'm standing up for energy.

1873
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:33,680
I'm trying to keep the energy up.

1874
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:38,840
The show, you know, talking about all the changes,

1875
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:41,520
the show goes around the world a lot.

1876
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:44,000
And the thing I honed in on Australia

1877
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,960
is that it samples the Australian folk song

1878
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,480
Waltzing Matilda a lot.

1879
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:49,440
Yes, absolutely it does.

1880
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,280
It's an interpolation.

1881
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:52,120
It's really cool.

1882
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:54,000
The chorus morphs into it,

1883
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,840
but then the lyrics are like Barbie's Waltzing Matilda.

1884
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:58,520
Waltzing Matilda is like a war song.

1885
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:01,280
It's like sort of a serious song.

1886
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:03,560
So a koala plays Waltzing Matilda?

1887
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:04,400
Yeah, wait a minute.

1888
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,400
We kind of went past, yes, we got distracted.

1889
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:07,720
We need to talk about the koala.

1890
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:08,560
Yeah, you're right.

1891
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:09,600
Oh my God, I'm starting to distract.

1892
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,120
There's a koala in the one sequence.

1893
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:12,880
There's a gorilla in a later one.

1894
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:14,120
And then they call him a monkey.

1895
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:16,080
But does the koala sing this song?

1896
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,360
The koala is playing the guitar.

1897
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:18,200
He's wearing sunglasses.

1898
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:21,200
And he's about like midge height.

1899
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:23,160
He's like halfway to Barbie,

1900
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:24,960
but in a full like mascot suit.

1901
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:26,720
And they're kind of,

1902
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:30,000
so the plot in the Epcot series is some sort of like,

1903
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,480
and we're presenting you an award

1904
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:32,520
for a friend of the animals.

1905
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:33,760
And then they just sing the song.

1906
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:34,600
But in this version,

1907
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:38,080
there's an evil guy who's trying to kill the koala

1908
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:39,880
because of some reason.

1909
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:41,680
Yeah, he's pretty mad about it.

1910
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:45,480
And he shows up in Africa, in the jungle, I think too.

1911
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:48,240
The same villain recurse.

1912
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:50,360
But it's like, Barbie's like, hey, don't kill a koala.

1913
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:51,440
He's just trying his best.

1914
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:53,440
And then to repay her,

1915
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:56,480
he plays a rock and roll version of this song for her.

1916
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:57,560
Oh, here we go.

1917
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:59,800
Okay, I got it now.

1918
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:01,720
Oh, and I love when it's like a,

1919
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:05,480
it's a mascot character, but with a real guitar,

1920
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:06,960
not a cartoon he could break.

1921
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:07,800
None of that.

1922
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,880
It's not one of those inflatable, you know,

1923
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:12,320
Chuck E. Cheese bullshit guitars.

1924
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:15,520
This is like, yeah, this is really different.

1925
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:19,440
And lots of dancers and we're doing the swim and stuff.

1926
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:21,280
This is fun.

1927
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:22,560
Do you think improved?

1928
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:24,520
That's a great question.

1929
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:26,280
It does, before they go to Australia,

1930
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:28,120
there is a really strange moment.

1931
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:30,840
I don't know if you also honed in on this of that.

1932
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,280
They're like, where in the world should we go?

1933
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:34,920
And then one of the black dancers is like,

1934
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:35,920
we should go to Africa.

1935
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:37,000
And Barbie's like, nah.

1936
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,800
And then one of the white dancers is like,

1937
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:39,760
what about Australia?

1938
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:41,800
And she's like, that's a great idea.

1939
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:43,320
Barbie.

1940
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:46,040
Yikes, oh my God.

1941
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:49,640
Optics had been invented in 1994.

1942
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:51,520
That's by the way, it's been weighing on me

1943
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:54,800
that I chose the name Brad as the most boring one

1944
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:55,760
out of the list a while ago.

1945
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,040
And then upon Googling it,

1946
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:58,880
discovered that Brad is black.

1947
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:01,920
That's not why I was dismissive of Brad.

1948
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:02,760
What ethnicity is Jazzy?

1949
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:04,520
I thought it was kind of a boring name.

1950
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:05,360
What's that?

1951
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:06,640
What's Jazzy's ethnicity?

1952
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:08,240
I don't know.

1953
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:09,400
We have to look at the Wikipedia.

1954
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:10,320
Jazzy.

1955
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:11,240
I was trying to find the name

1956
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:14,800
if Barbie had like a canonical koala with a name.

1957
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,240
I don't think I can find it,

1958
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:18,280
but I did find that there's a Sonic the Hedgehog character

1959
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:19,760
named Barbie Koala.

1960
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:20,600
Oh.

1961
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:22,440
So I was a character I was not familiar with.

1962
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:25,080
And do you wanna talk about extended universes?

1963
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:28,440
Sonic the Hedgehog, all those supporting characters,

1964
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:29,280
all those pranks and shadow.

1965
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:31,240
I know the ones from my childhood

1966
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:32,400
from the first couple of years,

1967
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,760
but then like I get to Amy and I'm gone.

1968
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:36,800
I don't know past Amy.

1969
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:39,560
I don't know, I know Amy and then whoever's after that.

1970
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:41,080
I know before I know Rotor

1971
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:44,960
and I know the guy with the kind of like a French

1972
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:48,400
like Colonel's outfit and I forget his name.

1973
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,000
I know Sally.

1974
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,920
I know Tails.

1975
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:54,440
But yeah, after that, no, I'm a little lost.

1976
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:57,360
Do we get a prize if we name our 200th name

1977
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:59,120
from the 90s in this episode?

1978
01:14:59,120 --> 01:14:59,960
I hope so, please.

1979
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:01,440
We get number 200.

1980
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:02,320
Somebody count them.

1981
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:03,160
I hope so.

1982
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:06,640
Well, that's a cool number.

1983
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:08,520
I mean, either way, The Land of Oz,

1984
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:09,760
I think is working out great.

1985
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:14,760
And then you check in with Lisa, the hosts.

1986
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:20,400
We hope you're loving the show as much as we are.

1987
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,360
I'm glad we checked in.

1988
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:24,400
Appreciate that.

1989
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:26,160
Oh, at this point,

1990
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:29,920
this would be real time discovering the horror

1991
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:33,800
that I did not pull the clip of the song, The Barbie Touch.

1992
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:34,640
Oh really?

1993
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:35,480
What was I doing?

1994
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:36,480
Don't worry, I can sing it.

1995
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:37,800
You've got the time.

1996
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:38,800
Oh please.

1997
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,400
Barbie touch.

1998
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:43,720
All you've gotta do is accessorize.

1999
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:48,720
It's a, it's a, it's the latest fashion craze.

2000
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:50,920
You've got the Barbie touch.

2001
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:52,440
You can touch it up.

2002
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:54,400
You can touch it down.

2003
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,240
Barbie touch it up.

2004
01:15:56,240 --> 01:15:57,280
It is a great song.

2005
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:58,120
Wow, yay.

2006
01:15:58,120 --> 01:15:58,960
Thank you so much.

2007
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:00,200
Thank you, Caroline.

2008
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:02,640
That was like a little contrived movie moment

2009
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:05,040
with like, everybody's getting here to the party,

2010
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:07,000
but the stereo's broken.

2011
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:07,840
Yeah.

2012
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:08,680
What are you gonna do?

2013
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:10,520
I'm gonna call it in 10,000 maniacs.

2014
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:11,360
Oh yeah.

2015
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:13,880
Thanks for being our 10,000 maniacs.

2016
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:15,720
I mean, that's awesome.

2017
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:16,560
The Barbie touch.

2018
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:18,360
That is that like nasally,

2019
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:20,120
the Barbie touch.

2020
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:22,280
All you gotta do is.

2021
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:24,680
Is it time to talk about the actor who played Kim

2022
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:25,520
in this production?

2023
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:26,340
Absolutely.

2024
01:16:26,340 --> 01:16:27,180
Sure, yeah.

2025
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:28,000
Do you know that there's a documentary about him

2026
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:28,840
on Amazon Prime?

2027
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:31,680
What a reveal.

2028
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:32,960
That is a reveal.

2029
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:36,120
He, as of the documentary,

2030
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:40,320
just had his 43rd consecutive contract at Walt Disney World.

2031
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:42,800
He went there for the college program and has not left.

2032
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:43,640
Wow.

2033
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:45,000
And it's called The Happiest Man on Earth

2034
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,920
because he is the happiest man on Earth.

2035
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:47,920
Oh, I did see that.

2036
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:50,520
Yeah, he was a cast member for like decades and decades.

2037
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:52,000
Yeah, yeah.

2038
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,720
A guy with a wife and kids.

2039
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:57,760
The children are aspiring theme park performers

2040
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:58,960
according to his Instagram,

2041
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:00,520
which I've spent some time on.

2042
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:05,080
Yeah, and a lot of his identity is like tied up in,

2043
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:08,800
being Ken in this seminal production.

2044
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:10,720
Does that like his like claimed,

2045
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:12,960
if there was an IMDB for theme park performers,

2046
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:14,440
would that be the number one thing probably?

2047
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:15,280
I think so, yeah.

2048
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:16,120
Yeah.

2049
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:17,360
But he's obviously has done a million things

2050
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:18,840
if he's been there that long.

2051
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:20,360
Yeah, but I have to wonder like,

2052
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:23,240
when you're a young man,

2053
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:24,840
theme park performer,

2054
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:26,520
who is like a face character,

2055
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:28,040
like can sing and dance and stuff,

2056
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:30,760
like you have the princes.

2057
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:31,840
And then like,

2058
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:34,320
what do you do until you're like the dad care,

2059
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:35,160
or like, you know,

2060
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:36,720
I don't know that he's like playing Geppetto

2061
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:37,560
or something like that.

2062
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:39,360
I'm Geppetto is like a mask.

2063
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:40,480
Yeah, exactly.

2064
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:43,800
Maybe he is, but that's not the glory of Ken or a prince.

2065
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:44,760
Yeah, exactly.

2066
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:47,040
I wonder who the oldest prince,

2067
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:49,600
like what oldest actor who ever played a prince is.

2068
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:50,440
Oldest.

2069
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:54,200
Is there an internal age that they don't like write down,

2070
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:55,520
but they know?

2071
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:58,440
It's like once you're 37, over.

2072
01:17:58,440 --> 01:17:59,280
And maybe it's lower.

2073
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:00,120
Are you asking about your sit?

2074
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:01,520
Do you wanna know if you can be a prince?

2075
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:02,360
Was it 39?

2076
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:05,560
Cause I don't know.

2077
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:06,400
Maybe.

2078
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:07,240
Oh yeah.

2079
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:08,840
The world, like the oldest,

2080
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:10,960
the oldest like Prince Eric.

2081
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:12,120
Wow. Wow. Yeah.

2082
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:13,160
Kids are like,

2083
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:14,560
Prince Eric, that looks different.

2084
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:16,840
He looks, he looks tired.

2085
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:19,400
He makes noises when he stands up and sits down.

2086
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:21,880
It's like, yeah.

2087
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:24,960
He's Prince Eric, like on the off season.

2088
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:25,800
Or the off time.

2089
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:26,840
Quite a Maurice yet.

2090
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:28,160
Like if you go at 8 a.m.

2091
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,360
Yeah, if you go to 8 a.m.

2092
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:32,160
they have like a 50 year old Prince Eric

2093
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:33,160
until like 11.

2094
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:35,280
And then like a hot young Prince Eric.

2095
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:37,040
He wants to get it done early too.

2096
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:37,880
Yeah.

2097
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:38,720
It goes like to bed.

2098
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:39,760
Early to bed, early to rise.

2099
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:40,600
Right, right.

2100
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:41,440
He's part time.

2101
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:42,260
Yeah.

2102
01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:43,100
That's interesting.

2103
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:44,440
Billy Flanagan. Billy Flanagan.

2104
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:45,320
The happiest man on earth.

2105
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:46,160
Oh wait.

2106
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:46,980
And we overlooked that.

2107
01:18:46,980 --> 01:18:51,080
I mentioned that, that Barbie was a pageant winner,

2108
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:54,800
but specifically they were having trouble finding Barbie.

2109
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,040
And then they were,

2110
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:57,880
and then the Disney people were watching

2111
01:18:57,880 --> 01:19:01,960
the Miss America pageant and found Miss Oregon,

2112
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:05,360
Elizabeth Simmons, the third runner up.

2113
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:06,960
So she didn't win that pageant,

2114
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:09,120
but she won the role of a lifetime.

2115
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:09,960
Yeah.

2116
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:12,080
Except that she then kind of immediately didn't do the role.

2117
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,720
It was a Beth mix something.

2118
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:16,600
Was the woman who did it for the majority of the show.

2119
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:19,440
So it was Elizabeth Simmons for the VHS tape.

2120
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:21,960
And then pretty promptly was a different actor.

2121
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:24,920
Who has done a couple of really interesting podcasts

2122
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:28,000
about all the rewrites of the show.

2123
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,640
And that it was originally written

2124
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:31,600
with all of this like point work.

2125
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:33,960
And she was not a ballet dancer.

2126
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:34,800
And they were like,

2127
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:37,600
oh, we're gonna bring in a body double for those parts.

2128
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:38,680
But then those parts got cut.

2129
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:39,840
Yeah.

2130
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:40,680
Interesting.

2131
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:42,260
Do you know why, what was she replaced?

2132
01:19:42,260 --> 01:19:43,720
Or the original actress?

2133
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:44,560
I do not know that.

2134
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:45,380
Interesting.

2135
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:46,480
Or she left.

2136
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:47,760
Creative differences.

2137
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:52,760
You also said that you at some point in your adult life

2138
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:56,080
have looked up the whereabouts of Lisa and Stephanie.

2139
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:57,760
Yeah. You were talking about Facebook groups earlier.

2140
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:00,840
I too, back in my Facebook days, loved a Facebook group.

2141
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:03,760
And I did find like a Facebook group for aficionados

2142
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,000
of this special in particular.

2143
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,160
And Lisa and Stephanie were both members of it.

2144
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:10,200
The actors, their real names are not Lisa and Stephanie.

2145
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:11,960
But I think one was like in nursing school.

2146
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:14,880
They sometimes would talk to each other.

2147
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:15,700
Yeah.

2148
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:17,500
Since then their socials have been a little,

2149
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:20,160
I don't know if they're just swarmed with fans

2150
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:21,920
with the popularity of Barbie

2151
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:23,160
that they all had to go on private.

2152
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:24,680
But yeah.

2153
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:28,360
People are so much more accessible on like Facebook

2154
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:30,200
than you would imagine even to like.

2155
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:34,080
And now the only example I have is I think he passed away.

2156
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:36,840
But my mom's like, you know Tony Dow from Leave It To Beaver

2157
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:41,840
is very active on various 60s Facebook groups.

2158
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:43,640
And she'll be like, oh, I responded

2159
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:45,480
to one of his comments the other day.

2160
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:50,480
He played Wally on Leave It To Beaver.

2161
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:51,880
Okay.

2162
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:54,600
Kind of an important character.

2163
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:55,440
Very important.

2164
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:56,280
Yeah.

2165
01:20:56,520 --> 01:21:01,520
But not too important to talk to their fans.

2166
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:02,480
Of course, yeah.

2167
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:05,240
So yeah, that doesn't surprise me that they're there.

2168
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:06,080
Yeah.

2169
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:08,120
Did you ever directly interact or no?

2170
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,120
No.

2171
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:11,760
No, I immediately went to,

2172
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:14,320
are you guys familiar with the We Sing series?

2173
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:15,160
Yeah.

2174
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:18,120
I have directly interacted with Silly Whim

2175
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:20,600
from We Sing in Sillyville,

2176
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:22,360
who I guess lives in Houston now.

2177
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:23,520
And I had a mutual friend

2178
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:26,480
with my first high school ex-boyfriend, Max Castillo.

2179
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:28,080
I said, Max, how do you know Silly Whim?

2180
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:30,000
And he was like, oh, we like did this thing together.

2181
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,160
So I sent her a DM and said,

2182
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:33,360
hey, Silly Whim is really important to me.

2183
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:34,200
Wow.

2184
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:35,040
I don't know that she responded.

2185
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:35,880
What is this series?

2186
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:38,480
Can you like sum it up in his sentence?

2187
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:41,320
I had one of, I think We Sing in Sillyville

2188
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:44,920
is the one that my wife Erin grew up.

2189
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:46,640
I think this one was a big one for her

2190
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:47,800
unless I'm mistaken.

2191
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:48,640
Yeah.

2192
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:49,480
I had a different Sillyville.

2193
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:50,640
Do you have Big Rock Candy Mountain?

2194
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:52,240
That was another really, really big one.

2195
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:54,040
Grandpa's Attic maybe.

2196
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:55,520
Maybe grandpa, or was that hers?

2197
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:56,360
I don't know.

2198
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:57,640
Silly Whim, okay.

2199
01:21:57,640 --> 01:21:58,480
Let's see.

2200
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,080
Well, there's a big tree with a face.

2201
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:01,680
So I don't like that.

2202
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:03,680
Oh, then you will not enjoy the We Sing series.

2203
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:04,500
Oh no.

2204
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:05,340
Oh geez.

2205
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:06,200
That's the main facet of it.

2206
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:08,160
The We Sing series was a series created,

2207
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:11,200
an educational series created by some music educators,

2208
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:13,080
the best people to create a series

2209
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:18,360
that said, we need to be teaching children folk songs

2210
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:21,560
and public domain music.

2211
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:24,000
These children only want to sing copyrighted songs.

2212
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,640
And so it's a series of sort of

2213
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:28,080
my favorite kind of entertainment,

2214
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:30,260
which is like adults in mascot costumes,

2215
01:22:30,260 --> 01:22:32,400
and then also adults not in mascot costumes

2216
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:33,880
and sort of painted sets.

2217
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:35,080
Oh yeah, yeah.

2218
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:38,600
Like doing like really rudimentary theatrical,

2219
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:40,080
like, you know.

2220
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,320
Real quick, just that question.

2221
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:42,400
We'll go right back to this.

2222
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:44,080
Do you, are you a Zoobly Zoo fan?

2223
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:44,920
Oh, of course I am.

2224
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:45,740
Okay, good.

2225
01:22:45,740 --> 01:22:49,360
Everyone here, time for the fun to begin.

2226
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:50,440
Come along with us.

2227
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:51,640
Oh yeah, big time.

2228
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:53,640
A Shelly Duvall's Fairytale Theater.

2229
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:56,160
Any of that stuff is big time my vibe.

2230
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:59,280
And so in We Sing in Sillyville,

2231
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:00,640
the colors aren't getting along.

2232
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:03,200
So it's the red bitty booties

2233
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:05,160
and the green spurtle gurgles

2234
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:08,920
and the twirly pops and the purple poshes

2235
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:10,080
getting along with everyone still.

2236
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:13,440
But so these two children are transported

2237
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:15,480
into a coloring book to help silly women figure out

2238
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:17,040
how to make all the colors get along again.

2239
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:17,880
Wow.

2240
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:18,720
That's sort of the plot.

2241
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:20,240
Okay.

2242
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:23,520
Mine is We Sing Together,

2243
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:28,520
which has like a mouse lady and a bear guy.

2244
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:30,520
He's a little Zoobly Zoo.

2245
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:31,360
Okay.

2246
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:32,920
This one was kind of frightening.

2247
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:33,840
I haven't seen these.

2248
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:34,680
I don't think.

2249
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:36,680
There's a big teapot probably for that one,

2250
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:38,400
you know, the public domain teapot song.

2251
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:39,360
I'm a little teapot.

2252
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:40,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2253
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:41,540
I don't know why I couldn't think of the name.

2254
01:23:41,540 --> 01:23:42,760
You know, the teapot song.

2255
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:43,600
Teapot song.

2256
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:46,360
Yeah, they tried to sort of like,

2257
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:48,720
like Grandpa's Addicts are like songs a grandpa would like.

2258
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:50,400
And then Silly Wim is silly songs.

2259
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,440
So it's like the I'm a nut, I'm a nut, I'm a nut.

2260
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:54,600
If you know that one or like a one bottle of pop,

2261
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:56,840
two bottle of pop, all these classic silly songs.

2262
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:59,640
And then Big Rock Candy Mountain is like folk songs.

2263
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:00,880
So it's like Big Rock Candy Mountain

2264
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:04,000
and like more kind of a American South based music.

2265
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,240
Skip to my Lou.

2266
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:06,080
Oh, sure.

2267
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:06,920
Yeah, yeah.

2268
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:08,320
Oh, Nobody Knows the Troubles I've Seen.

2269
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,160
That's one's in that.

2270
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:10,000
Really?

2271
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,600
That's the Little Bunny Foo Foo sings that

2272
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:14,120
after he's turned into a goon

2273
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:16,080
for Bipopping the Measy Mouse he sings.

2274
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:16,920
Okay.

2275
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:17,760
Nobody's known the trouble I've seen.

2276
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:20,760
I learned about a recent thing that's popular with kids

2277
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:25,400
nowadays on YouTube called Skibbity Toilet recently,

2278
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:28,920
which is like a CGI head that comes out of a toilet

2279
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:30,800
and kind of screams things at people.

2280
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:31,680
What's the name of this?

2281
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:33,400
Skibbity Toilet.

2282
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:34,240
Okay.

2283
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:35,080
Skibbity Toilet.

2284
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:37,640
And it, yeah, it's a little horrifying.

2285
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:38,480
Oh, I don't like that.

2286
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:39,320
It's a little.

2287
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:40,280
A little?

2288
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:41,120
Yeah, it's a little.

2289
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:43,560
It's like a ventriloquist dummy CGI head.

2290
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:45,720
It's a little Slender Man-y.

2291
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:46,560
It's a little.

2292
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:47,640
And kids like this or they're afraid of him?

2293
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:53,480
I think it's, I think he might be the villain.

2294
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:54,760
The villain I hope so.

2295
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:56,920
I think there's some other creatures

2296
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:59,280
who have like cameras for heads and TVs for heads.

2297
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:02,360
Is he trying to pull you into the toilet world with him?

2298
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:03,680
Is that his game?

2299
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:05,200
I'm not really sure.

2300
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:08,000
Does he, I hate to be crude, does he drink your pee?

2301
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,000
I don't, I think he mostly sings,

2302
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:14,640
he sounds like Spoon Man, like,

2303
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:16,720
or what's the Skibbity, what's the?

2304
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:17,560
The Scat Man?

2305
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:21,360
Yeah, he sounds a little like a more high-pitched Scat Man.

2306
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:24,160
Everything you say that's designed to make this more clear

2307
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:26,120
is making me more confused.

2308
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:27,480
I don't understand it either.

2309
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:29,960
To me it seemed like the YouTube stuff

2310
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:34,960
from like five or six years ago of like CG.

2311
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:37,160
Johnny Johnny Yes Poppy, that one?

2312
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:38,000
Oh yes.

2313
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:38,840
Oh yeah.

2314
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:39,680
Crack a Deal.

2315
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:41,560
Telling lies, is that that one?

2316
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:42,400
Yeah, yeah.

2317
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:45,200
It seemed like along those lines.

2318
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:50,080
So it might just be viruses that infect people.

2319
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:50,920
Okay.

2320
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:52,480
Both their computers and their brains.

2321
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:55,200
Oh, so maybe a virus might have made this video.

2322
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:56,040
A virus might have fully produced this video.

2323
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:57,560
It's very possible.

2324
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:59,320
We're there in this world.

2325
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:02,680
But it's probably similar to quote unquote,

2326
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:06,480
oh, all the new AI, which is really just like

2327
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:10,320
people doing data entry for pennies on the dollar,

2328
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:12,320
like around the world and just feeding in the-

2329
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:13,840
Spoiled the magic of AI.

2330
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:14,680
I spoiled the magic.

2331
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:17,160
I also think you said this two weeks ago on the show.

2332
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:18,880
You said exactly this on the show.

2333
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,040
Future five timer.

2334
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:22,720
The toilet man is the, is people programming?

2335
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:23,720
Toilet man is the way in.

2336
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:26,200
Yeah, sort of seemingly,

2337
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:30,520
whatever those early Barbie CG direct to video things,

2338
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:32,720
they just took that technology

2339
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:35,520
and kept some Windows XP machines running.

2340
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,360
And now they use it.

2341
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:38,400
Are we allowed to leave the episode

2342
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:41,240
without mentioning the video

2343
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:43,240
where Barbie meets Harvey Weinstein?

2344
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:44,240
No.

2345
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:46,080
Has everybody seen this?

2346
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:46,920
No, we're not allowed.

2347
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:47,760
This clip.

2348
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:48,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2349
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:50,120
I don't have it ready to go.

2350
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:54,440
It's really, I forget if it's Barbie or Barbie's friends.

2351
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:56,080
Midge, that's who knocked her out.

2352
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:58,920
It might be, oh no, poor Midge.

2353
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:01,160
Midge got in on one of the lawsuits.

2354
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:02,320
It's so insane.

2355
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:04,880
It is absolutely bonkers to watch.

2356
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:08,200
All these girls on a Hollywood set, no, who is that?

2357
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:09,440
You don't know who that is?

2358
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:11,560
That's Harvey Weinstein,

2359
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:13,320
the biggest producer in Hollywood.

2360
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:16,200
He's always up on the stage during the Oscars.

2361
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:18,400
Hello girls, hey, keep your dreams alive.

2362
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:19,600
Maybe you could.

2363
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:22,440
And then they animate him to be like,

2364
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:27,440
he looks like the animated Superman from the 90s.

2365
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:33,640
They beautify him so thoroughly.

2366
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:37,880
The famously dashing, barrel-chested Harvey Weinstein.

2367
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:39,200
Barbie's friend Harvey.

2368
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:41,200
You can get him to the toy aisle.

2369
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:44,320
He hangs out with Alan Sherwood a lot.

2370
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:46,000
And he has friends too.

2371
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:47,840
Bob.

2372
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:53,480
Well, Quentin says he's not his friend now,

2373
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:55,640
but I think Quentin was his friend once.

2374
01:27:57,120 --> 01:28:00,840
I'm just waiting for the Comic-Con where Bob pops up.

2375
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:02,360
Have we heard about Bob lately?

2376
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:03,200
Oh, Bob Weinstein.

2377
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:04,040
Bob Weinstein, yeah.

2378
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:05,520
I think he's laying low.

2379
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:06,720
Okay.

2380
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:08,680
Give it 10 years if you're him.

2381
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:09,520
Yeah.

2382
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:11,320
He's just like right in the tallies.

2383
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:12,520
Yeah, although he might have,

2384
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:15,160
we've discovered many times about people that have,

2385
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:16,240
he may just have another company

2386
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:17,680
that no one knows he's involved with.

2387
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:19,120
Oh, I'm sure, yeah.

2388
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:21,240
And he's just been doing stuff and who knows.

2389
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:23,680
I've almost asked this so many times in this episode.

2390
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:26,920
Alan Sherwood, isn't that the guy who graded Brady Bunch?

2391
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:28,920
No, that's Sherwood Schwartz.

2392
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:31,280
This is helping with our name count.

2393
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:33,520
It's in Lloyd Schwartz, his son.

2394
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:37,680
And it's also not Alan Sherman.

2395
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:39,960
Yes, the brother.

2396
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:41,640
We're doing really good on this name count.

2397
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:44,600
I really hope somebody actually does go count.

2398
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:45,840
The character names count right

2399
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:49,040
and all the characters in We Sing and Silly Bill count,

2400
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:49,880
right? Oh, nice.

2401
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:51,440
It's just specifics.

2402
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:53,920
As long as they're from, let's just say,

2403
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:57,040
does Tony Dow count or are we doing 90s only?

2404
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:58,760
Maybe he was alive in the 90s.

2405
01:28:58,760 --> 01:28:59,600
Yeah, of course.

2406
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:00,440
And relevant.

2407
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:01,280
Relevant.

2408
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:02,120
He's it, yes.

2409
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:04,040
I could say there will come a couple of Zoobly-Zoo,

2410
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:06,880
Builder Beaver, Mayor Ben,

2411
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:09,920
played by Ben Verene, of course, the star of Zoobly-Zoo.

2412
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:10,760
Great, great.

2413
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:13,680
Does it count as different ones

2414
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:16,360
if I say Macaulay Culkin and Macaulay Culkin?

2415
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:18,280
Do those count as different references?

2416
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:20,120
One person who exists and one who does not?

2417
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:22,480
It is a little surprising that we never got

2418
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:25,440
like a twin movie where he plays both twins.

2419
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:27,760
Or did we? Am I forgetting?

2420
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:29,840
Maybe his time was too valuable.

2421
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:32,000
And he also had brothers.

2422
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:35,240
So they just would hire the brother to play one of them.

2423
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:36,160
Yeah, that's true.

2424
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:38,560
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

2425
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,520
Okay, what's left in this show?

2426
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:42,160
Was there anything we've missed

2427
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:44,760
that you guys saw in the expanded version?

2428
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:47,080
Well, there are like doves that are released

2429
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:51,600
at the end of the show, which is just like, guys,

2430
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:53,280
like, come on.

2431
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:55,320
They come out of her dress, it feels like.

2432
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:58,400
Like the dress births doves.

2433
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:01,120
I know that Disney has a complicated relationship

2434
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:03,880
with like work animals and Clydesdales and horses and stuff,

2435
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:08,880
but it's just like, you're just killing birds for the show.

2436
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,800
Oh, yeah, every single show.

2437
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:12,760
They're not coming back afterwards

2438
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:14,480
to reset for the next show.

2439
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:17,520
Yeah, I haven't really grappled with that lie,

2440
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:18,960
that lie that you're told as a show.

2441
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:20,560
Well, no, the doves, they come back.

2442
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:22,920
Yeah, they're really well trained.

2443
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:24,920
So much so that they come back

2444
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,720
once all the people are cleared.

2445
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:30,600
So we have to leave so that the doves can come back.

2446
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:33,320
They'll be too scared to come back if you're still here.

2447
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:36,400
As soon as doves breathe in the Orlando air, they're dead.

2448
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:38,680
They're not supposed to be down there.

2449
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:40,960
You're taking that boat fishing over.

2450
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:43,240
Dead doves are just plunging into the lake.

2451
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:47,120
I caught a dove.

2452
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:51,520
A thing I know that we were talking about before,

2453
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:54,800
there's video online of the very last production of the show

2454
01:30:55,120 --> 01:31:00,120
in 1995, where they have changed saying to from Epcot 94,

2455
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:03,320
they say it's great to be here at Epcot 95. Yeah.

2456
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:07,480
In this one, I was trying to figure out if it was a lot of friends

2457
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:11,600
and family in the audience, because there's a good amount of like

2458
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:14,560
performers touching the audience members.

2459
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:18,120
So that having listened to a podcast with the replacement Barbie,

2460
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:19,840
that is a part of it.

2461
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:23,120
And that they would specifically put like pins on the children

2462
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:25,440
who were there like through charities.

2463
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:27,600
So they would go up and go like interact with them.

2464
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:31,240
And then they bring a child up at the end and put them in a pretty Barbie dress.

2465
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:34,000
And Ken says, can I kiss you on the cheek?

2466
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:35,800
And she goes, I

2467
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:39,560
cannot give you a little kiss on the cheek.

2468
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:43,800
The thing before that is the gorilla runs out in the crowd.

2469
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:47,240
And at some point, he grabbed the dad's shoulders and gave it a little shake.

2470
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:51,600
And I'm like, I wonder if he knows that, dad, or if it's just

2471
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:53,800
can I give you a kiss on the cheek? Yeah.

2472
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:56,120
Yeah, but that's classic stuff.

2473
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:57,400
You got to humiliate dad.

2474
01:31:57,400 --> 01:31:58,120
Just razzin' at dad.

2475
01:31:58,120 --> 01:31:58,960
Shaking at dad.

2476
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:02,040
Humiliating dad a little bit of theme park is like a fine tradition.

2477
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:04,200
Yeah. You got to make dad look a little silly.

2478
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:08,400
I wonder if they knew when they were filming that that it was the final show.

2479
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:10,960
Like and if it was like the final episode of Friends where everyone's

2480
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:13,600
just sort of on the verge of tears the whole time. Yeah.

2481
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:15,040
Maybe.

2482
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:19,160
Probably honestly, probably with most of this stuff, I think, honestly,

2483
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:22,600
the answer is it was like a theater production and everybody is very emotionally tied.

2484
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:26,240
Yeah. So I think if you do something like, you know,

2485
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:30,480
four times with the same group of people, emotions start to get.

2486
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:32,560
So you do it for a year and a half.

2487
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:33,760
Halloween Horror Nights.

2488
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:36,680
I know the end of Halloween Horror Nights, those scare actors.

2489
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:38,000
It's very emotional.

2490
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,680
The last night, you know.

2491
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:41,160
Yeah, sure.

2492
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:45,200
It was very emotional for me when I was fired from my tour guide job with a letter.

2493
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:48,760
I didn't get to share the emotion with anybody.

2494
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:54,440
But yeah, you have admitted you kept yourself on the role,

2495
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:55,640
the role call.

2496
01:32:55,640 --> 01:32:58,080
Like you kept yourself on the form for the free.

2497
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:00,840
Yeah, no, I never took a shift and I was only there for parking.

2498
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:04,320
So the most worthy and I had a full time job.

2499
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:06,400
So it was the most

2500
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:07,920
firing that made the most sense in the world.

2501
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:12,760
But I was an intern on the back lot and you had the badge

2502
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:15,640
and you could show the badge and park at the Frankenstein lot.

2503
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:19,680
And at the end of the semester, I was really like, do I get this back?

2504
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:23,520
I'm going back to these guys, but should I hold on to this?

2505
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:25,240
Because I'm thinking of moving back out here.

2506
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:29,400
You should have done what I did and make it take a color photo copy of the ID.

2507
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:32,720
So when it is seized from you, you can still flash a fake one,

2508
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:36,400
which I did for a long time until I got caught.

2509
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:40,760
And then luckily, the badge ended up at the desk of somebody who I knew.

2510
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:45,120
Probably told this one on the show before, but it's been it's been a long time.

2511
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:48,080
Make a quick aside about Frankenstein and Universal Studios.

2512
01:33:48,680 --> 01:33:49,880
This is really the podcast.

2513
01:33:49,880 --> 01:33:51,280
Yeah, I know it is.

2514
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:54,760
You know, I every time Universal emails me and ask for my opinion, I give it.

2515
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:57,600
I really want to help them build something beautiful.

2516
01:33:57,880 --> 01:34:01,720
And there was a thing I was like, which universal properties

2517
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:04,200
like would you want to see a world of this, this, this?

2518
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:07,840
And one of them is universal movie monsters like Dracula is really big for me.

2519
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:09,920
Like I always get a photo with Dracula there.

2520
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:11,920
And so then all the follow up questions are like,

2521
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:14,200
so say you're in a world that's universal movie monsters.

2522
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:16,200
What kind of music would you want to hear? What kind of food?

2523
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:17,760
And all my answers are like, I don't know.

2524
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:20,440
That's your job, but you just got to do it.

2525
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:23,200
That's blood, blood water.

2526
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:24,400
I don't know.

2527
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:27,320
I think full Lisa and Stephanie energy.

2528
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:29,560
All caps.

2529
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:31,360
They're like, I think whatever you want is fine.

2530
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:34,480
I think use your imaginations and anything can be true in Monster World.

2531
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:35,720
Let's go.

2532
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:39,480
It sounds like you influenced the Monster Land they're building in Florida.

2533
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:42,200
Oh, what? I told them that I live out here.

2534
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:43,680
Why would they do that?

2535
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:44,920
What are for me?

2536
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:46,440
Just, you know, a theme park goer.

2537
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:48,400
It sounds like maybe you're part of it.

2538
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:50,240
You may be like where the deciding vote.

2539
01:34:50,240 --> 01:34:52,120
Wow. Like an element of the land.

2540
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:53,200
Fifty one to forty nine.

2541
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:56,720
Yeah. It was like, are we going to play like happy in the month?

2542
01:34:56,720 --> 01:35:00,440
Like the Pharrell song Happy Here or is it going to be old scary sounding music?

2543
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:01,280
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2544
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:02,320
Music.

2545
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:07,200
The team we have you to thank then, I guess, for your survey enthusiasm.

2546
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:08,960
What are we missing?

2547
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:10,200
I mean, I'm just to the edge.

2548
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:13,280
She's wearing her biggest dress and doves come out of it and the song

2549
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:15,440
same song plays again, but that's great.

2550
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:16,640
Play it as much as you want.

2551
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:19,440
I mean, I think it's a I think it's a real victory.

2552
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:25,240
I think this entire I think Disney and Mattel and Barbie was a match made in heaven

2553
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:27,080
and in aesthetic heaven.

2554
01:35:27,080 --> 01:35:29,360
I love every shot of this.

2555
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:31,640
It's really fun to look at.

2556
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:32,840
I don't know what it did.

2557
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:34,320
Have we missed anything?

2558
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:35,240
Not from the show.

2559
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:37,560
I mean, just thoughts of like Barbie, like it.

2560
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:40,480
I'm sure there's a world where there was like a more permanent thing

2561
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:42,400
that ended up here, too, just.

2562
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:46,000
But it sounds like, yeah, there was like a lot of disagreement between the company.

2563
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,920
So, yeah, I just like I know there's a different time,

2564
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:52,440
like with money and such that maybe something could have ended up.

2565
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:57,240
That's that is where that there is not some permanent Barbie place.

2566
01:35:57,240 --> 01:36:01,560
There is something called Mattel Adventure Park coming in Glendale, Arizona.

2567
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:03,440
Yeah, yeah. I don't know much about it.

2568
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:08,360
I don't. Well, I see some thumbnails with maybe a Barbie presence.

2569
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:10,600
Oh, and a Thomas presence. Oh, yeah.

2570
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:14,600
I hope that they build this fast enough that my son is still that Thomas

2571
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:17,960
is the central part of his world so that we can get there.

2572
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:21,000
I think they are building it really fast.

2573
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:25,200
Maybe it's so fast that it's making me think it will not be a very good market.

2574
01:36:27,040 --> 01:36:28,880
But I see a Barbie Beach House there.

2575
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:32,560
And cool. We got some he man stuff and some hot wheels.

2576
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:33,080
I don't know.

2577
01:36:33,080 --> 01:36:35,840
Barbies is just from like Toy Isle real estate.

2578
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:38,640
Barbie had her own complete island.

2579
01:36:38,640 --> 01:36:41,120
Toys R Us. It was just wall to wall pink.

2580
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:43,920
I mean, you all remember doing going there or not going there

2581
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:45,720
because it was not for you into the blue island.

2582
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:47,640
Instead, the blue isle. Yes. Right.

2583
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:50,840
But it is just interesting that like that's got to be such a like

2584
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:55,400
one of the top things that didn't have like a permanent theme park presence.

2585
01:36:56,040 --> 01:36:58,680
And I wonder, yeah, I wonder, like, I guess even do you want a blue sky

2586
01:36:58,680 --> 01:37:01,080
real quick, what your Barbie ride or something would be?

2587
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:05,440
Oh, because it's got to you got probably have to be in the dream car.

2588
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:07,640
I would assume that's your ride vehicle.

2589
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:09,040
I think we would want a dark ride.

2590
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:13,560
So I'm to like, you know, there's these ride, the secret life of pets

2591
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:16,640
where it's like a little avatar of you and you're getting sprayed

2592
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:17,640
with water and stuff.

2593
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:22,840
And then there's like the car changing colors that those kind of little gags

2594
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:24,640
in the in the cars ride.

2595
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:25,360
But you got it.

2596
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:29,360
There's got to be something where it is you and you get to see yourself

2597
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:32,000
in a mirror in a bunch of different wardrobe changes.

2598
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,600
Well, I was thinking

2599
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:36,720
I'm the scary one at Disneyland.

2600
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:39,400
I don't know what's it called. Mr. Toad. No.

2601
01:37:40,680 --> 01:37:44,560
Well, I only say that because the devil shows up and you end up in hell.

2602
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:47,440
During the holidays is the nightmare before Christmas.

2603
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:48,520
Haunted Mansion.

2604
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:50,560
Yeah, Mr. Toad.

2605
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:51,720
Not Haunted Mansion.

2606
01:37:51,720 --> 01:37:54,560
But yeah, picturing that where, you know, you look in the mirror

2607
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:58,560
and you are the various ghosts, but it's you as the various Barbies.

2608
01:37:58,640 --> 01:38:00,000
Yes, yes.

2609
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,360
So that has to be part of it.

2610
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:05,200
So it's got to be some that you're like, you're getting ready

2611
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:07,640
for some big Barbie-bration.

2612
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:12,280
Yeah. And you get to like, I think we're fine.

2613
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:16,200
It's got to be, you know, I think it's not so character oriented

2614
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:17,640
because we've discovered this.

2615
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:20,120
It doesn't matter to people of midges in it.

2616
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:23,080
Wow. I'm like midges.

2617
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:25,720
Barbie's friend Roy is here.

2618
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:31,200
Roy was active from 1971 to 1976, and now he's not.

2619
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:35,440
I am interested in the movie because I looked at the IMDB.

2620
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:37,960
And, you know, there's a lot of Barbies and a lot of Kens.

2621
01:38:38,440 --> 01:38:40,200
There's no skipper credit.

2622
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:42,640
So there is. Is there a post?

2623
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:44,360
Yeah, maybe I'm just wrong.

2624
01:38:44,360 --> 01:38:46,880
I think it might be a celebrity cameo that I think.

2625
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:50,560
Yeah. Is there a post credit sequence with like a partially

2626
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:53,960
of like just lighting matches or something or smoking a cigarette?

2627
01:38:53,960 --> 01:38:56,200
And it's like, don't skip me.

2628
01:38:57,880 --> 01:39:01,480
The Hollywood gossip is that they're trying to build a Mattel cinematic

2629
01:39:01,480 --> 01:39:03,240
universe. Oh, I'm sure. Yeah. Yeah.

2630
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:04,720
Yeah. Makes a lot of sense.

2631
01:39:04,720 --> 01:39:06,840
Isn't it? Is wait Mattel Hot Wheels?

2632
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:08,880
Is that J.J. Abrams doing?

2633
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:11,280
Is that Hasbro? Yes. Kind of a gritty.

2634
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:13,520
Oh, that's Hasbro. Maybe that's a Hasbro universe.

2635
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:15,320
I don't think it might be Hasbro.

2636
01:39:15,320 --> 01:39:19,080
No, Hot Wheels, because Hot Wheels was in that picture with with Barbie.

2637
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:21,320
OK, so that's the Mattel universe, I guess.

2638
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:25,240
So Barbie will be driving a Hot Wheels car, maybe in a big crossover movie

2639
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:26,240
of some kind.

2640
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:32,360
I in terms of right, I mean, just as long as it is, just it's that

2641
01:39:32,360 --> 01:39:37,040
instead, as long as you are, you're in crazily bright cars.

2642
01:39:37,040 --> 01:39:40,160
Maybe it's like the Bibbidi Boppidi boutique or whatever.

2643
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:42,200
But kind of as a ride. Yeah.

2644
01:39:42,520 --> 01:39:45,560
If there's something that doesn't cost two hundred and fifty dollars per person.

2645
01:39:46,160 --> 01:39:47,320
That's probably for the best.

2646
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:48,640
There are more people in there.

2647
01:39:48,640 --> 01:39:50,800
We're like little girls go to dress. Oh, I know.

2648
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:54,480
Yeah. And for girls, it costs three hundred dollars.

2649
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:56,640
And for boys, it's fifteen dollars.

2650
01:39:56,640 --> 01:39:58,640
Really? Yeah. If you want to become a knight.

2651
01:39:58,640 --> 01:39:59,760
Oh, I didn't know that.

2652
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:00,840
You got to gel your hair.

2653
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:03,320
Knight or pally looks.

2654
01:40:03,320 --> 01:40:04,920
Pirate eye patch.

2655
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:08,000
They've got surplus glitter goo.

2656
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:12,280
They just with an unbreakable like a drugstore comb,

2657
01:40:12,280 --> 01:40:13,840
they just kind of give you a swoop.

2658
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:16,600
Yeah. Yeah. If you can just dollify.

2659
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:20,280
So, yeah, it's like at the end, it's like there's a box.

2660
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:21,840
Like you see yourself in the box.

2661
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:23,360
You're like Barbie's friend, Michael.

2662
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:24,800
And then it's like me.

2663
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:26,600
But I have a cool outfit on.

2664
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:29,720
Maybe it's sort of like interactive with like like Spaceship Earth is,

2665
01:40:29,720 --> 01:40:32,920
even though we don't like that element of it necessarily, where you choose things

2666
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:34,720
before you're on the ride.

2667
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:36,880
And then at the end, you see your whole thing,

2668
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:41,320
like your whole presentation of your toy or your Barbie's friend now

2669
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:42,640
or part of her family.

2670
01:40:42,640 --> 01:40:44,320
Either way, you can choose.

2671
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:46,520
Yeah, I don't want to be in a box, though.

2672
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:47,480
That scares me.

2673
01:40:47,480 --> 01:40:49,720
Barbie. I don't want to be stuck in a box.

2674
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:51,280
I want to be Barbie's friend.

2675
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:53,280
No, I don't want to be in a box.

2676
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:56,440
I don't get to hang out with Barbie if I'm sealed off.

2677
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:59,080
Now, I'm hit is going to get you and then take you home.

2678
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:02,680
Mike, you've talked about claustrophobia moments in the past.

2679
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:03,760
Do you want to be in the box?

2680
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:04,720
You want to be in a box?

2681
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:07,240
Well, because I would be very comfortable in the box.

2682
01:41:07,240 --> 01:41:09,840
I'm like, OK, you would.

2683
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:13,560
You would want to go home with a kid who was an inbox collector,

2684
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:15,480
as they call it, for toys.

2685
01:41:15,480 --> 01:41:17,400
Yeah, yeah, sure. Yeah, yeah.

2686
01:41:17,400 --> 01:41:20,920
I mean, I've talked before of like, oh, I want to do the Six Flags

2687
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:23,520
coffin challenge, but don't bother me.

2688
01:41:23,640 --> 01:41:27,080
Just leave me with my Agatha Christie, like audio books,

2689
01:41:27,080 --> 01:41:28,120
like leave me with my miss.

2690
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:30,240
Jason wants to sleep in a car.

2691
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:33,120
Jason wants to be in a coffin for 72 hours at a Six Flags.

2692
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:34,440
For six hundred dollars.

2693
01:41:34,440 --> 01:41:37,120
Well, you make six hundred and sixty six dollars or what?

2694
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:39,600
It's not even that maybe maybe maybe.

2695
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:41,480
Yeah. The possibility.

2696
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:43,960
And when they say, oh, it's time for you guys to move your legs

2697
01:41:43,960 --> 01:41:46,360
for five minutes so you don't, you know,

2698
01:41:46,360 --> 01:41:48,320
just letting up the biggest sigh.

2699
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:50,040
No problem here.

2700
01:41:50,040 --> 01:41:52,120
What time of the year is this?

2701
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:53,720
Well, it's around October.

2702
01:41:53,720 --> 01:41:57,920
Yeah. So I mean, that could be any temperature in Southern California.

2703
01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:00,360
And in New Jersey, I think it's a little chillier.

2704
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:02,760
You know, it really sounds bad. That's tough.

2705
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:06,200
Would you be like Barbie's ex Jason or something?

2706
01:42:07,560 --> 01:42:09,080
Because again, friends or family?

2707
01:42:09,080 --> 01:42:10,320
We're still on good terms.

2708
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:12,240
You know, I mean, it was unpleasant.

2709
01:42:12,240 --> 01:42:16,480
Breakups are always unpleasant, but, you know, still say Merry Christmas.

2710
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:19,000
What was that term you threw that I didn't hear never heard before

2711
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:19,920
about relationships?

2712
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:21,560
Situations. Oh, situations.

2713
01:42:21,560 --> 01:42:23,960
Jason had a situation with Barbie.

2714
01:42:24,120 --> 01:42:27,760
Those are like, OK, that's a negative kind of thing.

2715
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:31,160
You know, you made a commitment to Skipper and like, you know, that

2716
01:42:31,160 --> 01:42:33,480
you don't want that to be affected by your relationship with Barbie.

2717
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:35,640
Like, you know, you're you're staying in skippers life.

2718
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:39,520
Skipper's too young to understand the nuances. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2719
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:40,600
Yeah. I still yeah.

2720
01:42:40,600 --> 01:42:43,720
Still get a birthday present for Skipper.

2721
01:42:43,720 --> 01:42:44,960
Still get her a gift card.

2722
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:48,520
Still get her a Barnes and Noble gift card.

2723
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:50,400
She buys Barbies with it. It's fucked up.

2724
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:51,800
She there are too many toys.

2725
01:42:51,800 --> 01:42:54,120
Barnes and Noble, not enough books, too many toys nowadays.

2726
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:58,560
I think for a Barbie ride for me, this might just speak to what kind of ride

2727
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:02,640
I like, but I'm picturing like the Hogwarts Universal ride where it's like,

2728
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:05,600
what's going to happen in our imagination today?

2729
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:08,840
And it sort of swoops you to one thing and oh, it's you're the astronaut.

2730
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:10,160
And it swoops you to the next thing.

2731
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:12,800
And oh, you're a soccer star.

2732
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:14,600
And the swoozie to that thing.

2733
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:15,880
She does. Yeah.

2734
01:43:15,880 --> 01:43:18,040
And in the end, it's like and you could do even more.

2735
01:43:18,040 --> 01:43:20,160
And then your picture is on the wall or whatever you need.

2736
01:43:20,160 --> 01:43:21,440
So you could use the Kuka.

2737
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:23,120
It's the Kuka arm is what they call it.

2738
01:43:23,120 --> 01:43:25,080
Oh, yeah. So they can move you around.

2739
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:27,120
So you can sparkly transitions.

2740
01:43:27,120 --> 01:43:29,800
So the Kuka arm, you could like kick the soccer ball

2741
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:35,000
sort of in the vehicle and then you perform open heart surgery on someone with Barbie.

2742
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,160
Yeah, because she's a doctor and you're in surgery.

2743
01:43:37,160 --> 01:43:40,560
You're in like the operating room now or you're delivering babies or something.

2744
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:42,960
Sure. That's whatever.

2745
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:44,080
But she can do it all.

2746
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:46,600
Barbie having all the jobs is good because it doesn't.

2747
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:49,000
There's not that element of like

2748
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:53,920
it's not like empowerment by way of like

2749
01:43:54,920 --> 01:43:58,760
dullness, like Lola Bunny in Space Jam 2.

2750
01:43:58,760 --> 01:43:59,720
Oh, you know what I mean?

2751
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:02,160
Like she can have all the jobs and the jobs are great.

2752
01:44:02,160 --> 01:44:05,680
And also the wardrobe is still unbelievable.

2753
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:06,760
So she's delivered.

2754
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:11,280
It's the it's the most beautiful, sparkly forceps you've ever seen.

2755
01:44:12,600 --> 01:44:16,800
Even as like the blood splashes on her during the open heart surgery.

2756
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:18,760
But it kind of it looks like she planned it.

2757
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:20,600
Yeah, it's like like paint splatters.

2758
01:44:20,600 --> 01:44:20,920
Yeah.

2759
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:23,880
It's like a little heart shape on her, like lapel.

2760
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:24,480
It's adorable.

2761
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:26,760
Well, it always perfectly.

2762
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:29,360
If blood shoots out of a heart, it would stand to reason.

2763
01:44:29,360 --> 01:44:31,440
It would still maintain the shape as it's.

2764
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:33,840
But yeah, I love being a doctor.

2765
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:36,560
I lost another one today, but you can't win them all.

2766
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:43,840
My question is probably too much of a corporate nightmare,

2767
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:48,200
but like there's been a lot of Easter eggs already mentioned for the movie.

2768
01:44:48,440 --> 01:44:51,880
I know when Margaret Robbie has been doing like

2769
01:44:53,080 --> 01:44:58,760
stops along the like press stops promoting this or going to premieres,

2770
01:44:58,760 --> 01:45:02,760
Jane pointed out like all these outfits are dressing her in or like Barbie.

2771
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:06,680
Yeah, like classic outfits are like nods to like styles and stuff.

2772
01:45:06,680 --> 01:45:11,240
So could any of the music from this show show up in the mid?

2773
01:45:11,240 --> 01:45:14,560
Like a character is just turning off a radio at some point.

2774
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:17,680
Yeah, Barbie touched like you just hear a few seconds of it.

2775
01:45:17,680 --> 01:45:21,600
I mean, it would be it exists and they could just use it as is.

2776
01:45:22,520 --> 01:45:25,880
I bet they would think no, but like people don't know these songs enough.

2777
01:45:25,880 --> 01:45:30,080
Yeah. But they but also like people had these tapes and tapes

2778
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:34,040
wedge themselves into people's brains, such as Caroline.

2779
01:45:34,040 --> 01:45:37,960
So I mean, you could I think you in certain cases,

2780
01:45:37,960 --> 01:45:40,760
you would just get screams from the audience if there was a little

2781
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:43,400
touch of the Barbie touch.

2782
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:44,720
Sure. Boy.

2783
01:45:44,720 --> 01:45:47,360
Do you all have your tickets for Barbie yet? No.

2784
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:50,560
No, I don't have a big early ticket buyer.

2785
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:54,720
I'm not really I don't have a Barbie plan and we will be in Vegas

2786
01:45:54,720 --> 01:45:56,320
as it's coming out.

2787
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:59,840
So that so we I will at least have to wait for for things to die.

2788
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:01,680
Did you have a Barbie plan? Yeah, of course.

2789
01:46:01,680 --> 01:46:03,320
I don't know what you're talking about.

2790
01:46:03,320 --> 01:46:05,800
Yeah. Well, it's mostly my spouse who's very excited.

2791
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:09,680
But yeah, we got tickets the day they went on sale because it's going to sell out.

2792
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:12,960
And we're we've picked out our outfits.

2793
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:15,680
Yeah. We're opening night.

2794
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:18,240
Friday. So we're not going crazy on the Thursday midnight.

2795
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:20,480
But yeah, Friday night. OK.

2796
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:23,800
Anything to anything you're proud of in the outfits, anything you're like,

2797
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:27,200
well, this is going to well, you know, it's a classic, you know, kind of queer

2798
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:31,040
polyadult couple where it's like they're going to do like a version of Barbie

2799
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:34,560
Kenified and I'm doing a version of Ken Barbie fight, you know, we're we're,

2800
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:39,000
you know, finding the the the gender that exists between the two.

2801

01:49:43,640 --> 01:49:46,400
You're my California dream.

2858
01:49:47,520 --> 01:49:50,200

I don't know.

2866
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:12,000
I don't know if I want it from Brian Wilson.

2867
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:15,480
Maybe not from Brian Wilson, but maybe from Mike Love, you know.

2868
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:18,880
Yeah. You want somebody a little more sensual like Mike Love.

2869
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:21,360
Somehow he says it. He sounds furious.

2870
01:50:22,920 --> 01:50:24,960
Let me like ice cream.

2871
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:25,760
