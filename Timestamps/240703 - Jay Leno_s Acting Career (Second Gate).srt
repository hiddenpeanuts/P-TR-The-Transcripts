1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,360
It's the podcast the ride show with Jay Leno's acting career.

2
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:34,760
Tonight, Jay acts with Pamela Anderson, Walter Cronkite, Pat

3
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,200
Morita with Jason Eubanks and the podcast the ride show band.

4
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,360
That's right, Scott.

5
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,200
That's cold, huh?

6
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:43,800
All right.

7
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:51,560
And now Jay Leno's acting career, the topic on the

8
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,480
pocket story of the second gate.

9
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,680
Hey, isn't that nice to start with that?

10
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:03,040
You have to feel what they felt in famous studio one, let's say on the Burbank lot.

11
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,120
That's not one that sometimes, you know, the studio, like 8H, you know, we don't

12
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,040
know, nobody remembered, they didn't write down what studio they did it in.

13
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:11,760
Yeah.

14
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:18,960
Right by a major freeway exit for Burbank, you're heading to the Disney studios.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,400
Are you concerned about sound bleed or freeway?

16
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,480
Yeah, that's good point.

17
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,920
You want to be near a freeway, I think, just for, you know, helps audience, you

18
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,200
know, and it's not a big, a big deal for them.

19
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,680
Carson did it too.

20
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,880
So, you know, they were used to it.

21
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,800
Near the Wiener Schnitzel across the street.

22
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,720
You have to think that like, I mean, Jay's going to get recognized too much if he

23
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,320
goes to their Wiener Schnitzel himself, but you know that he sent out for Wiener

24
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,000
Schnitzels.

25
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:44,400
Yeah.

26
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,440
Every other day when he wasn't eating a big boy, he ate Wiener Schnitzel for

27
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:49,760
sure.

28
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,200
Hot dogs, hamburgers.

29
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,360
That was a pretty good, that was Ed Hall.

30
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:53,600
Right?

31
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,440
That was Ed Hall.

32
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,680
I don't know if I was even trying to do Ed Hall because Ed Hall was, Ed Hall was

33
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,520
kind of generic.

34
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,400
Ed Hall was his announcer, not for all of it.

35
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:00,680
Right?

36
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,560
Well, it was John Melendez, of course.

37
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,440
Suddering John.

38
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,880
Of course.

39
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,800
You remember.

40
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,600
That's another, it's one of those, those, those Jay Leno things that there's like

41
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,160
all, maybe not all talk shows, but a lot of long running talk shows have kind of

42
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:20,360
like, you remember this about the band or the sidekick or the, you know, of course,

43
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,920
you know, you can think of Carson's theme, you could think of Ed McMahon, but then

44
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,880
like, yeah, where did Jay do it?

45
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,160
Where did, who was his announcer?

46
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,280
What did he sound like?

47
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,880
Jay Leno.

48
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,080
This kind of nothing.

49
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,760
What was the song like even?

50
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,520
Like if you had to hum the Leno theme, I mean that, what, what, what I just played

51
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,720
was like not anything.

52
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,120
Yeah.

53
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,040
I guess I could have maybe gotten there, but I, yeah, it's not as memorable, but

54
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,160
like Letterman, do I know?

55
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,400
Is that it?

56
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,040
Yeah, yeah, that's, yeah, yeah, I guess so.

57
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,400
Yeah.

58
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,960
And then also like, did Leno never made Ed a character as much on the show?

59
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,560
I feel like.

60
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,240
Not really.

61
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:58,720
Yeah.

62
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,000
That's where he didn't seem to have a lot going on.

63
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,320
Cause like Conan's announcers all became characters or were Andy

64
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,720
eventually was the announcer.

65
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,080
Yeah.

66
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:07,520
Yes.

67
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,440
And then Letterman too.

68
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,840
But Joel Goddard, yeah, that kind of odd.

69
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,520
I mean, maybe not everybody knows.

70
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,120
I'm assuming, and not everyone out there is a late night with Conan O'Brien fan.

71
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,200
That's true.

72
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,000
But like, yeah, if you watched it, you know, you know, Weinberg and his weird

73
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,640
looks and you know, Joel Goddard and his weird looks.

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,920
Do you think that's why I wasn't like dating more in high school?

75
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,840
Cause I could go on and on about Max Weinberg and Joel Goddard bits.

76
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,880
Uh, no.

77
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,880
And trying to do it.

78
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,480
No, I don't think that's why.

79
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,680
Oh, it was the unpleasant sarcasm.

80
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,800
Okay, fine.

81
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,800
That was a subtly mean joke from Mike.

82
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,120
Like, no, I think the problems might've been deeper.

83
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,280
My problems were deeper than knowing Joel Goddard.

84
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:49,680
Yeah.

85
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,920
And doing the Joel like smile, like that big smile.

86
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,520
That big toothy weird.

87
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,200
Uh, I don't know.

88
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:01,240
I mean, it's just, I was just like some, there's gotta be some eligible girl at

89
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,280
this high school who also knows who these people are, uh, who could recognize

90
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,640
Brian McCann on site.

91
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,120
I don't know that there was a single girl in high school that did know that.

92
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:10,800
I don't think so.

93
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,120
I don't know.

94
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,080
Maybe I'm selling them short.

95
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,640
Maybe that is really offensive to say, but I don't know.

96
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,880
I don't, I never met them.

97
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,800
I was friends with a lot of people, uh, like girl wise.

98
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,560
I was, I was friends with, I was kind of friends with everyone.

99
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,520
Yeah, of course.

100
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,240
So I don't know.

101
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:26,840
I don't know.

102
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,560
And yet that didn't help with the dating ultimately.

103
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,240
Not really.

104
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,640
Or he just took you for, he's friends with everyone.

105
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,080
Well, my beyond friends with anyone.

106
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,360
I'm sure my type used to be people who are not interested in me.

107
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:40,840
Yeah.

108
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,640
But my charm will surely win them over my charm and humor.

109
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,520
And, uh, yeah, the damage of the Disney movies have done of like, I just

110
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,320
have to work very hard to win this person who doesn't know who I am over.

111
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,600
Surely won't make me come off like a extra big weirdo.

112
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:58,960
Yeah.

113
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,680
Well, there was one girl at my high school who I knew, and I knew that she

114
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,200
knew kids in the hall and the Christopher guest movies and things that were

115
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,480
important to me, and I just bided my time.

116
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,560
And after a while I married her.

117
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,120
So that did work.

118
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,680
It's already in the long run.

119
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,000
Yes.

120
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,320
We were not to be clear.

121
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,640
I don't know if the audience knows that Aaron and I went to high school together,

122
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,800
but we were not dating then, but.

123
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:22,520
Right.

124
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,560
It was like a 10 year plan.

125
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,040
Yeah.

126
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,440
Yeah.

127
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,160
I don't know.

128
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,080
It didn't even occur to me then admit it, but like, but I was like, wait,

129
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,400
whoa, there is a girl who knows these things.

130
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,920
So yeah, patience is the name of the game, I guess.

131
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,560
But we're not here to talk about the greatest comedy.

132
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:49,520
We're here to talk about Jay Leno and specifically his acting career.

133
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:57,000
Now we're using kind of that McGruff naming mechanism, but to say that he

134
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,360
had a full acting career is not necessarily accurate.

135
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,800
I mean, look, he's acted in more things than a lot of people.

136
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,960
Uh, uh, no offense to you guys, you know, professional actors.

137
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,440
He does have more credits acting.

138
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,320
He has so many more credits.

139
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,040
And that's just, that's after a long time.

140
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,120
And that's his celebrity, but this is an unfair comparison.

141
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,120
I don't know why I brought you in.

142
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,760
Now that now who's being mean.

143
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,160
Yeah, sure.

144
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,040
I don't act as much as the host of the tonight show and the Jay Leno show

145
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,400
with his green card challenge.

146
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,080
He's famous for the bits, the green card challenge.

147
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,480
Of course they're going to want him on other shows.

148
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,040
The acting comes from, from other things, obviously, and you want Jay

149
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,680
Leno cameos and things and all of that.

150
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,160
Most of the acting is concurrent to his standup work and his talk show work.

151
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:53,360
I have a broader theory to say as we sort of head into the Leno territory.

152
00:06:53,360 --> 00:07:00,640
And that is this talk show hosts acting is generally very strange.

153
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,160
Oh yeah.

154
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:06,640
Someone who you mainly know as a talk show host being in a movie or a show as

155
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,600
themselves, it's a little weird as not themselves.

156
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,080
It's extremely weird.

157
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,680
It's sort of akin to seeing a polar bear in the rain forest.

158
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,800
You're like, it's an animal and animals are in the forest, right?

159
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,640
Well, not that kind of animal and not that kind of forest.

160
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,560
There's just something about it that doesn't square.

161
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,280
And that's, I think the broader, interesting area of this to me.

162
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:32,880
I see.

163
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:39,440
Well, for talk shows hosts specifically, I always think that when, like, there's a

164
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,280
different vibe about their fake talk show in the universe or in like, or the real

165
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,920
talk show, like if Jimmy Fallon's doing a tonight show in a movie or a TV show,

166
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,640
he's acting a little different than regular Jimmy Fallon in the same way with

167
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,880
all of them, because a movie, a TV show is different than late night.

168
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,400
And there's a, there's a uptightness about it.

169
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:02,200
It's hard to recreate like what your show is like, like, for example, something

170
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:07,320
that happened when I worked at Conan, it was a little off when Conan did a live

171
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,280
interview with the billionaire character that Michael Caine plays in Now You See

172
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,040
Me from the monologue spot.

173
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,040
I think what might've been weird, cause I, you know, look, I worked there.

174
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,360
I saw every episode of the show and I don't remember on the real show him ever

175
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:26,000
being at not the desk, but rather the monologue mark and doing a live interview

176
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:31,160
with a not terribly famous billionaire who is on a plane as the interview is

177
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,320
occurring. Look this up if you haven't seen.

178
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:39,080
Now I feel shame as in Now You See Me head that I have not seen this segment.

179
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,280
It's in the film.

180
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,520
You don't recall Conan O'Brien's appearance in Now You See Me?

181
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,560
Uh, it's coming to me.

182
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,560
And this, I'm more of a Now You See Me 2 guy, I think.

183
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,040
Yeah, maybe me too.

184
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,160
Uh, I think, well, that, that says less about you and more about kind of the

185
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,040
stickiness of Now You See Me.

186
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,480
And I believe, wait, Arthur Tressler is the name.

187
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,880
Uh, we go now to Arthur Tressler in his private plane.

188
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,160
Now, what do you have to say about the four horsemen and Conan not making any

189
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,960
jokes? It is often a very strange thing that is the people that talk show hosts

190
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,240
are called upon to do, but I'm even more thinking and what I want to focus on

191
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:24,520
with Leno is the rare bird, which is the appearance as a character, as not

192
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,880
yourself. And I think a lot of what we'll talk about is him as Jay, as Jay.

193
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,480
However, just if you think about, you compare this to other prominent talk

194
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,320
show hosts. Johnny Carson did not ever, as far as I know, Letterman pretty much

195
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:37,760
did not.

196
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,760
Other than the Simpsons.

197
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,600
Oh yeah, true.

198
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,320
Cabin Boy.

199
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,400
Yeah, Letterman did in Cabin Boy.

200
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,200
And in that, now see, I think that a lot of the reason you don't see a lot of

201
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,480
talk show hosts as characters in movies is because it takes you out of it.

202
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:50,800
Right.

203
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,800
And in Cabin Boy, I feel like that the point is to be taken way out of it.

204
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,240
Yeah.

205
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,800
I mean, he's playing like a mean weirdo.

206
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,640
Like he.

207
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,280
Yes.

208
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,360
Oh, you're a fancy boy, huh?

209
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,120
You're one of those fancy boys.

210
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,720
Like boy.

211
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,320
Oh boy.

212
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,160
Do I hate those fancy boys?

213
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,560
I really like that.

214
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,200
Yeah, it's funny, but it's such a weird movie.

215
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,760
It makes sense that there's like suddenly David Letterman being a big weirdo.

216
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,360
You want to buy a monkey.

217
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,000
Mm hmm.

218
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,360
Yeah.

219
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,680
And it's, and that's like, he's doing it because he has, he trusts, he trusts his

220
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:31,960
old collaborator, Chris Elliott, that this will be a non-shame worthy movie that

221
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,800
people will talk about in glorious terms for, I mean, I know they do now, but it

222
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,320
was kind of a notorious bomb at the time.

223
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:42,200
Andy Richter talk show sidekick is in that film pre Conan.

224
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,880
Um, I think the talk show stigma in terms of crossover is so strange that when he

225
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:54,640
left Conan in the nineties to be an actor, him being a real actor, I think he

226
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,760
encountered a lot of people saying, what are you talking about?

227
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,240
Right.

228
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,600
That's like a monkey coming in and saying he wants to be an actor.

229
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,160
I think like everybody put like a sidekick is going to be in this.

230
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,720
Why?

231
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,880
As a novelty and he had to get over and like convince people, no, that is a

232
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,120
job that happened to me.

233
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,200
I didn't go to some sidekick school.

234
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,040
I am an actor and I, and then he was very good in a number of things.

235
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,040
Um, it's just, it's, it's a weird area in general.

236
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,080
Then you take like Conan and Kimmel into it and they will appear as themselves

237
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:30,480
in things, but mainly in a way of like, it's me, the talk show host in a suit.

238
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,160
And I have walked into a place that the talk show host is not supposed to be in.

239
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,360
And then that's kind of like, if the president or an astronaut comes into a

240
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,800
scene and the host gives you like, I'm sorry, the suit gives you like removal.

241
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,520
Like, okay, I've, this is happening because it's weird, right?

242
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,040
It's, it's just weird in general is what I'm saying.

243
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,960
Yeah, it's, it's weird in general.

244
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,920
I feel the same way about like, sort of when they do a newscast and it's like

245
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,760
generally fake newscasts are weird, but then when they have real people doing it,

246
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,080
like Wolf Blitz, I guess Wolf Blitz or Mission Impossible.

247
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,640
I kind of like, but

248
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,920
a lot of other things, but other things I don't, I'm like, it's weird that this is

249
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,600
Wolf, why is he even doing it?

250
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,120
Shouldn't he be busy with the news?

251
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,040
He doesn't have time to be in Mission Impossible.

252
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,360
And then if it's a fake newscast, I go, well, I've never seen this person before.

253
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,200
This is fake.

254
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,880
And then it's same sort of same thing with talk show hosts, where if it's a fake

255
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,400
talk show host, you go, well, this isn't how a talk show host is.

256
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,240
It doesn't feel like a talk show at all.

257
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,520
I know what talk shows feel like.

258
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,200
They didn't do it.

259
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:29,640
Right.

260
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,320
And then Jay is on and I go, well, this is weird too.

261
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,640
This is not how he is on his show.

262
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,520
Like, it's an oddness.

263
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,840
Sometimes I think they're able to create the vibe of like, because you got to,

264
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,560
I always wonder about the mechanics of it.

265
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,880
Like, how do they get these done?

266
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:48,280
Is it like, they got to slot it in between, like, we've just done the real

267
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,320
monologue and then like, hey, does everybody want to help us out?

268
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,320
We're doing a little bit of a movie.

269
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,080
I'm going to be an old part of wag the dog.

270
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,320
And then they kind of like keep the energy up.

271
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,280
And that's what you need.

272
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:00,320
If you can tell that the audience isn't there or the band isn't there, that kind

273
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,840
of thing is what makes it start to feel strange.

274
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,440
Right.

275
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:10,520
But there is some spontaneity on talk shows that is impossible almost to

276
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,920
recreate unless it's like, I guess Larry Sanders, but that's its own universe

277
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,280
they've created and established tones for both versions, like when they're on

278
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,160
air and when they're off.

279
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,960
Well, Larry Sanders and Curb, like a lot of these guys show up as

280
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,240
themselves on Curb Your Enthusiasm.

281
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,000
Oh, that's true.

282
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,320
Yes.

283
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,000
And I don't only like it.

284
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,800
I will say, because now you say that I'm flashing to Leno and Letterman and

285
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,840
anyone else appearing on Sanders and that works pretty well.

286
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:41,240
I think they knew how to because Sanders is so rooted in reality and, you know,

287
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:46,240
probably setting up a little situation where they don't get all hammy because

288
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,560
to bring it back to Leno, what I think is fascinating about this and this topic

289
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,880
that we've chosen is that for somebody who cannot act, he does a lot.

290
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,800
There's a lot more of this, I think, than anybody else that I just listed.

291
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,640
Did he ever say no to one of these?

292
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,320
God.

293
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,640
Well, there's no way to know.

294
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:10,760
I mean, I bet if it was like cake and you got to be naked, or you got to be

295
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:16,320
naked, I guess, but maybe if we do a body suit or something, that could be.

296
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,760
Um, he even like, he puts this, what I also find fascinating is he kind of

297
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,360
puts down his acting in general.

298
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,840
Uh, but yet he has been acting in things that aren't the tonight show.

299
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,480
Anytime anyone asks.

300
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,000
Yes.

301
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:31,320
Yeah.

302
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,280
So you always made the time.

303
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,920
I mean, this is a classic thing with Jay, which is it Jay?

304
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,720
Like, which, which actually is it?

305
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,920
I think he kind of likes doing it is my point.

306
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:41,960
Maybe.

307
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,040
I think he likes that because I think, you know, what you see him do is kind of

308
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,880
like, yeah, it's a lot of like, it's the jerky head and move kind of the, it's

309
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,680
almost like the stuff you do when you do a Jay Leno impression, he does

310
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:58,840
himself when he's at, he becomes like kind of a five to 10% plus up Leno.

311
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:03,000
So I think he likes, it's very like, it's like having a parent at it's like a dad

312
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
acting, he gets a little bit, I've directed my parents several times and I

313
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,920
know that the key is do less.

314
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,760
All right, dad do way less because you think like time to act and then you

315
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,320
like, do a little adjustment.

316
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:17,760
Yeah.

317
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,360
Well, now I have to flip a switch and I'm acting now.

318
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,640
That's still a thing.

319
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,360
Sometimes I have to say, like, you don't have to do very much if you're act

320
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,920
because it definitely feels like, okay, now I'm going to turn into a mutant and

321
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,640
I will act like, that's really what happened.

322
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,240
Like my eyebrows go weird.

323
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,920
I start to like, there was like, I just feel like you were like, I have to push

324
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,480
this, I have to push through the camera.

325
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,160
So people know I'm doing things.

326
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,880
It's like, that is not how it works.

327
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,720
Oh, yeah.

328
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:49,720
Well, acting training for like a live performance, like theatrical, often

329
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,800
you're playing to the back row.

330
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,960
So when you start doing it on camera, they're like, there is a microphone

331
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:00,280
above you, tamp it, tamp it down, you know, stop yelling.

332
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,840
Jay is yelling a lot.

333
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:07,120
Jay reminds me of Seinfeld acting just because it's like, oh, that's the

334
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:12,880
persona they honed on stage and he's just doing it on camera with his like,

335
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,240
whatever.

336
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,040
And it's like, he's a little bit removed from the situation with Jay more than

337
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,000
Jerry probably.

338
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,560
He got into the groove and also, and Jerry was constantly surrounded by three

339
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,520
fantastic actors, which helped, like he was, you know, couldn't help, but pick

340
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:29,480
up a certain amount, which he brings, which he, I think he really takes into

341
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,560
the smash hit feature film Unfrosted.

342
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:31,960
Sure.

343
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,800
Well, when I see it, I will, yes, I assume I'm going to agree.

344
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,560
Oh, I'm so excited.

345
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,320
I wish I was you with it still ahead of me.

346
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,960
I wish that I had this present to open.

347
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,880
You have Christmas ahead and I don't.

348
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,480
Okay, good, good.

349
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,640
Christmas is in my past.

350
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,400
I like Christmas.

351
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:54,080
One of the things I feel like with Leno is that in some of the stuff I saw, he's

352
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:59,240
delivering every line like it's like a standout punchline or setup.

353
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:05,160
And it's like, Jay, some lines in films just need to be lined, like some just

354
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,760
need to move things along.

355
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,120
Yeah.

356
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:07,640
Yeah.

357
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,600
Well, I mean, and you're right.

358
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:15,200
And that would be a great direction to give, but almost like if somebody told

359
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,560
him that would have any impact on anything that's going on, you know, I

360
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,120
don't think he wants more acting work.

361
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,840
I think the acting work just comes, even if he doesn't ask for it and he's

362
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,920
never terribly adjusted what he does.

363
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,520
And does he need to?

364
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,160
I don't know.

365
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,880
It's at least kept it to where it's all like interesting and dumb and funny

366
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,960
enough that we want to talk about it here, which I guess we're going to do.

367
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,320
I'm going to start going into some specific things.

368
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:44,600
Sure.

369
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:44,800
Yeah.

370
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,400
And maybe a good place to start is just that he, as I said, a lot of his acting

371
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,480
credits are him doing like monologue jokes in movies.

372
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,840
It's a good way to show that there are big stakes to the events of the film,

373
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,120
that what is happening has gotten famous enough that it can be

374
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,360
commented on by America's host.

375
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:04,840
Yes.

376
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,720
He did this in many things.

377
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,040
He did it on JAG.

378
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,800
He did it on DAG.

379
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:19,320
He did it in WAG, the dog, all sort of, all a variety of projects.

380
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,200
And then like, you know, anything about the president.

381
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,160
I feel like it, I think in Dave.

382
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,240
I was going to say, yeah, President Johnson's in hot water again.

383
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,560
This is what I wish I knew a little better.

384
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,560
I wish I could have, because I love fake movie presidents.

385
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:36,040
So I would love to like compile every time he talked about a fake movie president.

386
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:41,800
But sometimes the events of the, of the show or film require a little bit of

387
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,800
magical realism in order to get him in there.

388
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:51,720
And that's what I found in this clip, which I will play from the NBC soap

389
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,280
opera Passions, this one jumped out at me.

390
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,400
I remember that, you know, soap operas were on a lot of my house and my mom

391
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,200
watched days of our lives and that would, I think, run into Passions, which she had

392
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,480
no interest in, and I would just peripherally catch it and go like, so

393
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,240
there's like a witch and a doll boy.

394
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,560
The hell is this show?

395
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,640
Like it's that, that's a, that has some like weird shit in it, right?

396
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,920
Maybe we should watch Passions.

397
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,320
There's some supernatural stuff in Passions.

398
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,240
Cause my mom didn't care about Passions either.

399
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,920
I think there was, I think, but it was probably a certain mom, type of mom who

400
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,320
liked that supernatural stuff in the soap opera, but I wonder if Passions isn't

401
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,800
like good or at least interesting.

402
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,800
There's gotta be.

403
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,800
I know that, I assume that you could like to mention a talk show bit.

404
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,760
You could Walker, Texas Ranger, Lever, some out of context.

405
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:36,880
Yeah.

406
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,720
Or somebody out there just, there's a lot, there's all these out of context,

407
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,840
such and such accounts.

408
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,960
I'd love to see an out of context Passions.

409
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,560
If there is, I just haven't looked it up.

410
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,800
But anyway, this, this might be worth going in there.

411
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,960
I don't know what's going on with the Passions crew, but maybe

412
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,120
the scene will explain itself.

413
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:56,040
These so-called friends of mine are probably gloating over this, but

414
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,480
they're laughing at me right now.

415
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,280
The next thing you know, Jay Leno will be making fun of me on the tonight show.

416
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,520
Who wants to marry a multi-millionaire is back in the news.

417
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,680
Let's see, as socialized at Gwen Hoshkiss and social climate, Theresa

418
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,240
Lopez, Fitzgerald duke it out over rich boy, Ethan Crane of Harmony.

419
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,800
Boy, this sounds like a soap opera, doesn't it?

420
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,440
Anyway, when he's in shock, you see that Ethan called off their wedding.

421
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,480
After admitting he does have kind of the hots for, for Teresa, you see.

422
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,200
And Gwen, by the way, as you probably know, the winner of this year's, how

423
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,880
could you not see it coming award?

424
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,640
Hello.

425
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:37,800
I'm sorry, Gwen.

426
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,720
I'm not laughing at you.

427
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,000
I know you're hurting.

428
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:44,360
That was a little bit, that was a little bit like Chris Pratt trying to remember

429
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,760
the names of the Epcot center.

430
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,720
Things he loved as a kid on the guardians coaster.

431
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,200
Yeah.

432
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:54,880
Theresa Hawkins and the, uh, the veggie veggie fruit fruit.

433
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,120
Oh man.

434
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,040
It's so good.

435
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,240
So that was her imagining a little.

436
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:00,400
Yeah.

437
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,000
For the listener, this is kind of a fade.

438
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,840
You do a classic soap opera look, and then you fade into her imagining a

439
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,240
Jay Leno show that's talking about presumably her.

440
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,920
I would have to think that was a big complicated list of names.

441
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,720
You got to give them credit as a broadcaster.

442
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:19,120
Um, I think the only thing that's weird about it to your point, Mike, that these

443
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,480
things often feel weird is just like when in a talk show joke where there's

444
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:28,320
an economy of words, do you, is this, does the setup require three sentences

445
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,960
of soap opera style?

446
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,680
Who's who?

447
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,840
There's always something wrong in all these clips.

448
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,560
There's always something that you go, well, that's not right for this.

449
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:36,960
And you're right.

450
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,200
Yes.

451
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:43,600
The setup, why is Jay doing this long set up the events of passions?

452
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,040
I do really like that.

453
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:49,560
Then it shows, it does look, it does, it provides stakes within the world.

454
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:53,160
I think even the whole world is laughing at me or could be laughing

455
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,680
at me if this wasn't a fantasy.

456
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,520
Um, a lot of, I think there's a lot of this, I believe passions filmed like on

457
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:04,000
that, uh, Burbank lot next door near, uh, so, so that's pretty, you know, there's

458
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
a lot of like helping out the fellow NBC properties.

459
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,800
I'm in the family, you know, we all help each other out and that's how it works.

460
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,600
How did you, they're my family.

461
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,840
I can't anticipate them doing anything bad to me, uh, you know, way in the future.

462
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,160
Like, how did you get to Jay without the agent and manager to do a guest

463
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,920
spotting is calling the producer of the show?

464
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,120
Yeah, maybe.

465
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:24,640
Call tonight show probably.

466
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,680
Should we slot this in?

467
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,280
Yeah, yeah.

468
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:31,000
Uh, um, yes, or just like walk up to him in the parking lot.

469
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:31,280
Right.

470
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:31,840
Probably.

471
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,160
Right.

472
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,160
They know where he is.

473
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:38,040
Um, but so that's kind of an example of the norm, although that's a strange

474
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,600
set of things he's talking about, but I think where I started clocking that

475
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:47,600
it's funny when he's in things is, uh, the Flintstones movie from 94.

476
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,840
I don't have a clip of this.

477
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,280
It's not that worth playing, but Fred Flintstone is on the lamb for an

478
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:58,240
embezzling scandal and he is ducking around the streets of bedrock and there's

479
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:03,600
a TV in the store in a store window, um, that's playing the show bed rocks most

480
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,920
wanted and that's hosted by Jay Leno, who unfortunately I don't think gets

481
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,600
a rockified character name.

482
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,800
Uh, but you get to see him in a sleeveless caveman shirt, which is fun and

483
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:24,040
very natural because I think he has kind of a caveman sort of body and diet.

484
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,600
Maybe not diet because they ate a lot of like raw meat and he

485
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,520
eats the most processed meat.

486
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,280
It's possible that, yeah, no, I don't think Jay eats like big boy raw.

487
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,720
The big boy burger is raw.

488
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,360
Yeah, that is a great question though.

489
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,800
What does he, does he try to get them well done or does he go medium well?

490
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,240
He seems like a well done to me.

491
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:40,840
You think so?

492
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,200
Yeah.

493
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,000
Trump style.

494
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,440
Yeah, you might be right.

495
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:43,920
Yeah.

496
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,240
Yeah, that's a good question though.

497
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,880
Maybe we could, we'll find the answer to that somewhere.

498
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,480
Whatever gives it the least taste.

499
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,800
I think he's not after taste.

500
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:53,080
I think he, he doesn't even want to be like, I don't, you know, eating's just

501
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,280
stuff that I do to give me energy to go do stand-up.

502
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,160
If I could, if I could take a pill, never eat again.

503
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,040
Um, that, so that's all interesting.

504
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,640
Also provokes the question of like, you know, they're, I think they're pretty

505
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,000
clever in the Flintstones of like, how do they, all right, the bird is the record

506
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,120
player in the phone or whatever the TV.

507
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:10,800
They're like, I don't know.

508
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,400
It's TV.

509
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,320
It's crystals.

510
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,880
Crystals make it so the cavemen have TVs.

511
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,280
Right.

512
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,120
Do you buy that?

513
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:16,840
Crystals.

514
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
They didn't have crystals.

515
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,520
Why didn't they use crystals for everything?

516
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,680
Why don't, why don't they have computers and internet?

517
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,240
I don't know, man.

518
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:28,640
We have to have to, story means we have to have to be, it is black and white though.

519
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,280
Let's be clear where this isn't crazy.

520
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,320
It's not sci-fi.

521
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,600
We don't cavemen didn't have color TV.

522
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,120
It's not as wild as passions.

523
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,520
There's logic to this.

524
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:38,560
Yeah.

525
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,520
We don't want to be some off the rails passions type production.

526
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:41,800
Yeah.

527
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,320
There's, there's a rhyme or reason.

528
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,800
Passions was on for nine seasons.

529
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,440
Geez.

530
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:45,800
Wow.

531
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,400
Which is, and that's an episode every day.

532
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,120
Daily show.

533
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:48,440
Yeah.

534
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,000
So that's a tall order to do.

535
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,120
We're going to have to, you know, a separate podcast.

536
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,040
Yeah, I think so.

537
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,560
A daily podcast, but a separate one.

538
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:03,120
Anyway, that is one of Jay's filmed products that have the participation of

539
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:08,440
Steven Spielberg, John Goodman and dinosaurs because the main one, and I

540
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:13,080
think what maybe spurred this episode idea a little while ago was his

541
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,400
participation in the film.

542
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:21,840
We're back and dinosaurs story, which I Jason style, uh, borrowed from the

543
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,360
library last night, very smart.

544
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,560
It's not really streaming besides rental.

545
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,200
It's a rent.

546
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:27,440
Yeah.

547
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,600
And do I want to, yeah, do I want to pay the three 99 to just flip through?

548
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,960
Uh, we're back.

549
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,680
And with, with apologies, look, this was down to the wire.

550
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,840
I had to do what I could.

551
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:40,520
I didn't, if you're a fan of this film in general, I didn't really breathe it all in.

552
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,320
I kind of focused on his character.

553
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,120
VORB.

554
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:43,800
VORB.

555
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,240
Yeah.

556
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,320
Not a lot of VORB clips online.

557
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,720
I was looking for, if you just look up VORB, it doesn't come up.

558
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:53,400
Well, there is one though, uh, which I will play, which does give us a pretty

559
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,800
good sense of the, I've always been interested in this movie, not clearly

560
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,640
not enough to watch it, but I, you know, I remember it being an early clocking

561
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,640
of like, so there's non Disney movies.

562
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,160
Okay.

563
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,240
And it seems like there's cartoon movies that are less popular at school

564
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,840
than the ones that I think about all the time.

565
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,880
It doesn't seem like any kid is wearing a We're Back shirt.

566
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:19,440
Um, so this was in 93 and it was like a, not a fiasco, but it was not like, and

567
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,440
maybe like a little bit well regarded if you like kind of that era of, you know,

568
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,360
the post American tale kind of stuff, you know, great hand drawn animation in it,

569
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,480
but it also looks a little wonky, which maybe you can see the writing on the wall

570
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,120
of like needing to switch computer.

571
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:34,520
Right.

572
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:39,160
Um, so, uh, here's the context of this scene.

573
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:47,480
Um, we meet Rex, John Goodman's T-Rex character, and he, when we meet him, he

574
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:53,760
is golfing and talking, which establishes a reality in which dinosaurs golf and

575
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,760
talk, and you might wonder, how did we get to this point?

576
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:03,400
And the answer is, then you, then you flash back and you see a like feral

577
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:07,000
version of, you know, like a regular dinosaur version of Rex.

578
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
He looks scarier.

579
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,960
He's not talking.

580
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,840
He's roaring.

581
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:17,160
He's chasing after some prey until a steampunky airship arrives and it glows

582
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:22,840
with light and then out of it comes a weird little alien with a propeller on

583
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:27,400
his head who's after our hearts because he talks in a very familiar voice.

584
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,640
Um, so here's out of the airship and then maybe the rest of the

585
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,720
scene, uh, explains itself.

586
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,280
Here's Vorb.

587
00:27:52,840 --> 00:28:18,920
That gives you an idea, uh, doing a voice and this, this is kind of the thing about

588
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:22,520
it for somebody who I think has what my guess would be that he doesn't have a

589
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,400
lot of range.

590
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,720
That's kind of a, it's pretty good.

591
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,160
Yeah.

592
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,160
He kind of gets there.

593
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,320
That's a, that's a little bit of a, hey, puts it on and like, I, you know what?

594
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,840
I've, if I think let's assess this all at the end and maybe pick a favorite

595
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,680
performance, but I think Vorb is going to be the one to beat because he sort of

596
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,440
does, but this might be his only true character, right?

597
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:47,120
Well, he, he does more voice acting.

598
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,760
He is, he does.

599
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,320
I mean, I have a little more about we're back, but we, but, but, uh,

600
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:59,320
the, the context here, by the way, is that he, uh, uh, he offers the, this

601
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:04,160
dinosaur brain grain cereal, which is something that, that I guess makes you

602
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:04,680
smart.

603
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,480
He lures him into the spaceship in a kind of grotesque scene, force feeds a

604
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,640
bunch of cereal into his mouth.

605
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,720
Uh, and then after which immediately he like pops a little bit and then becomes

606
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,280
a fun cartoon dinosaur.

607
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,880
Um, so now he can talk and stuff.

608
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:27,200
And then you meet some other smart dinosaurs and then you meet Vorb's boss,

609
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,400
professor new eyes.

610
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,720
Has anyone seen this movie?

611
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,920
No, this is all, it was pretty good.

612
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:38,320
Actually, I might encourage at least watching what, what I watched.

613
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,160
Uh, so you get to see a little interaction with his boss, uh, uh, I'm

614
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:48,440
sorry, captain, captain new eyes, uh, as voiced by Walter Cronkite.

615
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,520
And this is what I think we were noting when this came up before is that the

616
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,200
cast is all broadcasters.

617
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,360
Julia child also appears in this.

618
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,760
Um, so Leno works with Cronkite.

619
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:03,080
Uh, at some point he comes out and he's like a folksy guy and he said, like,

620
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,920
just a kindly grandpa fella.

621
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,760
And at some point he says, Hey, Vorb.

622
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,160
And he says, that's the truth.

623
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:12,040
Skipper classic, uh, new eyes.

624
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,200
Vorb interplay.

625
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,720
And then he explains his deal, which is, uh, you know, after all the

626
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:23,960
money I made on brain grain, uh, now I travel the world and through time to

627
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,960
make a few wishes come true.

628
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,920
And that's why I use this.

629
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,560
It's a wish radio.

630
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:35,440
This is a lot more complicated than what I knew about the movie.

631
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:35,680
Yeah.

632
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,360
When you heard the title, we're back.

633
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,520
Do you have any guesses as to why they're back?

634
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:47,640
Um, uh, it could be time travel or eggs hatching in central park and they're

635
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,160
just trying to figure out New York city.

636
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,040
That's what I thought the movie was.

637
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:52,360
Yeah.

638
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:56,040
I didn't know there was kind of like steampunk and inventor and he kind of,

639
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,440
you're getting passed a lot.

640
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,840
The main thing he tells you is that he made a lot of money on this smart guy

641
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,560
cereal, but then the fact that he invented time travel is just kind of

642
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,640
glossed over as just part of the new wise deal.

643
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,400
Don't worry about it.

644
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,680
We are on the way to wish radio.

645
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,880
That's the main thing.

646
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:15,560
Uh, so then he plays messages from his wish radio, which indicate that a lot

647
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,920
of kids wish that they could see dinosaurs.

648
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,840
Uh, Oh wait with it.

649
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,200
I can hear what young people are wishing for, especially young people

650
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,200
because they wish the loudest.

651
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,200
Oh, my kid, he learned how to wish.

652
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,840
He's keeping me up every night with his loud wishes.

653
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:39,560
I guess maybe audibly loud adults wish.

654
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:44,800
Maybe I would argue adults sometimes wish harder, but in a quiet way, silently

655
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:45,760
in your head.

656
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,120
Yeah.

657
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,760
And to prayers count as wishes.

658
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:51,960
Do you hear prayers or does this, does the wish radio filter it out?

659
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,400
You got prayers go to God, wishes go to professor new eyes.

660
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,920
Sorry, captain new wise.

661
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,400
I'll explain why I'm getting mixed up.

662
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:04,880
Uh, so that, that info dump happens and then like, so you're going to earth in

663
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,000
1993.

664
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,640
Here you go.

665
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,920
When you get there, there's two people to look for.

666
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:09,960
One is Dr.

667
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,600
Bleeve.

668
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,000
She's very nice.

669
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,280
That's Julia child.

670
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,800
The other is professor screw eyes.

671
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,000
He's my brother.

672
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,880
He is cruel and insane.

673
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,080
It's really sells out his own brother.

674
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,600
No love lost from the, who seems like a very kindly man.

675
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:30,360
He was, he will absolutely, he will tell the, the, uh, God honest, brutal

676
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,440
truth about his brother.

677
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:31,960
Wow.

678
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,680
Um, so this is, I mean, this is a

679
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,400
really intriguing.

680
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,680
I just honestly didn't have time.

681
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,160
I still have it, uh, from the library.

682
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,440
So do I finish it?

683
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:45,360
Uh, I've looked, probably still not, but, uh, if you're interested or, you

684
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,200
know, now, you know, check it out from the library, it did make the

685
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,120
DVD cut on like, uh, Boris and Natasha.

686
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,440
Oh, right, right, right.

687
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,800
No, I saw it to come.

688
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,320
I saw it to watch that.

689
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,480
You really, you really do.

690
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,840
This is your yellow stone.

691
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:04,640
It is, it is right under the TV next to my copy of the

692
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,480
La Nuba DVD I bought.

693
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,360
Oh, wait, you do.

694
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:07,680
Wow.

695
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,520
You have both of those.

696
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,120
I did.

697
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,360
Yeah.

698
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,400
I bought both of those.

699
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:14,000
They were both about, uh, $4, $4 or $5.

700
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,600
Well, obviously you have to prioritize.

701
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,480
La Nuba is the most important piece.

702
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,400
Well, that I watched a rip of.

703
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,920
There is a full rip of it, but I had to see those special features.

704
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:30,680
Uh, hi, Hey, Hey, uh, love the new, but check out La Nuba.

705
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,600
Um, uh, anyway, then they show up at the Macy's parade and they, uh, walk

706
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,960
around and stomp on a bunch of dinosaur balloons and they deflate them.

707
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,880
Which is ironic because ultimately, uh, Rex was a Macy's balloon that

708
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,320
did deflate, uh, during the parade.

709
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,680
Uh, so that's the story of VORB.

710
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:51,160
Uh, um, the, the, and you're right that this is like part of a very

711
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,680
fruitful, uh, voiceover career.

712
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:57,160
This is actually, that might almost be the most, there's a lot of Leno voiceover.

713
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:57,800
Yeah.

714
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,960
I, the main one I was thinking of, and I remember kind of watching it at the

715
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,280
time was fairly odd parents.

716
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,120
He is the crimson shin and the villain naked shin.

717
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:15,760
Uh, he's both, I think he's credited as both that I saw that required.

718
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,880
Now I'm not, I haven't watched any of this admittedly.

719
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:21,920
I, I'd be curious about the duality and whether he can pull off one of the most

720
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:25,760
difficult acting challenges there is, you know, there wasn't the same actor playing

721
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,880
captain new eyes and professor screw eyes.

722
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,480
So to put that all in one, one actor like Leno, that's a lot.

723
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:37,200
Mike, have you confronted Lindsay about is the crimson chin coming back?

724
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,400
Have we had discussions about that?

725
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,960
We had discussed discussions about it.

726
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,440
I don't know.

727
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,360
I don't know if I'm ready to say anything, you know, I will say Jim

728
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,720
Cummings though, did do dark wing duck and naked ducks voice.

729
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:53,760
You might say he's more accomplished voice actor than Jay, but yeah, yeah,

730
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:58,680
more, you know, a little more prominent ones, but you know, Leno was also busy.

731
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,400
This might've been his direction if he wasn't busy with a nightly show and

732
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,360
250 standup dates a year.

733
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:05,840
Yes.

734
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,120
Yeah.

735
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:06,240
Yeah.

736
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:10,800
And constant and like, and zero time between show taping and getting on a

737
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,640
private plane to go to Duluth.

738
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,040
Right.

739
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:22,440
So anyways, uh, the, yeah, uh, uh, now he's, he's in the Disney family enough

740
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,320
that there's a Disney, he's on Disney Wiki.

741
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,800
There's a lot of Disney stuff to, to, to bring up.

742
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:32,200
Uh, uh, he's Billy Beagle on Mickey and the roadster racers.

743
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:39,280
Um, so your child might love Billy Beagle and therefore the voice of Jay.

744
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,760
Um, I don't have a lot of, I don't really have anything on Billy B.

745
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,920
That's a lot to go through.

746
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:45,680
Yeah.

747
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,680
Um, but you know, they made him a car guy, which is a common thing.

748
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,000
I think here you'll see that a lot where he gets to mess around with cars on screen.

749
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,520
Seems to be a big way to get him.

750
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,040
That's how they got him on Titus.

751
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,000
Yes.

752
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,200
Sorry to disappoint everyone.

753
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,440
I don't have a clip of his appearance on Titus.

754
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,640
Well, Jason was telling me about his last man standing work.

755
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,600
Oh, yes.

756
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:11,600
And yeah, I have seen that last man standing the Tim Allen show.

757
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,960
I feel like I need to explain what it is, even though that was a nine season.

758
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:15,640
Right.

759
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:19,880
Unbelievably popular and successful show that actually, you know, it's

760
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:26,640
funny, uh, that he's like, he owns like a big old outdoor store.

761
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,680
And in the establishing shot, it's clearly a doctored Bass Pro shops.

762
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:31,760
Right.

763
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,120
Yeah.

764
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:32,520
Yeah.

765
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,680
So I like it.

766
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,480
I'm sure I would like it.

767
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,640
Uh, what does he do on, on the last man standing?

768
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,360
He's not playing Jay.

769
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,960
Oh, there you go.

770
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,200
But he's another car guy.

771
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:50,200
Tim Allen plays, uh, himself, himself, I think a lot.

772
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,000
He owns a giant outdoor store.

773
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,600
And he also vlogs where he complains about millennials.

774
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,040
Right.

775
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:58,520
Right.

776
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,080
Yes.

777
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:04,600
So in real life, he would be unbelievably popular, successful, uh, full

778
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,920
industry around him.

779
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:09,400
His endorsement could make or break the presidential election.

780
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,240
Um, yeah, no telling the power of the sky in reality.

781
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,880
And does he have a right, Jason, does he have a rivalry with Tim?

782
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,200
Oh, Jay, there's a rival.

783
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:22,240
So there's a rival, but it's a little winky of borrowing like Tim's tools.

784
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,080
If I know anything, I know that's not a, this sounds like, this sounds like a

785
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:30,280
good enough Tim rivalry to rival Toy Story.

786
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,400
The two, the two great boating of heads of Tim Allen characters.

787
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:40,160
Uh, he's a King Malbert and Igor, of course.

788
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,840
Uh, I don't know a lot about King Malbert.

789
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:46,600
I mean, mainly the, to me, the shiniest object in the voiceover world.

790
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:52,040
It's a very brief, but he does do a brief, uh, you know, kind of single

791
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:59,200
line or single joke cameo in cars as the indelible, maybe ultimately the part

792
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:05,720
he'll be known for the most given the popularity of cars, Jay limo, which is

793
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,520
a great car name.

794
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,000
It's really good.

795
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:12,160
It's so clean when they put that together, they must've been high fiving.

796
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:18,240
Um, and it's a really good world expander of the, of the cars of verse.

797
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:23,240
You know, you established early on with Bob Cutlass, that there are like

798
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,840
commenters, that there's play by play people and that makes sense because

799
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,520
we're in a world of car racing, but it's not a given that there would be monologue

800
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:35,040
jokes poking fun at the events of famous cars in the car world.

801
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:38,000
It's also very much like a new version of the Flintstones thing too.

802
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:44,320
Just name wise, it's like a fun way to be like, we have a version of this person

803
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,800
in our universe as well.

804
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,480
So that we can, yeah.

805
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:53,560
So we can have our, our equivalents, you know, our, our, the car version

806
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,120
of Mick Jagger or whatever.

807
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:55,680
Yeah.

808
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,800
And they're more clever.

809
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,160
No offense to the Flintstones.

810
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,920
There's more to work with.

811
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,600
Yeah, that's true.

812
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,400
You're dealing with rocks in the past.

813
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,120
I mean, they try to keep them all on the three yet it's rock or stone pretty much.

814
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,920
But with cars, yeah, that's true.

815
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,040
There's many, many options.

816
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:13,240
Even as I was saying that, I was like, well, it would be Mick Jaguar.

817
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,920
Oh yeah, that would be good.

818
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,000
Yeah.

819
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,480
That's pretty, yeah.

820
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,360
And cars four, which I assume is coming.

821
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:25,000
Uh, I, you can all, I mean, it's the one that like the other ones, they've had to

822
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,880
get their heads around, like, do we do sequels to these?

823
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:32,000
I mean, given the emotional punch of the previous ones, do we go back cars?

824
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
The one like, how, how many do you need?

825
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,240
Yeah, we can get up to cars 22 decade.

826
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:38,840
Yeah.

827
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:42,120
I don't know if I, I guess I really haven't heard them announce that.

828
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:42,400
I don't know.

829
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,560
Is there a problem because of John, big John not being there anymore?

830
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:46,600
Hmm.

831
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,120
Yeah.

832
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,640
I mean, that's his baby might've been the main fuel.

833
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,200
Yeah.

834
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:50,680
Yeah.

835
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,320
I don't know.

836
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:51,760
We'll see.

837
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,120
Uh, yeah, I don't know.

838
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,120
Uh, if there are more, I'm hoping for more Jay limo.

839
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:01,400
And there's also, while that, while Jay limo himself kind of expands the world a

840
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:07,960
lot, I was doing my own world expansion, which is wondering, uh, did Jay limo get

841
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:16,400
his position presumably at 11 30 car time, uh, on that show due to, uh, the

842
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,640
backroom dealings of aggressive manager.

843
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,040
Helen Karshnik.

844
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,120
I'd like to think the answer.

845
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,440
I think the answer is yes.

846
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,600
Well, he really, what kind of car is Helen?

847
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,600
Um, who, huh?

848
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,480
I don't know if I know cars well enough.

849
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:37,680
Probably a station wagon, like a wood prison bus, prison bus is

850
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,200
better.

851
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,320
I just still aggressive vehicle.

852
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,960
Well, it's something that can hide the spikes, but then like, you know, unfurl

853
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,040
them all of a sudden, I just still feel so bad for a car.

854
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,160
No, no Buick.

855
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:56,760
Yeah.

856
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,640
I was going to say car, no, no Brian.

857
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,040
And then I was like, B car, B car.

858
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,240
I found it on the fly.

859
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:02,560
Yeah.

860
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,000
I found it.

861
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,080
Carnot.

862
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:04,280
No.

863
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:05,640
Wow.

864
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:06,880
Listen.

865
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:12,880
And then he fuckers don't have the lug nuts to keep that, that, that limited

866
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:19,840
popularity hack, Oh, Buick back at 12 30 where he belongs, then do I need to come

867
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:25,280
in and, uh, rip your carburetor out a late, so you want to like a late shift,

868
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,200
all cars in the cars verse full late shift only Pixar cars.

869
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:36,480
There is stuff in cars that like ask, you know, raises more questions

870
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:42,960
than answers because there's a one very quick shot, excuse me, in the first

871
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:49,040
movie where Bonnie hunts car, like goes to drive away and you see she has a

872
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:54,560
tramp stamp as if like, Oh, she had a wild phase in her younger years before

873
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,320
she was a lawyer who started running a desert motel.

874
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,120
Wow.

875
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:05,960
Um, and I, I was like, is that, I don't know if they still call them tramps.

876
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,600
They, that's what they used to call them when they were popular.

877
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,720
It might be an outdated term.

878
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,200
It might be an outdated term.

879
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:19,680
Uh, but she, she has like a tribal tattoo, like below her trunk, above her tail.

880
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,640
My barrier.

881
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:25,400
So above her trunk, it's a toilet trunk stamp.

882
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,040
Then we could say, uh, yeah.

883
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,040
Well, I mean, what does it call?

884
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,000
What does a wild time for a car and tail is the question?

885
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,600
Like, like, like, uh, huffing antifreeze.

886
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,520
Well, she went to sprocket break.

887
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:39,920
Yeah.

888
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,640
I've been writing this movie while we're sitting here doing a podcast.

889
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,520
Well, look, I'm already, I'm already doing a draft of blade.

890
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,040
So I may as well do a draft of cars while I'm there.

891
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,720
We're all doing a draft of blade.

892
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,800
We're trying to help out.

893
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,360
Everyone's doing a draft of blade.

894
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,800
Is it the blades in trouble and you're just throwing your head in the ring?

895
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:00,040
Yeah, they fired like five or six writers at this point.

896
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,240
They're onto their second director.

897
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,080
Somebody from a Mahershala Ali's camp who's playing blade and the new version

898
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,000
was just like, I've never seen anything like this.

899
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,520
I've never experienced anything like this where this has taken this long

900
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,840
to figure out what's going on with this movie.

901
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,680
They announced at Comic-Con 2019.

902
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:16,280
Wow.

903
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:16,920
Wow.

904
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,000
So no, Jason, so simple then you put on a hat and it's like a done deal.

905
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,520
Now it turns out it's complicated to figure out the whole movie.

906
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,440
Apparently it is.

907
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,040
Wow.

908
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:25,320
Wow.

909
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,360
Pitching in blade is cool.

910
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:32,600
Sprocket in this in the world, in the cars world, spring is called sprocket.

911
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,720
That's what the season is.

912
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:41,320
So when the winter is when window tour

913
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,760
because cars have windows, right?

914
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,680
That's true. Yeah.

915
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:50,760
Yeah, I mean, that's that's the rules of summer is sputter.

916
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,640
And then fall is pretty hard.

917
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,920
Fall is hard.

918
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,960
Just to give you something more to auto, auto or just auto bond.

919
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,840
Auto bond. Yeah, that's probably fine.

920
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,680
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

921
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,760
What does this refreshing auto bond weather?

922
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,360
Yeah. Fall is good time for nice drive.

923
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,480
Oh, and the 90 mile an hour auto bond.

924
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,840
On the insane roads of Germany, when you're a race car, that is relaxing.

925
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,960
Yeah, that's actually that's going slow for you.

926
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:26,360
Yeah. Well, anyways, more Jaylen, more Jaylen, oh, please, more Helen Karshnik.

927
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,320
Late gear, late gear shift.

928
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:33,800
He competes for the for the slot with against David Jeddaman.

929
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:39,360
OK. Maybe he's got a big gap in his grill.

930
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,840
Oh, that's good. Yeah.

931
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:41,680
Let's see.

932
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,440
Bonnie Hunt's character is wild college or grad student.

933
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,800
I mean, it could be law school.

934
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,640
Is she going to cut loose in law school?

935
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,040
You write that spin off that wild spin off.

936
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,640
Sure. Bonnie Hunt's character, what is her name again?

937
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,200
Is she Holly?

938
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,240
Uh, no, that's the agent.

939
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,760
No, that's the spy one.

940
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,840
It's a pretty shift.

941
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,120
Is there Holly Shiftwell?

942
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,400
Well, that's a spy. That's the other spy.

943
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,040
It's something else.

944
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,960
Her name is something very plain, whatever it is.

945
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,640
That's what I. Yeah. Yeah.

946
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,240
Sally Carrera, Carrera, Carrera thing.

947
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,640
OK. The sky blue 2002 Porsche 911.

948
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,320
Hmm. Porsche 911.

949
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:23,440
And which we we are left to assume is the most beautiful kind of

950
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:27,600
because like there's light and checks her out when she spit.

951
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,520
Probably when she's revealing that snap that you're talking about.

952
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,320
Lightning's given her the up and down.

953
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,840
Like, yeah. Can you imagine?

954
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:38,360
Well, there's a porch in the desert in like this small desert town.

955
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,360
That's unusual.

956
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:42,080
There's a hot sports car here.

957
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,520
Yeah. Can you imagine how weird the meeting was when Lasseter

958
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,960
had to like explain to everybody exactly why this was the most attractive car

959
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,640
and what was attractive about it?

960
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,320
Like how creepy that must have been.

961
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,360
Everyone's like, really thought about this.

962
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,800
What's the car again? Like she's a Porsche.

963
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,440
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

964
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:02,480
Because when you're caught into the car gaze,

965
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:07,840
powder blue is the pretty you cannot resist.

966
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:13,120
Yeah. The most the shiniest powdery blue running around hugging everyone.

967
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,360
I you know, not to disagree with you.

968
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,000
But I feel like in a car's universe,

969
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:22,120
a sports car would be like the classically attractive.

970
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,280
Well, you're not disagreeing with me. You're disagreeing with John.

971
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:27,800
No, I'm unfortunately, I'm agreeing with John.

972
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,920
You are agreeing with John. Oh, you get it.

973
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:33,080
So you would have done the same speech if you ran Pixar.

974
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,280
Yeah, I mean, I guess.

975
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:40,440
I mean, do you have another standard for beauty for cars?

976
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,840
I've never thought about who the hottest car might be.

977
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,760
What kind of brand or type the hottest car?

978
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,920
Sports cars tend to have a lot of curves.

979
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:51,320
So if you're in the it's analogous, I guess, too.

980
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,640
Interesting. Yeah.

981
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,160
I never thought about it till Cybertruck came into my head.

982
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,440
Oh, well, yeah. Hello.

983
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,040
That's like you're going the other way.

984
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,240
You want an angular.

985
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,600
Scott likes a big boy.

986
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,360
You want the first first generation Laura Crawley.

987
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,480
Yeah. Tomb Raider.

988
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,200
Scott's got like Tomb Raider a lot.

989
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,200
Yes. Yes. It finally fulfills.

990
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:13,360
There's something in the real world that feels like a polygons.

991
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,680
Polygons, the sharpest.

992
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,560
Oh, don't poke me with the polygons.

993
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,480
Oh, I don't like when you poke me.

994
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:22,400
Oh, my gosh.

995
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,720
I'm going to have to take the whole episode here

996
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:26,280
not to think about what the hottest what I think the hottest car.

997
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,920
The hottest car.

998
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,880
If you're Mike, if you're going to be in a creative environment,

999
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:36,000
you need to be ready at all times to say what the hottest,

1000
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,880
cutest car is.

1001
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:40,720
I mean, I think about this all the time.

1002
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:44,680
There's certain is that like we had a nineteen eight like Plymouth van.

1003
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:46,960
But do you were attracted to that?

1004
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,840
Like, well, I'm not saying I was attracted to the van.

1005
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,400
You're putting words in my mouth.

1006
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,000
That's what I'm saying.

1007
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,600
It is aesthetically pleasing.

1008
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,240
OK, what was the kind of a van was it?

1009
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,080
It was a Plymouth.

1010
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,040
We had a minivan.

1011
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,560
I'm trying to remember even what it was that maybe that's my problem.

1012
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,240
You're thinking on that.

1013
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,760
I know that you're not saying you want to have sex with the van.

1014
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,160
It was like a tan brown.

1015
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,480
I don't know. I'm guessing late 80s.

1016
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,360
It's just like a Plymouth van.

1017
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:16,160
I mean, look at this.

1018
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:20,080
Are we talking brown panel or is it like wood paneling?

1019
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:21,480
It was wood paneling.

1020
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:22,320
Yeah. OK.

1021
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,160
What color the rest of it, you think?

1022
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,200
Tan.

1023
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,760
The rest is tan, but wood.

1024
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:27,840
Oh, I see.

1025
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,840
Well, I think we might be looking at a Grand Voyager then.

1026
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,680
OK, let me take a look there.

1027
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:33,440
What do we think?

1028
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,080
OK, I don't know that I'm so attracted to it.

1029
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,240
I like it for a retro kind of vibe.

1030
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,000
I think it's an aesthetic I like.

1031
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:40,800
It was very fun.

1032
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,840
It was very sad when we got rid of it.

1033
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,040
Do you want to touch its little Plymouth star?

1034
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,520
Get all up on its Plymouth star?

1035
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,160
I don't know that I've ever wanted to touch a car,

1036
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:57,400
its little decorative brand logo.

1037
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:02,920
You know, I guess the Batmobile from Batman Forever I like.

1038
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,040
I don't know if I'm attracted.

1039
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,240
I guess I'm attracted to it.

1040
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:08,160
Again, that's a pretty notable aesthetic.

1041
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,040
Batmobile is actually more phallic,

1042
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:13,440
if I really think about it, than it is kind of male.

1043
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,040
No, it's fine.

1044
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,920
I'm just saying I'm trying to think of what these cars say

1045
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:20,320
to me on an attraction level, which is a new territory,

1046
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:20,960
I feel like.

1047
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,120
So I'm just learning as I say the words here on the show.

1048
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:30,400
So in Batman Forever XXX, Bruce Wayne admits his identity,

1049
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:35,440
brings Dr. Chase Meridian home with him and says,

1050
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,760
I just want to make you an offer, take it or leave it.

1051
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,960
Would you like to have sex with my car?

1052
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,560
It's like an indecent proposal or something, yeah.

1053
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:45,160
Maybe that's why.

1054
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:47,160
Her hair kind of blows back, it zooms way into her,

1055
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:49,920
and she's kind of like, oh, maybe.

1056
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,400
I hadn't thought about it, but I'm thinking about it now.

1057
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,120
As a psychiatrist, I think I must do it,

1058
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,160
just as a mind experiment.

1059
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,560
Just an experiment.

1060
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:04,560
Baby, I could bring you to a kiss from a car.

1061
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:07,120
That can still make it into my Batman Forever II script,

1062
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,160
so we'll see.

1063
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,880
We'll see if that makes the cut.

1064
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,680
When the most attractive female chase

1065
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,840
and the most attractive male, the Batmobile, get together.

1066
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:15,800
Yeah.

1067
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,680
OK, real quick, what's the hottest Batmobile

1068
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,480
of all the Batmobiles?

1069
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:20,200
What do you think?

1070
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,680
I think it's got to be the Bert.

1071
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:25,400
Well, because I love the animated series Batmobile,

1072
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,360
but it's kind of blocky.

1073
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,360
It's almost full Cybertruck style,

1074
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,920
but it is kind of blocky and angular.

1075
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,840
But I mean, I think it's certainly not

1076
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,880
the Tumbler from the Nolans.

1077
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,240
No offense to the Tumbler.

1078
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,880
Again, a cool vehicle, but not.

1079
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:43,240
Original Burton has that big nub in the front,

1080
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,760
which I think is like a missile that fires.

1081
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:49,000
But you know, you could view that as phallic.

1082
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,560
You could view it as akin to a nipple, if you wanted to.

1083
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:55,560
I think it gives you something to caress.

1084
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:58,880
So I'm going to lock in my vote for original Burton Batmobile.

1085
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,400
We have Burton Batmobile.

1086
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,600
I think that's good logic.

1087
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,880
I think, you know what?

1088
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,240
Batman and Robin has fun colors.

1089
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:11,600
I might even say the Batman and Robin, the Clooney Batmobile.

1090
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,800
I think I'm going to go iconoclastic

1091
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,720
and go with the Batman forever.

1092
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,400
The Tumbler?

1093
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,400
No, no.

1094
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,320
Oh, Batman Forever. I misheard it.

1095
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,600
I'm so sorry. Not the Tumbler.

1096
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,960
Yours, yours.

1097
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:25,840
No, I don't like the Tumbler.

1098
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,160
I don't know why it's on my mind.

1099
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:31,200
No, I'm saying Batman Forever, your movie.

1100
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,800
I'm saying I'm not obsessed with the Tumbler secretly,

1101
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,600
and that's why I keep bringing it up.

1102
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:38,240
I'm not attracted to it. That's what I'm saying.

1103
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,240
I like when it flies.

1104
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,000
Does it fly in the third one?

1105
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,440
I think it flies in the third one,

1106
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:46,520
because it flies the nuclear bomb out into the water.

1107
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,720
Are we allowed to pick the plane?

1108
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,280
Or just cars? Cars only.

1109
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,520
The Batwing, I think so.

1110
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:56,920
From Batman Returns as the plane, as the Batwing.

1111
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,240
Well, the Batwing's in the first movie,

1112
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,400
because he gets the, during the parade.

1113
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,680
It is in the first movie.

1114
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:04,560
Yeah, he gets all the balloons, and he shoots them up in the air

1115
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:05,880
that have all the Joker gas in them.

1116
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:08,640
Right. There's like one or two audience members

1117
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:13,920
who have been fireworks factory-ing every other episode

1118
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,120
and going, when are they going to talk about

1119
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:18,440
which Batmobiles they want to fuck?

1120
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:23,800
Well, finally, it's happened, and you can thank Jason for it.

1121
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,000
Seven years.

1122
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,600
Thank John Lasseter and Jason.

1123
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,720
You're very welcome. Can I repay you with a hug?

1124
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,280
Jason, could you say the same line now?

1125
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:35,720
You're very welcome. Can I repay you?

1126
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,640
No. No. I don't want to.

1127
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:38,840
Don't incriminate him.

1128
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:39,960
All right. All right.

1129
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,360
Let's go back. Sorry. Sorry.

1130
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:45,760
I, what, did you have more voice acting?

1131
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,480
I, you know, no, if you want to close out the voice area,

1132
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,760
I mean, I have a whole other zone that I can get into,

1133
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,360
but, you know, don't let me dictate it.

1134
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,160
If there are other, what I'm about to do

1135
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:59,720
is move into his work in 90s syndicated television,

1136
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,960
but if anybody else has another area,

1137
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,360
they'd like to fit in there first.

1138
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:06,000
Well, I think the area I focused on,

1139
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:10,400
unfortunately, is his sole leading man role.

1140
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,360
This is important. Do you want to end on that,

1141
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:14,640
or do you want to end on the sitcoms?

1142
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,760
I think we could do some, we could do the film right now.

1143
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,400
And this is, you know, this is important, I think,

1144
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:24,160
because this does offer up a alternate universe, Leno.

1145
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:28,160
If this works better, maybe we get busy with a film career,

1146
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,720
and not with The Tonight Show, because this is 89,

1147
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,840
this comes out, you know, so this,

1148
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:37,560
and this is definitely not, this is the opposite of him

1149
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:40,040
just being a talk show host in a suit.

1150
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:41,360
Would you like to tell us about the film, Jason?

1151
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:45,760
This is the 1989 movie, Collision Course,

1152
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:50,360
and I saw the AKA of this movie,

1153
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,960
Kamikaze to Detroit.

1154
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,960
Unfortunate, this is-

1155
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,760
And I don't want to know the other AKAs.

1156
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:59,760
I don't want to know the AKAs they didn't settle on.

1157
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,960
And this might be the worst thing

1158
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,960
I've ever watched for the podcast.

1159
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,000
Did you watch the whole thing?

1160
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,560
I watched the whole thing,

1161
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,960
because I found a rip on YouTube.

1162
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,400
Man, I've tried, I've like, it's been,

1163
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,160
it's been on Macs, actually, for Here and There,

1164
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:18,320
and survived all of the gluts, all of the wipeouts.

1165
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,800
And as you could tell from this episode,

1166
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,880
I'm very interested in Jay Leno and in Jay Leno acting.

1167
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:26,000
I've never, I've always collapsed somewhere

1168
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,400
in like minute eight of that movie.

1169
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:30,280
I've just been seeing like the poster,

1170
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:33,440
or like the VHS art box of him, like back to back,

1171
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,800
with co-star Pat Morita,

1172
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,960
who has some funny lines in this movie.

1173
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,760
Pat Morita, I think, is funnier in this movie than Jay Leno.

1174
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,360
Well, he's a movie star.

1175
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:47,200
Yeah.

1176
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,720
He's just been in some extremely popular movies,

1177
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,920
and on Happy Days, and you know,

1178
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:55,040
he's a professional comedic actor,

1179
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:57,680
which is something that Jay Leno was not.

1180
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,400
I think Jay might be miscast a little bit, too, here.

1181
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,760
Yeah, well, you think he's like

1182
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,640
a second or third choice, maybe?

1183
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,240
Yeah, that's a good question.

1184
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,280
I could see that being the case,

1185
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,320
because like, where is, he's still a couple years away

1186
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:11,640
from The Tonight Show, but he's doing the guest spot

1187
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,680
on Carson at this point already,

1188
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,640
so he's pretty well known.

1189
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:18,320
But it still feels like a lead in a movie.

1190
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,360
He hadn't, I mean, he's in other movies,

1191
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,920
but yeah, I wonder if.

1192
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:22,880
They wanted, they were going through,

1193
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:23,880
it was probably all stand-ups,

1194
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:24,840
and they're going through the list,

1195
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:26,520
and just everybody's busy with touring,

1196
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:29,600
so like Steven Wright, no, no, he won't do it.

1197
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,760
Emo Phillips, no, no, Emo won't do it.

1198
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:35,880
Michael Keaton, you're not gonna believe this,

1199
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:38,600
but he's filming Batman right now?

1200
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,240
Batman, what do you mean?

1201
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,520
This would be way, Collision Course

1202
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,080
would be way better for him.

1203
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,760
He's gonna look like a fool in that suit.

1204
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,680
This role is Detective Tony Costas.

1205
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:53,680
Yes, he is a Detroit detective, works in robbery,

1206
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:58,760
and Pat Morita is a Tokyo detective,

1207
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:03,440
and he is sent to America to get,

1208
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:07,040
to find a prototype that had been stolen,

1209
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:11,000
stolen from another, from a car company.

1210
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,560
Okay, so it's cars again.

1211
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:13,760
We're back to cars. So it is cars.

1212
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,160
And maybe they didn't think of him for it.

1213
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:20,760
In the opening credits, Jay Leno is driving a Corvette,

1214
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:24,160
which kind of comes back into play later in the movie,

1215
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,520
but he's driving a big old car.

1216
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:27,560
He was probably like,

1217
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:30,840
Hey, can that come back into play a lot?

1218
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:31,880
Actually, what if we can't, you know,

1219
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,000
this scene I don't think we need,

1220
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,120
I think all these lines we don't need,

1221
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:35,600
can I just spitball him?

1222
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,080
What if I'm just driving a Corvette again?

1223
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:39,880
Actually, what if I'm fixing the Corvette?

1224
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:41,120
Actually, what if you don't film it,

1225
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:44,120
and I just fix the Corvette, and I don't do this movie,

1226
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,440
and I go do some stand-up?

1227
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:49,200
A lot of, I mean, there's so much about it.

1228
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:53,080
This movie is very cheap, which comes into play.

1229
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:56,680
There's a note on the Wikipedia, which is very funny.

1230
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:01,640
When Merida guest starred on The Tonight Show in 1989

1231
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:04,520
with Leno serving as guest host,

1232
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:07,400
they recalled that the movie had run out of money

1233
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,200
on the last day of filming,

1234
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,800
with key scenes yet to be shot,

1235
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:15,480
and no budget left for editing and post-production.

1236
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:17,560
You need that.

1237
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:18,880
Yeah, that's important.

1238
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,720
It definitely, towards the end of the movie,

1239
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:25,800
just kind of in, it just kind of wraps up.

1240
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,520
It just freeze frames on something,

1241
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,560
like this movie's in, what do you want?

1242
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:32,240
They'll buy it, the suckers will buy it.

1243
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:35,600
Some of the budget may have gone to

1244
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:40,600
staging a fake car race going on in Detroit,

1245
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:46,480
which does not play into the movie plot at all,

1246
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:49,760
besides when Jay Leno and Pat Merida

1247
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:53,080
ride a motorcycle through this car race.

1248
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:55,080
Again, this is a J note.

1249
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:56,920
It's a J thing.

1250
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:58,440
I just had an idea.

1251
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,520
What if there's a car race?

1252
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:02,200
Well, that's a good boy.

1253
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:04,680
We did have that money earmarked for editing and post.

1254
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:07,240
That's boring stuff.

1255
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:08,080
You go vroom, vroom.

1256
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:10,360
Yeah, vroom, vroom is what we need.

1257
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,200
A little vroom and then a little vroom, vroom, vroom.

1258
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:14,720
We have all different kinds of engines.

1259
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:18,160
I was, in the trailer, these clips are there,

1260
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:23,160
which I watched, and it's like Jay's doing a stunt.

1261
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,080
I was like, is Jay an action hero

1262
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,880
kind of in this movie as well?

1263
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,120
Yeah, kind of.

1264
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:31,680
There is some action, other odd things about the movie.

1265
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:36,160
Ernie Hudson is in the movie in about two or three scenes

1266
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,160
and is behaving like he is an actor

1267
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:42,160
playing a supporting role in a movie,

1268
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:45,600
unlike Jay Leno, who is screaming most of his lines,

1269
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:46,760
stand-up style.

1270
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:50,520
You watched this movie from another room.

1271
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:52,160
You watched it from the bathroom.

1272
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:54,600
It's a little loud.

1273
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,680
I'm gonna get some distance from this.

1274
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,480
Jay is also like a creep in that movie.

1275
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:02,560
He looks the female police officer up and down

1276
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,440
in the first minute of the movie.

1277
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,120
They really lean into that heart.

1278
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,920
They're like a human version of a Porsche.

1279
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:13,040
Yeah, he's asking every woman in the movie

1280
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:17,120
for her home phone number for police business,

1281
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,400
which is creepy.

1282
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:23,040
There are a lot of jokes about Japan.

1283
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:26,280
By when I say jokes, I mean saying the words

1284
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:28,080
Godzilla or sushi.

1285
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:35,600
I think the movie is rooted in anxiety

1286
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:39,520
of Detroit falling apart and the rise

1287
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:44,520
of affordable, reliable cars from Asia.

1288
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:50,440
Honda, Toyota ostensibly is the theme in the movie,

1289
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:55,000
but that just comes out in everyone hating Pat Morita.

1290
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,720
Everyone being very racist to Pat Morita

1291
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:03,400
in a way that some of Rush Hour holds up,

1292
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,480
doesn't hold up in this movie,

1293
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:07,160
there's jokes where you're like,

1294
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:10,320
oh, I don't think you, you certainly can't say that now.

1295
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:13,800
I don't think you should have been saying that in 1989.

1296
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,680
Well, luckily no one saw it at the time.

1297
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1298
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:20,440
There's no need to put the content warning before it

1299
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:21,640
because that implies that anyone

1300
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:23,080
is turning this movie on.

1301
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:26,000
Whoever owns the movie, literally there was just

1302
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,760
a little light bleeped at their headquarters yesterday.

1303
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:29,960
Somebody watched the movie.

1304
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:32,160
We haven't seen this in years and it was you.

1305
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:35,400
No one's finished this movie.

1306
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:37,160
Since the editor had to finish it.

1307
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,760
Someone watched the illegal rip on YouTube.

1308
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:40,600
The YouTubers, yeah.

1309
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:41,800
Yeah, well, these things are known.

1310
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:46,600
Seems fair to, I'm mad about foreign cars

1311
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,800
and what that's doing to Detroit.

1312
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:52,480
I'm gonna put all my anger on this police officer.

1313
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:53,320
Yeah.

1314
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:54,160
Seems fair.

1315
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:58,400
There are, of course, a number of jokes about karate.

1316
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:04,880
There's a funny gag where they're talking about Mickey Mouse

1317
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:08,600
and Pat Morita says, we have Disneyland now in Tokyo.

1318
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,520
And Jay Leno was like, no, you don't.

1319
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:14,280
And Pat Morita was like, yes, we do.

1320
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:17,760
Because, you know, it opened by then.

1321
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:18,600
It did.

1322
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:19,440
It's right here, if you wanna hear it.

1323
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,320
What kind of Mickey Mouse system you got in Japan?

1324
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:23,320
Mickey Mouse, American invention.

1325
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:25,360
Right, you guys aren't clever enough to think about it.

1326
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:28,000
Now, we have Disneyland now near Tokyo.

1327
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:28,840
Do not.

1328
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:29,680
Do not.

1329
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:30,500
Do not.

1330
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:31,340
Do not.

1331
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:32,160
Do not.

1332
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:33,000
Do not.

1333
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:33,840
Do not.

1334
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:34,680
Do not.

1335
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:36,320
All three of us are in the theater.

1336
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:37,160
Ha!

1337
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:40,160
In an otherwise silent screening of collision course,

1338
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:44,120
three guys at one point just said ha, not even a big laugh.

1339
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:45,760
I think the average person didn't know

1340
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,640
that there was Disneyland there.

1341
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:48,480
Yeah, I don't know.

1342
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:49,320
So, like, how did that play in?

1343
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:50,600
It was like six years later, yeah.

1344
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:52,640
There's no internet, why would you know that?

1345
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:55,960
How would that scene play to an American audience

1346
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,480
who doesn't know that?

1347
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:00,360
They stand up like, bullshit, there's no such thing.

1348
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:02,680
Now we know that character's a liar.

1349
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:04,920
Travel agents in the audience are like,

1350
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:06,820
yes, no one believes me.

1351
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,680
Finally, proof.

1352
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:11,880
Thank you, collision course.

1353
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:14,760
I otherwise don't like your politics and your stereotypes,

1354
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:17,560
but in this case, you've been very helpful.

1355
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:20,480
There's some massive, if you can believe it,

1356
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:23,640
there's some massive logicals towards the end

1357
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:28,640
where they track the leads to a garage

1358
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:33,600
and it's really like, oh, that's in Duke's territory.

1359
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:38,200
The gang, the Dukes, they're really dangerous.

1360
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:42,920
Jay Leno leaves his car, his Corvette, by this garage.

1361
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:44,760
It is never addressed again.

1362
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:48,360
He also, Pat Morita drops the gun in this garage.

1363
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:51,920
So a cop's gun is left in this garage

1364
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:54,720
and it is never followed up on.

1365
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,840
But probably the worst thing in the movie,

1366
01:02:56,840 --> 01:03:01,520
the big bad villain, the head of a luxury car company

1367
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:04,320
who wants to use the stolen prototype,

1368
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:08,000
is named Derek Jarrett.

1369
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,120
And that is a bad movie name.

1370
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:13,320
I don't know how names sound.

1371
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:14,160
Derek Jarrett.

1372
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:14,980
Derek Jarrett.

1373
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:15,820
I kind of like it.

1374
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:17,000
I kind of like it, actually.

1375
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,640
There you go, bust this Derek Jarrett.

1376
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,480
Derek Jarrett.

1377
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:25,240
Jarrett also is spelled J-A-R-R-Y-D.

1378
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:28,000
I've never encountered that in my life.

1379
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,120
I've never seen that.

1380
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:31,220
What is this, Elon Musk's son?

1381
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:33,720
What is this, Elon Musk's son?

1382
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:36,560
What is this, Elon Musk's son?

1383
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:37,880
All right, we got a great show.

1384
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:39,280
Melissa Etheridge is here.

1385
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:43,040
Now that felt right.

1386
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:43,880
That was right.

1387
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:45,240
No, that was perfect, yeah.

1388
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:48,120
I can't believe you inflicted this whole thing on yourself.

1389
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:50,680
I did, because I was like, oh, well,

1390
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:51,840
for the Pride Night episode,

1391
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:54,640
I was going to try to watch all of Strange World

1392
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:56,600
and I didn't get around to it.

1393
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,440
I ran out of time.

1394
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:00,400
And I already know that it's a much better movie.

1395
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:03,640
You've been in the market for a great film.

1396
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:07,600
Well, and I had watched Jay Leno's Cars Co-Star.

1397
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:10,280
I watched an old Paul Newman movie called Harper

1398
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:12,440
a few days ago where he plays an old.

1399
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:16,880
Framing Paul Newman as Jay Leno's Cars Co-Star.

1400
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:20,400
Whatever's on his tombstone, erase it and put that.

1401
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,520
And I'm like, oh, I was reading about that.

1402
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:26,000
And I'm like, oh, it's the adaptation

1403
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,600
of the first Lou Archer novel, which I've read a few of.

1404
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:31,440
And it's awesome.

1405
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:36,440
And Lauren McCall is in it as the older client.

1406
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,520
You mean that she's her old pal

1407
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:40,440
or that it is an old film?

1408
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:43,400
She's older from, it's the late 60s,

1409
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:47,440
so she's older than the Key Largo or Hay Day.

1410
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:48,960
What's the name of the character?

1411
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,160
It's older than Kindergarten.

1412
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:52,000
What's that?

1413
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,080
What's the name of the character, Lou?

1414
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:54,000
Lou Archer.

1415
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,680
Archer, and that's who Paul Newman plays?

1416
01:04:56,680 --> 01:05:00,960
Well, they changed the name to Harper for whatever reason.

1417
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:02,520
So he plays it in this movie

1418
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:06,760
and then he plays it in a later movie called Drowning Pool.

1419
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:07,960
Oh, like the band.

1420
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:09,200
Like the band, yeah.

1421
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,200
Let the body set the floor.

1422
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:14,880
Wow, Peter Graves played Lou Archer as well.

1423
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:16,560
How about that?

1424
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:17,380
I don't think I knew that.

1425
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:18,220
I didn't know.

1426
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:19,740
Hmm.

1427
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:22,180
So you, have you heard about this?

1428
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:23,020
Have you heard about this?

1429
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:25,460
Peter Graves is playing Lou Archer.

1430
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:27,500
Jay Leno would probably love to talk about

1431
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:31,860
Harper's beat up old convertible.

1432
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:34,880
Well, Brian Keith also played Lou Archer.

1433
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:35,720
Oh.

1434
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:36,560
How about that?

1435
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:37,380
Did you know that?

1436
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:38,860
I didn't.

1437
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:40,580
Sometimes I think if I wasn't here,

1438
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:43,700
the podcast would be 100% the exchange that just happened.

1439
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:45,860
Then like just have 45 seconds of silence

1440
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:47,740
and then Jason and I both looking at Wikipedia going,

1441
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:48,660
what else?

1442
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:50,780
Okay, hmm.

1443
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:54,500
I wondered, did a Carradine ever play?

1444
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:55,340
Archer?

1445
01:05:55,340 --> 01:05:57,020
Oh, look at this.

1446
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:59,980
Brian Keith was on an Alfred Hitchcock Presents.

1447
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:02,140
Okay, yeah, this is his version.

1448
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:03,420
This is just Jason and I alone.

1449
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:06,740
I think a young Ed Asner could have worked as Archer.

1450
01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:08,440
Do you ever watch Family Affair?

1451
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:12,260
When FX started, they started showing Batman 66

1452
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:13,980
and they started showing this old show

1453
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:16,380
called Family Affair that my mother loved.

1454
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:17,660
Brian Keith, when you both start talking

1455
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:19,980
about Quest Diagnostics for a while.

1456
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:25,100
I've had a terrible time lately.

1457
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:27,640
USPS informed delivery informs me

1458
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:29,500
they're sending me something today.

1459
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:31,060
I don't know what it is.

1460
01:06:31,060 --> 01:06:32,740
I checked my informed delivery as well this morning.

1461
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:35,220
I love my informed delivery.

1462
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:37,340
So, okay, but we are in a world where

1463
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:38,660
I am one of the hosts of the show,

1464
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:41,420
so we got anything else about collision cores?

1465
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:42,980
I don't know.

1466
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:45,860
I also turned it off because I went, oh my gosh.

1467
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:47,380
It's rough.

1468
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:49,180
It is really, yeah, it's really terrible.

1469
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:50,620
I guess the only thing in my head is,

1470
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:52,220
because this was the Kuznick era

1471
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:54,340
and I am wondering about her negotiations

1472
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:57,060
to lock him in as Costas.

1473
01:06:57,060 --> 01:06:58,780
And if there were any efforts to like,

1474
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:00,500
what's this I hear about Merida

1475
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:02,700
asking for the same that Jay's making?

1476
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:04,940
Pat Merida is top-built because again,

1477
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:05,940
he's a movie star.

1478
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:06,780
Of course.

1479
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:08,560
I know and it drives me crazy.

1480
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:09,740
That's insane.

1481
01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:10,980
Merida's old news.

1482
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:12,500
How long ago was Happy Days?

1483
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:14,300
10 years ago, 15?

1484
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:15,540
He's in the past.

1485
01:07:15,540 --> 01:07:17,340
Leno's the wave of the future.

1486
01:07:17,340 --> 01:07:19,740
I should go up to Merida's trailer

1487
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:21,540
and rip his fucking sack off

1488
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:23,500
for even attempting to get the same money

1489
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:25,900
that the hottest comedian in America's making.

1490
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:27,100
Come on.

1491
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:28,780
This is the new Midnight Run

1492
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:32,380
and Jay is Grodin and De Niro all in one.

1493
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:34,220
You're lucky they're even pointing the camera

1494
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:36,380
at your dogshit client, Merida.

1495
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:39,780
She wrote the script probably.

1496
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:41,980
You and me and Pat Merida are gonna be working

1497
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:43,820
in this town for a long time.

1498
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:46,340
Let me tell ya, I'm never looking him in the eyes again.

1499
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:48,380
He's dead to me and so are you.

1500
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:51,980
That's like your most effortless character, I think.

1501
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:52,820
It really is.

1502
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:55,460
That's how much the late shift is in me.

1503
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:56,940
If you haven't seen it,

1504
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:58,900
Ellen Kushnick has played by Kathy Bates

1505
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:01,620
and if it is like, yeah, it's in there.

1506
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:03,060
That's why you need to do that.

1507
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:05,060
I said this when we did the late shift episode,

1508
01:08:05,060 --> 01:08:07,620
the full late shift series.

1509
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:09,860
You show running a late shift show

1510
01:08:09,860 --> 01:08:11,940
which is really just about Jay and Helen.

1511
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:14,780
And then you can make up most of it.

1512
01:08:14,780 --> 01:08:17,500
Well, look, you have to because she passed away.

1513
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:18,340
Well, right.

1514
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:19,620
So you would have to,

1515
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:22,980
but you, I think, just have to include her in like,

1516
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:27,540
Jay does joke after joke, night after night.

1517
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:31,020
He has more jokes per minute than any other host on TV

1518
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:32,820
and this guy comes out and fucks around

1519
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:35,260
with a string dance and touching his nipples.

1520
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:37,780
He belongs in a crazy house.

1521
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:39,460
My first move will be to lock him up.

1522
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:41,220
Forget him taking the Tonight Show.

1523
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:43,020
I want him behind bars.

1524
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:45,620
This is like, you would have to, again,

1525
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:47,300
we're backed at a lot of explanation,

1526
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:50,060
but maybe there's a Marvel universe type explanation

1527
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:52,180
where alternate universe Helen Kushnick

1528
01:08:52,180 --> 01:08:55,140
comes through a portal in like 1997

1529
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:56,940
and she just comes back to Jay

1530
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:58,940
and then manages Jay for the rest of his career.

1531
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:00,460
Well, that's the end of the first season.

1532
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:02,060
Eight or 10 episodes.

1533
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:03,620
It's a prestige TV.

1534
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:05,540
It's called The Elite.

1535
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:06,380
I think we said that.

1536
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:08,460
I think we maybe said that on the episode, too.

1537
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:09,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1538
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:10,460
Just, yeah, make it nice and tidy.

1539
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:11,620
I think it's seasons, though,

1540
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:13,780
full of just pre-Tonight Show.

1541
01:09:13,780 --> 01:09:16,300
Then the actual Tonight Show debacle depicted

1542
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:18,980
in The Late Shift is two seasons long.

1543
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:19,820
Sure.

1544
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:22,460
Then Helen passes away and then there's the portal

1545
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:24,060
that opened, the Doctor Strange portal

1546
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:25,260
and Helen walks through.

1547
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:28,580
So you pricks thought you could bury me.

1548
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:30,860
Well, you didn't count on me getting a heaping helping

1549
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:33,540
of Forbes brain grain cereal.

1550
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:37,380
It means it not only brought me back from the dead,

1551
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:40,340
it also made me even better at deals than I used to be.

1552
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:43,580
I would like another We're Back sequel

1553
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:45,460
where it explains that brain grain,

1554
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:48,140
if fed to corpses, brings them back to life.

1555
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:49,260
Yeah, and that, too.

1556
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:52,300
I also, now another thing you don't know about me

1557
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:55,060
is that besides that I invented time travel,

1558
01:09:55,060 --> 01:09:58,780
I also have a new variety of brain grain

1559
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:00,540
that reanimates corpses.

1560
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:03,340
I heard so many wishes on my wish radio.

1561
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:06,380
Every kid in the world is loudly wishing

1562
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:10,340
that the dead could walk the earth again.

1563
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:12,060
Some say I'm playing God.

1564
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:13,860
I say I am God.

1565
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:15,380
I have solved death.

1566
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:18,580
Cronkite's voice would be good for God.

1567
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:20,460
Does God have a cool airship?

1568
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:23,260
Does God have a steampunk airship full of dinosaurs?

1569
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:24,900
I think not.

1570
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:27,620
That's a great theological question.

1571
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:30,940
Does God have a cool airship full of dinosaurs?

1572
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:32,820
Yeah, well the way people are like,

1573
01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:34,780
we should retire like I don't think of God

1574
01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:36,780
as being like a guy in a cloud with a beard.

1575
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:38,740
I don't think of God as being like a guy

1576
01:10:38,740 --> 01:10:42,660
with a steampunk airship full of smart dinosaurs,

1577
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:44,180
serial fed, of course.

1578
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:45,700
Of course, yeah.

1579
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:49,900
I mean, sometimes I'm open to the possibility

1580
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:51,820
that God has a wish radio.

1581
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:54,140
Yeah, I'm agnostic.

1582
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:55,980
I'm not dogmatic about it.

1583
01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:58,180
I'm not saying either way, yes or no,

1584
01:10:58,180 --> 01:11:01,020
whether God has a magical wish radio,

1585
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:02,420
you know, but I'm open to it.

1586
01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:04,220
You have to allow all systems of belief.

1587
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:07,180
I would never hate my neighbor

1588
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:09,700
because he doesn't think God has a wish radio.

1589
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:15,020
As long as we acknowledge the reality of wish radios,

1590
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:17,220
that's the belief I don't bend on.

1591
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:18,980
Right, right, yeah, it makes a lot of sense.

1592
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:22,260
Yeah, Zen meditation says come back to the breath

1593
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:26,300
and it's okay, don't judge yourself if you get distracted.

1594
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:29,100
Of course, distracted thinking of wish radios.

1595
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:33,980
Listen, cocksucker, there's only two people

1596
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:37,420
who've ever risen from the dead, Jesus Christ and me.

1597
01:11:37,420 --> 01:11:41,180
And if I see that prick around here anywhere,

1598
01:11:41,180 --> 01:11:43,580
I'll tell him to stop being so preachy.

1599
01:11:43,580 --> 01:11:45,900
The gospel of Helen rules this town.

1600
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:47,380
Go back to Bethlehem.

1601
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:49,060
That's some great character building

1602
01:11:49,060 --> 01:11:52,300
that Helen Kushnick is hoarding all the brain grain cereal.

1603
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:55,900
That's why everybody's so like,

1604
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:58,700
oh God, A, she's so mean on the phone

1605
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:00,820
and B, she's got all the brain grain.

1606
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:03,420
She gives Jay one bowl a year

1607
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:06,060
so we can keep up with that shooting schedule

1608
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:08,380
and all those stand-up dates.

1609
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:11,380
How do you keep up that relentless pace, Jay?

1610
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:12,300
I just love doing it.

1611
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:15,580
I don't have intelligence increasing cereal

1612
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:17,380
that my manager fed me.

1613
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:19,940
It's based on the film that I was in where I played VORB.

1614
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:22,900
How do you come up with all those Monica Lewinsky jokes, Jay?

1615
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:25,980
Because eating it, that's not the cereal.

1616
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:29,420
One sec, for no reason, let me just duck out of frame here.

1617
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:31,100
I'll be right back.

1618
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:33,940
Could you do a one-person show as Helen, maybe, even two?

1619
01:12:33,940 --> 01:12:35,580
God, I think I could, oh fuck.

1620
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:36,420
Yeah.

1621
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:39,140
Oh, just get me fitted for a pantsuit from there.

1622
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:40,460
30 minutes, you could do,

1623
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:42,220
well, you could do 90 if you want, I guess.

1624
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:44,340
Kushnick the beginning, yeah.

1625
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:47,260
You'd be exhausted by the end of each show.

1626
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:49,060
Yeah, yeah, people would be like,

1627
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:50,940
I've heard profanity in my time,

1628
01:12:50,940 --> 01:12:54,300
but when you started going into the audience

1629
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:59,300
and me calling me a shit-eating little prick,

1630
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:00,300
what did I do?

1631
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:01,900
I gave you money for this show.

1632
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:03,100
Why do I deserve that?

1633
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:05,140
A lot of it's crowd work.

1634
01:13:05,140 --> 01:13:08,180
A lot of the one-man show will be crowd work.

1635
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:10,820
You just insult the audience as Helen.

1636
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:12,820
Listen, you pale, sweaty cuck.

1637
01:13:15,660 --> 01:13:18,420
You're the worst audience member I've ever seen.

1638
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:20,020
Your eyes are darting every which way.

1639
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:22,620
It's like you don't even know how to be in a fucking crowd.

1640
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:24,980
Wow, the new queen of mean is here.

1641
01:13:25,820 --> 01:13:26,740
Scott Gardner is.

1642
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:29,100
As, oh, and Kushnick.

1643
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:30,340
And then everything comes back to.

1644
01:13:30,340 --> 01:13:32,660
A lot would have to happen to get me on a Snatch Game,

1645
01:13:32,660 --> 01:13:35,460
but if I had that opportunity,

1646
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:38,340
I'd be the most obscure celebrity they've ever had,

1647
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:40,780
besides Wayland Flowers and Madame.

1648
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:41,700
Sure, of course.

1649
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:44,300
Was not Madame, I think we've learned that,

1650
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:46,580
that Madame was in a Snatch Game on Drag Race.

1651
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:50,260
Yes, yes, Madame does pop up a lot, yes.

1652
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:52,540
Of course, it's a very good transition as well.

1653
01:13:52,540 --> 01:13:55,980
Well, I saw something in that IMDB and I was wondering.

1654
01:13:55,980 --> 01:13:58,100
Yeah, Jay Leno was on Madame's place.

1655
01:13:58,940 --> 01:14:01,260
When I realized that I just backed this,

1656
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:04,020
as excited as I've been to do this episode,

1657
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:07,500
that I backed us into Madame actually sneaking in here.

1658
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:11,260
Jay Leno was on Madame's place, which is insane.

1659
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:14,020
Madame's Place just came up, what, two months ago?

1660
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:17,220
It's pretty new as far as the podcast.

1661
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:19,260
But, I mean, I don't know what you found

1662
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:22,380
as far as clips and why's for Madame's Place.

1663
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:24,460
I decided to leave it to you, Mike.

1664
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,940
Well, I saved myself some work.

1665
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:28,540
Here's the sad part about this,

1666
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:33,420
is that there's really one YouTube channel called TavTV

1667
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:35,700
that seems to have all of the Madame's Place,

1668
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:37,980
or most of the Madame's Place episodes.

1669
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:40,740
And Jay Leno appears on episode 14,

1670
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:45,740
but they only have a partial part of the episode.

1671
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:47,660
No!

1672
01:14:47,660 --> 01:14:51,580
And Madame's Place is not well archived in other places.

1673
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:52,420
So.

1674
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:55,860
I hate to talk about how the sausage is made,

1675
01:14:55,900 --> 01:14:57,740
but we're recording this the day after

1676
01:14:57,740 --> 01:14:59,620
the disastrous Biden debate.

1677
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:01,340
Mood's a little grim.

1678
01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:02,820
Now you're telling me that they don't have

1679
01:15:02,820 --> 01:15:04,700
episode 14 on TavTV?

1680
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:06,540
So really all it is, and we don't have to play it.

1681
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:07,580
This country's fucked.

1682
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:09,860
Jay appears on Madame's Place,

1683
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:13,340
so the clip starts with Jay shaking Madame's hand.

1684
01:15:13,340 --> 01:15:18,100
Now, Madame again is a puppet who has a talk show.

1685
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:18,940
And.

1686
01:15:18,940 --> 01:15:19,760
I think I forgot that part.

1687
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,140
That's a big part of the premise,

1688
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:22,460
is that Madame has a talk show.

1689
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:24,820
And this clip just starts with Jay on the show.

1690
01:15:24,860 --> 01:15:26,060
He doesn't say anything,

1691
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:28,300
and then he kind of disappears behind the curtain.

1692
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:29,260
He does a little thing like he didn't know

1693
01:15:29,260 --> 01:15:30,100
where he was going.

1694
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:31,140
And then he kind of does a little Jay dance,

1695
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:33,100
like acroid running in Ghostbusters,

1696
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:34,620
where he kind of is off kilter.

1697
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:37,180
And then Madame just goes on with the episode,

1698
01:15:37,180 --> 01:15:38,500
and there's other guests.

1699
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:39,820
So.

1700
01:15:39,820 --> 01:15:41,700
I was looking for the full episode,

1701
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:44,060
and I hope it's not lost forever.

1702
01:15:44,060 --> 01:15:46,140
I hope this is not completely lost media.

1703
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:46,980
Oh God.

1704
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:47,820
But.

1705
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:51,100
So at least we got to see Jay and Madame together.

1706
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:52,460
They are in one frame together, yes.

1707
01:15:52,460 --> 01:15:54,580
But I was really hoping for a full thing

1708
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:56,820
where like Madame was in love with Jay,

1709
01:15:56,820 --> 01:15:59,380
but maybe that is what happens early on in the episode.

1710
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:00,220
But.

1711
01:16:00,220 --> 01:16:01,060
Yeah.

1712
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:03,700
So you think because you've got some little

1713
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:05,620
rinky dink talk show.

1714
01:16:05,620 --> 01:16:06,900
I saw your set.

1715
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:08,620
It's nothing but lattices.

1716
01:16:08,620 --> 01:16:09,700
It looks cheap as hell.

1717
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:11,420
We're talking about The Tonight Show.

1718
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:13,740
The number one game in town.

1719
01:16:13,740 --> 01:16:15,900
First of all, look, I'm a lady,

1720
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:17,620
and I know the audience is never gonna accept

1721
01:16:17,620 --> 01:16:19,460
a lady host of The Tonight Show.

1722
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:20,700
So keep dreaming.

1723
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:24,060
That's Jay's spot when that old fuck Carson croaks,

1724
01:16:24,060 --> 01:16:25,460
and you know it.

1725
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:28,500
That's you as Helen on Madame's place, I think.

1726
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:29,340
Yeah, yeah.

1727
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:31,020
That's the first earlier scene.

1728
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:32,540
And what does she sound like?

1729
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:33,620
What would she say to that?

1730
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:34,460
Oh, Madame.

1731
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:36,100
I don't have my Madame impression down,

1732
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:37,540
which again, that'll have to come here.

1733
01:16:37,540 --> 01:16:41,860
But I'll give you a little bit of just what she says to Jay

1734
01:16:41,860 --> 01:16:42,700
on the way out here,

1735
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:45,500
and I'm gonna struggle with it for a second here.

1736
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:49,100
Just watching the kind of montage,

1737
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:51,140
I guess it's the credits.

1738
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:54,380
Madame looks like a long snake

1739
01:16:54,380 --> 01:16:55,860
when she moves sometimes,

1740
01:16:55,860 --> 01:16:57,820
because she has a long pump. How dare you?

1741
01:16:57,820 --> 01:17:00,060
How dare you say that about Madame?

1742
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:01,660
Oh, sure, America's gonna accept

1743
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:04,980
some long-snaked old lady into their home every night.

1744
01:17:04,980 --> 01:17:07,500
Keep dreaming, you old bag.

1745
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:10,860
She looks like a penis in balls, Jason.

1746
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:12,060
That's what she looks like.

1747
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:14,420
America wants a big, thick-chin man,

1748
01:17:14,420 --> 01:17:16,140
not a penis-faced woman.

1749
01:17:17,180 --> 01:17:19,660
We now join our show already in progress.

1750
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:22,820
Thank you, Jay.

1751
01:17:22,820 --> 01:17:23,660
That was good.

1752
01:17:23,660 --> 01:17:24,780
We'll be right back.

1753
01:17:24,780 --> 01:17:26,100
Thank you, darling.

1754
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:29,100
Well, wasn't that just terrific?

1755
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:31,100
Now I've got a little question for my audience.

1756
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:33,540
Have you ever wondered what those little ruffle things

1757
01:17:33,540 --> 01:17:36,060
they stick on the end of lamb chops are called?

1758
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:37,540
They're called little panties.

1759
01:17:37,540 --> 01:17:41,540
I'll never forget the first time I pulled them off, either.

1760
01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:46,540
That was a bad joke, wasn't it?

1761
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:49,460
That was a bad joke, wasn't it?

1762
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:54,940
This is what you are thirsting to talk about on this show.

1763
01:17:54,940 --> 01:17:57,660
Well, I will, like, you become Helen,

1764
01:17:57,660 --> 01:17:58,860
I will become Matt, as well.

1765
01:17:58,860 --> 01:18:00,340
That's what I'm thirsting to do.

1766
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:03,180
Well, now I know what I can wield in this episode.

1767
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:05,220
Whenever I get frustrated, I can become,

1768
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:07,380
I think Helen is like, Helen's a way

1769
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:09,260
to manifest the rage in me.

1770
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:12,780
It's like a healthy way to let it come out, this other side.

1771
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:15,500
People across the country could become Helen,

1772
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:17,900
and it would really help get some anger and rage out.

1773
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:23,500
And I'm just over here eating my show-recording lamb chops.

1774
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:24,860
What was that joke?

1775
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:25,980
Was that about panties?

1776
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:26,460
What did she say?

1777
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:28,620
Yeah, she said something called panties.

1778
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:32,980
I think the little ruffles that you used to get on a chop,

1779
01:18:32,980 --> 01:18:36,460
like, they always draw it in loony tunes.

1780
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:38,100
Is that what she's referring to?

1781
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:38,860
This is a joke.

1782
01:18:38,860 --> 01:18:42,500
This is an early 80s joke about a now-defunct preparation

1783
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:44,180
of lamb chops.

1784
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:46,940
But it's really just an excuse for a madam to say panties.

1785
01:18:46,940 --> 01:18:48,500
Talk about taking them off.

1786
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:52,060
And that didn't even get a laugh with the fake piped-in audience

1787
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:53,220
of Madam's Place.

1788
01:18:53,220 --> 01:18:54,660
Well, they were, yeah.

1789
01:18:54,660 --> 01:18:55,740
I don't know if it was fake.

1790
01:18:55,740 --> 01:18:57,580
I don't know if maybe the audience had heard

1791
01:18:57,580 --> 01:18:58,300
the joke a few times.

1792
01:18:58,300 --> 01:18:59,700
Maybe the puppet had to reset.

1793
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:01,700
There's no way there was a live audience.

1794
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:05,020
I feel like I know how Alf was made.

1795
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:06,980
There's no way you're making an audience sit

1796
01:19:06,980 --> 01:19:08,180
through all the puppet resets.

1797
01:19:08,180 --> 01:19:11,260
Scott, what if I were to tell you, at one point,

1798
01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:14,860
Madam is riding in the back of a Rolls-Royce?

1799
01:19:14,860 --> 01:19:17,900
And of course, it looks like she's standing up

1800
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:20,660
because she's so stretched out.

1801
01:19:20,660 --> 01:19:23,220
It is kind of a grotesque image, even as I said.

1802
01:19:23,220 --> 01:19:24,300
Madam is scary.

1803
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:25,020
I'm not denying.

1804
01:19:25,020 --> 01:19:27,100
I'm not going to argue Madam is cute.

1805
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:28,180
Madam is scary.

1806
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:29,140
I acknowledge that.

1807
01:19:29,140 --> 01:19:30,660
OK, all right.

1808
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:31,540
Yeah, it has always.

1809
01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:33,020
I don't think that's the main thing.

1810
01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:35,940
I think my main complaint is that it sucks.

1811
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:38,740
My secondary complaint is that she's scary.

1812
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:39,940
She is scary.

1813
01:19:39,940 --> 01:19:41,020
But look, on the future.

1814
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:43,220
I'm goddamn scary.

1815
01:19:43,220 --> 01:19:44,780
Madam's Place, other episodes have

1816
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:48,300
William Shatner, Pee-wee Herman, Arsenio Hall.

1817
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:53,020
I mean, we're in for a lot in the future of Madam discussion

1818
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:54,940
on this podcast.

1819
01:19:54,940 --> 01:19:55,980
But not right now.

1820
01:19:55,980 --> 01:19:56,540
We already have.

1821
01:19:56,540 --> 01:19:57,140
Not right now.

1822
01:19:57,140 --> 01:20:02,020
Well, because some other often discussed kitschy celebrities

1823
01:20:02,020 --> 01:20:04,980
are right around the corner where I'm heading,

1824
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:07,220
assuming that that closes out the Madam chapter.

1825
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:10,060
Yeah, for now, yes.

1826
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:14,380
I am going to bring up my beloved thing

1827
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:17,740
that I ham-fistedly insert whenever I can, Baywatch.

1828
01:20:17,740 --> 01:20:18,260
Of course.

1829
01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:18,940
Very excited.

1830
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:23,020
Jay Leno factors into one of my favorite episodes of Baywatch.

1831
01:20:23,020 --> 01:20:26,020
And it's an episode that really illustrates the kind of thing

1832
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:29,300
that they started doing that I don't think the audience knows.

1833
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:34,420
I think you picture a bunch of hokey ocean rescue hijinks.

1834
01:20:34,420 --> 01:20:38,500
And you don't know maybe that stuff like this

1835
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:39,940
happens on Baywatch.

1836
01:20:40,820 --> 01:20:47,940
By this, I mean the season seven episode, episode 14 talk show.

1837
01:20:47,940 --> 01:20:49,740
OK, so it's talk show because of Jay Leno.

1838
01:20:49,740 --> 01:20:53,980
Well, kind of, but also because, much like Madam,

1839
01:20:53,980 --> 01:20:57,100
we are now dealing with a fictional talk show that

1840
01:20:57,100 --> 01:20:59,420
is only in the Baywatch reverse.

1841
01:20:59,420 --> 01:21:03,260
Mitch Buchanan, AKA David Hasselhoff, on the beach

1842
01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:04,860
rescues a woman's life.

1843
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,540
But it's no ordinary woman.

1844
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:12,620
I have a beloved, presumably non-Jay Leno talk show host,

1845
01:21:12,620 --> 01:21:14,500
Cassie Cole.

1846
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:17,060
He rescues Cassie Cole's life.

1847
01:21:17,060 --> 01:21:18,460
That's a power player.

1848
01:21:18,460 --> 01:21:22,460
Cassie Cole is played by country singer and Branson Mainstay

1849
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:25,500
Barbara Mandrell of the Mandrell Sisters.

1850
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:26,220
Right, of course.

1851
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:32,060
So she rescues.

1852
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:33,900
She's rescued by Mitch Buchanan.

1853
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:36,340
She says, well, you've got to come on my show

1854
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:37,540
to talk about it.

1855
01:21:37,540 --> 01:21:39,220
That's an interesting thing to talk about.

1856
01:21:39,220 --> 01:21:40,060
You saved my life.

1857
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:41,460
You've got to tell the story.

1858
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:43,460
And he feels a little amiss about it

1859
01:21:43,460 --> 01:21:46,700
despite having incredible bravado.

1860
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:48,340
I mean, how could you not if you're

1861
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:50,300
an Adonis like Mitch Buchanan?

1862
01:21:50,300 --> 01:21:52,580
Yeah, this is the thing that kind of stresses me.

1863
01:21:52,580 --> 01:21:56,780
You just get a sense that maybe being on camera

1864
01:21:56,780 --> 01:21:58,180
is a whole other thing.

1865
01:21:58,180 --> 01:22:00,780
So then it goes to him on the show.

1866
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:03,180
And he's set up to tell the story.

1867
01:22:03,180 --> 01:22:07,300
And he's immediately flop sweating.

1868
01:22:07,300 --> 01:22:09,260
He's very, very nervous.

1869
01:22:09,260 --> 01:22:11,620
And it starts to get a little amiss.

1870
01:22:11,620 --> 01:22:13,860
You start to wonder, is something up?

1871
01:22:13,860 --> 01:22:15,700
Are we maybe dealing with a little bit

1872
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:17,860
of a dream sequence here?

1873
01:22:17,860 --> 01:22:19,220
And that is what I will play.

1874
01:22:19,220 --> 01:22:23,900
Despite it not having Jay Leno, I have to play this moment.

1875
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:28,060
Mitch Buchanan on the Cassie Cole show.

1876
01:22:28,060 --> 01:22:29,700
Mitch, talk to me.

1877
01:22:33,380 --> 01:22:34,260
Oh, no.

1878
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:35,820
Like airplane sweat.

1879
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:38,540
I was in the water, and the waves came,

1880
01:22:38,540 --> 01:22:41,940
and I went over to the garden, and I was in that moon.

1881
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:46,420
I can now just feel a Grammicon, feel a Grammicon,

1882
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:49,900
feel a Grammicon, feel a Grammicon, feel a Grammicon.

1883
01:22:53,900 --> 01:22:55,620
And then he wakes up.

1884
01:22:55,620 --> 01:22:58,180
Then he wakes up sleeping in a tank top.

1885
01:22:58,180 --> 01:22:59,740
Yeah, as you do.

1886
01:22:59,740 --> 01:23:01,340
Well, if somebody broke into your house,

1887
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:02,740
how else do you show off your bod?

1888
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:04,900
To an intruder.

1889
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:07,700
Yeah, you're right that it's, I think I said flop sweating,

1890
01:23:07,700 --> 01:23:10,500
but it's like just literal faucet coming to you.

1891
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:12,940
You listener could hear there.

1892
01:23:12,940 --> 01:23:16,500
And then he starts babbling.

1893
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:19,380
And then he starts saying, straight down the barrel

1894
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:22,900
of the lens, feel a Grammicon, feel a Grammicon.

1895
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:27,620
I cannot tell you why the fuck he is saying feel a Grammicon

1896
01:23:27,620 --> 01:23:28,340
over and over.

1897
01:23:28,340 --> 01:23:30,420
Is it like a reverse of some words?

1898
01:23:30,420 --> 01:23:32,100
Maybe, maybe.

1899
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:36,420
Is it some, is this like, was he like one of the main German

1900
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:40,740
investors in the successful syndication of Baywatch?

1901
01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:42,460
Is it a reference to something?

1902
01:23:42,460 --> 01:23:45,220
Is it just nonsense dream speak?

1903
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:47,740
And they were like, oh, what's a funny thing?

1904
01:23:47,740 --> 01:23:49,100
Yes, that's my feeling.

1905
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:52,620
Yeah, yeah, because he'd already done like blah, blah, blah.

1906
01:23:52,620 --> 01:23:54,300
But then feel a Grammicon.

1907
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:57,740
I've been haunted by feeling a Grammicon for a long time.

1908
01:23:57,740 --> 01:23:59,620
Listener, if you can help, if you can explain

1909
01:23:59,620 --> 01:24:01,780
what feel a Grammicon is.

1910
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:03,220
Really, if it's reversed, it doesn't really

1911
01:24:03,220 --> 01:24:04,220
look like anything.

1912
01:24:04,220 --> 01:24:05,180
Oh, you tried to flip it?

1913
01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:05,940
Yeah.

1914
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:06,460
Thank you.

1915
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:07,420
That was nice of you.

1916
01:24:07,420 --> 01:24:09,620
This is the real impetus for the episode.

1917
01:24:09,620 --> 01:24:12,740
Scott's trying to solve the mystery of feeling a Grammicon.

1918
01:24:12,740 --> 01:24:15,580
I've been, yes, the listeners should know that I don't sleep

1919
01:24:15,580 --> 01:24:17,700
and it has nothing to do with my young child.

1920
01:24:17,700 --> 01:24:18,780
This predates that.

1921
01:24:18,780 --> 01:24:22,060
I've been thinking about feel a Grammicon for eight years now.

1922
01:24:22,060 --> 01:24:23,300
And I need some help.

1923
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:27,540
Tossing and turning in your sleep tank top.

1924
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:29,380
Do you think it's weird to sleep in a tank top?

1925
01:24:29,380 --> 01:24:31,940
It's like a muscle shirt, I guess, more.

1926
01:24:31,940 --> 01:24:33,260
You mean it's too tight?

1927
01:24:33,260 --> 01:24:34,900
It's teal, that's something.

1928
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:38,180
It's definitely what he would wear at work, too.

1929
01:24:38,180 --> 01:24:38,700
Right.

1930
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:39,660
Yeah.

1931
01:24:39,660 --> 01:24:41,420
There's something, yeah, I think you're right.

1932
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:43,060
There's something off about it.

1933
01:24:43,060 --> 01:24:44,940
Yeah, yeah.

1934
01:24:44,940 --> 01:24:47,420
But anyways, now actually I'm not

1935
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:51,220
going to play a clip of, well, I don't know, maybe I should.

1936
01:24:51,220 --> 01:24:53,740
So there's two little scenes with Jay.

1937
01:24:53,740 --> 01:24:57,420
Jay is the lead guest that night on Cassie Cole.

1938
01:24:57,420 --> 01:24:59,820
There's a moment where he introduces himself

1939
01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:03,460
to a lifeguard who's not going to be on the show

1940
01:25:03,460 --> 01:25:05,940
and just kind of babbles and is very nervous.

1941
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:08,620
He offers him a cookie.

1942
01:25:08,620 --> 01:25:10,740
This is an attribute that's given to Jay

1943
01:25:10,740 --> 01:25:12,860
in this version of Jay, which is that he's always

1944
01:25:12,860 --> 01:25:15,500
walking around with a basket of cookies

1945
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:17,020
and offering them to people.

1946
01:25:17,020 --> 01:25:18,980
And then once you see him on the show,

1947
01:25:18,980 --> 01:25:21,500
Cassie Cole says, well, thank you so much for coming, Jay.

1948
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:24,380
And thanks for bringing us some of your tonight show cookies.

1949
01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:26,820
And he's like, yeah, yeah, sure.

1950
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:29,020
Tonight show cookies, huh, why?

1951
01:25:29,020 --> 01:25:33,140
You very quickly figure out, I'll

1952
01:25:33,140 --> 01:25:35,260
try to find a quick moment of it here.

1953
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:37,420
Maybe worth, might not play the best for listeners.

1954
01:25:37,420 --> 01:25:41,460
But it keeps also to note, he keeps going back

1955
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:44,820
to the cookies a lot.

1956
01:25:44,820 --> 01:25:46,140
Now that he's not the main guest,

1957
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:47,740
he's still on the couch, he's eating cookies.

1958
01:25:47,740 --> 01:25:49,620
Then I'll let him tell the story.

1959
01:25:49,620 --> 01:25:52,540
See, I'm an extreme jock.

1960
01:25:52,540 --> 01:25:55,380
When I was a little girl, I used to take on any dare, even

1961
01:25:55,380 --> 01:25:56,820
a double dog dare.

1962
01:25:56,820 --> 01:25:57,860
Well, same goes today.

1963
01:25:57,860 --> 01:26:00,180
I mean, I pushed the envelope.

1964
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:01,900
Live on the extreme.

1965
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:04,500
So anyway, I was out surfing, right?

1966
01:26:05,380 --> 01:26:06,220
Not exactly.

1967
01:26:07,180 --> 01:26:08,820
I was out drowning.

1968
01:26:08,820 --> 01:26:09,660
Exactly.

1969
01:26:10,660 --> 01:26:11,500
Oh, Jay.

1970
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:12,340
He's choking.

1971
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:14,340
Thank you, I thought so too.

1972
01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:16,340
He needs help, he needs help.

1973
01:26:16,340 --> 01:26:18,340
He needs help, he needs help.

1974
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:20,340
He needs help, he needs help.

1975
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:22,340
He needs help, he needs help.

1976
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:24,340
He needs help, he needs help.

1977
01:26:24,340 --> 01:26:25,340
He needs help, he needs help.

1978
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:27,140
Heimlich.

1979
01:26:28,420 --> 01:26:31,780
Heimlich, he's now saved two people's lives

1980
01:26:31,780 --> 01:26:32,900
in this episode.

1981
01:26:32,900 --> 01:26:35,420
Yeah, he's there to talk about the life that he saved,

1982
01:26:35,420 --> 01:26:37,700
and then he does it live on the show.

1983
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:41,140
He saves America's tied favorite host

1984
01:26:41,140 --> 01:26:42,500
to Cassie Cole, Jay Leno.

1985
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:44,300
You were just telling me about Heimlich being Heimlich.

1986
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:47,340
Were you Heimlich, or were you Heimlich someone?

1987
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:48,660
What were you talking about?

1988
01:26:48,660 --> 01:26:51,540
When I was three years old, we were at a diner,

1989
01:26:51,540 --> 01:26:54,420
and I started choking on a breakfast potato.

1990
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:56,660
And I think I was Heimlich.

1991
01:26:56,660 --> 01:26:59,060
I know that's not funny, but breakfast potato.

1992
01:26:59,060 --> 01:27:01,180
Breakfast potato's a funny specific to say.

1993
01:27:01,180 --> 01:27:04,140
Like, not a tiny home fry,

1994
01:27:04,140 --> 01:27:08,860
like a, or not a tiny hash brown, like a...

1995
01:27:08,860 --> 01:27:09,700
Like a big wedge.

1996
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:11,660
Like a chunk, or a wedge, yeah.

1997
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:14,060
Did you see someone be Heimlich as well?

1998
01:27:14,060 --> 01:27:16,740
I learned how to Heimlich in the Cub Scouts.

1999
01:27:16,740 --> 01:27:17,580
Boy Scouts.

2000
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:21,340
I was just, I actually had never, back on Wood,

2001
01:27:21,340 --> 01:27:22,460
I never had to be Heimlich.

2002
01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:23,780
You might have been talking about

2003
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:27,540
if you have to Heimlich yourself, you get a chair.

2004
01:27:27,540 --> 01:27:28,460
Yeah, yeah.

2005
01:27:28,460 --> 01:27:29,340
Yeah, yeah.

2006
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:30,660
I think I would start to do that,

2007
01:27:30,660 --> 01:27:32,580
and then realize I don't know the angle,

2008
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:34,860
or, it's probably something I should learn.

2009
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:38,740
In theory, I know how to do it.

2010
01:27:38,740 --> 01:27:39,640
In theory.

2011
01:27:40,940 --> 01:27:41,780
In theory.

2012
01:27:42,740 --> 01:27:46,100
Yes, how will your theories play in reality, I don't know.

2013
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:48,180
But anyway, well, we can all learn it from this scene.

2014
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:49,500
It's a helpful scene in that way.

2015
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:52,540
You get to see Jay with a bunch of regurgitated food

2016
01:27:52,540 --> 01:27:54,140
coming out of his mouth, which is interesting,

2017
01:27:54,140 --> 01:27:56,740
and then she says, how about I add,

2018
01:27:56,740 --> 01:27:58,220
he saved Jay, everybody,

2019
01:27:58,220 --> 01:28:00,160
and then Jay goes back to the cookies,

2020
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:01,180
and he takes another bite.

2021
01:28:01,180 --> 01:28:02,020
That's funny.

2022
01:28:02,020 --> 01:28:02,840
Which is pretty funny.

2023
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:03,680
That's funny, yeah.

2024
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:06,180
And something tells me that was his choice,

2025
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:07,900
because it's funnier than anything

2026
01:28:07,900 --> 01:28:09,700
that usually happens on Day Watch.

2027
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:12,980
So, I've always loved this little sequence.

2028
01:28:12,980 --> 01:28:14,620
Fun to see him, he's in the suit,

2029
01:28:14,620 --> 01:28:16,220
but he's gotta do action and stuff.

2030
01:28:16,220 --> 01:28:17,300
That's good, yeah.

2031
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:18,620
Really like this.

2032
01:28:18,620 --> 01:28:22,940
This is not the end of the Leno Baywatch connection,

2033
01:28:22,940 --> 01:28:26,660
because Leno also appears on a post-Baywatch show,

2034
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:29,100
post-Pamela Anderson's departure from Baywatch,

2035
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:32,260
her spinoff syndicated series, VIP.

2036
01:28:32,260 --> 01:28:33,420
Yes.

2037
01:28:33,420 --> 01:28:35,980
Now, in VIP, I feel like you might have pointed out

2038
01:28:35,980 --> 01:28:37,660
this naming mechanism.

2039
01:28:37,660 --> 01:28:39,660
Yes, Valerie Irons Protection.

2040
01:28:41,020 --> 01:28:43,420
See, Pamela Anderson is Valerie Irons.

2041
01:28:43,420 --> 01:28:46,900
Spelled in a weird way to spell Valerie,

2042
01:28:46,900 --> 01:28:50,740
and then, yeah, VIP is Valerie Irons Protection.

2043
01:28:50,740 --> 01:28:52,860
So, she's like kind of a bodyguard, but a little more.

2044
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:55,500
She has a company, she has a whole team of bodyguards.

2045
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:58,700
Okay, VIP looms large in my head,

2046
01:28:58,700 --> 01:28:59,740
and I've said this before,

2047
01:28:59,740 --> 01:29:02,900
and not just because Pamela Anderson was like,

2048
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:06,420
you know, interesting to a young man at the time.

2049
01:29:06,420 --> 01:29:07,460
You know, if I had to guess,

2050
01:29:07,460 --> 01:29:08,860
I would say that wasn't any part of it.

2051
01:29:08,860 --> 01:29:09,700
Have anything to do with it.

2052
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:10,700
There were attractive ladies on the show.

2053
01:29:10,700 --> 01:29:12,660
Certainly part of it, I'm not saying it's not nothing.

2054
01:29:12,660 --> 01:29:15,580
It's not nothing, but I was looking through some of it,

2055
01:29:15,580 --> 01:29:20,060
and I was like, there's an aesthetic to VIP I really like.

2056
01:29:20,060 --> 01:29:25,060
It's a very 90s colorful show that wouldn't,

2057
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:28,140
you would find the same, let me find a good scene of it.

2058
01:29:28,140 --> 01:29:30,620
It would look right on maybe Nickelodeon or something

2059
01:29:30,620 --> 01:29:33,220
as well, certain scenes.

2060
01:29:33,220 --> 01:29:35,620
It's kind of like space cases style.

2061
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:37,220
Kind of, yeah.

2062
01:29:37,220 --> 01:29:39,420
So, I'm like, oh yeah, that's definitely part

2063
01:29:39,420 --> 01:29:41,580
of my fascination with it,

2064
01:29:41,580 --> 01:29:44,900
and we were watching some of it over the pandemic,

2065
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:47,700
and I was like, some of this is at least watchable

2066
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:52,340
versus other ones of these hour-long syndicated shows.

2067
01:29:52,340 --> 01:29:53,940
Your Relic Hunters.

2068
01:29:53,940 --> 01:29:57,100
Yes, yeah, often shows like that have a really fun intro,

2069
01:29:57,100 --> 01:29:58,580
and then you really drag.

2070
01:29:58,580 --> 01:30:01,260
I'm sorry to say, that is kind of where I landed ultimately

2071
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:03,020
with Sebastian Jackal.

2072
01:30:03,020 --> 01:30:03,860
Yes.

2073
01:30:03,860 --> 01:30:05,100
Ultimately, UPN's Deadly Games,

2074
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:06,220
a little bit boring to watch.

2075
01:30:06,220 --> 01:30:07,220
These things come in hot

2076
01:30:07,220 --> 01:30:09,900
with a lot of very memorable opening sequence,

2077
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:11,100
and that's my thing with Baywatch,

2078
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:12,300
is that I find it so watchable,

2079
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:14,100
especially with the beautiful remaster.

2080
01:30:14,580 --> 01:30:15,420
Of course, now you can finally see.

2081
01:30:15,420 --> 01:30:18,140
If VIP is in this area at all, I'm interested,

2082
01:30:18,140 --> 01:30:20,220
and now that I know VIP is on Tubi,

2083
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:22,660
America's most successful streaming platform.

2084
01:30:22,660 --> 01:30:23,940
That's why I found Harper.

2085
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:24,940
There's a shot I have.

2086
01:30:24,940 --> 01:30:26,620
I think it's all, it has the Netflix thing,

2087
01:30:26,620 --> 01:30:28,580
where like all the shit's actually there.

2088
01:30:28,580 --> 01:30:29,940
What's also funny.

2089
01:30:29,940 --> 01:30:33,420
Yeah, a lot of it, apparently, I think the end

2090
01:30:33,420 --> 01:30:36,540
of every month, a lot of it says it's expiring,

2091
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:38,420
and then just doesn't.

2092
01:30:38,420 --> 01:30:42,020
Like, they get the contracts, they renew it anyway.

2093
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:43,460
Nevermind, we got it.

2094
01:30:44,300 --> 01:30:47,580
And maybe, this is why maybe a larger VIP study

2095
01:30:47,580 --> 01:30:51,340
needs to be engaged in, is that I think,

2096
01:30:51,340 --> 01:30:54,140
because Jay's on two episodes of VIP,

2097
01:30:54,140 --> 01:30:56,900
and I think the intro just of the show in the second season,

2098
01:30:56,900 --> 01:30:59,220
they have to cram in more of the explanation

2099
01:30:59,220 --> 01:31:02,900
of what the show is, because people are maybe confused

2100
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:04,900
by the premise, because the premise, I believe,

2101
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:07,500
is that there's like mistaken identity or something,

2102
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:11,500
and then these other like female assassins

2103
01:31:11,540 --> 01:31:14,420
get Pam Anderson to be like the figurehead

2104
01:31:14,420 --> 01:31:17,740
of their protection agency, and that she's not really

2105
01:31:17,740 --> 01:31:20,660
into like shooting and killing people.

2106
01:31:20,660 --> 01:31:21,860
I don't know if they actually kill anybody,

2107
01:31:21,860 --> 01:31:23,500
but like she's in a, she's just,

2108
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:24,780
Like falls in a trash can or something.

2109
01:31:24,780 --> 01:31:26,220
She gets mixed up in all of this.

2110
01:31:26,220 --> 01:31:27,620
She does a lot of prep falls.

2111
01:31:27,620 --> 01:31:29,940
But it's like, it's kind of a confusing premise.

2112
01:31:29,940 --> 01:31:30,780
Yeah.

2113
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:31,860
Like, why isn't she just on the,

2114
01:31:31,860 --> 01:31:33,420
like isn't she just on the team for some reason?

2115
01:31:33,420 --> 01:31:34,260
Yeah, sure, yeah.

2116
01:31:34,260 --> 01:31:36,700
But I bought, and I was like, oh, VIP,

2117
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:39,780
oh, it's an acronym, Valerie Iron, like I bought that.

2118
01:31:39,780 --> 01:31:40,860
You understood it immediately, you're saying.

2119
01:31:41,020 --> 01:31:43,700
I understood it, and the fact that it would kick in

2120
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:45,620
after Saturday morning cartoons.

2121
01:31:45,620 --> 01:31:48,540
Like their headquarters, it looks like it's a Barbie

2122
01:31:48,540 --> 01:31:49,660
dream house or something.

2123
01:31:49,660 --> 01:31:51,020
Sure. Like color-wise.

2124
01:31:51,020 --> 01:31:52,220
Yeah. Of course, this isn't loading,

2125
01:31:52,220 --> 01:31:56,860
but like their headquarters is very much the color here.

2126
01:31:56,860 --> 01:31:58,900
Yeah, well, it's kind of like where the Spice Girls

2127
01:31:58,900 --> 01:31:59,860
live in Spice World.

2128
01:31:59,860 --> 01:32:01,180
Yes, exactly, yes.

2129
01:32:01,180 --> 01:32:03,020
Mm-hmm, is that a bus?

2130
01:32:03,020 --> 01:32:04,260
That's like a giant bus.

2131
01:32:04,260 --> 01:32:05,980
I forget if they have a stationary home,

2132
01:32:05,980 --> 01:32:07,500
as well as the big bus.

2133
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:08,340
Yeah.

2134
01:32:08,340 --> 01:32:09,940
I like things with big buses in general.

2135
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:10,780
Sure.

2136
01:32:11,700 --> 01:32:12,980
There's a movie, in fact, called The Big Bus,

2137
01:32:12,980 --> 01:32:14,580
not to be confused with Super Train,

2138
01:32:14,580 --> 01:32:16,140
kind of in the same genre as Super Train.

2139
01:32:16,140 --> 01:32:18,900
Would you say you're attracted to buses more than cars?

2140
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:20,220
Wait, that's my answer, big buses.

2141
01:32:20,220 --> 01:32:21,060
Big buses.

2142
01:32:21,060 --> 01:32:22,860
All right, the Spice Girls bus.

2143
01:32:25,780 --> 01:32:28,780
Probably, it's like a little feather boa

2144
01:32:28,780 --> 01:32:30,740
around the bumper.

2145
01:32:31,940 --> 01:32:32,780
They spiced up the bus.

2146
01:32:32,780 --> 01:32:34,340
The Spice Girls bus is Scott's answer.

2147
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:37,780
Spiced up your life. Good answer, good answer, honestly.

2148
01:32:37,780 --> 01:32:39,500
But also another, and again,

2149
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:41,620
I'm not fully declaring VIP,

2150
01:32:41,620 --> 01:32:43,900
like you gotta watch this, you gotta binge it,

2151
01:32:43,900 --> 01:32:48,900
but the first scene that Jay is in is great.

2152
01:32:49,380 --> 01:32:50,860
I'm gonna go in backwards order between the two.

2153
01:32:50,860 --> 01:32:52,300
I think that's smart, yes.

2154
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:54,580
Because honestly, yeah, so you've seen it, so you know.

2155
01:32:54,580 --> 01:32:55,620
Yeah, I watched these, yeah, yeah.

2156
01:32:55,620 --> 01:32:57,180
That was my thought, is that she, you know,

2157
01:32:57,180 --> 01:33:00,260
he appeared on it twice, the second time in season two,

2158
01:33:01,180 --> 01:33:02,620
Valma and Louise.

2159
01:33:02,620 --> 01:33:04,100
Valma and Louise.

2160
01:33:04,100 --> 01:33:08,220
And the, yeah, it's, in this one,

2161
01:33:08,220 --> 01:33:09,940
you'll notice a familiarity.

2162
01:33:09,940 --> 01:33:11,300
Like now they know each other,

2163
01:33:11,300 --> 01:33:13,460
and that's because of the events of the first one

2164
01:33:13,460 --> 01:33:14,860
and what she does for him.

2165
01:33:14,860 --> 01:33:16,420
But I'm gonna build to that.

2166
01:33:16,420 --> 01:33:21,220
Okay, so by now, Jay and Val are old pals.

2167
01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:23,100
They've worked together before,

2168
01:33:23,100 --> 01:33:25,100
but this is their second interaction.

2169
01:33:25,940 --> 01:33:27,140
Hey Jay, how you doing?

2170
01:33:27,140 --> 01:33:28,380
Hey Val, you look great.

2171
01:33:28,380 --> 01:33:29,220
How you doing?

2172
01:33:29,220 --> 01:33:30,180
Good, good.

2173
01:33:30,180 --> 01:33:31,940
You mentioned something about a transport, Mr. Leno.

2174
01:33:31,940 --> 01:33:33,860
Oh yeah, listen, I wanna hire VIP

2175
01:33:33,860 --> 01:33:36,660
to drive a Priscilla up to Cal State, Sacramento.

2176
01:33:37,660 --> 01:33:39,580
The lovely Priscilla, you are lovely.

2177
01:33:39,580 --> 01:33:41,820
Actually, that's Williams, that's you, sir.

2178
01:33:41,820 --> 01:33:42,660
Over here.

2179
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:45,900
He tried to shake a woman's hand,

2180
01:33:45,900 --> 01:33:48,660
but they never explained who that woman was either.

2181
01:33:48,660 --> 01:33:49,500
You know.

2182
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:51,220
Well, I'm gonna auction it off as I think.

2183
01:33:51,220 --> 01:33:54,380
Priscilla is a car, Priscilla is a car.

2184
01:33:54,380 --> 01:33:55,220
Yeah.

2185
01:33:55,220 --> 01:33:58,580
I mean, these VIP people, like, proclaim to be expert,

2186
01:33:58,580 --> 01:33:59,860
like they probably gotta find out a lot

2187
01:33:59,860 --> 01:34:00,900
about whoever they're protecting,

2188
01:34:00,900 --> 01:34:01,980
and they haven't figured out by now

2189
01:34:01,980 --> 01:34:05,740
that if Jay says positive things about a female name,

2190
01:34:05,900 --> 01:34:06,740
that it's a car.

2191
01:34:06,740 --> 01:34:07,580
It's gotta be, yeah.

2192
01:34:07,580 --> 01:34:09,700
You would think they would be pros by now,

2193
01:34:10,620 --> 01:34:13,340
but yeah, that's just an error in the writing.

2194
01:34:13,340 --> 01:34:14,860
Anyway, then there's a big thing.

2195
01:34:14,860 --> 01:34:18,060
He has a big list of rules for taking care of Priscilla,

2196
01:34:18,060 --> 01:34:19,940
but the car comes back all busted,

2197
01:34:19,940 --> 01:34:23,220
and that's kind of the crux of it.

2198
01:34:23,220 --> 01:34:25,740
But the other one is definitely more exciting.

2199
01:34:25,740 --> 01:34:27,900
This is the sixth episode of the show,

2200
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:32,900
Diamonds Are Val's Best Friend, and this really is.

2201
01:34:32,900 --> 01:34:36,220
So Val is a guest on The Tonight Show.

2202
01:34:36,220 --> 01:34:37,060
Yes.

2203
01:34:37,060 --> 01:34:40,620
Much like how Cassie Cole has lifeguard Mitch Buchanan

2204
01:34:40,620 --> 01:34:42,700
to talk about, you know, saving lives,

2205
01:34:42,700 --> 01:34:46,300
and then he has a private security person.

2206
01:34:46,300 --> 01:34:47,140
The head of a private security.

2207
01:34:47,140 --> 01:34:49,300
The head of a, the non,

2208
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:51,140
it was not technically not part of the company,

2209
01:34:51,140 --> 01:34:52,380
you said, or something.

2210
01:34:52,380 --> 01:34:54,260
Well, she was, I mean, at this point she is,

2211
01:34:54,260 --> 01:34:55,700
but I just, yeah.

2212
01:34:55,700 --> 01:34:58,420
It's complicated.

2213
01:34:58,420 --> 01:34:59,500
Well, that's why, you know,

2214
01:34:59,500 --> 01:35:01,260
you gotta dive into the show itself to tell you.

2215
01:35:01,260 --> 01:35:05,620
But, yeah, Valerie Irons is the guest tonight.

2216
01:35:05,620 --> 01:35:07,820
Presumably, you know, it was George Clooney before,

2217
01:35:07,820 --> 01:35:11,660
and now it's Val Irons, and the interview's in progress,

2218
01:35:11,660 --> 01:35:13,020
but it takes quite a turn.

2219
01:35:14,300 --> 01:35:17,020
Who guards your body from that guy?

2220
01:35:19,140 --> 01:35:21,100
Excuse me, this never happens.

2221
01:35:21,100 --> 01:35:22,180
What is that, a beeper?

2222
01:35:22,180 --> 01:35:23,180
Really important.

2223
01:35:24,420 --> 01:35:26,620
Push in dramatic, like, oh my God.

2224
01:35:26,620 --> 01:35:29,260
There's a bomb on the Leno set, it says in her beeper.

2225
01:35:29,260 --> 01:35:31,060
Yeah, and they are on the Leno set.

2226
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:35,220
And Val gets up on the desk, and Jay's like,

2227
01:35:35,220 --> 01:35:36,980
oh, and then he's adjusting his tie,

2228
01:35:36,980 --> 01:35:39,820
like something racy is going on.

2229
01:35:39,820 --> 01:35:41,340
Something sexy is going on.

2230
01:35:42,260 --> 01:35:44,100
Jeez, what is this?

2231
01:35:44,100 --> 01:35:45,260
She's just, like, rushing around, though.

2232
01:35:45,260 --> 01:35:47,220
She's not doing anything.

2233
01:35:47,220 --> 01:35:49,940
The bomb's on the bottom of his microphone.

2234
01:35:49,940 --> 01:35:52,180
Listen, is it something I said?

2235
01:35:54,300 --> 01:35:56,180
So here she's running through the halls of the Tonight Show

2236
01:35:56,180 --> 01:35:59,460
with the bomb, the microphone bomb.

2237
01:36:00,460 --> 01:36:02,620
She throws it out, she goes out and exits.

2238
01:36:03,740 --> 01:36:06,020
And then she ducks, and there's an explosion.

2239
01:36:06,020 --> 01:36:09,420
An explosion so big it shakes Jay inside.

2240
01:36:09,420 --> 01:36:12,780
But they have not stopped the taping during any of this.

2241
01:36:12,780 --> 01:36:15,300
And Jay immediately knows what's happened and thanks her.

2242
01:36:15,300 --> 01:36:16,140
Thank you.

2243
01:36:20,580 --> 01:36:22,180
Did he suggest it, you think?

2244
01:36:22,180 --> 01:36:23,580
That feels like a Jay joke.

2245
01:36:25,020 --> 01:36:27,940
Even in the mid-90s, Tony Randall is a reference.

2246
01:36:28,780 --> 01:36:31,020
Like, I guess.

2247
01:36:31,020 --> 01:36:32,780
But it's an odd couple of years.

2248
01:36:32,780 --> 01:36:35,460
Yeah, yeah, another thing he could have done,

2249
01:36:35,460 --> 01:36:37,060
but you have to throw somebody under the bus,

2250
01:36:37,060 --> 01:36:39,700
but he might have, like, alt thing could be,

2251
01:36:39,700 --> 01:36:42,420
like, boy, I thought Louis Anderson

2252
01:36:42,420 --> 01:36:44,980
was the biggest bomb on our show.

2253
01:36:44,980 --> 01:36:47,420
Yeah, yeah, I mean, maybe he had alts.

2254
01:36:47,420 --> 01:36:50,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, you do if you're him.

2255
01:36:50,780 --> 01:36:52,500
You keep him handy.

2256
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:55,380
Anyway, so it's this funny little action sequence,

2257
01:36:55,380 --> 01:36:56,980
and some of what the listener is missing

2258
01:36:56,980 --> 01:36:58,900
is just him making all these faces.

2259
01:36:58,900 --> 01:37:02,060
It's just, if Collision Course didn't prove

2260
01:37:02,060 --> 01:37:04,300
that he's not a viable action star,

2261
01:37:04,300 --> 01:37:08,500
this is definitely the biggest eyes, and oh, jeez, okay, yay.

2262
01:37:08,500 --> 01:37:12,100
But then a subtle thing that's funny about it

2263
01:37:12,100 --> 01:37:13,660
is that when there's that big push-in

2264
01:37:13,660 --> 01:37:16,300
and she realizes there's a bomb from the beeper,

2265
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:19,620
it's done with the Tonight Show jib and camera.

2266
01:37:19,620 --> 01:37:20,460
Right.

2267
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:21,900
And then running through the hallways and all

2268
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:23,940
is shot with their cameras.

2269
01:37:23,940 --> 01:37:25,460
It actually switches back and forth

2270
01:37:25,460 --> 01:37:28,300
between four by three and 16 by nine.

2271
01:37:28,300 --> 01:37:31,460
So they're like, okay, we're filming here.

2272
01:37:31,460 --> 01:37:32,580
Well, I don't know, you know what?

2273
01:37:32,580 --> 01:37:34,220
Bringing our cameras isn't gonna be a hassle.

2274
01:37:34,220 --> 01:37:36,660
You think we could just use what they got?

2275
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:40,180
Hey, the camera's a camera.

2276
01:37:40,180 --> 01:37:42,180
Look, hey, we got him.

2277
01:37:42,180 --> 01:37:43,140
Why would you not use our eyes?

2278
01:37:43,140 --> 01:37:43,980
We got him.

2279
01:37:43,980 --> 01:37:46,900
Mallory Irons, VIP filmed at Panavision.

2280
01:37:48,220 --> 01:37:49,060
You can only assume.

2281
01:37:49,060 --> 01:37:49,900
Yeah.

2282
01:37:49,900 --> 01:37:50,720
Did I look down for a second?

2283
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:53,500
Was it the part with the coffee cup in there?

2284
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:54,500
Oh, yeah, no, I skipped that.

2285
01:37:54,500 --> 01:37:55,340
Oh, you skipped it, got it, okay.

2286
01:37:55,340 --> 01:37:56,300
What was going on with that?

2287
01:37:56,300 --> 01:37:59,140
Because they find the other, the women in the agency

2288
01:37:59,140 --> 01:38:03,140
find on a boat evidence of this happening.

2289
01:38:03,140 --> 01:38:03,980
Oh, like they-

2290
01:38:03,980 --> 01:38:06,140
And they find a Tonight Show mug

2291
01:38:06,140 --> 01:38:07,580
that proves that's who the target

2292
01:38:07,580 --> 01:38:09,420
of whatever this plot is.

2293
01:38:09,420 --> 01:38:11,540
Whoa, a Tonight Show with Jay Leno mug?

2294
01:38:11,540 --> 01:38:13,620
So the kidnappers or the bombers or whatever

2295
01:38:13,620 --> 01:38:14,460
just couldn't help themselves?

2296
01:38:14,460 --> 01:38:16,700
So they're having a gunfight with this man,

2297
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:19,260
which is just like an older character actor

2298
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:20,620
who's got a pretty big, and then they finally,

2299
01:38:20,620 --> 01:38:23,020
they stop him and then they go inside the boat

2300
01:38:23,020 --> 01:38:25,340
to find the evidence and the evidence of,

2301
01:38:25,340 --> 01:38:28,260
or who they're gonna, who he's targeting

2302
01:38:28,260 --> 01:38:30,220
is this Tonight Show with Jay Leno mugs,

2303
01:38:30,220 --> 01:38:33,060
big blue mug, and they're trying to figure it out.

2304
01:38:33,060 --> 01:38:34,700
Oh no, there's dynamite, oh.

2305
01:38:34,700 --> 01:38:38,180
But what's the justification that Jay Leno needs to die?

2306
01:38:38,180 --> 01:38:39,020
I forget.

2307
01:38:39,020 --> 01:38:40,460
Well, I didn't watch the part.

2308
01:38:40,460 --> 01:38:42,100
But yeah, they pull up this Tonight Show

2309
01:38:42,100 --> 01:38:43,220
with Jay Leno mug.

2310
01:38:43,220 --> 01:38:45,100
That's like if there was a movie

2311
01:38:45,100 --> 01:38:47,580
where somebody planted a bomb on a roller coaster

2312
01:38:47,580 --> 01:38:51,020
at Magic Mountain and then like what's their target

2313
01:38:51,020 --> 01:38:53,700
and then they go in that bomber's boat

2314
01:38:53,700 --> 01:38:57,260
and they find a, I had a great time at Magic Mountain

2315
01:38:57,260 --> 01:38:58,900
and all I got was this lousy T-shirt.

2316
01:38:58,900 --> 01:39:01,500
A big XXL Taz sleep shirt.

2317
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:02,340
Yeah.

2318
01:39:02,340 --> 01:39:06,460
Well, either they've been to Magic Mountain

2319
01:39:06,460 --> 01:39:08,100
or one of any mall, any of.

2320
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:10,860
Yeah, any Warner Brothers store.

2321
01:39:10,860 --> 01:39:13,620
Yeah, yeah, one of any number of malls in the area.

2322
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:16,780
And also just, I have a screenshot of Jay's face here

2323
01:39:16,780 --> 01:39:20,300
that I really like when Pam was on the desk.

2324
01:39:20,980 --> 01:39:22,780
Like, oh, look at it.

2325
01:39:22,780 --> 01:39:24,580
This is my favorite episode of the year.

2326
01:39:24,580 --> 01:39:25,940
This is our Emmy show.

2327
01:39:25,940 --> 01:39:28,940
Usually just the wildlife climb on the desk.

2328
01:39:31,540 --> 01:39:33,620
You thought he was having like a Drew Barrymore

2329
01:39:33,620 --> 01:39:34,460
Letterman moment.

2330
01:39:34,460 --> 01:39:35,740
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2331
01:39:35,740 --> 01:39:36,580
Maybe that is the reference, I don't know.

2332
01:39:36,580 --> 01:39:38,620
Finally, I've been jealous ever since.

2333
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:41,340
So.

2334
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:42,180
Wow, wow.

2335
01:39:42,180 --> 01:39:44,220
That's some good Jay content.

2336
01:39:44,220 --> 01:39:46,900
And I think at this point we're winding it down,

2337
01:39:46,940 --> 01:39:50,220
but I'm happy to say that he has a little bit more

2338
01:39:51,380 --> 01:39:54,740
of a presence in hour long dramas.

2339
01:39:54,740 --> 01:39:55,580
Yeah.

2340
01:39:55,580 --> 01:39:56,660
Unless, are you?

2341
01:39:56,660 --> 01:39:57,820
I don't know, I just have,

2342
01:39:57,820 --> 01:40:01,980
I got bogged down in some like not so notable things.

2343
01:40:01,980 --> 01:40:05,620
Like Jay in the movie American Hot Wax.

2344
01:40:05,620 --> 01:40:08,860
Yeah, he plays Mookie in American Hot Wax.

2345
01:40:08,860 --> 01:40:09,780
Yes.

2346
01:40:09,780 --> 01:40:12,900
He's in a movie called America Thon as well,

2347
01:40:12,900 --> 01:40:16,620
which I've noted before because soundtrack feature,

2348
01:40:17,300 --> 01:40:18,380
actually Elvis Costello in the movie,

2349
01:40:18,380 --> 01:40:20,140
performing an original song in the movie.

2350
01:40:20,140 --> 01:40:23,900
Beach Boys not in it, but they performed the title song

2351
01:40:23,900 --> 01:40:27,140
and they have to convey all of the exposition in the movie

2352
01:40:27,140 --> 01:40:29,980
about how like it's a world where America has run out

2353
01:40:29,980 --> 01:40:32,580
of power and everybody has to bike down the freeway.

2354
01:40:32,580 --> 01:40:34,700
So there's a Beach Boys song where Al Jardine's

2355
01:40:34,700 --> 01:40:37,420
singing about no more power.

2356
01:40:37,420 --> 01:40:39,940
Everyone's using their bikes.

2357
01:40:39,940 --> 01:40:40,780
Doo-wop.

2358
01:40:42,060 --> 01:40:42,900
Sounds good.

2359
01:40:42,900 --> 01:40:43,900
Yeah, yeah, that's a good one.

2360
01:40:43,900 --> 01:40:47,580
Jay too, like 97, Jay is like in 89, I looked it up,

2361
01:40:47,580 --> 01:40:49,500
he's like 39 years old.

2362
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:51,940
I always, yeah, I forget, he's like in his early 40s

2363
01:40:51,940 --> 01:40:53,060
when he gets to Tonight Show.

2364
01:40:53,060 --> 01:40:53,900
Oh wow.

2365
01:40:53,900 --> 01:40:56,220
So he's like 29 here in 1978,

2366
01:40:56,220 --> 01:40:59,700
but he almost looks like he's like got the Zemeckis de-aging.

2367
01:40:59,700 --> 01:41:02,700
It's almost like he looks, you know what I'm saying?

2368
01:41:02,700 --> 01:41:05,940
Like he's never looked young to me.

2369
01:41:05,940 --> 01:41:08,820
So it almost looks like they just smoothed out Jay now.

2370
01:41:08,820 --> 01:41:10,860
I know that's not fully the case,

2371
01:41:10,860 --> 01:41:12,860
but it's like he's just Jay now.

2372
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:14,060
Are you showing us American Hot Wax?

2373
01:41:14,060 --> 01:41:15,540
This is American Hot Wax and it's not,

2374
01:41:15,540 --> 01:41:16,380
you can't really see it.

2375
01:41:16,380 --> 01:41:20,180
The story of DJ Alan Freed and Fran Drescher is in this.

2376
01:41:20,180 --> 01:41:21,220
Fran Drescher is in it, yes.

2377
01:41:21,220 --> 01:41:23,020
Which is probably helps it,

2378
01:41:23,020 --> 01:41:25,740
why he was on The Nanny at some point.

2379
01:41:25,740 --> 01:41:26,580
I'm missing that one.

2380
01:41:26,580 --> 01:41:27,420
Maybe.

2381
01:41:27,420 --> 01:41:28,500
I mean, it's not that important, but he just-

2382
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:30,740
He always had that like shock of white hair,

2383
01:41:30,740 --> 01:41:34,580
so it was weird in Collision Course.

2384
01:41:34,580 --> 01:41:35,420
Oh, when he looked younger, yeah.

2385
01:41:35,420 --> 01:41:36,820
When he's got darker hair.

2386
01:41:36,820 --> 01:41:37,660
I think it's good for it.

2387
01:41:37,660 --> 01:41:39,300
He's a guy who Gray looks good on.

2388
01:41:39,300 --> 01:41:40,140
Yeah.

2389
01:41:40,140 --> 01:41:40,980
Anyway.

2390
01:41:40,980 --> 01:41:43,700
Maybe like present company included.

2391
01:41:43,700 --> 01:41:44,900
Well, I'm dying.

2392
01:41:47,220 --> 01:41:48,460
Thank you though.

2393
01:41:48,460 --> 01:41:50,540
There's also just stuff I've never heard of,

2394
01:41:50,540 --> 01:41:53,580
like a Jeremy Piven movie called Just Right.

2395
01:41:53,580 --> 01:41:55,060
Did you come up with this?

2396
01:41:55,060 --> 01:41:55,900
No, it's just-

2397
01:41:55,900 --> 01:41:56,740
I've never heard of this before.

2398
01:41:56,740 --> 01:42:00,580
Jay really only appears post credits on The Tonight Show

2399
01:42:00,580 --> 01:42:03,540
and he doesn't have a scene with Piven,

2400
01:42:03,540 --> 01:42:06,180
but this is a movie about Jeremy Piven

2401
01:42:06,180 --> 01:42:08,860
as a guy doing Hollywood tours

2402
01:42:08,900 --> 01:42:12,180
that lies to an actress about being a screenwriter

2403
01:42:13,300 --> 01:42:15,700
and he wears like a little outfit

2404
01:42:15,700 --> 01:42:16,540
when he's driving the bus.

2405
01:42:16,540 --> 01:42:19,620
You wear the 1930s like little bellhop uniform?

2406
01:42:19,620 --> 01:42:20,460
Uh-huh.

2407
01:42:20,460 --> 01:42:21,300
Wow.

2408
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:26,060
And it's pre-Ari Gold Piven, so he's still bald.

2409
01:42:26,060 --> 01:42:27,340
He's in a little trolley,

2410
01:42:27,340 --> 01:42:28,180
but this is set in modern times?

2411
01:42:28,180 --> 01:42:30,460
Trolleywood tours, yeah.

2412
01:42:30,460 --> 01:42:33,900
And he's, it looks bad and I didn't watch all of it,

2413
01:42:33,900 --> 01:42:36,220
but I got bogged down like watching this bad movie

2414
01:42:36,220 --> 01:42:37,060
last night.

2415
01:42:37,100 --> 01:42:42,100
When I came to L.A. before I first came out here for school,

2416
01:42:42,100 --> 01:42:43,860
I really did like, I'm like,

2417
01:42:43,860 --> 01:42:47,740
it's probably not like the 90s version of Hollywood,

2418
01:42:47,740 --> 01:42:50,900
but there's probably a little bit,

2419
01:42:50,900 --> 01:42:53,340
and sure enough, you know.

2420
01:42:53,340 --> 01:42:54,420
There was one movie.

2421
01:42:54,420 --> 01:42:56,100
There was one movie about a man with a cap.

2422
01:42:56,100 --> 01:42:58,780
One disliked movie that no one knows

2423
01:42:58,780 --> 01:43:01,140
where it is like theme park Hollywood.

2424
01:43:01,140 --> 01:43:02,260
No one's ever heard of this movie

2425
01:43:02,260 --> 01:43:03,780
and Jay is in it at the end.

2426
01:43:03,780 --> 01:43:04,620
Wow.

2427
01:43:04,620 --> 01:43:05,460
What does he do?

2428
01:43:06,260 --> 01:43:07,740
He interviews a different,

2429
01:43:07,740 --> 01:43:10,700
it's not worth it to play it,

2430
01:43:10,700 --> 01:43:13,460
but he's just, it's almost like a little tag on the end

2431
01:43:13,460 --> 01:43:16,860
of what happens to this one actor in the movie.

2432
01:43:16,860 --> 01:43:19,060
Samuel L. Jackson of this movie.

2433
01:43:19,060 --> 01:43:19,900
Sure.

2434
01:43:21,100 --> 01:43:22,340
Stay, wait, what's it called?

2435
01:43:22,340 --> 01:43:23,460
Just Write?

2436
01:43:23,460 --> 01:43:25,260
Just Write W-

2437
01:43:25,260 --> 01:43:27,820
Don't leave the theater during the credits

2438
01:43:27,820 --> 01:43:28,820
for Just Write.

2439
01:43:28,820 --> 01:43:31,540
Assuming, actually, okay, let's be honest.

2440
01:43:31,540 --> 01:43:34,380
Leave the TV on while you're watching,

2441
01:43:34,380 --> 01:43:36,500
probably straight to TV movie Just Write.

2442
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:37,340
Right.

2443
01:43:37,340 --> 01:43:39,620
I think accidentally straight to TV maybe.

2444
01:43:39,620 --> 01:43:40,460
Maybe they had ambitions.

2445
01:43:40,460 --> 01:43:42,420
Like, I think Collision Course.

2446
01:43:42,420 --> 01:43:44,380
I think Collision Course came out internationally.

2447
01:43:44,380 --> 01:43:45,220
Oh wow, I didn't know.

2448
01:43:45,220 --> 01:43:46,780
Maybe not in American theaters.

2449
01:43:46,780 --> 01:43:47,620
Interesting.

2450
01:43:47,620 --> 01:43:48,440
Yeah.

2451
01:43:48,440 --> 01:43:49,280
Okay.

2452
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:50,180
Well, they'll love it in Japan.

2453
01:43:50,180 --> 01:43:51,780
We make a lot of jokes about them.

2454
01:43:51,780 --> 01:43:53,140
Oh yeah, that'll be, yeah.

2455
01:43:53,140 --> 01:43:54,820
They'll think it's so funny.

2456
01:43:56,140 --> 01:43:56,980
Yeah, so I don't know.

2457
01:43:56,980 --> 01:43:58,540
Nothing else so notable,

2458
01:43:58,540 --> 01:44:00,740
but there's obviously a ton of Leno stuff still

2459
01:44:00,740 --> 01:44:01,740
and we couldn't go through all of it,

2460
01:44:01,740 --> 01:44:04,220
so I'm sure there's gems here and there we've missed.

2461
01:44:05,060 --> 01:44:06,420
Let's be clear about something

2462
01:44:06,420 --> 01:44:07,260
and if we've missed anything,

2463
01:44:07,260 --> 01:44:09,900
maybe we could pick it up in this episode.

2464
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:10,740
Oh right.

2465
01:44:10,740 --> 01:44:13,140
Jay Leno's acting career is not

2466
01:44:13,140 --> 01:44:15,340
Jay Leno's wrestling career.

2467
01:44:15,340 --> 01:44:16,180
Right.

2468
01:44:16,180 --> 01:44:18,700
Entire other episode that is coming.

2469
01:44:18,700 --> 01:44:19,540
Yes.

2470
01:44:19,540 --> 01:44:20,980
This is the tidy way that we figured out

2471
01:44:20,980 --> 01:44:24,100
how to do more of what seemed to always be

2472
01:44:24,100 --> 01:44:27,700
our longest episodes, episodes involving Jay Leno.

2473
01:44:27,700 --> 01:44:30,900
So, and we're not quite out of the woods yet

2474
01:44:30,900 --> 01:44:32,340
because I'm really happy with this one.

2475
01:44:32,340 --> 01:44:33,740
Luckily, not a lot of set up for this.

2476
01:44:34,260 --> 01:44:35,820
I remember a kind of late 90s, early 2000s

2477
01:44:35,820 --> 01:44:37,860
NBC show called Providence.

2478
01:44:37,860 --> 01:44:38,700
Yes.

2479
01:44:38,700 --> 01:44:39,540
Oh yeah.

2480
01:44:39,540 --> 01:44:40,740
Yeah, one of those like Saturday night,

2481
01:44:40,740 --> 01:44:41,940
like I don't know what it is.

2482
01:44:41,940 --> 01:44:44,260
Bunch of doctors in a little charming town.

2483
01:44:44,260 --> 01:44:45,100
I don't know.

2484
01:44:45,100 --> 01:44:46,300
Really doesn't matter.

2485
01:44:46,300 --> 01:44:47,980
I guess the only thing you need to know for this

2486
01:44:47,980 --> 01:44:49,940
is that we are going to watch a scene

2487
01:44:49,940 --> 01:44:52,980
involving a veterinarian

2488
01:44:52,980 --> 01:44:55,340
and this will be a better reveal for you guys

2489
01:44:55,340 --> 01:44:57,460
than the listener, but we'll clue you in.

2490
01:45:00,420 --> 01:45:03,020
Dr. Hanson, am I glad to see you.

2491
01:45:04,300 --> 01:45:06,100
Hey, you don't look so good.

2492
01:45:07,260 --> 01:45:08,860
Come on, let's get back upstairs.

2493
01:45:11,620 --> 01:45:12,940
Come on, follow me.

2494
01:45:15,060 --> 01:45:17,900
So, what is happening here is that

2495
01:45:19,660 --> 01:45:23,060
a woman has come in with her seeing eye dog.

2496
01:45:23,060 --> 01:45:25,260
There is a problem with the seeing eye dog.

2497
01:45:25,260 --> 01:45:28,300
It seems amiss and he's not doing his job.

2498
01:45:28,300 --> 01:45:30,660
And then I don't know if we're in fantasy land.

2499
01:45:30,660 --> 01:45:33,940
I don't know if the doctor, if the vet bumped his head

2500
01:45:33,940 --> 01:45:36,700
or whatever it is, but when he hears a voice,

2501
01:45:36,700 --> 01:45:38,460
like is there an intruder in my house?

2502
01:45:38,460 --> 01:45:40,260
And then he goes down into the kitchen

2503
01:45:40,260 --> 01:45:43,380
and he sees a dog and the dog talks to him

2504
01:45:43,380 --> 01:45:45,420
and the dog is voiced by Jay Leno.

2505
01:45:47,860 --> 01:45:49,900
There are some more moments of this.

2506
01:45:49,900 --> 01:45:52,020
He kind of ends up explaining his problem,

2507
01:45:52,020 --> 01:45:53,180
I think, in this clip.

2508
01:45:55,300 --> 01:45:56,460
You're still talking.

2509
01:45:56,460 --> 01:45:59,540
Yeah, we have a small window and we better take advantage.

2510
01:45:59,540 --> 01:46:02,100
I need you to tell me why this is happening to me.

2511
01:46:03,700 --> 01:46:04,980
Why, what's happening to you?

2512
01:46:04,980 --> 01:46:07,540
I'm in the middle of a guide dog's worst nightmare.

2513
01:46:07,540 --> 01:46:08,660
It's my eyes, doc.

2514
01:46:08,660 --> 01:46:10,220
I'm having trouble seeing.

2515
01:46:12,300 --> 01:46:13,460
A guide dog's.

2516
01:46:15,420 --> 01:46:16,740
He's a real guy's dog.

2517
01:46:17,780 --> 01:46:19,620
That's why he has that middle America feel.

2518
01:46:19,620 --> 01:46:21,700
Yeah, same to the regular guide dog.

2519
01:46:23,580 --> 01:46:27,100
He touched the bones from my one job.

2520
01:46:27,980 --> 01:46:30,580
Oh, yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2521
01:46:30,580 --> 01:46:33,940
I don't eat any of the bones given to me by my first owner.

2522
01:46:33,940 --> 01:46:36,660
I go to a second owner that nobody knows about.

2523
01:46:36,660 --> 01:46:37,820
I go out on the road.

2524
01:46:37,820 --> 01:46:41,940
I go to other dog owners' doors and they give me bones

2525
01:46:41,940 --> 01:46:42,780
and that's what I survive on.

2526
01:46:42,780 --> 01:46:43,700
I do dog shows.

2527
01:46:43,700 --> 01:46:45,500
I live on my dog show money.

2528
01:46:45,500 --> 01:46:46,340
That's good, yeah.

2529
01:46:46,340 --> 01:46:47,620
I know, that's very good.

2530
01:46:47,620 --> 01:46:49,740
I don't touch my guide dog bones.

2531
01:46:49,740 --> 01:46:50,580
That's great.

2532
01:46:50,580 --> 01:46:51,420
Yeah, yeah.

2533
01:46:52,420 --> 01:46:55,420
And he owes all of those fucking guide dog bones to me.

2534
01:46:55,420 --> 01:46:57,980
I'm the one who got him the guide dog job.

2535
01:46:57,980 --> 01:46:59,140
Yeah, I'm a bitch.

2536
01:46:59,140 --> 01:47:01,020
I'm not afraid to say it.

2537
01:47:01,020 --> 01:47:02,860
A wolf rush is a dog in this scenario, right?

2538
01:47:02,860 --> 01:47:03,700
Yes, yeah.

2539
01:47:05,020 --> 01:47:10,020
What I should be called, woof woof, woof woof fucking woof.

2540
01:47:12,020 --> 01:47:13,060
One more little moment.

2541
01:47:13,060 --> 01:47:14,860
I think I'm going to have to do this again.

2542
01:47:14,860 --> 01:47:15,700
I'm going to have to do this again.

2543
01:47:15,700 --> 01:47:16,540
I'm going to have to do this again.

2544
01:47:16,540 --> 01:47:17,380
Woof.

2545
01:47:18,820 --> 01:47:19,660
One more little moment.

2546
01:47:19,660 --> 01:47:21,860
I think this kind of helps resolve it.

2547
01:47:21,860 --> 01:47:24,140
Dog Hanson, you're the best.

2548
01:47:24,140 --> 01:47:26,140
Lucky I couldn't have done it without a good guide dog.

2549
01:47:26,140 --> 01:47:27,820
You walked me right through it.

2550
01:47:27,820 --> 01:47:29,220
Listen, if you don't mind sticking around

2551
01:47:29,220 --> 01:47:30,060
for a little while,

2552
01:47:30,060 --> 01:47:32,380
there are about a million questions I'd like to ask you.

2553
01:47:32,380 --> 01:47:33,740
Okay, shoot.

2554
01:47:34,700 --> 01:47:35,700
Henry.

2555
01:47:35,700 --> 01:47:36,860
Then you don't get those questions.

2556
01:47:36,860 --> 01:47:38,380
He doesn't even get a question in?

2557
01:47:38,380 --> 01:47:41,180
No, he doesn't, which it was frustrating for me

2558
01:47:41,180 --> 01:47:42,660
because I don't know the show Providence,

2559
01:47:42,660 --> 01:47:44,860
so I don't know if there's magic in it typically.

2560
01:47:44,860 --> 01:47:47,900
I don't know if dogs, he seems a little surprised

2561
01:47:47,900 --> 01:47:48,940
but not that surprised.

2562
01:47:48,940 --> 01:47:51,700
Maybe dogs sometimes talk in Providence.

2563
01:47:51,700 --> 01:47:52,780
I don't know.

2564
01:47:52,780 --> 01:47:55,100
Maybe none of it had to do with dogs.

2565
01:47:55,100 --> 01:47:57,700
Maybe it was like, I got a lot of questions for you.

2566
01:47:57,700 --> 01:47:58,860
Okay, shoot.

2567
01:47:59,860 --> 01:48:04,500
In the Cars universe, why would there be talk shows

2568
01:48:04,500 --> 01:48:06,500
and tramp stamps?

2569
01:48:06,500 --> 01:48:09,140
Why are those things that Cars would need?

2570
01:48:09,140 --> 01:48:10,820
I don't know, a C&I dog.

2571
01:48:10,820 --> 01:48:11,660
I know what that...

2572
01:48:11,660 --> 01:48:12,700
What do I, yeah.

2573
01:48:13,580 --> 01:48:16,420
We've only, my owner can only listen to Cars.

2574
01:48:18,300 --> 01:48:19,940
What did Jay turn down?

2575
01:48:19,940 --> 01:48:20,940
This is my question.

2576
01:48:20,940 --> 01:48:22,860
Yeah, that I would like to know.

2577
01:48:22,860 --> 01:48:25,460
I think things with a lot of swearing or...

2578
01:48:25,460 --> 01:48:27,020
Oh yeah, maybe.

2579
01:48:27,020 --> 01:48:28,900
Maybe if something, yeah, it was like he had to play

2580
01:48:28,900 --> 01:48:30,740
against type or something and he was not,

2581
01:48:30,740 --> 01:48:33,740
I bet that is absolutely what it is, playing against type

2582
01:48:33,740 --> 01:48:36,020
where he's like a very mean guy.

2583
01:48:36,020 --> 01:48:38,300
He would never do it because he's so self-conscious

2584
01:48:38,300 --> 01:48:41,340
about being a nice guy and being an everyman.

2585
01:48:41,420 --> 01:48:44,220
Yeah, well now he's a little mean in Collision Course

2586
01:48:44,220 --> 01:48:46,660
but I think since he made the flip, yeah, yeah.

2587
01:48:46,660 --> 01:48:49,820
But that's when he was regular Jay, not Denim Jay

2588
01:48:49,820 --> 01:48:52,500
who has built a suit of denim to protect

2589
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:56,180
from the harassment of his friends from back home.

2590
01:48:56,180 --> 01:48:57,300
The guys from back home were like,

2591
01:48:57,300 --> 01:49:00,500
oh, you make the big shot, which he talks about a lot.

2592
01:49:00,500 --> 01:49:05,500
I gave Jason a whole symposium on Jay's psychological profile

2593
01:49:05,540 --> 01:49:07,860
of why he does things in the car on the way over here

2594
01:49:07,860 --> 01:49:09,860
but yeah, it's because the denim

2595
01:49:10,180 --> 01:49:11,460
not touching the tights of money,

2596
01:49:11,460 --> 01:49:14,340
he's really worried about his buddies from back home

2597
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:17,380
giving him grief about being rich and successful.

2598
01:49:17,380 --> 01:49:19,020
So that's why he's like, they'll go,

2599
01:49:19,020 --> 01:49:20,100
Jay, do you have a pool?

2600
01:49:20,100 --> 01:49:20,940
You've never swam in it.

2601
01:49:20,940 --> 01:49:23,420
Yeah, yeah, I can just imagine the guys back home going,

2602
01:49:23,420 --> 01:49:25,380
oh, Mr. Big Shot, there was this big pool

2603
01:49:25,380 --> 01:49:26,820
like in Beverly Hills.

2604
01:49:26,820 --> 01:49:28,380
And you're like, Jay, what's wrong with you?

2605
01:49:28,380 --> 01:49:30,540
Swim in your fucking pool.

2606
01:49:30,540 --> 01:49:31,820
There's a heat wave going on.

2607
01:49:31,820 --> 01:49:32,660
Yeah, so.

2608
01:49:32,660 --> 01:49:34,420
Jay, have you gone soft on us?

2609
01:49:34,420 --> 01:49:39,420
Do you, you don't eat sushi out there in Hollywood, do you?

2610
01:49:40,220 --> 01:49:42,500
No, no, nothing but hot dogs for me.

2611
01:49:42,500 --> 01:49:44,660
And I have not found a private caterer

2612
01:49:44,660 --> 01:49:47,620
who knows how to disguise sushi as hot dogs.

2613
01:49:47,620 --> 01:49:49,540
No, it's regular hot dogs.

2614
01:49:49,540 --> 01:49:50,740
It is what it is.

2615
01:49:51,980 --> 01:49:53,500
I think that's so much of the basis

2616
01:49:53,500 --> 01:49:55,020
for all of his odd behavior

2617
01:49:55,020 --> 01:49:57,660
is trying to appear normal to his old buddies.

2618
01:49:57,660 --> 01:49:58,500
Wow.

2619
01:49:58,500 --> 01:50:00,420
To the theory of old buddies.

2620
01:50:00,420 --> 01:50:03,140
And they might not exist, by the way, too.

2621
01:50:03,140 --> 01:50:04,500
He might just in his head be like,

2622
01:50:04,500 --> 01:50:06,220
no, you've gone, you're big time.

2623
01:50:06,220 --> 01:50:09,740
Well, if I didn't spend every second of my life

2624
01:50:10,620 --> 01:50:13,140
post-15 doing stand-up, then I might,

2625
01:50:13,140 --> 01:50:16,060
a guy like that might end up having a couple of friends.

2626
01:50:16,060 --> 01:50:17,860
So theoretically, I'm just hung up

2627
01:50:17,860 --> 01:50:20,620
on what my theoretical friends might think.

2628
01:50:20,620 --> 01:50:21,460
That's right.

2629
01:50:21,460 --> 01:50:22,500
You know, I'm friends with Adam Carolla.

2630
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:24,340
I'm friends with some other good guys.

2631
01:50:24,340 --> 01:50:25,180
You don't want a friend.

2632
01:50:25,180 --> 01:50:26,900
Bill Maher, Adam Carolla, good guys, good guys.

2633
01:50:26,900 --> 01:50:28,380
Arnold Schwarzkopf, you know,

2634
01:50:28,380 --> 01:50:31,220
he's an ex-governor of California.

2635
01:50:31,220 --> 01:50:32,180
Yeah, he wouldn't have me do that

2636
01:50:32,180 --> 01:50:33,100
if he wasn't my friend.

2637
01:50:33,100 --> 01:50:34,060
We're friends.

2638
01:50:34,060 --> 01:50:35,260
Tim Allen.

2639
01:50:35,260 --> 01:50:37,220
Tim, of course, yeah, Tim.

2640
01:50:37,220 --> 01:50:38,780
Politically, you know, we don't see eye to eye,

2641
01:50:38,780 --> 01:50:41,420
necessarily, but like, his business is his business,

2642
01:50:41,420 --> 01:50:43,940
and what am I gonna do, you know, what am I saying?

2643
01:50:43,940 --> 01:50:46,940
You know, I got arrested for illicit substances

2644
01:50:46,940 --> 01:50:48,260
while in a car, and I don't like that,

2645
01:50:48,260 --> 01:50:50,620
because, you know, you could do damage to the car.

2646
01:50:50,620 --> 01:50:51,540
That could be hurt, yeah.

2647
01:50:51,540 --> 01:50:53,380
Drug driving, you know, it makes me crazy.

2648
01:50:53,380 --> 01:50:55,020
You could end up hitting the wrong button,

2649
01:50:55,020 --> 01:50:57,220
and then you do some damage to that thing.

2650
01:50:57,220 --> 01:50:59,020
Do you think it would be too weird to do an episode

2651
01:50:59,020 --> 01:51:02,380
just on Don't Blame Conan Letterman's monologue

2652
01:51:02,380 --> 01:51:06,020
from his show that Susser and I very often

2653
01:51:06,020 --> 01:51:09,340
will just text lines from this monologue,

2654
01:51:09,340 --> 01:51:10,780
because we're both obsessed with it,

2655
01:51:10,780 --> 01:51:12,500
and that's maybe what I would want to do

2656
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:15,620
in an acting class, is when there's a part when Conan.

2657
01:51:15,620 --> 01:51:18,020
You've previously explained, it's also on the show,

2658
01:51:18,020 --> 01:51:20,420
for sure, I know that you've said,

2659
01:51:20,420 --> 01:51:22,300
you ever seen this clip, we both said yes,

2660
01:51:22,300 --> 01:51:23,900
then you said the whole clip anyway.

2661
01:51:23,900 --> 01:51:25,380
Well, now I'm doing it for the listener.

2662
01:51:25,380 --> 01:51:26,220
Now I'm not doing it to him.

2663
01:51:26,220 --> 01:51:27,420
Not on the show, too, I'm saying.

2664
01:51:27,420 --> 01:51:28,260
Oh, okay.

2665
01:51:28,260 --> 01:51:31,220
Yeah, but he's working on his piece for his acting class.

2666
01:51:31,220 --> 01:51:33,620
I'm working on the piece for my acting class.

2667
01:51:34,060 --> 01:51:37,500
I'm around the same age Jay was in Collision Course.

2668
01:51:37,500 --> 01:51:39,260
Well, that's a heady thing to do in an acting class.

2669
01:51:39,260 --> 01:51:41,100
This whole thing has been about talk show hosts

2670
01:51:41,100 --> 01:51:42,500
and their weird relationship to acting,

2671
01:51:42,500 --> 01:51:44,020
and that you are going to,

2672
01:51:45,220 --> 01:51:48,060
for you to get way more credits than Jay Leno has,

2673
01:51:48,060 --> 01:51:51,300
you're gonna use a monologue of acting

2674
01:51:51,300 --> 01:51:53,620
about talk show hosts to get there?

2675
01:51:53,620 --> 01:51:56,140
That might be the kind of ingenious meta thinking

2676
01:51:56,140 --> 01:51:58,180
that you need to light a fire.

2677
01:51:58,180 --> 01:51:59,260
I think that might be right.

2678
01:51:59,260 --> 01:52:02,180
So, coming soon, my one person show,

2679
01:52:02,180 --> 01:52:05,940
where I just recreate David Letterman's monologue.

2680
01:52:05,940 --> 01:52:06,780
Three minute monologue.

2681
01:52:06,780 --> 01:52:08,900
Or desk piece, I should say, not standing up.

2682
01:52:08,900 --> 01:52:09,740
Desk piece, yeah.

2683
01:52:09,740 --> 01:52:11,460
So, yeah, right next to each other, yes.

2684
01:52:11,460 --> 01:52:14,620
So, it's Mike Carlson is David Letterman.

2685
01:52:14,620 --> 01:52:16,340
Scott Gardner is Helen Kushnick.

2686
01:52:16,340 --> 01:52:17,420
Right.

2687
01:52:17,420 --> 01:52:18,900
Mine's called Don't Blame Conan,

2688
01:52:18,900 --> 01:52:20,100
which is what the clip is called.

2689
01:52:20,100 --> 01:52:21,900
And then to get in character,

2690
01:52:21,900 --> 01:52:24,740
yours is called, you do yours at a black box,

2691
01:52:24,740 --> 01:52:26,380
called The Player's Workshop,

2692
01:52:26,380 --> 01:52:30,060
and I, in character, am calling up The Player's Workshop.

2693
01:52:30,060 --> 01:52:33,140
You need to bump that tired old fuck Carlson.

2694
01:52:33,140 --> 01:52:35,900
He's already said this on a podcast twice.

2695
01:52:35,900 --> 01:52:37,420
Now you think people are gonna come in

2696
01:52:37,420 --> 01:52:39,940
and pay to hear the monologue?

2697
01:52:39,940 --> 01:52:41,340
I'm the hottest shit in town.

2698
01:52:41,340 --> 01:52:45,060
Me, this goddamn bitch with the biggest nards

2699
01:52:45,060 --> 01:52:46,540
you ever seen.

2700
01:52:46,540 --> 01:52:48,860
I just make a quick cameo in Mike's show.

2701
01:52:48,860 --> 01:52:50,340
It's Paul Schaefer.

2702
01:52:50,340 --> 01:52:53,700
I put a bald cap on and I go, no, Dave.

2703
01:52:53,700 --> 01:52:55,700
I hope you're not thinking about blaming Conan.

2704
01:52:55,700 --> 01:52:57,100
I wasn't.

2705
01:52:57,100 --> 01:52:58,940
You know what, Scott, you should do,

2706
01:52:59,500 --> 01:53:00,860
you should actually just become her

2707
01:53:00,860 --> 01:53:02,740
and become your own manager

2708
01:53:02,740 --> 01:53:04,300
and just be a phone manager.

2709
01:53:04,300 --> 01:53:05,380
Oh, like Trump?

2710
01:53:05,380 --> 01:53:06,220
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2711
01:53:06,220 --> 01:53:07,740
Yeah, pretending you have a.

2712
01:53:07,740 --> 01:53:09,060
The voice is a little close.

2713
01:53:09,060 --> 01:53:10,340
I think if I could just run it through a filter or something.

2714
01:53:10,340 --> 01:53:13,260
On the phone, though, I think it wouldn't read.

2715
01:53:13,260 --> 01:53:15,020
Well, and you know what else I could do is like,

2716
01:53:15,020 --> 01:53:16,660
she's probably a speakerphone person.

2717
01:53:16,660 --> 01:53:19,060
Like, Marty, I'm putting you on speaker.

2718
01:53:19,060 --> 01:53:20,620
I got shit to do.

2719
01:53:20,620 --> 01:53:22,740
So if I go back here, maybe that kind of,

2720
01:53:22,740 --> 01:53:25,300
and if I establish, once you get me on the phone,

2721
01:53:25,300 --> 01:53:28,260
that I'm like deep voiced and friendly, wow.

2722
01:53:28,260 --> 01:53:29,340
Well, I'd love to do it.

2723
01:53:29,340 --> 01:53:31,100
I'd really love to be a part of your project.

2724
01:53:31,100 --> 01:53:33,700
I just really have to run it through my manager, Helen.

2725
01:53:35,020 --> 01:53:36,140
Listen, you.

2726
01:53:37,300 --> 01:53:39,460
Listen, you bald guzzler.

2727
01:53:39,460 --> 01:53:41,420
Scott Garner doesn't get out of bed

2728
01:53:41,420 --> 01:53:43,580
for less than 200K a day.

2729
01:53:44,780 --> 01:53:47,900
If you don't like it, I'll force feed you

2730
01:53:47,900 --> 01:53:52,100
of more brain grain cereal than you can eat.

2731
01:53:52,100 --> 01:53:52,940
Oh my God.

2732
01:53:52,940 --> 01:53:54,740
Although with the size of your mouth,

2733
01:53:54,740 --> 01:53:57,700
I bet you love having big loads in your mouth, don't you?

2734
01:53:58,340 --> 01:53:59,620
Helen.

2735
01:53:59,620 --> 01:54:00,460
Well, I guess we better give Scott.

2736
01:54:00,460 --> 01:54:01,780
What, you can't handle the heat?

2737
01:54:01,780 --> 01:54:03,460
Then get out of the goddamn kitchen.

2738
01:54:03,460 --> 01:54:06,180
I guess we better give Scott that 200K.

2739
01:54:06,180 --> 01:54:07,740
A day. A day.

2740
01:54:07,740 --> 01:54:09,300
That's an astounding day, right?

2741
01:54:09,300 --> 01:54:10,340
Yeah.

2742
01:54:10,340 --> 01:54:13,340
We don't want to be insulted by his manager again.

2743
01:54:13,340 --> 01:54:15,860
His manager, a real human woman who exists,

2744
01:54:15,860 --> 01:54:17,500
is gonna have my ass.

2745
01:54:17,500 --> 01:54:20,860
She keeps threatening to roast my nards on her stove.

2746
01:54:22,780 --> 01:54:23,620
Maybe that's what.

2747
01:54:23,620 --> 01:54:25,580
She says she's got a gas grill and an electric,

2748
01:54:25,580 --> 01:54:28,100
and she's not afraid to switch me back and forth.

2749
01:54:28,940 --> 01:54:30,740
Kill or be killed right now in the entertainment business.

2750
01:54:30,740 --> 01:54:32,660
And I think you need every leg up you can get.

2751
01:54:32,660 --> 01:54:33,620
I think this is the way.

2752
01:54:33,620 --> 01:54:35,020
Well, so apologies.

2753
01:54:35,020 --> 01:54:36,580
I'm gonna have to crush your show.

2754
01:54:36,580 --> 01:54:37,420
That's fine.

2755
01:54:37,420 --> 01:54:39,580
And then any other listeners out there, any other actor,

2756
01:54:39,580 --> 01:54:41,900
if you're doing any local theater productions,

2757
01:54:41,900 --> 01:54:42,860
you're dead to me.

2758
01:54:42,860 --> 01:54:43,700
Yeah.

2759
01:54:43,700 --> 01:54:45,300
And especially to Helen.

2760
01:54:45,300 --> 01:54:46,140
I don't want to.

2761
01:54:46,140 --> 01:54:47,580
I'm scared of Helen.

2762
01:54:47,580 --> 01:54:48,500
I'm afraid of her.

2763
01:54:51,620 --> 01:54:53,300
Listen, you little pussies

2764
01:54:53,300 --> 01:54:55,780
can't go any more minutes on this thing, can you?

2765
01:54:55,780 --> 01:54:57,140
You can't stand the heat.

2766
01:54:57,140 --> 01:54:59,340
You want to wrap up this episode, don't you?

2767
01:54:59,340 --> 01:55:02,260
Well, then I guess you survived podcast The Ride.

2768
01:55:02,260 --> 01:55:03,820
I could go another three hours.

2769
01:55:03,820 --> 01:55:05,460
I could do it in my sleep.

2770
01:55:05,460 --> 01:55:08,380
But look at you, quivering, falling to the ground,

2771
01:55:08,380 --> 01:55:11,060
sweating like Hasselhoff in that goddamn clip.

2772
01:55:11,060 --> 01:55:12,500
Oh yeah, you're right, Helen.

2773
01:55:13,940 --> 01:55:16,540
I bet everybody listening doesn't have the nards

2774
01:55:16,540 --> 01:55:18,180
to dig even deeper and join us

2775
01:55:18,180 --> 01:55:21,180
on our VIP Patreon tier, Club 3.

2776
01:55:21,180 --> 01:55:22,900
Bad news, you gotta have something bigger

2777
01:55:22,900 --> 01:55:25,940
than a tiny little prick if you want to make it in Club 3,

2778
01:55:25,940 --> 01:55:28,380
where you get one more bonus episode every month

2779
01:55:28,380 --> 01:55:31,260
and our regular episodes ad-free, damn it.

2780
01:55:31,260 --> 01:55:33,900
I have tiny nards, Helen, I'm sorry.

2781
01:55:33,900 --> 01:55:36,460
You called me, you saw through me.

2782
01:55:36,460 --> 01:55:38,860
I see right through those teal shorts of yours.

2783
01:55:38,860 --> 01:55:39,780
Yeah.

2784
01:55:39,780 --> 01:55:41,060
Jason, I don't understand.

2785
01:55:41,060 --> 01:55:44,780
You make fun of Hasselhoff's teal body shirt,

2786
01:55:44,780 --> 01:55:48,380
but teal shorts on your buddy are just fine?

2787
01:55:48,380 --> 01:55:50,180
I don't want to bring up his nards.

2788
01:55:50,180 --> 01:55:51,980
I'm afraid you'll go in on my nards.

2789
01:55:51,980 --> 01:55:53,140
Jason, make fun of my nards

2790
01:55:53,140 --> 01:55:54,940
so Helen doesn't get extra mad.

2791
01:55:54,980 --> 01:55:57,380
Oh, nasty, nasty nards.

2792
01:55:58,620 --> 01:55:59,460
Was that good, Helen?

2793
01:55:59,460 --> 01:56:00,420
Helen likes it.

2794
01:56:00,420 --> 01:56:01,260
I can see you're smiling.

2795
01:56:01,260 --> 01:56:03,220
Very good, perhaps you could work in my office.

2796
01:56:03,220 --> 01:56:04,060
Oh, okay.

2797
01:56:04,060 --> 01:56:07,500
Salary starts at a buck an hour, 15 hours a day, damn it.

2798
01:56:07,500 --> 01:56:08,500
Take the job, take the job, Jason.

2799
01:56:08,500 --> 01:56:10,620
I don't think that's legal federally.

2800
01:56:10,620 --> 01:56:11,460
I don't care, keep it.

2801
01:56:11,460 --> 01:56:13,020
If you don't take this job right now,

2802
01:56:13,020 --> 01:56:15,620
I'll know you're the pussy I suspected you were

2803
01:56:15,620 --> 01:56:16,820
when you walked into this room.

2804
01:56:16,820 --> 01:56:19,300
I am, I've made no,

2805
01:56:19,300 --> 01:56:21,780
I've made no arguments that I am not.

2806
01:56:21,780 --> 01:56:23,380
You know what, you admitted you're a pussy

2807
01:56:23,380 --> 01:56:24,420
and I respect it.

2808
01:56:24,420 --> 01:56:26,180
You're hired.

2809
01:56:26,180 --> 01:56:28,660
Can I at least get $3 an hour?

2810
01:56:28,660 --> 01:56:29,500
Jason, no.

2811
01:56:29,500 --> 01:56:31,020
Hell fucking no.

2812
01:56:32,140 --> 01:56:34,740
Thought you would like it if I played a hard ball.
