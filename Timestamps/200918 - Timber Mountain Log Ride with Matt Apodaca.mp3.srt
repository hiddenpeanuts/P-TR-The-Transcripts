1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Forever.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,080
Dog.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,340
Warning, the following podcast contains

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,680
backbreaking manual labor, sweet pranks,

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,880
a Nixon restaurant, and rivers Cuomo?

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,660
Matt Apodaca joins us to talk Knott's Berry Farms

7
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,400
timber mountain log ride.

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,820
Get ready for lumber and splashing.

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,160
It's podcast, The Ride.

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:50,120
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a show hosted by three men who, under normal circumstances,

11
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,500
are the show's sitting butt to crotch, butt to crotch, butt to crotch.

12
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:00,060
Similar to today's attraction, I'm Jason Sheridan, joined as always by Mike Carlson.

13
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:04,380
Hi I'm here and I insist that we do that because it makes me feel loved.

14
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:09,500
I, you know, and I seconded it because I feel the same way.

15
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,380
Scott Gerner is also here.

16
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:17,220
Yeah, and the only issue is that we all fight over who gets to be the middle.

17
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,100
Who gets to have the most love.

18
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,800
Jason usually comes into recording and he yells middle Z's.

19
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,600
You gotta call middle Z's.

20
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,160
I'm the fastest at calling middle Z's.

21
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:34,280
We gotta learn to call it, be a text before we get inside.

22
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,000
Yeah, I know, but I always forget.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,800
He gets us.

24
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,320
Yeah.

25
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,800
Yeah.

26
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,960
But yeah, we haven't had that contact in a while.

27
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,720
And I assume we're all missing.

28
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:51,340
And I take Duffy and friends and I use them to sort of recreate that while I'm recording.

29
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,340
I'll have Duffy in front and Shelley Mae in back.

30
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,500
Oh, sure.

31
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,100
But it's not the same.

32
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:57,700
Yeah.

33
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:02,780
Me and all my Rex's, we all line up by height.

34
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:07,380
I take the back in that case because they're all very small and I don't want to block their

35
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,900
view of the virtual log ride that we all go on together.

36
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,420
That's right.

37
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,500
And you're kind of a father figure to those Rex's.

38
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,520
Yeah, absolutely.

39
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,520
Yeah.

40
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,520
And only to them.

41
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,520
And only to them.

42
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,520
Yeah.

43
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,520
I'm not letting some...

44
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,520
Disregard you being an actual father.

45
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,320
No, I'm not letting some baby take their well-earned territory.

46
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,720
Let's bring in our guest.

47
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,760
Our guest today, he's the producer of How Did This Get Played, a wonderful podcast on

48
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,480
the Earwolf Network.

49
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,880
It's Matt Apodaca.

50
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:44,880
And I realized I did not ask how to say your last name before we started recording.

51
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,900
You nailed it, baby.

52
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,900
All right.

53
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,900
You did it.

54
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,900
All right.

55
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,900
Five stars.

56
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,580
Thank you so much.

57
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,420
Another win for Jason.

58
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,500
This is unbelievable.

59
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,940
I got the intro out.

60
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,740
I got the guest name right.

61
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,060
Everything's coming up Jason today.

62
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,060
That's it.

63
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,100
We get to talk about old timey bullshit and guys named Bud Hurlbutt and stuff.

64
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,420
This is a big day for you.

65
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:13,080
Defunct ride fabrication companies too.

66
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,240
Thank you for doing the show, Matt.

67
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:24,840
Now, when we were talking about your theme park experiences or stuff you like, you had

68
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,320
mentioned you grew up pretty close to Disneyland and Knott's Berry Farms.

69
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,320
Yeah.

70
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,640
I'm a SoCal kid.

71
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:39,700
I guess I technically grew up within the county of Los Angeles, but I was like on the very

72
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,700
edge of it.

73
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,140
So very Orange County adjacent.

74
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:49,260
So I spent a lot of time at Knott's Berry Farm and at Disneyland in particular.

75
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,420
But we had annual passes to Knott's Berry Farm.

76
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,260
And that was just like a thing that my mom, if she had to like work on the weekend, would

77
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,260
just like drop us off there while she was at work.

78
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,720
So we weren't like...

79
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,880
So she would at least know where we were.

80
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,680
And she's like, well, they're going to, one, burn all this energy at a theme park and then

81
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:13,360
I'll pick them up and then they'll just be like too tired to be bad when I got home.

82
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,360
Did it work?

83
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,360
We were no, we were really, really bad.

84
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,440
We were really bad kids.

85
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,840
I have two other brothers and so like, and we're all, I have a twin brother and a younger

86
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,680
brother who is two years younger.

87
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,260
And we were all like, you know, I guess what?

88
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,820
Three stooges, I guess, just like being bad, being bad kid.

89
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:38,860
So when you say being bad, you mean only spending like one hour exploring the replica of Independence

90
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,920
Hall, not two hours.

91
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,940
We went straight to the thrills and didn't get to really honoring the history of America,

92
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:51,620
which is part of the Knott's Berry Farm experience that people do often neglect.

93
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,620
Yes.

94
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,900
Do you have any memories?

95
00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:00,960
I always like to ask, do you have any like teen, strong teen memories from hanging out?

96
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,340
Cause that's such a, I think important part of everyone's theme park teen experience is

97
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,000
like these weird.

98
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,960
Sort of, but like they're all like, I don't know.

99
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,760
I feel like other people would probably have stories that involved like groups of friends,

100
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,600
but I just have, like I had two brothers, so I just spent a lot of time with them.

101
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,960
But then like, then they all then also then would tangentially involve my mom.

102
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:29,100
Cause if my mom wasn't at work, she was also there with us cause she's young and we would

103
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,300
like prank call her at Knott's Berry Farm.

104
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:38,820
Like we would call her work phone, collect and like, so one she'd have to accept a charge

105
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,940
cause she thought something was wrong.

106
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,140
And then we'd just be like, miss you mom.

107
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,140
It would even be bad.

108
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,140
It would just be like, hi.

109
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,720
We thought we were pranking her.

110
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,700
That's the sweetest prank I've ever heard.

111
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,700
Yeah.

112
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,700
That's usually what it was.

113
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,500
Or that we were like bored, which is like, you know, such a spoiled little brat, so Cal

114
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,500
kid thing.

115
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,500
We're bored at Berry Farm.

116
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,160
Are you done with work?

117
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,160
So stupid.

118
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,160
I mean, that's nice.

119
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,160
Yeah.

120
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,080
That's a good place to be.

121
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,520
You know, if you can be bored at the theme park, I guess you can just be bored anywhere

122
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,880
and not spend that money to be there instead.

123
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,040
Right.

124
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,360
Were you ever just around?

125
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,160
Would you always stay in Knott's or would you go into any of the other great parts of

126
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,080
the greatest city in the world, Buena Park?

127
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:29,860
So, yeah, there's, you know, a lot of Buena Park even to this day has remained unexplored.

128
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:35,980
If Buena Park was like in like a video game, like most of the map would still be red for

129
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:36,980
me.

130
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,180
Like I just had not gotten to it.

131
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:48,820
But that strip, that strip leading up to Knott's Berry Farm, I think there's some, well, there's

132
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,820
a lot of shit.

133
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:54,680
Like the medieval times is like, all right.

134
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,000
Like it's that's good for like a fun sort of just like, you know, maybe like tongue in

135
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,640
cheek outing for an excellent meal for the finest meal.

136
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,600
Oh, yeah, I wouldn't.

137
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,200
It's like it's it's better than any meal I've ever had.

138
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,200
Certainly.

139
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,200
It's great.

140
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,200
That's great.

141
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,200
That's where you go.

142
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,240
If you're really like if like the Pope's in town or something, you take the Pope to.

143
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:21,060
If you're entertaining a Pope, make sure he's going to want to be in a palace first of all.

144
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,060
Right.

145
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,620
He'll get to sit where the king is, I assume.

146
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,620
They will.

147
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,620
The king will make room for him.

148
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,620
I would hope so.

149
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,020
Otherwise, I hope they're prepared to shut down.

150
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,020
Yeah.

151
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:33,020
But they just added portos.

152
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,020
He drives the Pope Mobile.

153
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,540
Sorry, I was going to say he drives the Pope Mobile on the dirt before.

154
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,540
It just runs over the jouster.

155
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,540
Yeah.

156
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,540
Pope always wins.

157
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,540
Sorry.

158
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,840
It goes like night.

159
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,840
Sure.

160
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,080
Most nights, you know, would beat anybody.

161
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,080
But the Pope.

162
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,080
Sorry.

163
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,080
Pope always wins.

164
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,080
He wins.

165
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,480
He demands to take home a soup pitcher, the pitcher they walk around holding soup in that

166
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,120
they serve it to you.

167
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,120
Funny enough, that's the same demand Jason made.

168
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,120
Yes.

169
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,120
When we were there.

170
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,400
I always wanted like a sword.

171
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,880
I always wanted like a light up sword.

172
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:13,660
The one time I got one, I had it for like a day and then I was like, well, this is bullshit.

173
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,660
It's not even good.

174
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,860
Like it's it's a bad souvenir.

175
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,340
It's a waste of a souvenir.

176
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,260
A cup would be better because you could use a cup longer.

177
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,260
Yeah.

178
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,260
It's practical.

179
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,260
Yeah.

180
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,260
Yeah.

181
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,260
I cut you off.

182
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,260
What were you saying before?

183
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,260
Oh, there's like a portos over there in Buena Park now.

184
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,700
And I take gigantic portos.

185
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:34,900
And I feel like the quality across like portos in general is like very high.

186
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,900
Like it's very hard.

187
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,520
There's only there's not that many of them, but there are more now than there were like

188
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,360
like even five years ago or something.

189
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,240
But they're all very good.

190
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,840
There's a claim jumper over there that I think I've been the most full I've ever been in

191
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,560
my life eating at the claim jumper.

192
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,880
It's like not in a good way.

193
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,880
I hated it.

194
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,880
I hated that I ate that.

195
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,880
Oh, yeah.

196
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,880
Too full.

197
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,880
This is what it is.

198
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,880
They're off.

199
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,840
Yeah, that should be on their like sign outside.

200
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,400
Like eat more than you ever have and hate yourself.

201
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:10,020
It's like I ordered like what you would think is like a normal amount of food, but for some

202
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,540
reason it was just so dense.

203
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,100
I was just like, how?

204
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,340
I didn't even eat like like four meals.

205
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:19,740
I mean, good places, right?

206
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,380
Clean jumper is I figured figured out it is not good.

207
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,300
I think it's bad.

208
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:28,460
I don't want to accept what you're saying, but you probably are right.

209
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:32,380
But I feel like I've eaten like I go have a club sandwich and then they bring over like

210
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,040
three plate like each part of the sandwich has its own plate.

211
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,560
It's so big.

212
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,720
And then I do finish it and I go, well, that wasn't very good.

213
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,480
And you're always eating there right before you got to go to the airport.

214
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,640
So that adds to the stress.

215
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,640
So low.

216
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,440
It is definitely one in Burbank.

217
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,440
Yeah.

218
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,240
And in an office building, in terms of the hierarchy of Landry restaurants, it's definitely

219
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,440
leaning more towards rainforest cafe than yard house.

220
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,660
Not yard house.

221
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,980
So I would I would tip that scale the other way.

222
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,900
I would think I think rainforest cafe good.

223
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:16,740
You know, I went to the last one in the Los Angeles area, which is at the Ontario Mills

224
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:23,820
Mall. I was there with with old bug main and we I thought the legitimate ribs, very good

225
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,780
ribs. I was shockingly sad.

226
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,860
I was picturing just bullshit.

227
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,880
And he was very excited because they had a menu that was all like it said this was

228
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,080
developed by the executive chef at the Animal Kingdom location.

229
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,240
Oh, wow.

230
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,160
I like it. Specific rainforest cafe chefs.

231
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,880
And he was like, you can taste it.

232
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,880
You can taste the animal kingdom magic straight from the top.

233
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,600
These recipes are coming from like the like the prime location.

234
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,440
That's great. The most high pressure location.

235
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,080
I mean, that's the spotlights on you at that one.

236
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,140
So, yeah, I was sad now.

237
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:04,580
Great. And we were like, I think the only people in there on a Tuesday afternoon.

238
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:08,500
It's one of the last things I did before the lockdown.

239
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:13,260
And it got me transitioned to there being no people around anywhere.

240
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,740
That's that's that's a while to think about.

241
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,300
I don't even remember the last restaurant.

242
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,820
That's such a memorable restaurant to go out on if restaurants never come back.

243
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,520
Yeah. My final restaurant had like a

244
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,520
sort of glitchy speaker elephant

245
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,280
that no one was paying attention to.

246
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,560
You can't confuse it with any other one.

247
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,800
That's all the way on.

248
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,240
Yeah, it was very just that fluorescence.

249
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,720
Who cares? We don't need a mood here.

250
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,400
The only thing that would beat it is like, oh, yeah, the last thing

251
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,400
last place they ate before quarantine was Chuck E.

252
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,540
Cheese. Yeah.

253
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,780
Or like soup plantation, because like that closed because of this.

254
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,740
Like imagine you're like there the day before they close. Right.

255
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,540
Genuinely, the last one I read the last resort I went to is closed.

256
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:05,140
Now the place Conrad's in Glendale, this diner I really like,

257
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,740
it's where I was there when like I looked at the TV and what?

258
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,780
No more NBA. Oh, fuck.

259
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,620
And then now that place does not exist anymore.

260
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,580
Man, like I guess I could have seen it coming.

261
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,480
All right. Pecan Reds, Glendale locals.

262
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,640
Matt, the last place I'll ask is, do you have any fond memories of McThriller?

263
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,140
The McDonald's in Pointe du Parc?

264
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,560
You know, is that the one that's like right there?

265
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,140
I've been to that McDonald's and I don't remember.

266
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,440
I mean, I feel like every McDonald's I went to as a kid was just like,

267
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:40,200
oh, my God, is this going to be the best day of my life?

268
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,080
Are you kidding me? I'm at McDonald's today and I get to play in here.

269
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,860
But I don't remember like that.

270
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,900
I feel like that one maybe had like a kiosk that had like N64 controllers

271
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,200
like way past when like N64 was like out.

272
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,340
I feel like they had it through GameCube.

273
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,440
They had him for like a really long time.

274
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:08,240
But I don't remember like being particularly like, now this is McDonald's.

275
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,500
And I say that and I don't mean to drop this flex, and I'm very,

276
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,020
very sorry for what I'm about to do.

277
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:17,020
I am from Downey, California, which is home of the oldest operating McDonald's.

278
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:20,900
So I come with a very exciting McDonald's.

279
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,500
Well, I've been there. I've been to that one.

280
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,580
There's like a little museum, essentially.

281
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:29,340
Yes. And it's, you know, boring, but it's like kind of cool.

282
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,840
Like there's it is sort of just like, hey, look, an old menu.

283
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:36,840
Yeah. Like, it's not like that cool,

284
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:41,320
but it's like to see old pictures and like to read a plaque about, you know,

285
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,520
uh, how Ray Croc is a hero.

286
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:49,260
Yeah. Wow. They've got Ray Croc's loafers.

287
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,600
These are the loafers he was wearing when he when he put the nail in the coffin

288
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,040
of the McDonald's brothers.

289
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,080
This is that powdered ice cream he switched to for the first time.

290
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,040
This is the handkerchief he let that lady

291
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,680
borrow who he stole and became his wife.

292
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:17,420
What are the chances that Ray Croc ever set foot in Walter Nott's Freedom Center?

293
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,120
Wow.

294
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,300
Seems like they could have been friends.

295
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,600
Yeah. Friends. Hi, I would think.

296
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,040
I would hope I would hope that he got to.

297
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,540
That's what I'll say. I hope that he did.

298
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,940
You know, I mean, we all look, I'll Google it.

299
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,340
I don't think we're going to have a result, but I'll try.

300
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,220
Feels like they they would have gotten along.

301
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,880
Well, actually, while you Google that, I just want to share the fact that,

302
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,580
I mean, I always bring up McThriller because I love it.

303
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,820
There used to be a ride in there and isn't anymore.

304
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,900
But I forget another big McThriller detail,

305
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,660
which is that it's the only place in my life where I've ever won a claw machine.

306
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,160
Wow. Like, it's such a hard thing to do. And I did it there.

307
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,780
And it was very, it was very like, you know, 50s dates where, uh, I'm,

308
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,700
I'm there with Aaron, my now wife, and, uh,

309
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,760
she married me because of this, because of my.

310
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,300
It was a dare. It was a bet.

311
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:19,700
You got to marry me. Yeah. Yeah. Look, and there was a, yeah, the bear was,

312
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,880
there was a little bear that was attached to a,

313
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,040
luckily a $4,000 wedding ring.

314
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:31,420
I only put in a quarter, but, um, no, I like, uh, I, I,

315
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,680
I went for it and I went for a, uh,

316
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,400
this awesome looking teddy bear that was wearing a little shirt that says Pepsi

317
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:42,880
bear. And, uh, and Pepsi bear has been in our home ever since we love Pepsi bear.

318
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,640
So I'm really fond memories for me there.

319
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,360
The only thing I ever won in my whole life.

320
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,360
And the McThriller had a simulator.

321
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,160
Yeah, I think so. There's very little information about what it was.

322
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,160
I don't think I ever got on it, but I remember being like, well,

323
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,760
we have to do this, right? And my mom was like, well, no, we're going to,

324
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,120
we're going to not, what do you do? No.

325
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,760
Yeah. We need to find in the, maybe it's in the archives.

326
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,680
It's gotta be in the archives somewhere. What it was,

327
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,280
what the simulator actually was.

328
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,840
Yeah. Yeah. Uh, cause do it, if it was McDonald's themed and that's what you

329
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,560
really want is that it was like a tree that you're, you know,

330
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,840
trying to run over the hamburger and stop them for good. Yeah. Yeah.

331
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,280
You're like riding grimace or something. Yeah.

332
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,840
You're on his back. Yeah. Yeah.

333
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:34,040
Swinging wildly. Get on my back quick.

334
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,840
Punch that bastard.

335
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,360
It was probably just though, like a simulator explaining to you how great

336
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,560
Ray Kroc was. Oh yeah. Yeah. It was just, you would like,

337
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,720
and then you're like running over people on your way to the top. Maybe.

338
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:55,480
Yeah. It's like a dark ride slash like hall of presidents, like simulator.

339
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,880
So it's like a screen that's showing you these things.

340
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,360
It's not built all the way in and it's, but it's like an hour and a half.

341
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:01,920
You're just like,

342
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,000
feature length.

343
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,440
A part of a ride where you have to watch him meet, uh,

344
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,720
Carrie J Sonnenfeld. Is that the right?

345
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,240
I'm trying to quickly look up who BJ Novak played in that movie.

346
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,200
I only see the first part of his name. So that might be, I'll go with Raleigh

347
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,480
Smith. Then he met Raleigh Smith.

348
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,480
The thing shakes wildly.

349
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,280
When you shake Raleigh Smith's hand for the first time,

350
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,680
the simulator goes up and down to simulate shake it. Yeah, that's good.

351
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,480
That's what the thriller was. Yeah, no.

352
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,000
You can see, you can feel the,

353
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,160
you can feel Ray jump for joy when he divorces his wife.

354
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,000
Ethel,

355
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,160
younger woman.

356
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,160
The founder popped up on one of the streaming services in the last few weeks.

357
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,960
And I went, Oh, the founder. And I'm like, wait a minute. I sold the founder.

358
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,840
It feels like it's stuff started with like the social network and then like you

359
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,880
hit money ball and then you get to the fit, like all of these,

360
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,520
like bio picks about guys. Like,

361
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,560
yeah, they just kind of drop off and like that falls in like a,

362
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,480
like a sort of sub category for me that I, I,

363
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,800
I'll like any movie that's like this,

364
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,680
where it's just like watching like people like a boring movie where people just

365
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,880
do their job. Like that's like, I love that. Like,

366
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,640
I don't think the, like the post is obviously a very good movie,

367
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,800
but it's also like, they're just doing their job.

368
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,360
And I watched every like second of that movie, just being like,

369
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,560
this is the best movie I've ever seen. I love this.

370
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,480
So that makes sense.

371
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:57,200
So you would watch a movie about a, what is his name?

372
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,680
Wells Wellington, Bud Hurlbitt Wendell. Excuse me.

373
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,280
You will watch a movie about Wendell, Bud Hurlbitt making miniature,

374
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,560
antique trains. Yeah,

375
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,000
that would be a top 10 movie for me. I think

376
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:16,240
no conflict. Just yeah.

377
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,120
He ran out of polish. Yeah. Yeah. I'd go for the Hurlbitt.

378
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,320
I don't know. I'd have to look up what he looks like. I don't know.

379
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,440
I don't have off the top of my head a good Hurlbitt biopic.

380
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,760
Sure. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Why am I thinking it has to be an old man?

381
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,600
Yeah. It's fine. The hotter, the better. Yeah.

382
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,400
Cause then you're just like, I have to pay attention to this thing, this thing.

383
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,160
I got hunk's doing this. I'm in. Yeah.

384
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,800
Unki is a log builder.

385
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,160
Yeah, boy. Bud Hurlbitt.

386
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,240
I'm so excited we get to say that name a lot today.

387
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,600
But but Hurlbitt, I guess.

388
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:01,000
We talked to you about your or Jason Jason was asking about your,

389
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,240
your not experience. And and this is this is a not classic. Were you like,

390
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,360
were you especially fond of this one? Was this a good early? Do you like,

391
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,600
could you, did you like this one before you were willing to brave bigger,

392
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,480
tougher rides? I feel like, yeah, this was like, you know,

393
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:22,080
from like my early childhood, like this was like as far as I would go,

394
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,320
like outside of like camp Snoopy, I'd be like, well,

395
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,080
I have to get on the log ride, you know? So then I, then, you know,

396
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:33,160
I feel like when did Jaguar open? Like that was probably like 97 or something.

397
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,760
I think sounds right. And so I remember being like, okay, well,

398
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,880
that's like a roller coaster, but it doesn't have any loops.

399
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:44,400
That seems like, okay. And then you like get on that. And there was,

400
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,360
you know, there's some rides I'd never been on to this day because I was like,

401
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,920
well, I'm never going to get on boomerang and now it turns out I can't.

402
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,240
I think, I think it's done.

403
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:58,800
But I loved the log ride, even though it has no discernible,

404
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,480
it has nothing for a little boy to enjoy. There's nothing,

405
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,120
there is nothing fun about the log ride, except that you are,

406
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,720
you get splashed and there is like a fun drop,

407
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,360
but like maybe there is something to trace this back to like just watching like

408
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,920
these men do their job, like has impacted how I enjoy media,

409
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:23,480
because that ride is just people sawing and then like sitting down after

410
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:28,000
sawing and like, that's it. That's the whole ride.

411
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,360
Yeah.

412
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,800
That's a Knott's like tradition is just to see people kind of doing their normal

413
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,960
day. Yeah. Yeah. It's just like,

414
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,760
at least I, you know, not to talk about Disneyland,

415
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,200
which is only like a few miles away. But it,

416
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,840
at least those rides are based on like IP that you recognize.

417
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,840
So like, even if it's like not a whole lot going on, you're like, oh great,

418
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:55,800
look, there's a thing that I remember, or, you know, at least in camp Snoopy,

419
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,080
there's like Snoopy iconography. And in, in this part of the park,

420
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,280
it is only old, like, like, I guess,

421
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,320
loggers and miners and stuff. Yeah.

422
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,440
Tough job, hard physical labor. Yeah.

423
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:14,480
The the IP of the Calico goes town is the fortitude of the 49ers.

424
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,480
The steadfastness of the American West. Yeah.

425
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,720
The most intellectual property there is. Yeah.

426
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:32,280
They used to, I mean, not was an easy, like school,

427
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,040
what is that called? Field trip, field trip type thing. Or like,

428
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,880
if it was a summer day camp situation,

429
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,800
that'd be like the last place we would go at like the final week.

430
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:45,720
You know,

431
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,720
excursion was not very far on like the Friday of that last week of camp and you

432
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,720
would go and you know, just drink as much boys and berry punch as you could,

433
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,000
as much as you could have. Oh yeah. That sugar will go right to your head.

434
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,560
Yeah. Because nots, nots has the bare minimum of educational stuff.

435
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,560
And I, I am a little sad.

436
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:11,480
I never saw like a nineties knots where they were just jamming in a roller

437
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:16,480
coaster and like any storefront and like they would just jam and roller coasters

438
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,080
wherever. Because like nowadays,

439
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:23,280
nots looks all like freshly painted and like timber mountain log ride,

440
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:29,280
which celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2019 was kind of the,

441
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,480
the big impotent, like they were like, well,

442
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,760
let's redo this a little and that kind of set them off on a streak of like

443
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,440
gussying up their like older rides.

444
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:45,920
And being about becoming a charming park again, as opposed to just,

445
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:51,560
here's a steel pink coaster next to a steel bright purple coaster next to a,

446
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,680
just a big unthemed drop.

447
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,880
If it got like the skyline got sort of ugly for a little while.

448
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,560
And now it's like the homey nice part again.

449
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,840
It had to sort of reckon with like, like, I don't know. I mean,

450
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,080
it's, it's very much in Disneyland shadow, you know,

451
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,720
like cause it is sort of like the lesser park,

452
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,160
but it's a little cheaper for entry and like it has some,

453
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,200
it has things that Disneyland doesn't have,

454
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,320
which is like legitimate thrill rides.

455
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,760
But it's a mess. Like I think the park is a mess.

456
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,640
And it's, I mean, in the, I haven't been in a couple of years,

457
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,920
I think, but like the last few times I was there, I was like,

458
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,440
it's remarkably dirtier.

459
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,360
You would never see as much filth on the ground at Disneyland at any given time

460
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,200
that you would cause like they, they won't allow it there.

461
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,640
Like there are people are those people at Disneyland are just constantly sweeping.

462
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:48,280
Like, but at Knott's Berry Farm, you could walk by barf,

463
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,600
like for an hour, like the same puddle of barf.

464
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,240
You could walk by it like three times and like it's not,

465
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,840
it's not cleaned up at not. Yeah.

466
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,880
Yeah. Yeah. Knott's, I feel like Knott's, I can still get lost in.

467
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,000
So I feel like they probably don't have as many janitors.

468
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,920
And then also maybe the janitors are getting a little lost walking around as

469
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,760
well.

470
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,360
They just don't have great bearings on the park.

471
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,200
Cause you're like, Oh, there's like just dead ends. There's a lot of dead ends.

472
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,480
It's not a good point. Yeah.

473
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,240
Matt, would you know your way around if you were just plopped into not,

474
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,880
could you take people around or would you need to like, yeah, wait,

475
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,800
where's that? Is that in the twenties?

476
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,880
There was a time. Yeah. Yeah.

477
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,160
You have to know the numbers of like where we are. Like the, I,

478
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:35,480
there was a time probably in like maybe the mid 2000s, like, uh,

479
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,360
like to like early like 2010s where I would have been able to do that.

480
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:44,200
But now that information is just like, it's lost. Like, cause there's, I,

481
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,520
I used to go there.

482
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,880
It would be like a sort of like on off situation where I'd have like a Disney

483
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,760
pass and then the next year we would do not.

484
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,080
And then there were some times where we had both and then we would just start

485
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,840
neglecting not very far because I, you know, come on.

486
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:04,640
Yeah. It's a weird way to go constantly for a whole year.

487
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,280
No. And like, cause we would go like there was like, just for an example,

488
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:12,280
we'd go to not probably like on some weekends, but there were a couple of times,

489
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,040
like there was times when we had Disneyland passes a ride,

490
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,880
be at Disneyland a couple of times a week, cause it was not that far away.

491
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:22,440
And it would just be like something to do like after five,

492
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,000
when I was off school or something.

493
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,920
Yeah. I seriously, uh, there,

494
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,840
there has been a little bit of a fight for the,

495
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,080
I think the soul of knots in the last so many years was kind of we were talking

496
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:39,480
about. And I do think the people in charge know they're going in the right

497
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,880
direction. They just plus up their raft ride with a little more animatronic fun.

498
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,880
Um, and I think it's also just like,

499
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,840
people have such affection for like classic knots. One of the,

500
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,920
I think I'm sure we've talked about it after the fact,

501
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,160
but we had an interview with a Disney Imagineer, Tony Baxter.

502
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:00,800
And my favorite part of that interview two years ago is that he said that one of

503
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,240
the things he does in his spare time is sits around with his friends and tries

504
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,160
to think of how to fix knots, Barry.

505
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,800
Amazing.

506
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,360
Which was like, I popped so hard.

507
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,560
Yeah. I can't believe that's the coolest thing I've ever heard.

508
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:20,200
Cause like if anybody can do it, probably like that's incredible.

509
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,960
Um, Scott, that's a wrestling term meaning, uh, exploded with like cheer.

510
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,040
It does not mean got a boner.

511
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,480
See, that's what I thought, but I was like, fine. I was okay with it.

512
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,720
I mean, did I get maybe like kind of a boner?

513
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,560
Yeah.

514
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,360
The word hard was in there too. So I popped hard.

515
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,000
What's so weird about it?

516
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,760
It's wrestling.

517
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,040
I popped a hard one. Yes. Yeah, Mike,

518
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,840
but it's slang in some other industries too.

519
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,840
That's fair. I mean, it's honestly,

520
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,000
it works in whatever context you want it to work. Sure. Okay. Yeah.

521
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,800
Flexible verb. Yeah. Yeah.

522
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:09,720
Um, yeah, that was, that was very cool. Um, but I also, I guess, um,

523
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:15,560
growing up, if you were sort of at the middle school, the teenager, uh,

524
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,040
in that age range, did you find this ride?

525
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,560
Was it exciting because there was a drop or was everything leading up to the

526
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,160
drop as sort of dull and workman like,

527
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,040
I think, yeah, cause like there's honestly, I don't know,

528
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,760
I feel like I would get on that ride and it would just be like, because it's,

529
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,600
you know, it's not a quick ride, but it's not like the longest ride either.

530
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:40,480
Like the Calico mine ride, you're sitting in there for a while, but like the,

531
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,080
uh, the log ride is like probably like four minutes long or something.

532
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,040
So it was just nice to when you're sitting down, you're getting a nice breeze.

533
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:51,360
You're maybe getting a little splash. It was more like a utilitarian than it was

534
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,880
fun. Like you're sort of like, well,

535
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:57,680
I'm going to just get a little bit of a rest and a bit of a splash. Uh,

536
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,000
and then you get a little thrill from the drop and like the drop is the whole

537
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,480
thing. I'm not looking around being like these animatronics are so good.

538
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,800
Cause like when I was going, it hadn't been refurbished yet.

539
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:12,400
So they were like old and shitty. Uh, like it, like I knew not,

540
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,400
like before, I guess they started caring about it again.

541
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,920
They were starting to add a bunch of stuff and they were just like, you know,

542
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,840
going like Sim city all over it and just putting stuff wherever it sort of fit.

543
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,680
Uh, not really thinking about like the theming of it or whatever. Uh,

544
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,360
and it was, you know, I still liked it. I like,

545
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,080
it's also like you're waiting in line and I guess then that's like when you're

546
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,720
like talking, it would like your, you know, my brothers are like, are, you know,

547
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:43,480
our group of friends or whatever. And it's just a nice, it's a nice cue. You know,

548
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,800
it's a, you're sort of just like in the rocks and I'm getting like,

549
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,520
I'm looking at a picture of it right now and I can like smell the water,

550
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:55,520
like, you know, that water smell. Oh yeah. So yeah, it's not like,

551
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,080
it's like, I don't know. I think it's one of the,

552
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,120
there's something about it that is classic that like when you're on it,

553
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:06,440
you're just sort of like, wow, this ride is so old. Uh, but like,

554
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,480
I think I would probably place it, um, in,

555
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:14,240
in like the upper tier of rides at knots, like even though it's not,

556
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,600
there's nothing fancy about it. I still just think it's like, it's great.

557
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,200
It's not even the best log ride I've ever been on. Like, but it's like, it's good.

558
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:26,440
Sure. But it's, but it's a, it's a themed knots experience, which they aren't,

559
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,840
all of them are not.

560
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,760
It's the least offensive log ride I've been on.

561
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,480
Yes. That is the funny thing.

562
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:38,480
It beats last mountain by about 20 years and is somehow less problematic in this

563
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:44,000
day and age because like, do we, the most, the most, I guess, like,

564
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,640
well, there's a couple of like hitchhikers with bindles. Uh,

565
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,200
I guess that's unfortunate, but they seeming good spirits.

566
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,280
And it's not like you slow down and hear anyone's philosophy on the ride,

567
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,360
any of the robots.

568
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,200
We don't know anything about them. That's true.

569
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,520
We know nothing about them.

570
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,560
Who they've killed or what other dark deeds they've done.

571
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:11,920
They're all like Daniel plane views with dark stories to tell.

572
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,440
You know, honestly, they all,

573
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,800
if you look at each robot on this and, and, and on the, uh, uh,

574
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,280
mine cart ride at knots,

575
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:24,680
every man look into his eyes and you know he's killed and that he has seen some

576
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,920
shit and his movie would make an insane, excuse me,

577
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,560
his life would make an insane movie.

578
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:36,640
It's just a matter of did he kill for, for good? Was it, uh, you know,

579
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:40,560
to save someone or help the world in some other way,

580
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,000
but he for sure has killed.

581
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,720
I mean, I would say most of them have not killed for good.

582
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,560
Definitely have it. Right.

583
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,200
We should say for anybody who doesn't know this ride or what's,

584
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,920
what's in it exactly. So it opened in 1969. So, you know, this,

585
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,720
as Jason said way before splash mountain way before, you know,

586
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:06,520
it's a little past parts of the Caribbean rides with a bunch of animatronics are

587
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:11,080
not very common and they were pretty rudimentary at the time. But, um,

588
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,680
it was not the first log flume.

589
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:17,400
There had been a couple of those all kind of built by the same company arrow,

590
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,640
but this was maybe the first heavily themed one.

591
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,040
And if you haven't been on it, just,

592
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:28,720
just to help the viewer or the listener picture it, it's you,

593
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:33,240
you, you are just in a literal log, the logging, uh,

594
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,920
factory essentially you're like, you go through a mill.

595
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:42,240
And then where you say you are seeing real machinery that would have been used

596
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:47,080
to prepare logs. And then that sends you, uh, through a,

597
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:50,560
and I didn't realize log of flume was a real thing.

598
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:55,640
It was a way to transport logs upstream. Uh, uh, so, you know,

599
00:32:55,640 --> 00:33:00,320
they build these big shoots and you pass through towns and see, you know, uh,

600
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,840
forest creatures and stuff. So that, so it,

601
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,400
I don't think I ever understood what the story was exactly.

602
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:10,000
They're in the factory and then your log is being sent up a river where you see

603
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,240
little settlements and animals and that kind of thing. So that, that's what,

604
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,120
what's happening narratively in this, right?

605
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,880
Yeah, I didn't realize that either, but then there's like,

606
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:22,840
I've seen a couple, I'm sure old cartoons where it's logs going down a

607
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,840
river. So it's like, Oh, yes, that I should have known that before.

608
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,120
I should have put that together.

609
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,440
Yeah. Well you, cause you could just send a log down the river,

610
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,520
but what if you want to go up the river? Well, you got to build a flume.

611
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,880
And they would in the 1800s build these things that people would try to ride

612
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,320
them like a ride.

613
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:46,360
But obviously that was far more dangerous than the theme park log flume

614
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,320
experience.

615
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:51,760
Is the rider supposed to take the POV of a,

616
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,240
of a logger or the log?

617
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,440
I think you are a log.

618
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,880
I think because nobody's ever,

619
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,000
being a log rider is a weird other experience.

620
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,880
Like only the craziest daredevils in 1870 are doing that.

621
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,840
And you hear sounds. I don't think I ever put any of this together too,

622
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,000
that you hear grinding,

623
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:18,160
which is supposed to indicate that the log is being sheer.

624
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,760
I don't know what the word is. Like,

625
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,520
you're going through log processing essentially.

626
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:27,240
Yeah. So I would say maybe is you, maybe you are a log.

627
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:31,520
They'd be like, you're crazy for doing this.

628
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,680
I can't believe you're the most wild person in the whole wilderness.

629
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:39,560
Yes. Yeah. Be careful. Duck. You might get commands.

630
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,320
And so on.

631
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,000
The only thing is on the, on the Halloween overlay,

632
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,600
a bear does address you at the end of the ride.

633
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,520
So was he talking to you or the log? Cause he goes trick or treat at the end.

634
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,720
And what do you be saying? Trick or treat to a log that's been processed?

635
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,280
Maybe, maybe if you're an exceptional log,

636
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,640
because you get to see the logs being cut down at the start,

637
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:10,080
and then you get to go to a hootenanny,

638
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,560
you regardless of the seasonal overlay or not,

639
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,680
there is a hootenanny in the middle of the ride.

640
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,440
And then you go at the processing hill and dumped down.

641
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,600
So maybe you are like the one millionth log and they're

642
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,520
celebrating you being sent down the flume.

643
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:32,360
Yeah. Your, your role on the ride is millionth log.

644
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,640
The specialist log.

645
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,880
But that's every log.

646
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,240
But if every log has that experience, then every log is an exceptional log.

647
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,480
Can every log be an exceptional log?

648
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,680
The answer of course is no, but in the narrative of the ride,

649
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,760
you're not supposed to see the other logs. It's the same way where like,

650
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,800
you know, rise of the resistance is really, you're only supposed to be going.

651
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,640
It's only happening to you.

652
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,520
It's only you're really yourself in the little party you're with,

653
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,160
and you're not really supposed to know that there's a whole line behind.

654
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:06,880
And the subtext of all of Walter Knott's rides is that like,

655
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,720
well, yes, you are exceptional,

656
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,160
but you had to pull yourself up by your bootstraps. You know,

657
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,400
you had to work for it 80 hours a week. You know.

658
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,680
He admired the log, the mighty log that helped to build

659
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,080
America. You know,

660
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:28,240
so this is really a tribute to the log, you know, it housed people.

661
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,080
It kept them warm.

662
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,480
Yeah. You know, we don't give enough credit to the log at this day and age.

663
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,000
We kind of forget, we've forgotten,

664
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:40,080
and I hope that younger people can, you know, pick up where we left off.

665
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,760
Well, I think kids today, now that they've,

666
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,840
they've done a little sprucing up of this,

667
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,280
we'll really more appreciate the mighty log.

668
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,000
And what we all live in places that involve wood,

669
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,280
but none of them look like logs. So we forget the importance of the log.

670
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,400
I assume I'm looking at all of your zoom screens and none of you live in a log

671
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,000
cabin. No, no. And that's, that's my shame.

672
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,080
Yeah. That's my cross the bear. I have, I have to deal with that.

673
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,200
The only real patriotic way to live is a log cabin the way Lincoln did.

674
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,200
There's a, um,

675
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,840
there's like a concession stand that I love that's near the log ride.

676
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,920
And it's not like a good, it's not like it's a special concession stand,

677
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,680
but it's like you get, it's like right when you get off in the exit,

678
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,320
there's like straight across and you're like, okay,

679
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,840
now it's time for some funnel cake, baby. It's like right there.

680
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,080
It's right by the bathrooms. Yes, exactly. So there's a really good, like, okay,

681
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,160
we're, we're off the log ride, go to the bathroom.

682
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,800
I'm going to get in line, get a treat.

683
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,640
Now everyone's got treats when they're done with the bathroom.

684
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,240
It's like a win-win for everybody.

685
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:52,320
That is a lot of your theme park hierarchy of needs right there in one

686
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,480
central side, a log flume and a funnel cake and, uh,

687
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:00,200
facilities, you know, get an icy there too. Yes.

688
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:04,600
You can get like a, uh, a Knott's Berry Farm,

689
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,240
exclusive boys and Berry punch. I see.

690
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,680
Well, really? Yeah. At least when I was going, you could do that.

691
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,560
And you can get that punch, but the icy version was like the treat.

692
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,400
Wow. I've actually never heard of that. I'm not sure if they have that anymore,

693
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,000
but that's it was, look, I was an icy kid that would have thrilled me. Yeah.

694
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,920
You would've lost your mind. But the, cause I loved getting the punch.

695
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,960
I just love that punt and I would get it today. Like if I could,

696
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,640
I like want it so bad, like just talking about it, I want it.

697
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,640
Do you like the boys and Berry beer? Have you tried that?

698
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,240
I have not tried that. Does it as sweet? Yes.

699
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:44,600
It's getting there. Yeah. It's pretty sweet. It's pretty crazy.

700
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,680
I like it. I like all of it. I'd like, you know, the,

701
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,280
the real contribution that not has given us is the boys and Berry.

702
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:57,640
Didn't know about it before. The humble boys and Berry. Yes. Yeah.

703
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:03,240
There should be a ride where you are the boys and Berry going through processing

704
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:08,600
beer to make the icy, to make the churro boys, very churro.

705
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,040
There's a, and there's that, um,

706
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,640
there's like this weird thing that's like right next to it.

707
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:17,280
That's like always closed. It's like a theater. It looks like a theater sort of,

708
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,760
I have a story about that place.

709
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,280
Yeah, go ahead.

710
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,240
My, in my high school, I think this is the last time I went to Nott's,

711
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,440
but no, I went for a not scary farm like two years after that. But, uh,

712
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,240
one of the last times I went was, um,

713
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:37,040
my high school had their winter formal dance there in that, like, sort of like,

714
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,840
in that room. Um, and so then you can go on the road.

715
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,440
Um, and so then you can go on the rides. Not all the rides are open,

716
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:46,840
but like the log ride was open and, um, that like spinny ride that's nearby.

717
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:50,320
That's like, just like any sort of like bullshit carnival ride. Um,

718
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:55,040
and a couple of the other rides, but not everything. Um, and the,

719
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,920
the reason it's memorable is because I was, um,

720
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:04,160
I was a nominee for winter formal King. Um,

721
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,760
and I did get it and I won.

722
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,800
And before anyone thinks this is great,

723
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:18,760
I must point out that the student body did not vote

724
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,760
me in no one,

725
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,800
the student body did not vote for winter formal King and Queen teachers did.

726
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,080
So the teachers at my high school

727
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,400
were like, you know, who's, who's a great kid, man, let's nominate him.

728
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,360
And it was me and other couple of really nice boys,

729
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,200
but I was the nicest boy of them all. And I won.

730
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,240
Teachers said I was a good boy.

731
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,040
Welcome brother.

732
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,840
Safe sharing that with the other, with the other good boys.

733
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,680
You started out saying you were bad and it's very clear you were the opposite.

734
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:02,520
Well, I was good, but like, if you asked my mom, three boys, like at once,

735
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,840
she was like, they were, uh, that was the nightmarish.

736
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,600
It sounds like you were, it sounds like you were a handful. Yeah.

737
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,400
I go as far to say even like a scamp,

738
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,040
but that's lovable. That's a, oh yeah. Yes. Yeah.

739
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,520
Those nice words always put before the word scamp. Yeah.

740
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,240
One of those kids that the teachers would be like, Matt, stop talking.

741
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,880
And then I'd say something funny and everyone laugh and the teacher would laugh

742
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,360
and they're like, I can't stay mad. And somebody, I remember this happened to me.

743
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,520
And then I heard like,

744
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:32,360
it was funny cause Paul of Tompkins has a bit about calling a crown, a King hat.

745
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,720
And somebody asked me if they could put on my King hat,

746
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:40,160
like while I was on stage getting it. And I was like, that's not what it's called.

747
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,760
And then I heard that bit and I was like, see, it's a thing that people say.

748
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,360
Wow. They wanted it right then. It was your first moment to wear it.

749
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,440
Did you wear it on the rides? No, I remember it. Well,

750
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,440
I have a gigantic head and it did not fit all the way.

751
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,880
Like it was just something that I had to rest on my head. And you know,

752
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:05,400
the further you pushed down on it, it looked, it looked very silly.

753
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:10,960
But it was, yeah, it was too small for my gigantic head.

754
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,600
Very relatable for me. Very relatable.

755
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:19,120
Were you excited when you got that on or were you like a little embarrassed

756
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,720
cause you felt like the kids are going to goof on you or was it like, hell yeah,

757
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,440
I'm awesome.

758
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:28,440
No, it's back then it was probably one of the things I was the most embarrassed

759
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,040
of like ever in like my life.

760
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:34,520
And there's now I sort of like have owned it and that gets a funny story.

761
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:38,240
It's a funnier story now than it was like when it was happening,

762
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,320
but it was not like anything bad was happening. Like,

763
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,080
like when that honor was bestowed upon me, I was just like,

764
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,680
I don't even want to go to this.

765
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:52,760
Now I got to go into this because I'm like, the teachers think I'm nice.

766
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,040
And then I was like, well that, you know,

767
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,960
I got some really great teachers. I better go make them proud.

768
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,800
I went with my parents.

769
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:05,160
And we went to the end of the day, your teacher deference one.

770
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,160
We went to islands before too. So not the worst night in the world.

771
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:08,640
I'll tell you what.

772
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,600
Well, there we go.

773
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:14,240
That was great. And the log flu. I'd love to have this day right now.

774
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,960
I want to be the winter formal king.

775
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:16,800
I have a,

776
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:21,680
I have an islands gift card in my wallet right now that I haven't used like that

777
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:26,040
I got since Christmas and I'm just like just Jones in for some tortilla soup,

778
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:26,880
baby.

779
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:27,680
Heartbreaking.

780
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,320
That's the last restaurant I went to before quarantine.

781
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,600
That's great. That's great.

782
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,400
That's a good one to go out on.

783
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,840
It was Saturday. It was Saturday. And we're like, Hey, this coronavirus,

784
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,040
Lindsey and I are like, this coronavirus thing is really going to be, is it,

785
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,520
huh? Shouldn't we lock everything down right now? And we're like, yeah,

786
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:49,560
I guess so. Huh? Okay. Eat, eat, eat.

787
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,200
Three to four days later, everything shut down.

788
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,360
I was at Disneyland the week before we went on lockdown.

789
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:58,800
Like it was just me too.

790
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,640
Me too. Me too.

791
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,280
Four days before. Yeah.

792
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,840
I was in, I was in line at big thunder and I saw an alert on my phone that said

793
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:09,680
orange County declares like state of emergency or something.

794
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:13,400
And I'm in line at big thunder. I'm like, huh? Okay.

795
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,120
And I remember texting and Jason was like, ah,

796
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,160
they just have to do that to open up some funds.

797
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,560
And I was like, Oh, okay. That makes sense. Got it.

798
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,760
Yeah. I was in Vegas not too long before. And I was like,

799
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,800
God, there's a lot of hand sanitizer and Hey,

800
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,240
I don't remember this much hand sanitizer everywhere.

801
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,120
Did you take bets on when it would be over?

802
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:37,200
I should have taken a prop that I should have taken.

803
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,320
Cover the spread.

804
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:46,520
What if I knew just a real crazy bet? Like what if it went for like,

805
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,000
I don't know, 18 months?

806
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,800
Not that that'll happen. If I did, I'd be a millionaire.

807
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,840
I don't know. I can't pinpoint the exact restaurant because I know there must

808
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,400
have been something in between this,

809
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:02,320
but the ones that stick out in my mind were the vague were like Italy and Roy

810
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:05,920
Choi's best friend. Like in my Vegas trip.

811
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:07,880
It wants to go out.

812
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:12,440
Mm hmm. That's for speaking of quality restaurants.

813
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:17,000
I dropped out for a second because I really wanted to specifically say the name

814
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,960
of whatever the place is that you called out or you can get the funnel cakes

815
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,720
after you go on the log ride. And after some searching,

816
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:27,280
I determined that the name of this restaurant is log ride funnel cake.

817
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:37,040
It's me on the map. Like which one is it? Oh, there, there.

818
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,120
I think that's probably it.

819
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:43,120
What the part of the charm of Knott's Berry Farm is how sort of like slapped

820
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,320
together it is like they could have beaten that.

821
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,800
They could have absolutely come up with something better than that,

822
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,800
but they were just like, well, where is it?

823
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,200
What does it serve? OK, great.

824
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,880
Log ride funnel cake.

825
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:58,040
They name it like they're submitting things for like fire codes.

826
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:02,320
This is where the city, we just need to name it something for the city, say,

827
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,800
you know, to release the funds. That's like a translation.

828
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,760
That's like that what the like the official English for it would be.

829
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:11,080
But it's like it would be translated somewhere else.

830
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,080
Oh, if you went from English to another language and back.

831
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:16,880
Yeah. And it's like original good time pizza place.

832
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,800
Yeah, I wonder.

833
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:25,120
They I mean, they've been doing it seemingly from what we've understood.

834
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,200
They've been doing a lot with a little.

835
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,800
I wonder if that's even on the list of like they have a little bit of a theming

836
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,200
idea and they're just like, yeah, but we don't we don't we don't have that

837
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,360
twenty dollars to paint a new sign.

838
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,080
We're such pretty thin here.

839
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:44,560
We really like to woodworking station where you can get like a custom sign.

840
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,400
They could do it in house.

841
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:51,240
Well, that's one of the things I wanted to do before all this shit was to get.

842
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,560
I was literally looking up like prices on that.

843
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,920
I wanted to go to knots and get a sign made with my, you know,

844
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:04,120
with my family's name on me and my wife and my son's name and a good old car.

845
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,880
You know, really curly carved ampersand.

846
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,960
Yeah. And then I didn't get to do it because everything shut down.

847
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,080
Hmm. I like the signs.

848
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,320
I'm glad you called out the signs.

849
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,760
Why is it good? They're good.

850
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,840
Those are I'm sure the person who knows them there are good.

851
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:23,520
I found I'm on Facebook as a like on a fan page for, I think, the guy

852
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:28,760
who designed one of the country bears, like the carved country bear signs.

853
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,440
And he still make commissions.

854
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:33,080
Wow. Oh, boy.

855
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:34,400
Oh, send us this info.

856
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,640
Give us these. Yeah.

857
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:37,480
Yeah, I'll send it.

858
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,920
I forget exactly what his name is. Boy.

859
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,720
Well, carving, this is what, you know, this is what this ride is about.

860
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,720
You get you go up the first hill and you get carved.

861
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,040
This is a rider you experience being carved.

862
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:53,200
That that should have been the 90s tagline for it

863
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,760
when they're really trying to bring in the teens.

864
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,840
It's a fire. Get car.

865
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:58,640
Yes.

866
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,960
Get decent to be in some commercials.

867
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,000
Oh, yeah. You got to get car.

868
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,440
Yeah. If you want to add to your campaign, get car.

869
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,520
You turn clean and stuff.

870
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,280
Yeah. All the characters.

871
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
So that kind of is yeah, you go up a hill, you get carved.

872
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,360
Then you're in a chute and then you go inside this building for show scenes,

873
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:26,120
which are like passing by little encampments.

874
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:30,160
The first one is pretty I mean, I don't have them so clearly in my head.

875
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,880
I feel like it's you know, here's a couple of people and a weird old kooky guy

876
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:39,160
and a prospector and and then you and then this town after that is

877
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,640
way more populous and where, as Jason said, in fact,

878
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,560
a real hootenanny is occurring. Yes.

879
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:48,600
Well, there's an animal scenes right before that.

880
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:53,520
There's like a campsite and there's a squirrel stealing a long underwear man's hat.

881
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,040
And there's there's a wolf.

882
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:59,960
And that's where they stick the bear at Halloween.

883
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:03,680
And then you hit the hootenanny, including the animatronic of a man

884
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:07,520
running on a spinning log, which is very impressive to see.

885
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,720
Great animatronics of like.

886
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:14,080
I'm going to share the screen real quick, because I do want to give

887
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:18,040
I know we all know what the vibe of these men, these robot men are.

888
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:21,680
But this one really, I think, sums up the best.

889
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,280
And we'll post a photo of it on Twitter.

890
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:27,480
This man right here.

891
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:33,080
This look, this is the vibe of almost every robot man.

892
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,320
Yeah, he is just like he looks like, I guess,

893
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,600
Jed Clampett from the Beverly Hillbillies.

894
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,600
He looks furious.

895
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,760
Why are you here?

896
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,640
And he does look like he's about to shout at you.

897
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:46,920
He does not. But I just like if you've never been on this before

898
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:50,360
and you're not even going to watch a ride through, just know this is the vibe,

899
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:53,600
the general vibe of everyone holding some copper.

900
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,640
He's near a rope.

901
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,920
He's just the saltiest ride.

902
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:02,440
No, no, as we said, no, you don't pass by anyone who's having a happy life.

903
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:06,560
Imagine like thinking you're building this for like families and kids.

904
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:07,920
And no one is smiling.

905
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,200
No one has any.

906
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,680
Like, what do you think you'd do?

907
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:15,440
Like, just now you'd have to go the Disney length, but you would think like,

908
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,720
well, you know, kids are going to want you to be like, hey, everybody,

909
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:20,960
we're making law, like we're carving logs today or whatever.

910
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:21,960
It's no.

911
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,840
Even some of the pirates and pirates of the Caribbean are like having fun.

912
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,160
Like, you know, almost all having fun.

913
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,760
Yeah, it's very joyous.

914
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,560
The ghosts are all mostly having fun on Haunted Mansion.

915
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,800
They're like, this is great. We're dead and loving it.

916
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,600
Like Leslie Neal said,

917
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:43,160
as Dracula, you mean Dracula dead and loving it.

918
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:48,080
I was going to say the Calico rides are the only rides

919
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:51,840
where the animatronics look at you and say, like, I look at people and there's

920
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,880
there's nothing I see in them that I like.

921
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,080
Just all the Daniel Flade view.

922
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:01,560
They're all suspect.

923
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:04,000
They're suspicious of us passing through their towns

924
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,600
because they think we're going to pull a false brother scam on them.

925
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:11,680
All this trick in the book.

926
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:15,600
Yeah, they so like they have like what you're saying,

927
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:19,000
the long underwear man, that is like there's some whimsy in the

928
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:22,000
guy on top of the wheel.

929
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,880
But you would think when you were making it, we'd be like,

930
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,880
well, we want this to be somewhat inviting.

931
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,280
And it is not. Yeah, it's like it's there's

932
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:33,760
I was saying earlier, there's like almost no appeal for kids.

933
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,560
Like in on this thing, like at all.

934
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:39,360
There is nothing that if you were to like, like tell a kid about this ride

935
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:42,800
before they got on it, like to describe it to them, that would excite a kid.

936
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,800
Like, OK, like except maybe drop and like water.

937
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:48,400
Like those are the two. Yeah, it is fast.

938
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,600
I don't know what the first time I wrote it.

939
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,560
It's like if it always felt faster to me.

940
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,920
I mean, I wrote it at a not scary farm.

941
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,800
It was nighttime. It was colder.

942
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:02,280
But just the speed of the water did make it feel very fast.

943
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:03,440
They're churning logs out.

944
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,680
They're just pushing people through that thing.

945
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:09,160
And it is not says it's their most popular ride.

946
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,560
Mm hmm. Wow. Yeah, that makes sense to me.

947
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:16,000
I do wonder because I never obviously went to this thing as a kid.

948
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:20,200
And I immediately when I went on it as an adult, I loved it

949
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:24,320
because it's so bizarre and weird and such a relic of its time.

950
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:28,320
But I do wonder, I probably would not have appreciated it at all as a kid.

951
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:31,360
I don't know, especially having been to Disney.

952
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:34,240
I probably would have been like, well, I like the drop and it goes fast.

953
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,360
But I don't know what else.

954
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:39,640
Well, it also it also got a refresh.

955
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:43,600
And it's hard to tell what was in the refresh and what was there before.

956
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:46,000
And what if if, you know, did they plus up

957
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,320
existing animatronics or some of them entirely new?

958
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:55,320
But, you know, in I think 2013 or so was when they they refreshed

959
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:59,280
the whole thing. And part of that was this this animatronics company, Garner

960
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,960
Holt's putting in new animatronics.

961
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:05,400
And I think, you know, they they did everything in the rapids,

962
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,520
right, the Calico rapids, which we talked about, you know, a year or so back.

963
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:13,840
But I think they I think what you can definitely credit them for is the

964
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,200
the critters.

965
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:20,080
I think any little, you know, like a couple of squirrels pulling on a hat,

966
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,160
one of them stealing something or whatever.

967
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:26,720
And I think this bear that we talked about with the Halloween thing,

968
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,840
I think all of these are Garner Holt.

969
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:34,120
So if none of that was there before, then I mean,

970
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,440
Matt, you're the only one who did it at the time.

971
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:39,120
It seems like it was like entirely joyless, barely moving.

972
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,760
I wish I could remember that.

973
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:43,520
I don't remember a bear.

974
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:48,200
And, you know, I think if I if I'm being honest,

975
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:51,960
the bear does sound like they were they were sort of eating

976
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,160
Disney's lunch a little bit.

977
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,360
And they're like, we're going to have an unproblematic bear.

978
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,240
How about this? You got you.

979
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,720
You don't even know what we're about to do to you.

980
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,880
Is that the next bear that wishes you trick or treat?

981
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:07,440
Well, so this I mean, we should talk about this because I think this

982
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,480
we've definitely talked about it on the show before.

983
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:13,440
But, Matt, you just you just laughed and smiled when we said this happened

984
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,520
the same way we did on the ride when we did it.

985
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,000
We didn't know it was coming.

986
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,880
We were there for this Halloween overlay.

987
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:23,240
I think they call the whole thing Halloween Hootenanny.

988
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,400
Halloween Hootenanny is the name of the log ride.

989
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:31,160
The overlay for the before they did that, it was

990
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:35,000
they did a Halloween thing called Sleepy Hollow Mountain, which

991
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,880
looks like they just it doesn't look as good.

992
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,880
I saw a 2010 video.

993
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,960
It's just not the same.

994
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:47,920
OK, sure. But I we rounded a corner and, you know, it's it's

995
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,480
it's very confusing.

996
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:52,200
Theming is a part where aliens have crash landed.

997
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,680
Yeah, a lot of stuff all at once.

998
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:58,120
But oh, my God, and we were out of this one river bank

999
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:02,120
and then this bear just look, it feels like he's looking straight into your eyes.

1000
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:04,320
It's it's trick or treat.

1001
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:07,720
We just laughed like we were three years old.

1002
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:11,520
And we were getting keys jangled for the just such pure joy.

1003
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,760
That's one of the funnier things I could think of like happening on a log ride.

1004
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,480
Like, that's pretty that's pretty good.

1005
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:22,000
But I I remember the theming of the the Halloween one.

1006
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,760
I remember being sort of unimpressed because it just seemed like they put

1007
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:31,960
like like glove claws and like scary masks on some of the animatronics.

1008
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,000
And then like that was it.

1009
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,320
And I was like, OK, well, that's kind of scary.

1010
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:41,840
I'll say going on that ride during Halloween, but not at not scary farm,

1011
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:44,200
like during the day before it becomes not scary.

1012
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:48,000
Farm is its own thing because it's they just cover the stuff.

1013
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,160
They just have it.

1014
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,200
So you're going through.

1015
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,880
Carves. Yeah.

1016
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,600
Or just like black curtains, like covering the things or like

1017
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:59,240
on the scary mask animatronics, they'll just put like a like

1018
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:03,400
like black bag over the over the mask.

1019
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:07,040
And so you're going through it and you're just like, this is like.

1020
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:11,040
I don't know, like the Guantanamo log ride.

1021
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:16,280
Yeah, so weird that logger has escaped a CIA black site. Yeah.

1022
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,960
They're about to dump that

1023
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,920
animatronic into the ocean.

1024
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,440
There was so there were some years.

1025
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:25,720
Well, they are.

1026
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:29,480
What Walter not would have not well, he would approve the Guantanamo.

1027
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:33,520
You know, necessary measures, you know.

1028
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:37,760
Sorry, Jason, I thought that joke was so good, I kept cutting you off.

1029
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,160
I appreciate it.

1030
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:41,280
No, I yeah, you're right.

1031
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:46,000
There was a few years where they had actor.

1032
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,360
They had scare actors on this ride.

1033
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:52,000
But in terms of like safety,

1034
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:58,320
the scare actors could very clearly only pop out from the emergency exits

1035
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:01,080
because like these logs, they go fast.

1036
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:04,040
They can't just be like hanging by the water.

1037
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:08,160
So they're like standing on the pads, like outside of the doorways.

1038
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:13,320
And it's just like a leather face or, you know, just a general ghouly.

1039
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,200
Yeah, they did this.

1040
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,680
Yeah. On the other ride, too.

1041
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:21,760
Basically, at the emergency exits, they would station a human with a mask.

1042
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:26,080
And then you just go, ah, well, you were going by, which I saw in some videos.

1043
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:29,840
And when we when we did our first scary farm a couple of years ago,

1044
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,240
they had stopped doing that.

1045
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:34,440
It feels like they they they they throw a lot at the wall at knots,

1046
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:35,360
which I appreciate.

1047
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:37,280
They go, maybe that didn't work. Maybe they're trying.

1048
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,400
Maybe somebody's. Yeah, that's what that's what I'm saying.

1049
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:42,040
They're trying. They keep changing things.

1050
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:48,320
To that end, can I say I found a list of all of the Halloween overlays

1051
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:50,800
that they've done of this ride? Oh, yes.

1052
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:55,640
Oh, I mean, most of there's not detailed information about most of them,

1053
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,080
but just the names.

1054
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,680
This is such a blast.

1055
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:02,600
It started with Terror Mountain, then Satan's Sawmill,

1056
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:06,160
Sorcerer's Lair, Nightmare Mountain,

1057
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:09,560
realm of the sorcerer, switched from a lair to a realm.

1058
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:13,800
Santa Claus Mountain spelled like Bear Claus.

1059
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,400
Scary Santa.

1060
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:18,320
Pretty scary. Yeah, I mean, yeah, if he if he goes terrifying,

1061
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:19,640
if he goes rabid,

1062
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:22,840
I was the camp gonna getcha.

1063
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:29,920
You know, it's put together in that camp naming way.

1064
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,920
Red Moon Massacre.

1065
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:36,360
I mean, these are just all kick ass names no matter what it's for.

1066
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:39,000
Pyro maniacs with an X.

1067
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Wow. Oh, Sleepy Hollow Mountain, as Jason said.

1068
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,560
At one point, they did a tie in to the Evil Dead.

1069
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:49,240
They did one of the rare Knott's IP crossovers.

1070
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:50,880
There ever was in this video of it.

1071
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:51,680
I didn't get to watch it,

1072
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:54,520
but I think there may be characters from the Evil Dead world on it.

1073
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,040
But the absolute best one, at least in terms of description,

1074
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:02,880
is I think it's from 1988, Toxic Terror, because this one,

1075
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,080
there is a plot and the plot rules.

1076
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,440
This is official Knott's copy.

1077
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,400
In the not too distant future,

1078
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:14,360
the Timber Mountain Logging Company has been acquired by Knox Co.

1079
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:18,800
Inc., a multinational conglomerate that manufactures chemicals,

1080
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:24,080
plastics and industrial grade phlegm employees mutated by exposure

1081
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:28,320
to the fuming mixture of goo delight in processing our guests.

1082
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:31,320
So Jesus, right along with the bubbling waste,

1083
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:35,440
if the visitors survive being dunked in acid and sprayed with ooze,

1084
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:39,280
can they live through the final plunge into the sludge pond?

1085
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,320
Wow. Amazing.

1086
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:44,640
They kept the mythology.

1087
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:47,880
It's still the Timber Mountain Logging Company, but it got bought out.

1088
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:53,080
And it's a commentary on current, you know, toxic avengers sort of stuff.

1089
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:56,000
It's like the Ninja Turtles with the ooze company.

1090
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,400
And this is like of the era. It's topical.

1091
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,160
Those rules. They.

1092
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:03,600
Yeah. When we when we were talking to the people behind the scenes,

1093
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,720
it nots a couple of years ago, too.

1094
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:08,320
It feels like I mean, we know for sure they have a lot more freedom than Disney,

1095
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,920
but they get a little budget and it seems like they get to make up

1096
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:14,040
fun names and do cool stuff with a little amount of money.

1097
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:17,680
So it's it does seem like, you know, we'd all want to do a little imagineering.

1098
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:20,440
But really, nots might be where it's at.

1099
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:25,880
We could maybe realistically like name a Halloween overlay.

1100
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,560
Yeah, it's yeah.

1101
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:30,000
Obviously, yeah. Who wouldn't want to be an Imagineer?

1102
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:35,400
But. Your hit rate of getting things through is going to be higher at not.

1103
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,200
Absolutely. Oh, yeah.

1104
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,880
Throw whatever you want out and they'll be like, yeah, I guess.

1105
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:45,040
If we could design this, the sign for the funnel cake stand even.

1106
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:48,640
That's probably much more likely to happen than us.

1107
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:52,480
You know, we have a regular name or a horror name.

1108
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:55,040
Can we do a horror overlay over the funnel?

1109
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:57,160
Oh, I'm sure we can.

1110
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,680
Log, right?

1111
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,680
Funnel cake.

1112
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,720
Mummy cakes, mummel cakes.

1113
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,600
They kind of does kind of look like bandages. Yeah.

1114
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:11,800
That's a pile of loose mummy bandages, not a funnel cake.

1115
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:15,720
That's good. I was going to say like it's cooked fingers, maybe.

1116
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:17,960
Oh, finger cakes.

1117
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:19,480
Finger fungal.

1118
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:21,960
Wait, there you go. Fungal cake.

1119
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:24,320
And you do gross colors like green.

1120
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,080
Yeah. Yeah.

1121
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:28,360
Like the red buns, like the red buns.

1122
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:29,880
They put sandwiches on.

1123
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,040
That's terrible.

1124
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,960
You're under your favorite, Scott, the red.

1125
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:38,440
Waited so long for food and then it was a red bun.

1126
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,520
The red buns we ate were not good.

1127
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,840
Oh, boy. But fungal cakes.

1128
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:48,320
This is good. And you could put, you know, maybe you do like toss in

1129
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:52,800
a finger that once you bite it, it's like brownie pieces or something.

1130
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:58,400
You know, there's ways story are you put like a gummy spider in there or something?

1131
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:01,320
Yeah, for sure. We could do we could do this.

1132
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:02,880
This is more achievable.

1133
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,800
Yeah. Yeah. We're proving it on the fly.

1134
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:08,360
And it goes along with kind of the playfulness of like, well, Halloween,

1135
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:12,680
Hootenanny, it's just like a bunch of grays showed up and they put on a party

1136
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:16,680
for them and there's a bear who talks and a gray alien plays a banjo.

1137
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,960
Like fungal cakes is kind of like mischievous,

1138
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:24,760
kind of like a scam designed like a like a Matt Apodaca designed

1139
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:27,920
or approved scam.

1140
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,440
Top scam.

1141
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:33,160
I would. Oh, man, if I could get that, if I could go back and get that

1142
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:37,240
instead of Windr Formal King, I would I would prefer top scam.

1143
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,760
Well, on our show, that's your title.

1144
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:43,240
Yes. Hell, yeah.

1145
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:44,440
The Schultz scam.

1146
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:48,600
There's no there's no hat for it yet, but perhaps in the future.

1147
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:51,160
I'll I'd wear a hat that just said top scam.

1148
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:55,280
I guess that would require that would, you know, I'd probably get some look.

1149
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:00,480
No, it's fine.

1150
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:03,960
It's like it's like Jughead, a grand fun crown.

1151
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:07,520
Yeah. Like scamps.

1152
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:11,560
Scamps. Classic Jughead, like not not Riverdale Jughead,

1153
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:14,920
who has like a body cow who is like blood on his hands.

1154
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:17,920
Original harmless one. Yeah.

1155
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,520
Mike, didn't you?

1156
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:20,880
I feel like you used it somewhat.

1157
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:25,040
I've heard you say off hand the name of the band that plays in.

1158
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:29,040
I just realized I figured it out and now I don't know.

1159
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,680
I got to let me re figure it out.

1160
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:33,320
I haven't had it at one point in time.

1161
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:36,520
In this fight, and was he talk amongst yourself in this ride?

1162
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,480
Yeah, the name of the band with the alien and the bear.

1163
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:42,160
Yes. Yeah.

1164
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:46,120
Story band, because I have the hillbillies.

1165
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:50,120
Yeah. Crazy Kirk and the Hillbillies did the original song for the

1166
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:52,240
the new version. Yeah.

1167
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:56,080
And they were formerly Billy Hill in the hillbillies and played at Disneyland

1168
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:57,520
for over 20 years.

1169
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:00,880
And then when Disneyland let them go nuts, got right in there,

1170
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:04,560
scooped them right up, you know, that is I love it.

1171
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,640
It's the most incredible thing to me.

1172
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:10,080
It's like a full on sprint guy becoming Verizon.

1173
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:14,240
Yeah. It's like wrestlers jumping companies.

1174
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,240
Yes. Yeah. Slightly different name.

1175
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:17,320
They got to go.

1176
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:21,200
And even even right now, like as we speak, I think it's still running knocks.

1177
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:25,600
Not just like partially open and doing an outdoor food festival.

1178
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:30,280
And the band cannot play, but they recorded an original video,

1179
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:35,680
like a concert of them playing that plays on a giant screen by like picnic tables.

1180
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,640
Nice. Yeah, that's cool.

1181
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:41,000
Knots, I think, has a good idea here.

1182
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,880
Genuinely, the fact that they're trying to open a little bit

1183
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,200
and just let people have some of the vibe.

1184
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:50,800
I do wonder if there is a step between Disneyland is open fully

1185
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:51,600
and all the rides are there.

1186
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:55,640
And can we just like walk around and experience a little bit

1187
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:57,760
and nobody does anything unsafe?

1188
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:03,520
Like I do feel like Knots maybe is a pioneer in this covid era in that way.

1189
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:06,520
Yeah. Yeah, it's it'll be tough.

1190
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:09,640
It's like maybe the outdoor rides are open or something.

1191
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,880
Yeah. Or just let people walk around Main Street like you did.

1192
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:14,880
You could everything could be closed.

1193
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:17,320
Just let people like would you?

1194
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:18,720
I don't know. Am I crazy?

1195
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:22,200
Or aren't there people who would go to a Disneyland where there were no rides?

1196
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:24,880
Yeah, I would just like 100 percent. Yeah.

1197
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,240
Yeah, I do it.

1198
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:28,520
Open the Panda Express at Knots Berry Farm.

1199
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,720
Open the limited menu selection.

1200
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,120
Any clues on that band, Mike?

1201
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:41,080
I think it's the Calico coffins.

1202
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:47,400
Or a Calico coffin band, something like that.

1203
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:48,680
It's just hard to make out.

1204
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:50,040
I had it at a certain point.

1205
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:52,040
Oh, because it's we're rushing by it.

1206
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:53,360
It's hard to. Yeah.

1207
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:56,920
And I was a freeze frame to get if it's the same thing I had last time

1208
01:05:56,920 --> 01:06:00,240
where I was like, I think it's this seems seems right.

1209
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:03,960
Oh, I got it. I got it. I got it.

1210
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,640
Here we go. Here we go. Are we ready?

1211
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:08,720
Yeah. The Calico coffin creepers.

1212
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:11,840
Oh, wow. Oh, hey.

1213
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:13,160
That's even better.

1214
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Makes me think of Odenkirk as the Dr.

1215
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,400
Demento esque character, the Calico coffin creepers.

1216
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:28,840
Is he is he Daffy Mal, Yinkle, Yinkle, or is that so what else?

1217
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:30,240
No, that's different.

1218
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:32,160
No, what's the name of the Demento?

1219
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:34,880
I'm not I'm proving I'm not a truly encyclopedic.

1220
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:39,640
Mr. I remember from the Monster Party's Factor Fiction sketch.

1221
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:41,920
Let us know and we'll go.

1222
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,560
Hmm. Oh, that's right.

1223
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:45,800
Anyway, they're the creeper.

1224
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,200
Yeah, that's I'm glad you caught that.

1225
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,920
I felt I did feel like one was missing. Creepers is great.

1226
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:52,480
Yeah, I realized I found part of it.

1227
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:56,800
And then I just looked at my notes and I just wrote in Calico Coffin

1228
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:59,600
and it showed up from a year ago.

1229
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:02,320
The name I had written down in my notes from a year ago. Yeah.

1230
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:08,600
This Halloween overlay, I think, is my favorite holiday overlay of all time.

1231
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:15,040
Yeah, I think I think we're forgetting, don't they put a big skull on the top also?

1232
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:17,120
Oh, yeah. There's like a face when you walk.

1233
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:18,720
Is that what you're talking about when you go in?

1234
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:22,080
Don't know. At least at some point in time on the like, you know,

1235
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,680
wherever you're when you're heading up the first lift hill to be carved,

1236
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:29,720
the hole that you go into, I think there's a big skull up top.

1237
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:32,880
Yes. Yeah, yeah, they make. Yeah, that's very scary.

1238
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:36,320
Yeah, very, very cool.

1239
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:39,040
Yeah, really strong Halloween version.

1240
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:41,560
And there aren't a lot of Halloween overlays out there.

1241
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:44,960
So you got to give them credit and that they've tried so many

1242
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,480
that they do a different one every year. It's very bold.

1243
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:51,280
Yeah. And like they were sort of like, I mean, because they were probably doing

1244
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:56,840
the like extra ticket, like horror, like a month

1245
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:59,120
thing before anybody else, I think.

1246
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:02,960
Like, I think Universal started after probably not a scary farm. Yeah.

1247
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:06,560
I mean, Disneyland has their sort of like cute one.

1248
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,760
That's like, you know, for kids going trick and treating or whatever.

1249
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:11,920
But they don't have like mazes or anything actually scary.

1250
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:16,440
But not scary farm has been a thing like thinking like my entire life, probably.

1251
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:20,840
Yes. And Bud Hurlbitt, the guy who created this ride,

1252
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:23,880
was an early creator of not scary.

1253
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:28,720
He was an early like, yeah, helps head up the whole thing.

1254
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:33,240
Wow. And an original scaricter himself got out there as a scarred

1255
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:36,000
this ride we're talking about. Yeah.

1256
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
He would jump out.

1257
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,360
He was like on the mine ride.

1258
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:41,680
He would jump out and like scare people.

1259
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:44,720
Presumably with permission.

1260
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:49,480
I don't I mean, maybe sometimes he did it just, you know, going wildcat, you know.

1261
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,320
Like that's like when like

1262
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:57,000
a famous chef opens a restaurant and sometimes they're in the kitchen

1263
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,800
still, even though they don't really have to. Yes. Yes. Right.

1264
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,400
Or like that restaurant, John Bon Jovi owns where he like washes dishes.

1265
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:08,720
I mean, it's for it's for I think people with that much money.

1266
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:12,600
But yeah, John is sometimes there, but he doesn't have to be very rich.

1267
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:13,640
Yeah, he doesn't got it.

1268
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:17,240
You know, maybe he just likes watching dishes, but he doesn't got to do that.

1269
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:20,800
Johnny was a dish dish at the restaurant.

1270
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:23,560
Didn't have to be there.

1271
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:25,920
He wanted to be.

1272
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:29,360
It this could be a whole this will be whole on their episode,

1273
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:33,360
but John Bon Jovi, I was just made aware of a certain type of rosé he has.

1274
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:36,400
Well, well, now we're talking.

1275
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:41,960
Well, I believe it's called Hampton Water Rosé.

1276
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:45,560
Ouch. I was in and I went right out

1277
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:48,600
like Grandpa Simpson walking in and out of the door.

1278
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:52,800
Was there for point five seconds.

1279
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:56,200
Scott, you got to have eight glasses of Hampton Water a day.

1280
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:57,880
Doctor recommend

1281
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:01,000
Hampton Water.

1282
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:05,080
There's a video of him playing a covering the killers.

1283
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:09,720
Mr. Brightside that has a little pop up that's an ad for it.

1284
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:11,120
Wow.

1285
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:16,520
Most current song he knows.

1286
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:23,000
So I I'm a big fan of it already.

1287
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
I haven't tried it. Yeah.

1288
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,520
Well, I may never try it, but I'm a big fan.

1289
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:30,880
Also, if you cut the middle out, it's the ham water.

1290
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:34,440
Oh, well, now I'm interested.

1291
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:42,080
Glad Jason has a glass of that every night. Sure.

1292
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:46,600
Ham vintage in my hometown.

1293
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:49,640
Like right, right before I went off to college,

1294
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:53,520
they built a development of like very big McMansions, like

1295
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:59,720
the biggest houses are like some of the biggest houses in the the borough.

1296
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:03,560
And the rumor going around was that like, oh, you know,

1297
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:06,760
John Bon Jovi bought one of those houses, you know.

1298
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:09,520
Is that where the story ends?

1299
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:12,360
That is where the story is, because I never heard.

1300
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:16,080
I heard it a number of times, but I never heard any resolution

1301
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:18,240
besides her John Bon Jovi.

1302
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:19,960
It's similarly in Ithaca.

1303
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:22,360
There was like, you know, Whoopi Goldberg has a house on the lake.

1304
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:27,720
You know, I can I'll tie this into that

1305
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:31,960
when I go hang out in Newport Beach

1306
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:36,160
for summers growing up, my dad and I were well, my dad had.

1307
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:38,960
I've said before, my dad had a little little dinky sailboat

1308
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:40,920
called Drunky with Suey.

1309
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,720
And he had so I love that name so much.

1310
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:47,760
Very proud of my dad for that.

1311
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:52,200
But I'd go out and Drunky with him and he would always give me the celebrity tour

1312
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:56,320
because there are a lot of McMansions like along the harbor.

1313
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:59,880
The biggest one of which by far this palace

1314
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:03,800
in the Newport Beach Harbor area was John Wayne.

1315
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:07,240
And probably the residents of John Wayne and his son,

1316
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:12,800
who were the first two writers of this attraction in 1969.

1317
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,240
What a pull together.

1318
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:18,600
I figured pointing out houses in this mansion was this.

1319
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,760
And yeah, I didn't know how else to get in there.

1320
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,200
It's the opportunity presented itself and we sailed right in.

1321
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:30,120
I found that to be a fun, odd fact that the first writer was John Wayne.

1322
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:34,160
There is a crazy long video about the history of this ride

1323
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:36,360
by the Channel Expedition Theme Park.

1324
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:40,000
And they said that wasn't even like a random occurrence.

1325
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,840
It wasn't like, well, let's get a big star.

1326
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:45,560
Like somehow John Wayne was being given a tour of Knott's Berryvarm

1327
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:49,680
and saw the work on this ride and somebody threw and Bud Hurlbutt,

1328
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:52,000
I think, threw out, well, you should be the first to ride it.

1329
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,160
And he was like, I'm going to take you up on that.

1330
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:55,400
And they actually made good.

1331
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,960
He really wanted to be the first.

1332
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:00,440
And so much so, this is really odd.

1333
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:04,320
The ride was heading for an August opening.

1334
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:09,000
But John Wayne's filming schedule was such that he was going to be gone

1335
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,160
for the month of August, like filming in Mexico.

1336
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:17,080
And so they were like, well, I mean, the PR of getting John Wayne is worth it.

1337
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:20,840
So they rushed the opening of the ride and got it open in July.

1338
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:25,080
So it opened with the cruddiest animatronics you've ever seen

1339
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:29,280
and exposed beams and completely unfinished, unthemed parts

1340
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:32,720
because they wanted John Wayne riding that thing with his kid.

1341
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:33,720
That's wow.

1342
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:35,480
That's wild.

1343
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:38,720
Yeah, the priorities.

1344
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:42,520
But on this channel, if you watch, if you go to Expedition Theme Park,

1345
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:45,800
you get this guy track down footage from the Orange County Archives

1346
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:49,960
where you can watch John Wayne given his opening speech, taking his opening ride.

1347
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:54,760
And you get to the best footage is watching him land in a helicopter

1348
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:58,280
and go immediately from a helicopter into a stage coach

1349
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:01,640
that rolls him right up to the log ride.

1350
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:03,960
It's legitimately very cool.

1351
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:08,120
The two wildest disparate modes of transportation.

1352
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:13,080
The story of the 21st century, the 20th century.

1353
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:16,840
In one field.

1354
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:19,880
I imagine John Wayne thought he was kind of a real cowboy.

1355
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:22,600
So when he was in knots, he was like felt at home.

1356
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,800
I mean, he also felt at home, probably because of Walter Nod

1357
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,360
and his life philosophy.

1358
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:27,200
I'm sorry.

1359
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:28,120
He was.

1360
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:29,880
But

1361
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:33,640
I could I could see him like being uncomfortable in the helicopter.

1362
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:35,560
But then as soon as he's in the stagecoach, he's like,

1363
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:38,280
well, I'm home, I guess.

1364
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:42,360
I'm supposed to be, boy, another more terrible impression.

1365
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:50,640
Boy, I don't want to go to the

1366
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:52,920
Halloween Hootin' Nanny Pilgrim.

1367
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:57,720
Where are those little missions, Pilgrim?

1368
01:14:57,720 --> 01:15:02,960
Where's the Dippin' Dots ice cream of the future, Pilgrim?

1369
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:06,080
Clear my schedule.

1370
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:10,360
I got eight hours and I'm going to spend it in the Freedom Center, Pilgrim.

1371
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:16,920
If I could just swirl some dry facts around

1372
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:19,480
that are all related to 60s conservative

1373
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:22,640
conservativism, this is really odd.

1374
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:24,760
I was like, I wonder what movie he was filming.

1375
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:28,040
And I figured it out that he was filming a movie called Chisholm.

1376
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:29,720
I'm no old Western expert.

1377
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:31,160
I didn't really know what Chisholm was.

1378
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:36,360
But on the Wikipedia of Chisholm, it says how Richard Nixon used Chisholm

1379
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:39,120
to describe his approach to law and order.

1380
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:43,040
I saw this movie, this John Wayne film.

1381
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:46,280
And this is how I believe we need to run the country is

1382
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:48,920
we got to do play by Chisholm's rules.

1383
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:51,920
Jesus. And I was like, oh, sorry.

1384
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:53,720
Oh, good. You know, you go ahead. Yeah.

1385
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:57,880
Well, it just I just I can keep connecting a bunch of odd things that.

1386
01:15:58,440 --> 01:15:59,640
So that's weird.

1387
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:02,840
And of course, Walter Nott, as we've said many times, very conservative guy.

1388
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:07,160
He invited Nixon to take a tour of Knott's Berry Farm in 68.

1389
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:11,440
But in this we've all been thinking about 68 because we're in another 68 right now.

1390
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:15,760
So the year he was elected president, he took a tour of Knott's Berry Farm,

1391
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:18,360
hung out with Walter Nott, I believe, met Bud Hurlbutt,

1392
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:23,400
the creator of this ride and went to the Chicken Dinner Restaurant.

1393
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:25,520
I guess that's where the event was.

1394
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:27,520
Nixon hung out there.

1395
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:29,720
And then one more thing. Let me complete this triangle.

1396
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:31,640
This is so strange.

1397
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:35,400
What like Bud Hurlbutt made a bunch of odd.

1398
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:39,800
He made a lot of trains, private trains, like not Walt Disney's train,

1399
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,040
but the kind that he had, like this backyard trains reveal.

1400
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:46,680
And he made a little miniature train for a restaurant in Orange County.

1401
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:51,000
The restaurant was Nick was Nixon's,

1402
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:56,000
which was a fast food chain run by Don Nixon, Richard Nixon's brother.

1403
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:59,240
Oh, my God. I've never heard that before.

1404
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,640
I've never heard any of this yet.

1405
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:05,920
But Hurlbutt built a little train for Don Nixon for Nixon's restaurant,

1406
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:08,960
where he sold things like literally Nixon burger.

1407
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:12,920
You can go get a Nixon burger for 20 cents in the year

1408
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:15,120
where Richard Nixon became the president.

1409
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:19,920
And there was a Nixon's at one of the streets, Harbor and Cotella,

1410
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:24,840
where now, you know, like around where we did our live show at that hotel

1411
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:28,640
that used to be that intersection was where there was a Nixon's

1412
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:31,160
where there's a pizza press now.

1413
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:32,200
Yeah.

1414
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:38,800
Beats the way was paved by Don Nixon and his delicious Nixon burgers.

1415
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,720
Did did Nixon serve Nixon's

1416
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:47,240
favorite lunch of pineapple and cottage cheese with ketchup?

1417
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:49,640
Oh, no.

1418
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:53,840
His last meal before he left the White House was

1419
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:57,720
cottage cheese and pineapple and a large glass of milk.

1420
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:02,320
And supposedly he liked his cottage cheese and pineapple with ketchup.

1421
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:05,080
What? Yeah.

1422
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:06,480
Any sense?

1423
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:09,360
I you know what? I love Nixon up until you told me that.

1424
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:14,080
Now I don't think he's so cool anymore.

1425
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:15,560
I think he's a weird man.

1426
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:17,760
Yes, I loved him.

1427
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:22,320
Loved everything about he thinks all those videos I've made praising him on YouTube.

1428
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:26,440
Weird Nixon is was the Nixon and Nixon family,

1429
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:29,000
were they just big theme park and themed experience fans?

1430
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,400
Because Nixon's Disneyland.

1431
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:32,320
Walt love Nixon. He's a Nazi.

1432
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:34,400
He's got his own family as a restaurant.

1433
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:37,800
Yeah, I mean, well, he's a kid, too, right?

1434
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:39,200
He's from Whittier.

1435
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:43,400
So maybe he knows these guys like, yeah, like I like to get on.

1436
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:47,760
I think he would have become a regular on podcast, the ride, unfortunately.

1437
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,400
I maybe do.

1438
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:52,720
But I listened to the audiobook of Nixonland a few years ago,

1439
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:55,880
and it seemed like he was a guy who had a lot of scores to settle.

1440
01:18:56,080 --> 01:19:00,680
So he might have just been been into all of that Orange County stuff

1441
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:04,880
because he got to cut the ribbons and all the rubes who stayed in town.

1442
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:07,320
He could be like, look at me, you bastards.

1443
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:10,840
I was nothing.

1444
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:12,880
Now I've got big scissors in my hands.

1445
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:14,080
Just are.

1446
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,960
You've never even had scissors as big

1447
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:21,040
regular scissors for you, if at all.

1448
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:25,600
The the Nixon impression is better than the John Wayne impression.

1449
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:28,680
Yeah, it's all right. Yeah, I've I've I've

1450
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:32,000
forced my Nixon into things before.

1451
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,080
I'll go start doing I got a real career ahead of me, being able to do it.

1452
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:38,240
OK, Nixon, I got to be the next rich little or

1453
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:41,040
who's that other guy I like?

1454
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:43,400
Old old impressionist.

1455
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:44,920
Oh, Fred Travolina.

1456
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:47,080
There you go, Lena.

1457
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:48,480
I'm traveling.

1458
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:51,120
They all could all do Nixon

1459
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,240
was the main impression in those days.

1460
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:56,640
Kevin Spacey does Nixon.

1461
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:59,080
He has to.

1462
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:01,440
When he was in that movie, he's an Elvis.

1463
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:02,400
And yes, he is.

1464
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:04,800
They play Nixon, right? Yeah.

1465
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:08,680
Great. He decidedly didn't do an impression, just did like his own take.

1466
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:13,440
Nixon is singing some standards in this one.

1467
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:21,760
Scott, did you come across the other John Wayne fact

1468
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:24,080
kind of around this ride?

1469
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:29,880
No, no. The month before this ride opened, the or not.

1470
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,320
Wait. Yeah, John Wayne.

1471
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:34,680
The the month before this ride opened, the John Wayne movie in theaters

1472
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:38,280
was True Grit, the movie he won.

1473
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:40,680
I believe won the Oscar for.

1474
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:43,800
Or at least was nominated for.

1475
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:46,400
It's one of the ones that, you know,

1476
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:48,320
and then he's messing around at knots.

1477
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:51,400
Yeah. Big summer. Big summer for Mr. Wayne.

1478
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:54,040
Thank you.

1479
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:56,240
This is this is a little bit.

1480
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:57,600
Well, not out of nowhere.

1481
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:02,800
This I want to share a quick photo here to Walter, not am Bud Hurlbutt

1482
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,960
on the ride. Did we see this on the Wikipedia?

1483
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:06,000
Oh, yes.

1484
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,200
Forget it.

1485
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:11,600
They look both like they're like animatronics fell into the log.

1486
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:16,200
And then they like they both look not real to me here.

1487
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:18,760
They.

1488
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:26,840
Like the most like wooden pose from Walter with a straw hat or at

1489
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:29,640
I guess maybe right now to straw yet, but.

1490
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:33,800
It looks like someone told Walter not do something with your hands.

1491
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:37,960
Walter act natural act like you're having fun.

1492
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:44,120
And he was incapable of fully showing fun on his face.

1493
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:49,600
Yeah. And then Bud Hurlbutt is this he wears a bit not.

1494
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:51,080
How do you describe this?

1495
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:56,040
I mean, it's a very kernel tie with the bow tie, but with the long strings

1496
01:21:56,480 --> 01:22:00,480
going and he's got he's got a got pins hanging out of his pocket.

1497
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:02,680
He's like, you know, you could.

1498
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:06,480
Yes. Like Jack Nicholson from the end of the Shining in this photo.

1499
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:08,240
And it wouldn't be different.

1500
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:09,640
It would be the same.

1501
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:15,400
Yeah, there is just there is something very ominous about this photo already.

1502
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,520
And I don't know exactly what it is.

1503
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:24,480
Yeah, it there is just look like it looks like they're sitting very still.

1504
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:26,880
Like you can feel them sitting still.

1505
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:31,800
But it might also just be like worn out because he fronted

1506
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:35,440
the three point five million it took to build this right.

1507
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:38,480
And that I think like sold it to not.

1508
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:41,840
Yeah, he like I found this.

1509
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:47,560
This was in that video that he leased to the like he leased to the ride to them.

1510
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:51,840
He built it, but then leased like as if, you know, I'm trying.

1511
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:52,760
What's a good example?

1512
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:57,680
Like the, you know, if if the teacups were built by some guy

1513
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:01,200
and he like he just, you know, rented it to Disneyland.

1514
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:03,960
It's so weird. Yeah.

1515
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:07,640
Yeah, I guess it's just I guess more willing to make deals

1516
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:09,720
when you don't have as much money as Disney did.

1517
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:12,040
Like how to get something made.

1518
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:16,320
I mean, he seems like as much credit is due to him as the knots.

1519
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:20,960
Like he was the guy pushing them to like he because he worked on the

1520
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:24,000
Calico Mine train, too.

1521
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,240
And then he did this.

1522
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:28,680
I think this he wanted to be like a roller coaster first, a roller coaster

1523
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:31,320
that looked like a log bouncing around.

1524
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:36,280
And then when working with Arrow, they got the the first modern log flume

1525
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:38,040
up and going at Six Flags over Texas.

1526
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:42,520
That was enough proof of concept success to get this one off the ground.

1527
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:44,560
Now, what's your feeling about that?

1528
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:47,720
That other one about the the mine ride?

1529
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:52,360
The mine ride is I think one of the oddest

1530
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:57,560
just like like ride experiences because it's not exciting

1531
01:23:57,560 --> 01:24:02,840
and it's not like it's it's a weird like in between

1532
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:06,280
because like you're learning about, I guess, like that this is just like a thing

1533
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:09,360
people did. So like there's like a slight bit of education to it.

1534
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:13,160
But it's not interesting, like or like done well.

1535
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:16,240
So like but it's like in the cart, you're sitting

1536
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:19,720
the cart is like one of the more baffling ride seats to me

1537
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:22,600
because it's like you're sitting in like a rectangle and you're sitting

1538
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:24,880
like around the perimeter of it inside of it.

1539
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:26,920
So the middle is completely empty.

1540
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:30,480
So like to see some of the ride, you have to like crane your neck and stuff

1541
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:33,120
and like make sure you're not missing anything behind you.

1542
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:35,800
But it's like that's it's long, too.

1543
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:38,280
I feel like it's like a long experience.

1544
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:41,960
Yeah. But it's a long time to be knee to knee with

1545
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:45,600
strangers. Yes.

1546
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:48,680
Yeah. With land like when you've had our experience.

1547
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:53,400
I mean, this is the first time Mike and I hung out was to check out these rides.

1548
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:56,080
And it was, yeah, a group of us.

1549
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:59,400
I think I think Ryan Perez is there and Doug Jones and all of us like,

1550
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:02,320
you know, like with a bunch of children.

1551
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:07,800
Yeah. There's a bunch of 30 somethings and then the rest is all little kids.

1552
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:10,280
You spend most of the ride going, oh, sorry.

1553
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:14,160
Nearby. I'm not.

1554
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:17,120
We're not creeps. We're not.

1555
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:20,320
Sorry. Yeah, we're not going to start a podcast about this soon.

1556
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:25,640
It also feels like on that train ride, which believe me, I

1557
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:29,080
I don't disagree with anything you're saying, but I love it.

1558
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:31,280
But yeah, I also love it.

1559
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:33,200
It's boring, but it's great.

1560
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:35,480
Yeah. It struggles that train.

1561
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:38,400
It feels like it's struggling to get you up as well.

1562
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:41,640
It feels like, oh, a certain point, maybe that the brakes just break

1563
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:44,480
and we just roll backwards and crash into the train behind us.

1564
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:46,920
Yeah. Then at least something would have happened on the ride.

1565
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:50,080
Well, that's true. It would be exciting.

1566
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:51,520
Fly out.

1567
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:55,800
But yeah, Nats is doing.

1568
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:59,800
I'm I'm a big fan of I think not to slowly just trying to build out

1569
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:03,560
the world of these miserable people that lived in olden times. Yes.

1570
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:05,960
But then that's what's exciting.

1571
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:09,120
They had they don't have it anymore, but they had that one ride where

1572
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:12,640
I think it was called was it called the Kingdom of the Dinosaurs?

1573
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:16,760
Or was it like this like time travel ride where you went through

1574
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:21,880
you know, a mad scientist lab and then you went through his time machine,

1575
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:25,560
which was unready and untested and you went back and saw dinosaurs.

1576
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:28,560
And that was also like a very long ride.

1577
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:32,680
So like they had that they had experience, what it's like to work

1578
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:35,880
as a person who like doesn't have modern technology.

1579
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:39,280
And then also just like swings, like just like

1580
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:42,720
just like any other kind of like regular sort of roller coaster ride.

1581
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:45,680
The very, very

1582
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:48,040
it's just it's a strange theme park and I love it.

1583
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:49,920
And I frankly do miss it.

1584
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:53,680
I haven't been in some time and I'd love to go when it's safe to go.

1585
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:56,760
Yeah. Yeah, we were big fans of it.

1586
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:58,720
And it's only yeah, they're only expanding.

1587
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:01,040
They did a maze last year that I was very excited about.

1588
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:04,880
That was the origin of Halloween maze, the origin of the ghost town.

1589
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:06,320
Oh, wow.

1590
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:08,760
Which we were like so thrilled by.

1591
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:11,080
Like you got a lot of mileage out of stuff like that,

1592
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:13,480
because that's like legitimately like very interesting.

1593
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:16,360
Like that's that's a good idea.

1594
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:20,480
So the people in charge right now are good and know what they're doing.

1595
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:24,040
Well, and you know, yeah, we're all missing it.

1596
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:26,800
We've been so charmed by knots and we really like this ride.

1597
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:30,040
And that sounds like you haven't gotten to go in a while and you miss it.

1598
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:32,920
And we've all been we're in what feels like such an

1599
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:35,920
awful time right now this year.

1600
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:39,160
But maybe if we could get out of this and go to knots and knots

1601
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:42,920
will remind us that the times before were way worse.

1602
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:48,280
Yeah, you had to be a logger, a miner or work on a stage coach and get robbed.

1603
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:54,320
Yeah. If you go way back, a dinosaur might bite your head off.

1604
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:59,280
Yeah. If you go like midway, you could be a ghost in a in a desert town.

1605
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,240
Yeah. I mean, there had to been some sort of outbreak in the mine, for God's sake.

1606
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:06,960
Oh, yeah, absolutely. Yeah.

1607
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:10,560
Oh, yeah. Way, way crazier to see.

1608
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:15,200
Nuts will make us appreciate that this is really 2020 is really the best year

1609
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,560
we've ever had.

1610
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:19,040
Is there a canary? Is there a dead canary in that?

1611
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:20,560
Yes, there sure is.

1612
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:22,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK.

1613
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:25,640
And you know, the part there's a part that I was thinking about,

1614
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:27,800
I don't know how to describe it, but there's like a big like

1615
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:31,400
where you can only see it from like afar, but it's like a big

1616
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:34,520
looks like the biggest part of the ride where it's like multiple layers

1617
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:38,600
of like work being done that and there's like animatronics like on like carts

1618
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:42,280
and stuff. That's like a legitimately like impressive part of the ride.

1619
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:44,240
Like, yeah, thinking about it like

1620
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:47,000
me walking back that it is boring.

1621
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,040
That's like very good.

1622
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:49,880
Like that's a good part of it.

1623
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:52,280
The scale, the scale of like that they put it.

1624
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:53,720
Yeah. In this ride.

1625
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:55,640
Some work went into that, for sure.

1626
01:28:55,640 --> 01:29:00,120
Yeah. And I think a lot of the like plus ups they did in the 2013s,

1627
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:03,640
they kind of like were leaning into those sorts of like

1628
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:06,400
going with those choices.

1629
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:10,960
I meant to say this earlier with like because it kind of is a little weird,

1630
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:13,120
kind of ties in with the Halloween stuff.

1631
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:15,240
At least it gives me the heebie jeebies a little.

1632
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:19,760
But then when they when they upgraded the ride, the human figures,

1633
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:22,640
when there was 17 of them originally, it went to 40.

1634
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:25,560
And I read in the O.C.

1635
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:32,640
Register that they made the faces out of some of the original cast,

1636
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:35,880
the original molds they used on the ride.

1637
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:39,920
But the hands, legs and feet were made from the life

1638
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:42,760
cast of Carter Holt employees and friends.

1639
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:44,800
Oh,

1640
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:47,560
just like real people.

1641
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:51,600
Yeah. So I don't know why, but that just gave me the Willie.

1642
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:54,000
Yeah. Like that's that's awful.

1643
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:56,560
I would jump at the chance.

1644
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:59,040
Oh, yeah. It's it's given.

1645
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:01,560
It gave me the Willie's a little.

1646
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:04,400
It's like kind of part of their soul is there. Yeah.

1647
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:07,360
Yeah. Yeah. There's a piece of them.

1648
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:11,240
Like, it's not as bad as like them modeling

1649
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:15,320
an animatronic after Jack Sparrow, like in

1650
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:20,320
it's like it's that's that's different somehow and not as bad.

1651
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:23,760
Right. Yeah.

1652
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:26,840
I would we all like to be preserved as

1653
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:30,080
creepy animatronics and a giant corpses.

1654
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:32,000
No, no, no.

1655
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:36,080
Dermi, I mean, would we like molds of although I don't know.

1656
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:38,160
I might be fine with that, too. Yeah, puppet me.

1657
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:40,320
That's fine. I would have to be doing something

1658
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:46,200
you like better than what I'm doing, like with my life right now.

1659
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:49,240
Like I'd have to be like doing something like legitimately impressive

1660
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:52,280
and in the animatronic, maybe put me on the make make me a logger.

1661
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:54,040
I could never be a logger right now.

1662
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:55,880
And you run on the logs.

1663
01:30:55,880 --> 01:30:57,080
You run on a spinning.

1664
01:30:57,080 --> 01:31:00,760
God, if I could be preserved as the log runner, that would be

1665
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:03,080
that'd be like a dream come true.

1666
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:05,920
We're in a crown that says top scam.

1667
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:09,440
I'm not a boysenberry punch living the little of my life.

1668
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:12,360
That would not be out of place on this ride.

1669
01:31:12,360 --> 01:31:13,720
No. Yeah.

1670
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:17,200
Well, that's the way that's the way you should be remembered.

1671
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:20,720
And so I think with that top scam from that Appadaka,

1672
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:23,080
you survived by the right. Yeah.

1673
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:25,240
That was a blast.

1674
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:28,880
And is there anything that let's exit to the gift shop?

1675
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:31,840
Is there anything that the top scam would like to put?

1676
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:34,440
Well, yeah, I mean, I think the thing is that

1677
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:37,440
I like to blow. Well, yeah, I mean, well, first of all,

1678
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:38,200
thank you for having me.

1679
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:40,120
I would you really love this show.

1680
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:41,960
So thank you for having me.

1681
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:46,280
And I guess for plugs, listen to how this get played.

1682
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:50,080
You can hear me talk sometimes

1683
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:53,680
with Nick Weigert and Heather and Campbell about

1684
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:57,200
bad or weird video games.

1685
01:31:57,200 --> 01:31:58,920
That's a lot of fun.

1686
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:02,720
You can be on like, you know, is this racist or culture kings as well?

1687
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:07,600
And I have my own podcast that is off right now,

1688
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:10,240
but I just released like a I just really OK.

1689
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:12,000
So I have a Weiser podcast called What's With These Homies

1690
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,760
Talking About Weiser, where I covered all the Weiser albums

1691
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:17,280
and some of the other little things in between.

1692
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:22,840
And then I did a one off of called So Whatcha Whatcha Whatcha

1693
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:25,520
Talking About Beastie Boys, where me and John Gaber's talked about

1694
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:27,440
Licensed to Ill, because that's a great album as well.

1695
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:31,880
So all those things are there for in the What's With These Homies

1696
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:33,040
Talking About Weiser Feed.

1697
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:36,600
And so if you want to hear me talk about music that sometimes people like

1698
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:37,800
and most of the time they do not.

1699
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:42,640
I have a quick question, Matt, do you like on Ratatoude

1700
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:45,040
on the Weiser album, Ratatoude, do you like the song?

1701
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:47,840
I don't want to let you go.

1702
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:49,680
You know, I think that's a good, very good song.

1703
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:52,920
I can't remember what I said about it, but I do think that song is good.

1704
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:55,720
That's one of the better songs on Ratatoude.

1705
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:58,160
Certainly better than I'm Your Daddy.

1706
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:01,360
Or I agree.

1707
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:05,920
I don't know this one, but I'm interested.

1708
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:08,200
I'm Your Daddy is not a great Weiser song.

1709
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:09,440
It's not a great song.

1710
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:12,560
Like it's it's barely a good thing to say.

1711
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:16,240
The yeah, I'm looking at the tracklist.

1712
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:19,360
If you're wondering if I want you to that song, I love that.

1713
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:20,680
I think it's great. That's a great.

1714
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:21,760
That's a top Weiser song.

1715
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:26,600
I think the album starts strong and there's a lot of songs and then it ends strong.

1716
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:28,960
And then the bonus tracks are also not good.

1717
01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:31,680
More daddy stuff, more daddy daddy stuff.

1718
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:36,080
There's a song that Rivers wrote for for soccer

1719
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:39,080
and the soccer song is not good.

1720
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,880
But yeah, just a lot of just a lot of stuff there that's bad.

1721
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:45,280
Is there anything about heart songs?

1722
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:46,680
Heart songs is great.

1723
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:50,760
I think I have a hard time with just the word.

1724
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:53,640
Like the word gives me embarrassment goosebumps.

1725
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:57,080
Yeah, it is very like Tumblr.

1726
01:33:57,320 --> 01:33:59,160
Tumblr like it's a very like

1727
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:04,960
it's just like it's a little too twee for even for like Weiser.

1728
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:10,320
But I think the new take is because everyone's like Maldroids underrated.

1729
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:12,600
So if everyone's saying that, that means it's good.

1730
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:15,320
So everyone can disagree that Maldroid is just plain good.

1731
01:34:16,040 --> 01:34:18,720
My new thing is that the red album is underrated.

1732
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:21,040
Not enough love for the red album.

1733
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:24,640
What's what's on Maldroid or the red album and the audience?

1734
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:26,160
Audience, a follower, Twitter and everything.

1735
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:27,880
This little bonus Weiser podcast.

1736
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:28,760
Feel free to bail if you want.

1737
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:30,960
But what's what's on either of those?

1738
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:33,120
Dope Nose, American Gigolo.

1739
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:34,360
I like that one.

1740
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:36,720
I think Keep Fishing is the last one that I like.

1741
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:38,080
I like Dope Nose.

1742
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:39,840
Dope Nose is great.

1743
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:41,520
Possibilities is a good song.

1744
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:42,760
Possibilities.

1745
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:43,880
Love Explosion is good.

1746
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:44,680
Burnt and Jam.

1747
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:45,400
They're all good.

1748
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:47,160
That's pretty good.

1749
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:48,280
Yes, I agree.

1750
01:34:48,280 --> 01:34:49,560
It's a great album.

1751
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:51,520
I think half of Red is good.

1752
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:54,440
I think half of Heart Songs is good, except for the part where he's like,

1753
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:56,400
These are my heart song.

1754
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:57,480
That's my problem.

1755
01:34:57,480 --> 01:34:58,400
Yes. Yeah.

1756
01:34:58,400 --> 01:34:59,720
I don't remember the rest.

1757
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:02,360
That part just like consumed my memory.

1758
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:07,080
That part is not so good, but the rest of it, I think, is actually pretty good.

1759
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:12,200
You know, and I love I love the white album and I love everything.

1760
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:13,200
It'll be all right in the end.

1761
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:17,520
And they have some good stuff on like I don't think Pacific Daydream is all bad.

1762
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:20,200
I don't think black is all bad, but they're trying.

1763
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:23,400
And I'm very excited about the newer stuff that they put out.

1764
01:35:23,560 --> 01:35:25,040
Like fairly recently.

1765
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:26,840
I really the white album is very good.

1766
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:28,160
The white album is stellar.

1767
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:29,080
It's great. Yeah.

1768
01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:31,160
It's really time.

1769
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:33,920
Yes. I was going to say any time he just goes, you know what?

1770
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:36,360
Let's just make it sound exactly like the first two albums.

1771
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:38,880
Yeah. I'm going to write exactly like that.

1772
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:39,720
It's always good.

1773
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:42,000
Well, and everything will be all right in the end, too.

1774
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:46,000
They brought back Rick Okasek and he was just like, I know what your guitars sound like.

1775
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:49,000
And then everyone was like, oh, yeah, these. Yes.

1776
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:51,000
Just help them tune it right.

1777
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,360
Yeah. No, no, no.

1778
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:53,320
You're doing it all wrong.

1779
01:35:53,320 --> 01:35:54,200
Here, use mine.

1780
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:56,160
And they're like, oh, I did that before. You're right.

1781
01:35:58,640 --> 01:36:00,080
Anyway, yes, I could talk.

1782
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:01,040
I could talk with you all day.

1783
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:02,520
Scott, you were going to say something before.

1784
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:05,640
Well, we were talking before we started about how I've said how they are.

1785
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:09,840
They are like the Beach Boys and that they like they'll never go away.

1786
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:13,720
Weasel will be doing or Rivers will be doing this when he's 70 with a bunch of,

1787
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:15,840
you know, hired guns.

1788
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:18,840
But but your guys, weasel take clearly is like my beach boys take

1789
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:22,440
because I'll defend songs on their 2012 album.

1790
01:36:22,440 --> 01:36:24,640
That's why God made the radio.

1791
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:27,560
I'm the one going, actually, that's why I got a radio.

1792
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:30,840
So there's good stuff on Summer in Paradise is the thing.

1793
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:35,520
So I feel like I'm like I'm right there with you with another thing.

1794
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:39,840
There's a the the Monkeys had an album like maybe like two or three years ago.

1795
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:41,880
That is like actually pretty good.

1796
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:43,600
Pretty good. Yes.

1797
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:46,600
River's wrote at least one of the songs on that album.

1798
01:36:46,920 --> 01:36:48,440
Yes. Oh, really?

1799
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:51,720
I've only heard the XTC ones and there's a Paul Weller one that's good.

1800
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:53,240
Yeah, that is a oddly good.

1801
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:55,520
Yeah. Like who would have thought that one?

1802
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:58,360
That's like something that would come out

1803
01:36:58,360 --> 01:37:02,640
in like the late 2010s and then that it would be like

1804
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:04,840
actually like very listenable and very good.

1805
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:11,200
The last kind of obscure Weezer song, Miss Sweeney, are you in favor?

1806
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:12,120
Love it. I love it.

1807
01:37:12,120 --> 01:37:16,480
I think Miss Sweeney is like I wish they would do more things like that

1808
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:19,040
because there is something very

1809
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:20,360
like theatrical about it.

1810
01:37:20,360 --> 01:37:23,680
And like I know Weezer musical sounds bad to everyone

1811
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:27,640
who just heard what I just said, but I think could be good.

1812
01:37:27,720 --> 01:37:32,600
And I think based on like if Rivers wrote the songbook for a musical,

1813
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:33,760
it would be great.

1814
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:37,080
Wow. Well, I'm going to send Miss Sweeney to Scott if he's never heard it.

1815
01:37:37,080 --> 01:37:39,920
I am curious to know what his reaction is to it.

1816
01:37:40,240 --> 01:37:46,680
But I'm not hard out unless they are covering songs that a wedding band.

1817
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:49,120
That is my rule.

1818
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:52,160
I think but I think what I said, you can't stop the hustle.

1819
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:54,040
You weren't thrilled with it.

1820
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:59,200
If it's like a wedding, if it's like a wedding band's original music would be,

1821
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:00,760
then I have trouble to.

1822
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:02,480
Well, thanks for doing this miniature.

1823
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:03,760
What's he's always talking about?

1824
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:06,720
We certainly can be very excited that the show is back.

1825
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:09,600
Two podcasts for the price of one.

1826
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:13,520
And hey, if you want more podcasts from us, obviously stay on the main feed

1828
01:38:16,280 --> 01:38:19,120
But but for three bonus episodes every month,

1829
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:24,440
you can check out the second gate at Patreon dot com slash podcast, the ride.

1830
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:27,480
And that is and our music picks for the week.

1831
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:32,640
The Beach Boys, the Monkeys and Weezer.

1832
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:39,480
It's like pitchfork early, early days, a pitchfork screen

1833
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:43,280
checking to really dig in through the bins, finding the

1834
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:48,520
secret to our spin off podcast of mostly old man music

1835
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:52,640
mixed with 10 percent 90s and zero 2010s.

1836
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:57,040
Although although it should be late period old man music.

1837
01:38:57,120 --> 01:39:00,720
Yes, we really genuinely could do that entire podcast.

1838
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:01,120
Yeah.

1839
01:39:01,120 --> 01:39:05,240
I've been 90s and later albums by 60s musicians.

1840
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:08,440
Yes. Oh, no, I do this now.

1841
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:13,480
Bruce Springsteen's outlaw, Pete, talking about for like 30 minutes

1842
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:15,400
and being like, everyone's like, what is this song?

1843
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:16,680
I've never heard this.

1844
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:18,400
There's pretty good stuff on flaming pie.

1845
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:22,240
If you we got it, we have to leave now or we have to get out of here

1846
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:25,560
because I just wanted I've been listening to the reissue of it.

1847
01:39:27,320 --> 01:39:29,200
All right. Well, we'll figure out that podcast later time.

1848
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:31,320
Matt, thanks for being here. Everyone else, thanks for listening.

1849
01:39:31,320 --> 01:39:32,360
