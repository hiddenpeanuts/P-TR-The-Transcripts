1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Oh, he's naughty.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I've just seen him on slot machines.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I guess I didn't realize his comics heritage.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
He's got baby Huey family, Richie Rich.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Okay, okay.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We look similar, the big round head.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Yeah, he looks really cool.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I love his character design.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Yeah.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I just got a, I just actually hit record.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Maybe this is part of it.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Okay, great.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I was in Target just now and a very aggressive, like, bro, bro.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And I go, I turn around like, oh no, something's wrong.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And he goes, where'd you get that shirt?

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And I'm wearing, of course, a Hot Stuff the Little Devil shirt.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And I go, I got it at hottopic.com, Black Friday sale.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And he goes, that's awesome.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And I went, whoa, wow.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That's like the greatest compliment I could have ever received.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I didn't think people knew Hot Stuff.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Maybe he didn't know Hot Stuff necessarily.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
He just likes the design, yeah.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
He just liked the child devil.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Right.

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
That's the idea of it was good.

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Anyway, podcast The Ride the Second Gate, we're here.

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And yes, I am wearing, let's go around the room.

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Jason Sheridan here.

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
He's wearing Islands of Adventure sweatshirt.

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm in my Be Cozy Islands of Adventure sweatshirt.

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yeah, and our guest today, Nick Weiger's wearing, what is it, blue or gray?

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
This is just a gray t-shirt.

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's very boring, but I'm wearing it.

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I was wearing an underlayer under my much more exciting Tiger print sweater.

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But it was just getting a little warm in here, so I took the sweater off.

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Smart, yeah, that's a very cool sweater.

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yeah, I like it, thank you.

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
What brand we got on that t-shirt?

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
This t-shirt is a, I don't know the brand because I was in Toronto and Air Canada lost my luggage.

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So this was like one of two shirts I bought when I was waiting for my luggage for 48 hours.

43
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It looks nice.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It is, thank you, it's very comfortable actually.

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yeah, well I wanted to start with just some wholesome talk up top here, you know,

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:09,000
because I feel like the good listeners today are going to get bombarded with naughty talk, dirty things,

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
because of the topic of today's episode.

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So now that we've gotten that out of the way, a wholesome sort of discussion about our clothing,

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
let's start talking about the topic today, Santa's Secret.

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Santa's Secret.

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Jason, you want to say Santa's Secret?

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Santa's Secret.

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Shh, don't tell Mrs. Claus.

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That's the tagline.

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Now, I did not make it to this outing.

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yes.

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:44,000
But I wanted to get a little background on Santa's Secret, and learned it came from New York originally,

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:55,000
and that there, I watched, I accidentally watched a YouTube short that showed me everything,

59
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
and I don't have the context for it, but I'm like, oh, okay.

60
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
A YouTube short though, like how short was the video?

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
No, no, the like vertical, YouTube shorts are like YouTube's version of TikToks.

62
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
But aren't those usually shorter?

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It was like 40 seconds.

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
But basically for a minute, it summarized all the acts is what you're saying.

65
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
All the acts.

66
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So my, I'm aware that there's a New York show.

67
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I think the LA show is different.

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
In fact, I think the show is largely dictated like Cirque du Soleil style.

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I've seen one of those where it's like, it's kind of a review where each act brings their own thing to the table,

70
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
and they just sort of string it together with a loose narrative.

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It was that sort of format.

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yes.

73
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So this is something that started popping up into like our algorithm last year.

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
That's right.

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And it would be like a hunky guy in a Santa outfit, shirtless guy.

76
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Then there would be like maybe like a sexy lady elf or something.

77
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Right.

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Woman that seems to be nearly nude in a big martini glass or in a big eggnog glass.

79
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I can't remember what oversized drink it was.

80
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And we were definitely all fascinated by it last year.

81
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yeah.

82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And we were talking about potentially going.

83
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And I don't know quite why it fell through.

84
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
This is also, of course, we're talking with our good friend, Eva Anderson, who accompanied us.

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yes.

86
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Scott Garner and Eva Anderson accompanied us, Weiger and I, to Santa's Secret last Friday,

87
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
which by now you've heard the Kyle Mooney episode,

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
which we discussed having to end early to go to a secret thing.

89
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Ironically, Santa's Secret.

90
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Wow.

91
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And now it's been revealed that we were going to Santa's Secret.

92
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Kyle asked if we wanted to go out for margaritas.

93
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
We said, no, we cannot.

94
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
We have tickets to a very important content related show.

95
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Should have brought Kyle out to the Beverly Center.

96
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
We offered, but there were tickets available.

97
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
We enjoyed Santa's Secret.

98
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So here's the thing.

99
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I think a lot of our discussion was centered around what is Santa's Secret?

100
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Are we going to learn Santa's Secret?

101
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And I think that was a lot of what we were intrigued by.

102
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It was, yes.

103
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
They were like, what is Santa's Secret that Mrs. Claus can never find out about?

104
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And so a lot of us anticipating this event was, what are we going to learn?

105
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Right.

106
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And then it definitely felt like there was, yes, a big question hanging over it.

107
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So we're like, what could Santa's Secret possibly be?

108
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And I said, you know, we're Scott-free today in studio,

109
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
but I was talking to Scott, you know, at the event,

110
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
and I theorized that Santa's Secret was perhaps the show itself.

111
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That we're going to like, hey, Santa's Secret is that he's got a little burlesque that, you know,

112
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
he gets a little horny when he's not on the clock, you know.

113
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Right. Santa's Secret is just that, yes, he enjoys a leggy elf.

114
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
He enjoys seeing the kneecap of a lady elf or something once in a while.

115
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But the show itself represents just the average dreams of a horny fictional character.

116
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Yes. But in fact, Santa's Secret was much more than that.

117
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I will say, Jason, I would have loved for you to be there,

118
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
but it's probably for the best because I think you might have gotten so horny you would have levitated.

119
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You know, Jane's mom was in town and I didn't know you guys had moved this outing until like,

120
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
oh, we got to run right after this.

121
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
We have to go to Santa's Secret.

122
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And I'm like, oh, that's probably for the best.

123
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I don't know that I would have taken my future mother-at-law to Santa's Secret once I saw what it was.

124
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yeah. But I will say, I think it was largely an older crowd.

125
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I think it was the kind of experience I have as a man in my 40s now where I go to see like a jazz concert.

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I love jazz music.

127
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And then like these silver haired people will be like, oh, it's great to see some young people here.

128
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And I'm like, well, I'm in my mid 40s.

129
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
But yeah, I guess I qualify as young in this.

130
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I think that was one of those things where it was like, you know, there were a lot of just maybe that's who this appeals to,

131
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
or maybe that's just who lives in Beverly Hills.

132
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
There's older folks.

133
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

134
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And it's at the Beverly Center.

135
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It sure is.

136
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It is a higher end mall.

137
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yes, it is a higher end mall.

138
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Some might call it a fortress.

139
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Some might call it an impenetrable fortress.

140
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Kind of famously, famously inconvenient to navigate, I believe.

141
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's wild how hard it is to just get into the Beverly Center from street level.

142
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
This was a whole thing.

143
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
That was a whole thing.

144
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Finding out how to get down to the bowling alley was impossible.

145
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
We tried after the show.

146
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It took 20 minutes to figure it out.

147
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:43,000
But the Beverly Center, I will say, is not a place that you necessarily think about, oh, I'm going to go see some light nudity.

148
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's more of like, oh, they have higher end stores or whatever that means to anybody.

149
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Yeah.

150
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Well, that's what I asked you when you were talking about it.

151
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I said, well, wait a minute, because I thought this was just a straight show.

152
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I didn't know about, I'm not going to spoil anything, but the immersive elements, a word that pretty much means nothing nowadays.

153
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
But I didn't know about any of that.

154
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But I asked you, is this a performance base or an abandoned Sears?

155
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Well, we performed an abandoned sports authority and the answer appears to be half calm, half combi.

156
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yeah. Did you figure out exactly what it was?

157
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I think Scott was doing some research and he found that it was the old food court that has been taken apart.

158
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yeah.

159
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And hollowed out and inhabited like a hermit crab by Santa's secret.

160
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Would you say that the old food court was dug out?

161
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I guess you could say that. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's fair.

162
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's a, I at first, because there used to be a top floor movie theater.

163
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's on the top floor of the Beverly Center, which is like an eight level mall.

164
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's absurdly tall.

165
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And so we're on the eighth level of the Beverly Center, which by the way, also you have to take sets of escalators that are not connected.

166
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So you have to like go up one set of escalator, then like walk to the other end of the promenade to take another escalator that goes up.

167
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So anyway, so, so we serpentine our way all the way, all the way to the top floor.

168
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I was, I was the last, the last to arrive.

169
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I read basically right at showtime.

170
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And I at first theorized that it was the, there used to be a movie theater up there.

171
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I thought it was the movie theater.

172
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And I was like, that kind of makes sense for a, for a presentational space.

173
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
But no, I guess it was, you know, where the Wetzel's pretzels and Panda Express were.

174
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yeah. But it was hard to tell. They did dress it up well.

175
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
They did.

176
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Where you didn't necessarily feel like you were like walking by an old pretzel maker or something.

177
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Like I couldn't tell what it was. We didn't know.

178
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
No. Okay. So, so you were in line that were queued up.

179
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It's a little complicated, I guess, because I was late.

180
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Like I'd missed the pre, the pre cocktail thing where you get like, yeah.

181
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So I didn't get a, I didn't get a cocktail in advance.

182
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I had to like, you know, order that separately.

183
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yes. We are pre prepaid for cocktails in line on a phone.

184
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But then you just like sweet talked a person at a window and got a cocktail anyway.

185
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:14,000
So, so this is the other thing I will say is that it's one of those things where everyone there is attractive because that's part of the whole burlesque thing.

186
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So it's like there was, there was like this, you know, hunk wearing a vest who was working in the bar.

187
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Sure.

188
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And handed me, you know, I think I got the Rudolph's, the Rudolph Rita or something like this.

189
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It was a red margarita. And, you know, but the thing is, it's like, it's not like they were whipping up craft cocktails back there.

190
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
They'd batched everything and he just handed me a glass that was already finished.

191
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So, yeah, it was a big, it was like a jug full of mixed liquor.

192
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Yeah. Oh, well, we love a milk chug of liquor.

193
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Like an icecoach.

194
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And yeah, and then you would go. So yeah, once you finally went inside, there was a little like, it said train tickets.

195
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Right. Right. Right by where you would get the drink.

196
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So I, so I also want to just acknowledge with the narrative that they're what the story they're weaving is, is that we're going to the train.

197
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
We're taking a magical train ride to go see the North Pole, essentially.

198
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
A Polar Sexpress, if you will.

199
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
A train that goes in a tunnel, backs up, goes back at the tunnel, backs up.

200
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
A real North by Northwest situation.

201
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
So yeah, so we all had our mixed cocktail.

202
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And at this point, you're waiting in this little lobby and I really did not know what to expect.

203
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Me neither, no.

204
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,000
But there was a door and there was like kind of a hunky guy in a vest, sort of a vest with no shirt on underneath.

205
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Yeah, that was like kind of standard look for men.

206
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Sort of vest with no shirt.

207
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yes. Or just no shirt.

208
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Or just no shirt.

209
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
But then he had like a little conductor's hat on.

210
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And I've just, the whole time I'm thinking, oh, Jason would have loved this.

211
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You would have loved that. And also the, the bartender blew a little train whistle and did like an all aboard when drinks were ready.

212
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I wish they all would.

213
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's hard to get there. I wish you could blow a whistle.

214
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Oh, that'd be great.

215
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
To flag down the bartender a different tone than the whistle they blow to say your drink is ready.

216
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Have you, Jason, can I ask you, have you ever in your life worn a little vest and a conductor's hat?

217
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Just those?

218
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
With no shirt.

219
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
No, I can't say I have.

220
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Okay, I haven't either. I just wanted to know.

221
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm open to it.

222
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Okay.

223
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
But I'm carrying a little extra weight right now, you know.

224
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Well, hey.

225
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm trying to get my diet, my sleep, and a little bit of exercise leveled out, you know.

226
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Sure.

227
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Aren't we all this time of year?

228
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Well, me too. Yeah. Next year you're, like in about a year's time you'll pledge to wear a vest, no shirt, and a train conductor's hat.

229
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You are always trying to get me to pledge.

230
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I just want sort of an informal agreement between the two of us that you will wear the little vest.

231
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I think that'd be a good look for you.

232
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Huh?

233
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I think that'd be a good look for you.

234
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Thank you. I appreciate that. I'd give it a shot, you know.

235
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It kind of looks like Aladdin.

236
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's funny you say that because I bought some just around the house cozy baggy sweatpants to wear.

237
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Okay.

238
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:10,000
And when I got them home and tried them on, the cozy baggy sweatpants I thought I bought looked more like Aladdin's pants.

239
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Oh, okay.

240
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
But then they shrunk up a little on the wash, so then they just looked like normal sweatpants.

241
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Okay. Yeah, it kind of bums me out though that they're regular now.

242
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Yeah, that is a bummer.

243
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I know. I was a little bummed too because I was going to turn it into content.

244
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
So, oh well.

245
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Oh well.

246
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I can't believe how long it took me to figure out that my wife and other women I've cohabited with are correct to size up on their lounge wear.

247
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You know what I mean?

248
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's like at home I should be wearing an XXL sweatshirt because it's fun to have a big cozy sweatshirt.

249
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It's really comfy.

250
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You want to swim in it more.

251
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Yeah, exactly.

252
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I would usually just get stuff that's my size and I'm like, well, I'm not as comfortable as I should be.

253
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
That's a good point.

254
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I feel like everything my old t-shirts I sleep in now, they're like too small.

255
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Yeah.

256
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And that's not as nice.

257
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
No.

258
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Oh, I've always been a baggy t-shirt boy for lounging and sleeping.

259
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
That's the way to go.

260
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Oh, yeah.

261
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Would you always buy one size or two sizes up?

262
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Well, I think when we were little, we would usually just buy like a big adult size shirt to wear in the pool.

263
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Oh, okay.

264
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
When you go to the pool or the beach or around the house or something.

265
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And then in the 90s, baggy was very popular.

266
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Yeah.

267
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Now it's popular again.

268
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Right.

269
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:35,000
And then there was that hell in the 2010s, 2009 where we all were very uncomfortable in slim skinny jeans and awful American barrel shirts.

270
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Yeah.

271
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Well, this hot stuff, the little devil shirt is XL and I'm usually a large guy.

272
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Yeah.

273
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
But I went XL this time because baggy is in.

274
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It looks great.

275
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Yeah.

276
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Thank you.

277
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
That's all I needed to hear.

278
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
So we go in there and yeah, there's kind of like a train lobby sort of setup.

279
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And we're queued up outside in the mall.

280
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Then we go inside.

281
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
There's kind of like this sort of train station that we're hanging out in.

282
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
And then we're ushered through just a black tunnel.

283
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It is just dark and hard to see.

284
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And I, again, still don't know what's going on at this point and what to expect.

285
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And we come out on the other side and I would say we were all enchanted.

286
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It's pretty good.

287
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It's pretty good show on the other side.

288
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It was good because you went through the tunnel and I'm like, oh, is this going to just be, first of all, it felt like a horror night's maze or something.

289
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Yeah, exactly.

290
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's going to be scary or we're just going to go straight into the nightclub.

291
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And there's like, we didn't even know if there's going to be a pre-show, you know.

292
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Because you could hear the loud band playing.

293
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Right.

294
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You could hear like somebody playing Simply the Best by Tina Turner in the distance.

295
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
And you're like, okay, who knows what this, but yeah, you're right.

296
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
We walked out of this dark tunnel into a winter Christmas wonderland.

297
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It was a winter wonderland with some robots.

298
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
There were some animatronics.

299
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Yes, there was like a good amount of robots, this whole like kind of walkthrough area.

300
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And a part of me also was thinking like, oh, did I read wrong?

301
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I thought this was a show, but maybe it's just a maze.

302
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Yeah, maybe it's just a walkthrough sort of thing.

303
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Because of how elaborate the decorations were.

304
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I thought, oh, maybe that's the experience.

305
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I guess at this point also we should say that we were given a ticket for our party.

306
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Yes, yes.

307
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And in advance, like this was not a drink ticket.

308
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
This was a separate ticket.

309
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
They were like, hey, this is for the show.

310
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Give this to the, was it the gingerbread lady?

311
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Yes, I believe it was the gingerbread lady.

312
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Give this to the gingerbread lady for a special treat or something.

313
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Right.

314
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Or for some sugar.

315
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Was that what the language was?

316
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I don't remember the specific language.

317
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Something like that, yeah.

318
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Yeah, so it was a little bit like winky, winky, whatever that.

319
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You knew what it meant.

320
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
But like, here, give that to this person.

321
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
But it felt like a quest or something you had to go on.

322
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Right.

323
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Which is a fun part of an immersive experience.

324
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I agree.

325
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
We go through there and there's like, you know, there's a bunch of animatronics.

326
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
There's a, but this is the other thing is like you said Winter Wonderland.

327
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I think that's a good way to characterize it.

328
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Because Jason, it's very wholesome at first at least.

329
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Yeah.

330
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
There's nothing that's at all body except for there's the guy with the Santa hat who's like very, was it the Santa guy?

331
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
That was a little later.

332
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It was a little later.

333
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It was a sexy lumberjack, right?

334
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It was a sexy lumberjack.

335
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Yeah.

336
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I sometimes, it's hard to tell where, which sexy guy was in what scene.

337
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Yeah.

338
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
But I think for the first room, there wasn't anything.

339
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Nothing was getting me going in the first room.

340
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Yeah.

341
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You know?

342
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
It was, I think it was a guy with like a, you know, like a winter hat and then like, you know, short shorts.

343
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And he was shirtless.

344
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
And he was just there to like take our picture.

345
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
He's like, do you guys want to take your picture in front of the big Christmas table?

346
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Right.

347
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I was in such a mood to, excuse me, a mode to look out for things.

348
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I guess I was in a mood too.

349
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
That I was like, oh, maybe I'm taking pictures of things.

350
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm like, oh, that Santa's like a pervert.

351
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Yes, right.

352
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
He's a peeping Tom Perl.

353
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And then you look at the phone and you're like, I don't know necessarily if that's what they were going for.

354
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
It might just be Santa standing behind a tree.

355
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
And then I'm looking at the elves and I'm like, which one of these elves is a sick fuck?

356
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And then I'm like, I know they all seem like nice and innocent.

357
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
No, yeah.

358
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And then I think I said something to you in the first room or two and I was like, what are these?

359
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
When are they going to get sexy?

360
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Yeah, when's it going to be horny?

361
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Yeah, because I was like, oh, maybe they overplayed their hand.

362
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Maybe this isn't going to be a very sexual show.

363
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Yeah, we kind of chased and maybe there's some people wearing skimpy outfits.

364
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
But if I'm just looking at stuff that would be at like a Christmas superstore.

365
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I will say the one bit of show I really enjoy is it's the looping conveyor belt trick,

366
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
which they had a conveyor belt of presents that would just go around.

367
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Oh yeah, and we had a little Christmas, I guess, mouse there looking at a pretzel.

368
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Is that what that is?

369
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Yes, there's a Christmas.

370
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I would say he's like a two and a half foot tall Christmas mouse.

371
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
His head moves.

372
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
He's got an adorable face and he seems to be doing something to a giant pretzel,

373
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
like one of those like, you know, baseball stadium pretzels.

374
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I think he's maybe just eyeing it.

375
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You think he's eyeing it?

376
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I feel like he's holding a candy cane as well.

377
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I don't know because it feels like he's working on it, but maybe he's not.

378
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Maybe that's what he's making.

379
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Maybe that's his job.

380
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
He says he's a pretzel maker.

381
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Yeah, is that a Christmas tree?

382
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Like, is that something you would have for Christmas?

383
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
A big stadium pretzel?

384
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
A big baseball?

385
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I can't say so.

386
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Yeah, I don't think it is, but maybe it was an East Coast thing.

387
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I was going to say maybe little smokies, little pigs in a blanket,

388
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
but those are usually crescent rolls.

389
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You would never get a big baseball stadium pretzel in your stocking?

390
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I can't say.

391
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
No.

392
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Get an orange or two maybe.

393
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Okay, sure.

394
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Tangerine.

395
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
That feels like the kind of movie you heard about when it's like, oh yeah,

396
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
that's what Dutch Christmas is.

397
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
They all have like big pretzels and then like someone wearing like a racially

398
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
inappropriate outfit.

399
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Yeah, I was going to say big pretzels and then something that is ghastly.

400
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Yeah.

401
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Yes.

402
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
So yeah, the first room and a half, two rooms were just like that.

403
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
And I was like, wow, this is really elaborate.

404
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
And they put some money into it.

405
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Yeah.

406
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Because a lot of times, you know, when these temporary things pop up,

407
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
it's a big ripoff.

408
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I expect to be completely half-assed.

409
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Like, oh, they put some wrapping paper on the walls, like wallpaper,

410
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
that sort of thing.

411
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
It's like, no, but they got a lot of animatronics here.

412
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
They put some work into staging this.

413
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Yeah.

414
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Tickets were $75.

415
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Yes.

416
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Which is expensive.

417
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
We could have gone to the press night, but it didn't work out for everyone's

418
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
schedule.

419
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
So we ended up paying.

420
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
So we can be as honest as possible about the $75.

421
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Yeah.

422
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Which I would say for this experience, just on the cusp of outrageous,

423
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
like $75 is a lot of money for what we got.

424
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Wait.

425
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Does that include a cocktail at all?

426
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
No.

427
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
No.

428
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Okay.

429
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
The cocktail was separate and the cocktail was, I believe, $22.

430
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Yeah.

431
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:45,000
But I would say the average enjoyment of the average show-goer was through

432
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
the roof.

433
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
That's true.

434
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
People were having fun.

435
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
So I think that there was hooting and hollering going on at this thing.

436
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I was like, oh, everybody here was loving this.

437
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
So I feel like if you like this type of entertainment, you know,

438
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
it would be good to write up your alley.

439
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:07,000
See, now I'm very curious because I think maybe I've been to one or two

440
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
burlesque shows and so I don't have any bearing for it.

441
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I get it.

442
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I know there's craftsmanship that goes into it.

443
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I appreciate there seems to be, at least in the LA scene,

444
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
like a real body positivity and acceptance angle.

445
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And also, it's a little horny.

446
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It's a little sexy.

447
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
But what you've described so far seems to be waiters who are dressed like

448
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Chippendales.

449
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Yeah.

450
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
So we are still in the pre-show and we kind of snake our way through this

451
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
maze.

452
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
And at what point do we meet Santa's secretary?

453
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Very quickly.

454
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
That's like the next room.

455
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Yes, the next room.

456
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
So we come into this room and there's a performer there that,

457
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
as you just pointed, as you just said, is Santa's secretary.

458
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
And there's a little desk and kind of a little tableau of what it might look

459
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
like in Santa's office.

460
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
All the big Christmas characters were represented.

461
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
The gingerbread lady, the ice queen, and Santa's secretary.

462
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Santa's W2 employee secretary.

463
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Needs a lot of help around the holiday season, so it makes sense.

464
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
So you've got sets.

465
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
You've got photo ops.

466
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
And so she's kind of got like, I guess, his study or whatever.

467
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It's like sort of set up like a state.

468
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
She's supposed to be like a sexy librarian.

469
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
She's kind of coded like that.

470
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And she's got a little hand implement.

471
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
And she asks, who is the naughtiest person here?

472
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Yes.

473
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Now, Gerdner and Carlson both immediately say, oh, Weiger is.

474
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
They point at me, which I'm like now scared.

475
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Now, I think we both wanted to say Jason, but he wasn't there.

476
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Jason wasn't there, yeah.

477
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
So just because the other male in the group was you,

478
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I think that's why it fell on you to be the naughty one.

479
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Because if it was Jason, there's just no way we wouldn't have said Jason.

480
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
It also kind of felt like, from my perspective,

481
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
like self-preservation on your part.

482
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
That's also part of it too.

483
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Absolutely.

484
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
So you said it was a naughty one.

485
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I said, I'm nice.

486
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
And then I got trapped because she was like, whoever says he's nice is actually the naughtiest one.

487
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I was like, well, there's no way out of this.

488
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
So then Jason's nightmare, which has been detailed.

489
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I had nauseam on this show talking about the Las Vegas story where he got too high in the German restaurant

490
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
and was afraid.

491
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Hofbrau House.

492
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Hofbrau House.

493
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
And it was so afraid of getting paddled by the lady.

494
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Yeah.

495
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
He, Weiger, took one on the butt.

496
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Right.

497
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
With like a riding crop.

498
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Riding crop.

499
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Yes.

500
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
That looked, I saw the clip of the riding crop lady.

501
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
It looked much more gentle than the like two foot long paddle.

502
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
It was really gentle.

503
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I mean, there was no real like, you know, no real impact felt.

504
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Yes.

505
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
So, okay.

506
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
At this point, what happens now?

507
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I have been a request.

508
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Scott has requested that we give him a phone call and talk to him about the event that happens next.

509
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
He wants to tell it from his perspective.

510
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Okay.

511
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Hello, Scott.

512
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Hey, hey.

513
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
You have me, Scott.

514
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Hello, everybody.

515
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Hi, Scott.

516
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Hi.

517
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Hey.

518
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Hey, Wiggs.

519
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Hey, Jason.

520
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Hey, Mike.

521
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
What's going on?

522
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Sorry.

523
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I couldn't be there in person.

524
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I'm also a tad under the weather and I didn't want to spread it to you guys.

525
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Now, am I a tad under the weather because I drank from a shared liquor bottle that was handed to me by a gingerbread lady?

526
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Possibly.

527
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I don't know.

528
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I have to do some kind of test on that.

529
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Well, we're sorry to hear that.

530
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:51,000
But I hope you would, you know, even if you did get an illness from Santa's Secret, I hope you would do it all again next week

531
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
because of how much fun you had.

532
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
You know, I think I would.

533
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And that's not to jump around too much.

534
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,000
And I don't know if you guys have kind of like reviewed the experience in mass.

535
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:09,000
But here a few days later in the harsh light of sobriety, am I crazy or like that was great, right?

536
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I thought it was really fun.

537
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I had a fun time.

538
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I think it was a fun experience.

539
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
We've been kind of going chronologically.

540
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
So we're really just sequentially up to where, you know, we're still in the pre-show period.

541
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
OK, OK, sure.

542
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Well, I didn't, you know, I wanted to give that overall thought and just ask if I was crazy or if I'm just like if my perspective is different

543
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
because I don't I haven't been getting out too much lately because I'm kind of just working and taking care of a baby.

544
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Maybe I did I respond to it just because I it was nice to be out of the house.

545
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Was it that or was it the magic of the North Pole?

546
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I think it was a combination of factors.

547
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I think it was that that it was above expectations in terms of, you know, the decor, in terms of the staging, in terms of the production value.

548
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I think that was part of it.

549
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I think the it had elements of you were actually seeing, you know, human mastery.

550
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Like some of these the acts were like, oh, that's actually a genuinely impressive bit of dancing you're doing, you know.

551
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Absolutely.

552
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:10,000
And and but I think there's there's also the just obviously the the ironic level and then just like the, you know, outright lewd level.

553
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
But I think we were having a good time.

554
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
We had a good group as well.

555
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
You saw a lot of people's nice stomachs.

556
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
A lot of nice stomachs.

557
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Indeed.

558
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,000
And well, and I don't want to I don't want to say too much about a certain furry creature who stripped in unexpected ways.

559
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I'll leave that to you guys.

560
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
But yeah, no, visuals like I can't erase and don't want to erase, frankly.

561
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
But I let me let me jump in.

562
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:41,000
So you guys already covered we've been going room to room at the North Pole and we've made it up through the the Weiger spanking.

563
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
That is correct.

564
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Weiger has just been spanked by Santa's secretary in the chronological order of events.

565
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Who keeps the naughty and nice list, of course.

566
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
He's in charge of the list.

567
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:04,000
So, you know, I watched this happen and I got a little bit jealous, like not necessarily of the spank itself, but because of the quality content that we got.

568
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Here I am.

569
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Here I am just sitting, taking a back seat and taking a video of Weiger's little butt getting spanked.

570
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
And meanwhile, my little butt, nothing is happening to nor Mike's.

571
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
And we're the host of the show.

572
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Right.

573
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:23,000
So as soon as the spank has occurred, I'm like, oh, you know what, we should get one of us, too.

574
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
So so I turn to Santa's secretary, who has turned fully away from us at this point immediately.

575
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
And I go back and like, hey, actually, you know what I was I was thinking?

576
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I actually I think my friend and I here have been a little bit naughty, too.

577
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
And she's like, huh?

578
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
And I immediately feel tension.

579
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:49,000
And I go, oh, well, I was just because, you know, because you spanked him because he was not interested.

580
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I thought we maybe he and I could could also do like we've been.

581
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
And then I start dropping the naughty thing.

582
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I'm just I just wanted to feel that we just film it like could we could we do it together?

583
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Is that OK?

584
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
And it's the answer is it's not OK.

585
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Like we I broke in that moment some fundamental unwritten rule of Santa's secret that I was not aware of at all.

586
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
It was so uncomfortable. Am I correct in that assessment?

587
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I was uncomfortable as also but I will also say the whole thing was genuinely confusing.

588
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
And this extends to our interaction with the gingerbread lady.

589
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Like we didn't know going into each of these interactions that they were.

590
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
There was one designated person who was going to have this experience.

591
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Like no one told us in advance.

592
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,000
No, we figured out the pattern by the gingerbread lady, which I can get to maybe while you still got me here.

593
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
But the yeah, like there was nothing saying only one of you gets a little spank.

594
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I thought everybody could get a little spank. So she agrees.

595
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
She doesn't want to say no, but it's a very like here.

596
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
It's fine. It's fine. Just do it because we got to move to the next.

597
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Oh, sorry. And I even say, oh, we don't have to.

598
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
And she's like, no, no, no, let's just do it.

599
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
And so so then I'm handing the phone over.

600
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
But then like that's taking to even having to hand you the phone.

601
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Weiger is too much business. Right.

602
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I felt like, all right, it's already in progress. Let's just do it. Let's just do it.

603
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,000
So we film a video and it's Mike and I and we both turn around and we get our little butts spanked.

604
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
He he he. But the it was not worth going.

605
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
But it's not like that was any funnier than than why you're doing it.

606
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
It was probably less funny, honestly.

607
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
So just know that when we post to this extra content,

608
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:29,000
the the awkwardness that was set through while in order to get it like we read.

609
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,000
And the difference in the vibe from Weiger's little butt getting spanked to our little butts getting spanked.

610
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Everything changed. Everything changed in that 30 seconds.

611
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
And I don't quite understand why it went from her being like, oh,

612
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
they were having a naughty little bit of naughty fun to like, all right, come on.

613
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
You know, let's get it over with.

614
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Like, it was really strange.

615
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I completely disassociated after 20 seconds of you talking to her.

616
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
And all I remember is just like, I want this to be over.

617
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Whatever happens, I want it to be over.

618
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
It felt a little bit like, you know, not to say I've done a lot of like, oh,

619
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
trying to get a picture of the celebrity or getting an autograph.

620
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
But if you ever like if that if that interaction ever takes more than 10 seconds

621
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
and you like make make somebody sit around while a flash.

622
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Oh, sorry, I went with the flash. Can I try one without?

623
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Like, that's the most mortifying thing ever.

624
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
So it was it was the pressure of like you're with an A-list celebrity,

625
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
except the A-list celebrity was Santa's secretary.

626
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
It was the strangest vibe.

627
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I felt so awkward about it still the next day.

628
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
And I texted our little thread about it.

629
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:41,000
And then Eva responded with, you coerced Santa's secretary into unpaid sex work.

630
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:47,000
This is an epic burn of me.

631
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
No, it did not help me feel any better about it.

632
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
And I wanted to be forthright and share that statement with the audience.

633
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
But I disagree with that assessment. That's not what I'm about.

634
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
That's not the kind of guy I am.

635
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
That is not what I intended to do.

636
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,000
It was all just accidental missing of the protocol of how Santa's secretary room worked.

637
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
It was it was so weird.

638
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
So I just had to like express that awkwardness myself rather than having it be told.

639
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
But what but should we go into?

640
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I forget if it was right after.

641
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:23,000
But I'm holding in my hand the card that kind of redeemed things for me a little bit

642
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
because we were handed a card at the beginning and I was keeping it for the group.

643
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I believe it was the next experience.

644
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
So here's the thing.

645
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
As I mentioned, we got the card.

646
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
They said, give this to the gingerbread lady for a little sugar.

647
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Santa's secretary, there's no card involved.

648
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
You just go up there and everyone like one person in their party.

649
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
And I guess if you've got a two person party, one person gets their butt spanked.

650
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
If you've got a six person party, one person gets their butt spanked.

651
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
That's what it seems to be the rule is.

652
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
The thing I will say in your defense, Scott, before we get to the gingerbread lady is

653
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I was shocked that she had not dealt with someone else asking before.

654
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Like didn't you expect there to be either she's like, sorry, we can only do one.

655
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
That's just the rule.

656
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Or either she has that set up or she's like has a little playful banter

657
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
because she's encountered this before where maybe there's like kind of a Randy party,

658
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
a bachelorette party where everyone wants to get their butt spanked.

659
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
You know what I mean?

660
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Like I was just surprised that she seemed like completely like baffled by the request.

661
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Could it have been?

662
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Yes.

663
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
But maybe it was her first night as Santa's secretary.

664
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I guess that's a possibility.

665
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
It could have been night one and maybe we could have been an early group.

666
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Like maybe the Santa's secretary had to go.

667
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Right.

668
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
And they got a new Santa's secretary.

669
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Right.

670
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
So she was the understudy.

671
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Well, so here's the other bit of awkwardness and that I not just you,

672
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
but I also felt in the aftermath was when we got to the stage show,

673
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Santa's secretary is a singer in the show.

674
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
And so like when we had this interaction earlier, I was like, oh, well, she's like a dominatrix.

675
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
This is like her thing.

676
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
But now I'm like, wait, no, she's a singer.

677
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
And they say like, hey, also you have to spank people's butts as they come into the theater.

678
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Yeah.

679
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
That was really strange.

680
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I got mortified when I realized these were like talented performers.

681
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,000
We'd all had these little intimate moments with people who'd like display their talents on a stage later.

682
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
No, just just like skin crawling, all of it.

683
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
And yes, how like this is the first time this has ever come up.

684
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
And the biggest problem, maybe not the biggest problem,

685
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
but you would expect a problem to be like a guy getting a little too like, oh, hey, you know,

686
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
that's it's making my candy cane grow a little bit.

687
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I would expect like a little comments like that.

688
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Not that the biggest problem you encounter is ignoring invisible protocols.

689
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I didn't see any signs about this.

690
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I'm a good boy.

691
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I would never have broken such a rule.

692
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I just thought it'd be funny to have a little video.

693
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
That's the problem, though.

694
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
She noticed that you and I were too good.

695
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
That might have been it.

696
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
We weren't naughty enough.

697
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Oh, she knew we belonged on the nice list.

698
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Yes, yes.

699
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,000
The biggest sin was pretending that we are naughty

700
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
when we are so clearly visibly nice.

701
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Right.

702
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:08,000
She would have been like, assume the Amazon position, Mr. Sheridan.

703
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Prone bone at once.

704
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Yeah, yeah.

705
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
It just didn't make sense to hit us.

706
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
There was no reason for it.

707
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Should we move into to the gingerbread lady?

708
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Yes.

709
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
So we're there.

710
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
And that that itself is kind of like an antechamber because we go into another room

711
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
where there's like a bunch of these experiences.

712
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
And I think the first I believe the first one was the gingerbread lady.

713
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Yes.

714
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Oh, OK.

715
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Yes.

716
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Yeah, yeah.

717
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
And it was that beginning of the question of like, oh, is this one of the oh, this is one of the things.

718
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
And there's oh, wait.

719
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
So not every card is the gingerbread lady.

720
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Like people have different cards for different things.

721
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
You don't get to talk to everybody.

722
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
So we're like figuring out this product, which it's kind of fun to like figure out a little system,

723
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:53,000
especially while little cocktails kicking in good cocktails that really like it onboarded me really fast.

724
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
So I was enjoying what I was drinking.

725
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,000
But then I didn't realize that, you know, well, first of all, I was given the job of keeping the card.

726
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
The card says, present this card to the gingerbread lady to get some sugar.

727
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
And and then I lost the card.

728
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I was given one job.

729
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:17,000
First, I fucked up the situation with the secretary and then I didn't do my one single job.

730
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
So I'm feeling very humiliated by this point.

731
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
But then thankfully, the gingerbread lady was very nice.

732
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:29,000
She was willing to break little protocols and she let me still come and sit in her gingerbread throne.

733
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I went behind a velvet rope.

734
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
It was all it was all big thing.

735
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
And I felt bad that it became me just by virtue of that.

736
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I was the one who got the card.

737
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I think everybody would have enjoyed this experience.

738
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,000
But but only I got it and I didn't deserve it after, you know, everything I'd done.

739
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:58,000
But so I sit in the in the gingerbread throne and then she puts the lolly a big lollipop in front between us and the guests.

740
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
So you guys can't see what I'm doing.

741
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Yeah, maybe like implying like, oh, what's going on back there?

742
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Is he getting a little smooch?

743
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,000
And I'm I'm feeling awkwardness back there because I'm like, what is this turning into?

744
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
It said get some sugar.

745
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Is this going to am I supposed to kiss this woman?

746
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I can't imagine it's that I like I'm not going to make the first move here.

747
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Absolutely not.

748
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
But is but is is she going to is that part of her kiss?

749
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I didn't try to kiss this woman after forcing Santa's secretary to pound your butt.

750
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:34,000
This would be my last episode of the show, Santa's Secret, the episode where Scott is canceled.

751
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:44,000
In reality, you were hidden by a big lolly and transported to a world beyond pleasure and pain.

752
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I got to do it.

753
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
It's the move that Jason uses to get away with everything.

754
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Just hide behind a big lolly.

755
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:58,000
But no, thankfully, all that was happening back there was she did get right in my face and I'm like, oh, what is this?

756
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:04,000
And then it and then it just becomes she is whispering to me, do you like it sweet or spicy?

757
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,000
And I took I took a swing and I said spicy.

758
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:19,000
And then she produces a bottle of fireball or some facsimile like a Jack Daniels, you know, spiced cinnamon spiced equivalent.

759
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Now, this is a kind of alcohol that I typically despise, but I'm in the spirit.

760
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I was I'm I'm all for it at this point.

761
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I'm on the gingerbread throne.

762
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Cannot wait.

763
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
And she pours it into my mouth.

764
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Now, granted, with enough distance like that was that was a good pour.

765
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:39,000
It was a good couple inches and it landed perfectly in my mouth to where I don't think that's what made me sick.

766
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:45,000
But it did remind me of like accepting the chalice of wine and church where like there did feel like germ risks there.

767
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Right.

768
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
So if you hear my slightly hoarse voice, I don't know, could have been from fireball.

769
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Was it worth it?

770
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I say yes.

771
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
This was a delightful.

772
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I'm glad I said spicy.

773
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
And boy, did it all get me in the mood for for a hell of a show.

774
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
The fireball whiskey killed any surface germs on that bottle.

775
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Had to have.

776
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Yeah, that couldn't be.

777
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
It's it's whatever you got.

778
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
It's it was airborne.

779
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
That's what I think.

780
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Do you have any sense of whether it was what what what the liquor would have been if you'd said sweet?

781
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Yeah.

782
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Do you see another bottle?

783
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Oh, I don't know.

784
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
But you know what?

785
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I'm glad I'm glad that I guessed because if we're talking the genre of like holiday liquor, like if it had been some peppermint thing, I think I would have been very unhappy.

786
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I would have loved would have loved a quart of rum chata poured down Scott's throat.

787
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Give me a story.

788
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Scott had to go to the hospital.

789
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
He ingested a pint of rum chata.

790
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Well, you know, we were right next to Cedar Sinai, so it would have been the place to do it.

791
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Great facility.

792
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Really world class.

793
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Well, yes, they do great work over there.

794
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I've done better than Santa's workshop.

795
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Well, that's I mean, that's kind of the end of my experience.

796
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
And I won't make you guys be on speakerphone any longer.

797
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I do.

798
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:14,000
And but I and I don't want to jump around too much, but I wanted to get just a few more just just quick hits in before I jump off.

799
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
And I'm sure you'll get to some of this or maybe already have.

800
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:23,000
But I wanted to say, I think this experience convinced me that the Beverly Center is the worst place in Los Angeles.

801
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Okay, great.

802
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
You've covered this.

803
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I mean, how do we not?

804
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I mean, we might get we might get into it in more depth in a bit.

805
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:38,000
But I would just say, like, well, while you're here, maybe we can talk about our post-show odyssey of trying to get into Lucky Strike.

806
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:50,000
And how that involved exiting the Beverly Center and then reentering the Beverly Center, I think twice before we took our way all the way up to the was it the do we ever go up into the fourth floor and then go back to the lobby level?

807
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Is that what their solution was? Yeah.

808
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Yeah, I think so.

809
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Yes.

810
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I know.

811
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
And so this is like like this is us we're talking about.

812
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:03,000
We're all kind of mall aficionados, specifically mall parking garage aficionados.

813
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
This is the group.

814
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Yes.

815
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Let's crack this situation.

816
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
And yet we were all completely flummoxed.

817
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Yeah, like because the show gets out and we're still feeling a little charged up from it.

818
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
What do we do?

819
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Let's go like let's go play arcade games or something.

820
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Because we are on the way in.

821
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:29,000
We saw the ground floor, like most featured on Los Cienega arcade facility.

822
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Like so we all knew it was there.

823
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
So let's let's let's jump over there.

824
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Let's have some fun.

825
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Let's go outside the Beverly Center onto the street to the corner where we all saw it and know it existed.

826
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
And then there's no door.

827
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
There was no door to the place that's facing the street.

828
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
This is the most pedestrian unfriendly thing I've ever seen.

829
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Here's how much the Beverly Center sucks.

830
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Eva was like, oh, is the P.F. Chang's still there?

831
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
We should go check out the P.F. Chang's.

832
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
And we went over to where the P.F. Chang's was and it was now an escalator.

833
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Yeah, bizarre.

834
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:14,000
And then like we by the way, I checked the website of like what what they say about how you get there.

835
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
And it does kind of confirm that like there isn't an entrance from the street.

836
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
There's one from deeper into the parking garage and like the valet.

837
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
But we sure didn't see that.

838
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I'm also seeing that I believe that Lucky Strike is officially open today as we're recording this.

839
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
That is a brand new thing.

840
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Oh, wow.

841
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Which didn't really read to me.

842
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I'm getting this news right now for the first time.

843
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:44,000
And but didn't it like I felt it felt to me like kind of a rundown.

844
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I was like we're walking around like this old place ain't doing so hot.

845
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
It's new. It's new today.

846
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Yeah, it had already had the feel of an off strip casino.

847
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Oh, very much so.

848
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:02,000
The sad little like fake food truck that you got to order for nothing better than a fake indoor food truck.

849
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
What's more fun than that?

850
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I really dislike a place where it's like, hey, this is you're going to go you're going to go sit down.

851
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
It's like it's got like the the the aesthetics of a sit down restaurant.

852
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
But there's like a counter where you put your whole order in.

853
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Like it's just like like like for certain for certain concepts, that's fine for like a pizza concept or something like that's fine.

854
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:29,000
But for this sort of place or it's like I want to just hang out at a booth or sit in the sit at the at a lane and be ordering food from a server.

855
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Yeah, they got a lot of problems to work out already.

856
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I think for that spot a lot, including the bizarre because we couldn't get inside.

857
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
So we were stuck on the outside.

858
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:44,000
So we're staring at these like 1920s movie posters that are all the most A.I.

859
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:51,000
made garbage like where they're just missing letters and it's all fake movies and fake movie stars.

860
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Just like absolute horse shit.

861
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Because is that what Lucky Strike is going for?

862
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
They're trying to do like a flapper sort of thing.

863
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
They're trying to do like like a Gatsby sort of vibe.

864
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I think that's for Hollywood.

865
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I bet that's exclusive to Hollywood.

866
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
OK, so there is that because that all the posters.

867
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Yeah, they were like they were like fake, like, you know, you know, 1930s gangster and Hollywood sort of movies.

868
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:21,000
And yeah, but I was just like, why is this not, you know, like a bowling lane or something?

869
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Like, why is this nothing that evokes bowling?

870
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

871
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I just I completely did not understand what that was doing there.

872
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
But yeah, they also just look so bad.

873
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
And they look like shit.

874
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Like they had one guy and they weren't really paying attention to what he was doing.

875
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
So we just did all everything through chat GBT.

876
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

877
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
We probably didn't tell them they weren't paying attention.

878
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Like, oh, yeah, no, I can do that in a couple of days.

879
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
No problem. Just straight to A.I.

880
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I'm easy as check.

881
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
He ever got. Yeah.

882
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
No garbage.

883
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
And then it put us in a bad mood.

884
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Like we we eventually made our way in just to say that we did just to like feel pride as adults that we cracked the code.

885
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:05,000
But the whole experience is so frustrating that we ended up giving them zero dollars because like it was just so confounding.

886
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,000
And we were so mad about the posters and the lack of street access.

887
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Just a very strange experience.

888
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:16,000
There's one more little negative thing that I will say on the way out the door.

889
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
And mostly I would say positive things.

890
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
And I'm curious what you guys will say when I listen to this back later.

891
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,000
One downside, though, those mini beef Wellingtons didn't do it for me.

892
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Those were kind of gut bombs.

893
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Like I felt a little shitty the next day and I could like I like honed in on that.

894
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Like error error found like that was the thing the thing in my stomach that pushed it over to not the best night.

895
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
So I don't know if anybody sees this.

896
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Avoid those.

897
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I'll take the L for advocating for the mini beef Wellingtons.

898
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:54,000
But also I knew what I was doing because I was like everything else that we've ordered is something like spinach artichoke dip or like a pretzel twist.

899
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
This is all conventional stuff.

900
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
We got to get one of the weird things that they have there.

901
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:07,000
And the options were either the mini beef Wellington or the ninety five dollar Ocetra caviar service as Jesus.

902
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Yeah. So it's like let's not get the caviar.

903
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Let's get the let's get the beef Wellingtons.

904
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
They did suck. They were awful. They made me feel like shit.

905
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Did they to you, too? Am I not alone in that?

906
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
I didn't like the taste of them, but I was fine the next day.

907
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,000
I mean, that's why you and I punish our stomachs more regularly than you do, though.

908
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
So you probably just couldn't handle it.

909
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:35,000
And Jason would Jason, I think, would have not only survived them, but like saved them for later and said they were better four days from now.

910
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Well, sure. I would have just gotten a doggy bag and wheeled over to Cedars and I would have been all door dashing in order of mini beef Wellington.

911
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Put it in a blender and put it in the IV bags and just drip it right into your veins.

912
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Well, thank you for letting me get those thoughts out.

913
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:12,000
The food wasn't particularly good. The food was not as good as the jokes, I would say.

914
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
No, no, no, no. And I'm excited. I hope that this episode takes a positive turn.

915
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I hope that the correct praise is given to various aspects of this, or at least that you were like you enjoyed being flummoxed by it as I was.

916
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I have been unable to even though I liked it, I've been unable to produce one fact about this that made my wife, Erin, understand why I liked it.

917
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I've not like there hasn't been one thing I've said where she went, oh, that sounds fun.

918
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
And yet somehow I did still I did still enjoy it.

919
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:45,000
So curious what you guys think. Excited to listen back later and I'll jump off.

920
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
But I will also say I'll see everybody soon.

921
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:55,000
And Mike and Jason, you guys get your little butts ready because I'm going through my naughty list on that Club 3 episode.

922
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:03,000
So get in get in get in prone bone position because whip whip boys.

923
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Well, while we're on that topic, Scott, I mean, I did want to talk about the Amex trifecta, which I think we didn't really get into on the club.

924
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Oh, what's that? I think you guys are you guys are coming out.

925
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I'm not hearing you so good. All right.

926
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
I was too bad. Reception is ruining this whole thing. It's all been going great.

927
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
All right. I will have fun, everybody.

928
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Merry Christmas. I'll talk to you soon. Bye, Scott.

929
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Feel better, buddy. All right.

930
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
All right. Thanks. See you.

931
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
So after the gingerbread lady, there's just like a few different characters.

932
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I think we probably speed through this because we didn't have a ticket for any of the rest of them.

933
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,000
And we didn't realize that these were all like ticketed experiences.

934
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
So there was there was a toy soldier, hunk toy soldier or no, the nutcracker.

935
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,000
It was the nutcracker specifically, hunk nutcracker, a hunk nutcracker.

936
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:56,000
There was a there was a oh, she was she was the snow angel.

937
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
She was supposed to be like a sexy Christmas topper, right? Yes.

938
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Christmas tree topper. There was her.

939
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Christmas topper is another thing that Jason talks about.

940
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Well, yes, she was supposed to be like, yeah, the thing, the nice angel you see at the top of the tree.

941
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,000
And, you know, very like the wardrobe was all really good.

942
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,000
I mean, that's the thing you get to get with an L.A. sort of production is like, oh, there's really talented like,

943
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,000
you know, costumers in this town who just like, oh, yeah, I'll take a job at Santa's Secret.

944
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
And so all that stuff looked great. Then then there was the ice queen, right?

945
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,000
That's who the ice queen ended up being the emcee of the show, who is a drag queen.

946
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Yes. And again, all these experiences were like you had to have a ticket to go up

947
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
to do whatever the equivalent of the fireball whiskey shot was with them.

948
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Right. The one thing I will say is I wish someone had told us going in like, hey, you only get one of these.

949
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
And I also kind of wish even if we didn't know exactly what we're getting, we got to choose.

950
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Yes, I agree. If they were like, hey, do you want the gingerbread lady? Do you want the nutcracker?

951
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Well, what's what is each experience like? Well, I can't tell you.

952
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,000
It's like, OK. I mean, like you at least feel like you had some like choice in what you were what you're receiving.

953
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Yes, I agree. It was just kind of granted to us.

954
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Oh, and then there was also the photo op with the hunky Santa where we get to sit on Santa's lap.

955
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
So, yes, there's this there's a big kind of a big ish room.

956
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,000
It's a pretty big room where there's a hunky guy.

957
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:26,000
He's got just like little Santa shorts on Santa hat boots and then like fluffy cuffs.

958
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Yeah, no beer. Yeah, no beer.

959
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
But like, you know, beard like mine. Yeah, I'm not trying to say I'm like this hunky guy.

960
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
I'm just saying beard similar to mine. Yeah.

961
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Probably 10 years younger than me. Let's be honest.

962
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:46,000
And then next to him, there's a sign that says come salivate on me.

963
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
That looks like a Salvation Army sign. Yeah, that's fun.

964
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:54,000
And it says doing the most good and then good is crossed out.

965
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,000
OK, so now we're real. Now we're really in naughty territory. Yes.

966
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Here. So at this point, I wasn't sure what we were supposed to do.

967
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:07,000
But then they even I gave my phone to the person to take a photo.

968
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Eva ended up getting a solo photo with Donkey Santa,

969
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
which is great because she like has like a like she looks sad in the photo.

970
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:20,000
She looks upset. So she looks like a sad woman who went to this experience by herself.

971
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:25,000
She's staring nowhere with kind of a neutral face. Yeah.

972
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
But then sorry, just real quick, can you go back?

973
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Can I get a spelling on that? Come salivate me. Is it a question?

974
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:39,000
C.O.M.E. You wanted to see you missed opportunity.

975
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,000
But isn't that a hat on a hat at that point?

976
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I guess this salivate is already unusual. Maybe it's gilding the lily.

977
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:55,000
So then here here is everyone sitting on this like 30 year old hunky Santa's lap on his big throne.

978
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
We did get a photo with all four of us with hunky Santa.

979
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Unfortunately, his physique is covered up because we're all like, you know, crowding him.

980
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Weiger and I both said this independently of each other.

981
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
We're like, but now you can't see how jacked Santa is.

982
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
I wish we were seeing more hunky Santa.

983
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:15,000
But I will say hunky Santa is an experience the Beverly Center has had or used to have back in the day.

984
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:22,000
And I'm not sure if Santa's Secret is like kind of like the, you know, the successor to that.

985
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
If they were kind of like, oh, well, we had hunky Santa.

986
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
I guess Santa's Secret is a natural fit for it.

987
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
But there is precedent for Santa for a hunky Santa there.

988
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Was he shirtless? Have you ever?

989
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Yeah, it was like it was like a it was like a it was like for mom and dad.

990
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
There was a hunky Santa and then there was a conventional Santa for the kids.

991
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Well, was it they were not next to each other?

992
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
No, they were in their separate parts of the mall.

993
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
And I think it was even it was maybe even separate times.

994
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Yeah. But yeah, so like the that's a thing they had like a decade plus ago.

995
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:58,000
And the one thing I will say is that this this this actor, I said, I said, you're looking very hunky Santa.

996
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

997
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,000
He had a canned line for me, which I liked, which is like, thanks, but laying off the cookies.

998
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
And he kind of patted his abs. Solid.

999
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
It's pretty good. Really good.

1000
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,000
You know, he said that 30 times.

1001
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
It was a good line. You should use it. Yeah.

1002
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,000
You ever use stuff? I'll text the same joke to three different text chains on my phone once in a while.

1003
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Yeah, of course.

1004
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:26,000
So at that point, I'm really looking around for like little like little horny stuff.

1005
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,000
And then again, I don't know if I just I'm seeing things where they don't belong.

1006
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:38,000
But then there's this like picture or excuse me, this statue of Santa and one of his reindeer that looks kind of vaguely sexual to me.

1007
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:47,000
I think they were starting to even if they weren't like already sexy, you know, statues or animatronics, they were like they reached a certain point.

1008
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
They were like, we can kind of pose these in a lecherous sort of way.

1009
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Yeah, it's definitely a come hither look. You sent me that photo with no contacts.

1010
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Yeah. Well, you knew where we were. I knew where you were.

1011
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
So it's not like out of nowhere.

1012
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,000
You're like, why is this statue of Santa and Rudolph looking at each other longing?

1013
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Yeah. Oh, wait, I'm really we missed one thing.

1014
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,000
This is one of the few times that I was scandalized, which is speaking of Rudolph.

1015
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Yeah, there was a Rudolph performer, a woman with a with a red nose, but she also had like lines of cocaine.

1016
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Yes. And she was like, kind of like, oh, but that's why my nose is red or whatever.

1017
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Right. And I was like, I think that's like too far.

1018
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
I think Rudolph should be doing cocaine. And also, this is like a horny like body thing.

1019
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
I don't think we need to bring hard drugs into it. Yeah.

1020
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
But it wouldn't be the last hard drug reference of the night. That's true.

1021
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Because the hard drugs was a theme of the whole show.

1022
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Yeah, I would have thought it would have been I would have thought a bit more like I mean, I guess people have sex on cocaine, but it would be more like ecstasy.

1023
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Yeah, sure. Rudolph was on ecstasy and he wants you to pet him.

1024
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
He just wants you to put your hand through his fur.

1025
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Like that would have made more sense to me versus cocaine.

1026
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:11,000
But I guess cocaine is just an easier reference for, I don't know, everybody to understand what it is.

1027
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Or they just had it.

1028
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:18,000
What's funny about all what's funny about all of these interactions is, you know, we've done some of that horror.

1029
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:24,000
We've done horror nights. We've done delusions, stuff like that, where performers are fully in character.

1030
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Everyone here felt like they were half out of character.

1031
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
A lot of them were not full committed at all.

1032
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:39,000
So when you would like look them in the eye and they would deliver their line about, I'm Rudolph and I'm doing cocaine, you would see a performer inside going, help me, help me.

1033
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I don't want to just move along, please.

1034
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Like I feel like everyone's eyes was just like, please move along.

1035
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I want to do my like talent in the show.

1036
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Yeah, when you get when we later got that, like, oh, these are all the performers who are in the burlesque review, then it was like, oh, I think this was like an ad like an added thing that none of them were super into.

1037
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Yeah, yes.

1038
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,000
They're all like, oh, I have to do this pre show meet and greet with basically like I'm a dancer.

1039
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
This isn't my thing is in my comfort level.

1040
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Right. So like I felt like not that I'm not that I'm always wanting to talk to somebody in character, not that that's the number one thing I like, but it definitely felt like, OK, you we made eye contact.

1041
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Keep moving.

1042
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Keep going to the next person.

1043
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Yeah.

1044
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
But everyone was good.

1045
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Everyone did their job.

1046
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
I just they weren't 100 percent.

1047
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
They weren't committed.

1048
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Maybe the gingerbread lady.

1049
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
I felt it was the most gingerbread lady was pretty locked in.

1050
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,000
It felt like the snow angel was kind of like, you know, maybe just by via presence.

1051
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
She had a presence for sure.

1052
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Yeah. But the nutcracker who had a great act in the show.

1053
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:49,000
But the nutcracker, I think I was I think I was like, oh, what's you know, like I just tried to send something Christmassy to him is like, oh, what's what's the occasion or whatever?

1054
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:55,000
And I think he just said, I'm the nutcracker.

1055
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:01,000
It's a ring toss game.

1056
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Yeah. So so that lasted what?

1057
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
I felt like 10 minutes.

1058
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Yeah, it was pretty substantial.

1059
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
There's a lot of there's a pretty lengthy walkthrough, a lot to look at.

1060
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Yeah. So so that in and of itself, I was like, oh, that's pretty good.

1061
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
The production value is pretty high for this.

1062
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:23,000
And I was trying to I was also like, is there another like did they repurpose this during the day for something like I just it felt right.

1063
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
It felt I didn't expect it, I guess.

1064
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
So but I think it's all just for that.

1065
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:34,000
And they I'm assuming they just bought off the shelf all these different like little elf like robots and statues.

1066
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Yeah, I assume so.

1067
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Yeah, because they were cute.

1068
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
They weren't that scary.

1069
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,000
So so that part was really it was really fun and unexpected.

1070
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
I really like the pre show.

1071
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:54,000
So we go in, we go through this whole thing, and then we go into a nightclub that's been set up and we're ushered to our table.

1072
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:03,000
And the next hour basically of the night is like a an 80s cover band.

1073
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Like it's like it's like a good it's like a good like they're good studio musicians and a good singer.

1074
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:15,000
But like we're basically just just watching them, you know, sing like, oh, I want to dance with somebody or, you know, yes.

1075
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Basically, like, you know, the show, I don't remember at this point, but like so the show over the show was at six then the ticket.

1076
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Right.

1077
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,000
But from six, I believe, to seven is people fill into the actual room.

1078
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
There's just an hour of covers, not Christmas songs.

1079
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
No, no Christmas music at all.

1080
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Okay.

1081
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Just covers.

1082
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
And again, the singer fantastic.

1083
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
The band sounded great.

1084
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
But yes, not a Christmas song to be found.

1085
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
No, they're doing Michael Jackson's Pretty Young Thing.

1086
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Yes.

1087
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
And people are loving it.

1088
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
I will say like the crowd was was really into it.

1089
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Yeah. So they sounded good.

1090
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
So that was fine.

1091
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,000
It just it was a little because I guess maybe you don't want to step on the toes of the Christmas music in the next hour.

1092
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
I suppose so much Christmas.

1093
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Yeah, it's true thing.

1094
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:01,000
It's like it's like, yeah, I know they were using and they also weren't just using Christmas songs for the acts.

1095
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
A lot of them had different songs, too.

1096
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,000
So I wonder about because I would like to be more Christmasy.

1097
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Maybe even just like one out of every three songs is like, you know, the company that puts this on is called Voss Events.

1098
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,000
OK, which sounds like the evil corporation from the show, The Boys.

1099
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:24,000
But this company puts on just a lot of like drag show, RuPaul's Drag Race Live or whatever.

1100
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,000
I wonder if this band isn't from another part, another show.

1101
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
And they're just like, you don't have to learn.

1102
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Just this is for warm up.

1103
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Just do your standard set, whatever.

1104
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Just get the energy up.

1105
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Yeah, I wonder if that's something from another part of the touring thing.

1106
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Yeah, that would totally apparatus.

1107
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
That would totally it totally makes sense.

1108
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:53,000
By the way, speaking of Drag Race, I looked up the the emcee, the drag queen afterwards, who was on RuPaul's Drag Race, a very, very well known drag queen, Lawrence Cheney.

1109
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Yeah.

1110
00:58:54,000 --> 00:59:00,000
And then, yes, RuPaul's Drag Race Live, I guess that's they were on the live tour.

1111
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:05,000
There's many different credits on this Instagram, but was very good, very good host.

1112
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Yeah, they're good.

1113
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
So, yeah.

1114
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,000
So I guess about eight o'clock is when or no, seven o'clock is when the actual show.

1115
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Right.

1116
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Started the part of Santa's Secret.

1117
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
And again, we're talking amongst ourselves.

1118
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Are we going to learn Santa's Secret?

1119
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Like that was a big thing.

1120
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
This is the thing we've been anticipating the whole time.

1121
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Are we going to learn Santa's Secret?

1122
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:28,000
By this point, I've made peace with like we're not going to learn Santa's Secret or Santa's Secret is just like an abstract concept.

1123
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
This is haunting you.

1124
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
We're just thinking about it.

1125
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Well, because also we've been talking about this for a year.

1126
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Like, what is Santa's Secret that he can't tell Mrs. Claus?

1127
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Yes.

1128
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
And during the year, they've changed it.

1129
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
It was like, oh, what's St. Patrick's Secret?

1130
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
They did.

1131
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Yeah, they had Uncle Sam's Secret.

1132
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Another seasonal one.

1133
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Well, that's just a handful of coup d'etat.

1134
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,000
You know, it's not even that interesting.

1135
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Yeah, yeah, we all know.

1136
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,000
So, yeah, we're kind of we're chatting it up.

1137
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
I forget.

1138
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Eva said, I think her husband made some joke that felt like Santa's Secret is that it was like a standby me thing or like they saw a guy get killed.

1139
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Santa saw a guy get killed and he has to keep quiet about it.

1140
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
I was like, oh, yeah, I guess that could be it.

1141
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:15,000
But yeah, we really to lower our expectations said, I don't think it's going to be a real secret.

1142
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
It's just going to be a show or whatever.

1143
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:21,000
And then the emcee Lawrence Cheney, right?

1144
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Correct. Yes.

1145
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Gets out there and in character as the it's the ice queen, right?

1146
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
I mean, it was ice.

1147
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Yes.

1148
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
In character is the ice queen.

1149
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:38,000
And I think one of the first bits of copy, they say, is tonight you will learn Santa's secret.

1150
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
And we go nuts.

1151
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:48,000
We just go fucking crazy.

1152
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Like you're going to learn the meaning of life tonight.

1153
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Yeah, I was thrilled.

1154
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
But but here's the thing.

1155
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Santa's secret is not a secret.

1156
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:04,000
It's a series of secret series of secrets that are unveiled one by one.

1157
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Yes.

1158
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:11,000
So that yes, this is like all of all of the skeletons in Santa's closet, all of his dirty laundry.

1159
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Yes.

1160
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:17,000
So now we are going to learn the secret and there are many secrets to learn.

1161
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Yes. So imagine our delight to hear this.

1162
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,000
And I don't think the secrets disappointed, quite frankly.

1163
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
They don't.

1164
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:31,000
But I will say that there was a little bit of narrative confusion and it could have used some structure and clarity because.

1165
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:36,000
So just to skip ahead a little point a little bit, there was another table that was next to us.

1166
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:41,000
And I think like us, the woman there was tracking the secrets.

1167
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:45,000
So a few secrets are dispelled at a certain point.

1168
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:51,000
The the emcee says, now time for Santa's secret number four.

1169
01:01:51,000 --> 01:02:01,000
And the woman turns to us confused, like four, because I think at this point we'd only learned like one or two secrets or or like what was clearly a Santa secret.

1170
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:05,000
But I guess some other bit of information that was dispensed to us was in fact a secret.

1171
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Yes. Just another podcaster, just Jamie Loftus at the other table like, hey, can we compare notes?

1172
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:17,000
I think I missed something.

1173
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Weiger, you haven't worked as a television writer in a few years at this point.

1174
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:30,000
But is this sort of you kind of informally saying you would kind of go back to the job if you could be showrunner of Santa's secret next year?

1175
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,000
I would love, look, I would love to just just make a few tweaks.

1176
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,000
I think it was as simple as up top they're like, you're going to learn Santa's secrets.

1177
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Each act will tell you a new secret about Santa.

1178
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:51,000
You know, like then it'd be like, oh, OK, because it took me a minute to lock into that even that each of these acts was was like, hey, this is what was the was the emcee's act first.

1179
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Was it the first one that was up?

1180
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Yes, I believe so.

1181
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:09,000
So the ice queen is like the Santa's first secret is that Mrs. Claus had an affair.

1182
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Mrs. Claus is not Santa's first wife.

1183
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Yeah, Mrs. Claus is not Santa's first wife.

1184
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
It was me, right?

1185
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Yes. Yes.

1186
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
That's what it was. Yeah.

1187
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Right. And then they made Santa divorce a drag queen, basically.

1188
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Right.

1189
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,000
So so we're going through a few different like it's it's pretty complicated.

1190
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:32,000
But basically, like she would like like the like the the drag queen was Santa's original wife.

1191
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
That was it was an untoward marriage.

1192
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:39,000
The North Pole, you know, power brokers would not allow it.

1193
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:43,000
And then they also had an affair with Frosty.

1194
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,000
But was that I don't think that was the reason for the divorce.

1195
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
That was just another thing.

1196
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,000
And then that led to Frosty being melted.

1197
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,000
And there was a gag holding up a plastic bag of water that said Frosty on it.

1198
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Yeah.

1199
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:04,000
But then that led into an act where the ice queen was it was a was there was there a frosty?

1200
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Because I know a carrot got involved.

1201
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,000
It was a frosty, right? A frosty getting melted.

1202
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Yeah, I think later during the musical numbers, what is your remembering?

1203
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Yes, because they were like jerking the carrot off.

1204
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
They were jerking the carrot off, which was fun.

1205
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Yeah.

1206
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
You were like just basically like slow down.

1207
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
There was too much.

1208
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Let's make a meal out of all of this.

1209
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
OK.

1210
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:31,000
You know, that's why you got to have a good producer, good director, good stage manager.

1211
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:37,000
And you got to review like, you know, we have everything we need, but does this make sense?

1212
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Should we start cutting?

1213
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Should we start simplifying?

1214
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Simplify 100 percent.

1215
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
I think that would have gone a long way.

1216
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Anyway, that did lead to the thing that made me like laugh so hard, which was I mean,

1217
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:55,000
I mean, the ice queen was was a was a very funny performer, but but was it reached a certain height

1218
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:00,000
into a certain point where they were jacking off like the carrot, like it was, you know,

1219
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
like a dick and fighting the carrot.

1220
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,000
And then the music, which I don't remember what track it was.

1221
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Oh, that's a good question. I don't.

1222
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
It might have been like it might have just been like Frosty the Snowman or whatever,

1223
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,000
but like Frosty the Snowman had a and then it cuts out.

1224
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Oh, yes. Yeah.

1225
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
And played Hawk Tuah.

1226
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Just went Hawk Tuah, the actual audio clip from the viral video.

1227
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
I just feel like the house would go nuts.

1228
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
People loved it.

1229
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
It was that is legit.

1230
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Like, you know, some of this stuff you can enjoy kind of ironically.

1231
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
I'll say there's no irony in that.

1232
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
I was laughing so hard.

1233
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Really, really funny.

1234
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
And really well timed.

1235
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Almost one of the maybe the funniest things of the whole show.

1236
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
It was great.

1237
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,000
And then, yeah, and then that also led into a grape fruiting thing that using using that

1238
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
that video audio.

1239
01:05:54,000 --> 01:06:00,000
And then it heightened to the carrot tip exploding with a load of bubbles over.

1240
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Yeah.

1241
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
So the carrot tip came, Jason.

1242
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
OK. Yeah.

1243
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Are you guys getting to I don't want to spoil anything.

1244
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,000
I saw a shot of a giant champagne glass.

1245
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Yeah, there was something like that.

1246
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Well, here's the thing.

1247
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:21,000
So some of those I think some of those those elements were not as forward in the L.A.

1248
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
show. OK.

1249
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Yeah, because I I feel like you would have jumped at this because watching this clip,

1250
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
I had to rewind it.

1251
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:34,000
I'm like, I can't be seeing that right because there was a giant champagne glass that someone

1252
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:40,000
was splashing around in and the white cloudy liquid they were splashing in.

1253
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:45,000
And I'm like, look, I don't want to just talk about cum just because why?

1254
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Right. Right. Right.

1255
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:53,000
But it's because the I was like trying to figure out like what besides rum,

1256
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Chata, would you imagine?

1257
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
I guess eggnog.

1258
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Eggnog looks like cum.

1259
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
It's definitely meant to be like a double on top.

1260
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Yeah.

1261
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Yeah. Or I guess melted frosty could be a little cloudy.

1262
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Oh, his melted frosty.

1263
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
The snowman.

1264
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,000
I don't really I don't think they had the what you're talking about.

1265
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,000
I don't think they had someone in a big glass full of eggnog rolling rolling around.

1266
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
I don't think I guess I guess not.

1267
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,000
I feel like we I unfortunately it's since closed.

1268
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:30,000
But Pennsylvania in the Poconos there was like I don't even know what you would call it.

1269
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:37,000
A love, an American love hotel, like a romantic retreat for couples.

1270
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:41,000
And there was a hot tub in a giant champagne glass.

1271
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Really?

1272
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Two stories sweet.

1273
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:48,000
And you would get in upstairs and the stock would go to the bottom on the floor.

1274
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:57,000
And there are a lot of photos from the 1980s of like loving couples sharing champagne in the giant champagne flute hot tub.

1275
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:03,000
But with regular water, not with with regular water and maybe some soap bubbles.

1276
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:08,000
And it's closed now closed like it's been condemned six months ago, a year ago.

1277
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Like because everyone's like, oh, maybe it'll get redone.

1278
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:17,000
It's like what hotel group is going to redo the fuck hotel with the giant champagne glass tub?

1279
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:23,000
If this all goes to shit ever, you could go back and reopen it and just manage that hotel for the rest of your life.

1280
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Oh, sure.

1281
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
It's like a spin off sitcom.

1282
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Like if Niles and Daphne moved and opened a bed of breakfast or something.

1283
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Well, like Newark.

1284
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Yeah, like Newark had the inn, yeah.

1285
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Yeah, you could do that.

1286
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
I think you'd thrive there.

1287
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:41,000
You could just have to polish the big glass after a couple left every day.

1288
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Well, I get a power wash every day.

1289
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Okay.

1290
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Wear a Bess with no shirt and a local sailor cap.

1291
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Oh, that's the worst outfit for the Poconos.

1292
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Jesus, it's so snowy.

1293
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Yeah, so yes, you're right.

1294
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:03,000
They were hitting you with a lot of things, sometimes contradictory as far as maybe logic is concerned.

1295
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,000
So I don't remember what the gingerbread lady's secret was.

1296
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
That was the thing.

1297
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
But gingerbread lady was next, right?

1298
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
I can't remember what the order was.

1299
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Scott was nice and wrote down a lot of the revelations.

1300
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Oh yeah, we had a text thread where Scott and Eva were chronicling the Santa secret sometimes in all caps.

1301
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:35,000
You have some handwritten notes in a field notes that I'm assuming you're throwing at a dumpster so you don't get pulled over with these in your car.

1302
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Yeah, I'm burning this afterwards.

1303
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Just to rest it on principle.

1304
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,000
There's just random things though, like Scott wrote down.

1305
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
There's a man who can handle a big sack.

1306
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,000
And then he wrote Ice Queen and then he wrote Santa doesn't allow sex at the North Pole.

1307
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
And then he wrote not a secret.

1308
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
So that was not an official secret.

1309
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,000
That's just a piece of lore.

1310
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Yeah.

1311
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,000
That was the other bit of confusion.

1312
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:01,000
A Christmas angel sucked too many dicks and Santa threw her on top of the tree.

1313
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Yeah, so that was the snow angels one, right?

1314
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,000
And yeah, I don't remember how we got into the gingerbread lady.

1315
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:11,000
I do remember I was wrong about this, but I thought I knew what was coming.

1316
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Yes, you leaned over.

1317
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:17,000
So the two performers dressed up as like in gingerbread band mascot suits come out

1318
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
and the gingerbread lady comes out in between them.

1319
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
And the song that's playing is Lollipop, right?

1320
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Lollipop, lollipop, lool.

1321
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:30,000
And I leaned over across and I was like, this is going to turn from lollipop into 50 cents candy shop.

1322
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,000
I was so confident that they were going to do that and it was going to get horny.

1323
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:36,000
It's the cockiest and most confident I've ever seen it.

1324
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
I thought I nailed it.

1325
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
I was not right.

1326
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,000
He leaned back, he put his hands behind his head.

1327
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,000
He put his feet up on the table.

1328
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Watch, Junior, he said to me.

1329
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Not what happened.

1330
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
But then the gingerbread lady did do a little.

1331
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
But that's why you should show run Santa's Secret.

1332
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Yeah, I think people would like that.

1333
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Because that would have been good.

1334
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
People would have popped for that.

1335
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,000
I thought you were right too.

1336
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,000
You said it was such confidence and it makes too much sense.

1337
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,000
I go, he's right.

1338
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,000
It's going to be candy shop by 50 cent.

1339
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
But yeah, I don't even remember what the song was.

1340
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
It was not particularly notable.

1341
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Yeah, I don't remember either.

1342
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,000
But yeah, I mean, if Jason was show running, he would have been like a good ship.

1343
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Let's do good ship lollipop next.

1344
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:19,000
You know, I think Wiger and I might have to go in on like directing together.

1345
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Because he can be the more creative director and I can be the producer.

1346
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Like, well, I don't know if the budget will allow or like, is there another way to do this?

1347
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Like, could we move the chairs around to use that or something?

1348
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Oh, you want to make sure you will be the cost cutter?

1349
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Well, no, I don't want to be the bad guy.

1350
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,000
I just we both done a lot of stage sketch comedy.

1351
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Right. Yeah.

1352
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:44,000
And so I think we we and it's always good to have a second set of eyes.

1353
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Yeah, we have the reps to figure out how to make it work.

1354
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Yeah, right.

1355
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Just you would want the lollipops to be bigger every time.

1356
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,000
He would just get candy should be bigger.

1357
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Guys, let's not skimp on this.

1358
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
This isn't reading like eggnog.

1359
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Make it more opaque.

1360
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Jason, that lollipop was pretty big when we gave it to you.

1361
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
You took it backstage.

1362
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Look, I go, I don't know.

1363
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,000
I mean, I don't I was trying to find out if we could find out who writes this.

1364
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
But we I could not.

1365
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Yeah, it was hard to figure out like how credits weren't there.

1366
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Yeah, I think it could have used a little bit.

1367
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
You know what? It's kind of like.

1368
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:27,000
It's like Medieval Times or Pirates Dinner Adventure where you want there to be like just enough where you can track what's going on.

1369
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,000
You know who you're waiting for.

1370
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
And this I thought was just a little convoluted.

1371
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Gingerbread Lady.

1372
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
There was the Snow Queen had had.

1373
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,000
I mean, a lot of these were just like like the same sort of acts.

1374
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,000
It was like pole dancing or trapeze, you know, something that Ariel stuff that's very impressive.

1375
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:49,000
But it's it's also stuff that I think as Scott was saying, it was it was kind of not even all that sexual.

1376
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
You know, it's like it's not like we were like watching you.

1377
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:57,000
You know, I mean, it's like well, you would get you would get like fake out like removal of clothing generally.

1378
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Somebody would remove like the top part of their clothes to reveal a slightly smaller shirt.

1379
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Yeah.

1380
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
And then they would go do a wire act.

1381
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
And again, you could see their stomach.

1382
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Obviously, they're very good shape, but it wasn't something that was so dirty.

1383
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:18,000
There were a couple of things like a man in the chair later and a woman comes up and suggestively dances.

1384
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,000
But it wasn't it wasn't horny.

1385
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
You're like in a different context.

1386
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
This is just this isn't a circus.

1387
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:31,000
But this but this audience of boomers was still getting horny as shit like they were like losing these boomers.

1388
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
They're T levels.

1389
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:37,000
If you were to like take the reading before and after, it would have been a 50 point jump.

1390
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,000
They were all just chugging eugenics beforehand.

1391
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Well, yeah, they're using those like Rudolph Riddos to wash down a tattifil or a sedentifil.

1392
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:55,000
There was a guy there was a guy and I assume his wife or girlfriend and they were in full pajamas.

1393
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
They were wearing pajamas. Yeah.

1394
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Christmas pajamas.

1395
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:01,000
I clocked them while the show was happening, going nuts, putting their arms in the air.

1396
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,000
And then we saw them leaving.

1397
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Yeah.

1398
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
And you just I think to them, you go, hey, great show.

1399
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
And the guy was like, great show.

1400
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Well, they're having a good time.

1401
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Yeah, they were having a great time.

1402
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
And yeah, they were what?

1403
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Ten years older than us.

1404
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Fifteen.

1405
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
I don't know.

1406
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Yeah, I mean, it's certainly certainly a slightly older demographic.

1407
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Everything I do in Los Angeles, I'm still one of the youngest people.

1408
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,000
One hundred percent.

1409
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Me too. Yeah, for sure.

1410
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:26,000
That's more about what I'm doing than it is about the demographics in Los Angeles.

1411
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:33,000
It sounds like when I'm sure I told them before, but when I went to go see Sideways when it came out alone

1412
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:37,000
and I was the youngest person there by like 20 years.

1413
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,000
And then I made the mistake of like, I'll have a healthy snack.

1414
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:46,000
And I brought an apple and I took a bite during the trailers and it was like a gunshot.

1415
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:50,000
And I went, oh, no, I cannot finish this apple.

1416
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
What was I thinking?

1417
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,000
So all the 45 year olds turned around and looked at you.

1418
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:00,000
I feel like I got some looks, but I also was like, maybe there's an action movie trailer.

1419
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,000
I can like crunch during this apple a little.

1420
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
That's why I've done the movie theater apple.

1421
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Yeah, you just have to wait till the sound design really kicks into the score.

1422
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,000
When was the last time both of you had an apple in a movie theater?

1423
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Honestly, pretty recently.

1424
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Really?

1425
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Yeah, pretty recently.

1426
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Here's the thing.

1427
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:26,000
We go to the movies once a week pretty much, but it's kind of like a regular thing.

1428
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:31,000
And if I bring an apple, I won't get nachos.

1429
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:39,000
But I'll still get a big soda, but I won't be getting the empty calories of like a big tray of corn chips and cheese.

1430
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:43,000
It's not every time. It's not a universal thing.

1431
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,000
And honestly, a bar or something is safer, something a little less crunchy.

1432
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Okay, so you want all of it, but with whatever fruit you have in the house.

1433
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Yeah, I'll toss a banana in the bag. Why not?

1434
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Okay. Jason, when was the last time you ate an apple in a theater? Was it sideways?

1435
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,000
That was the last time I ever took one off.

1436
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:06,000
But I went with a friend once and we got like Pan Express or some sort of Chinese food.

1437
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:12,000
And I was like eating really fast. I'm like, oh, we got to get to the movies.

1438
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
And she just, she's like, I know.

1439
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:23,000
And she took the takeout container and just shoved it sideways, shoved it in her purse like upside.

1440
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,000
And I went, geez, that's going to leak.

1441
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:32,000
And she like ate a full like two entrees and noodles like during a movie.

1442
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
I love that.

1443
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
How long ago was that?

1444
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
I was when I was in high school.

1445
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Okay.

1446
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Although we...

1447
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
I went to...

1448
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:43,000
We went, I remember Bundress went to see Bridesmaids when it came out.

1449
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:49,000
We sat down and Anthony Gio went, well, time for my movie sandwich.

1450
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,000
And he pulled out a full subway football.

1451
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Really?

1452
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Yeah.

1453
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,000
He's like, oh, I always get a big sandwich when I go to the movies.

1454
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Oh my God.

1455
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,000
I don't even remember that.

1456
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
We got to ask him about that next time he's on the show.

1457
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,000
I cannot.

1458
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:06,000
It probably lives one of the clearest images I have in my mind.

1459
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,000
I'm going to text him while we're doing this.

1460
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:14,000
I went to see a movie with a friend of ours and she was like, we go to Chipotle before the movie.

1461
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,000
And we sneak in burritos and go see the movie.

1462
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
And I go, oh, okay.

1463
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
And I did it.

1464
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,000
And I've never felt more wrong doing that.

1465
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:26,000
I felt like I was smuggling in like contraband or something.

1466
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,000
And then just the smell of a burrito in the theater.

1467
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,000
I was like, no, I'm never doing this again.

1468
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,000
I think burritos in LA is pretty common.

1469
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Yeah.

1470
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
I think it was the Arclight.

1471
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,000
I was like, ah, this is...

1472
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Remember that Chipotle, right?

1473
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
There's a Chipotle right by there.

1474
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
It did have me thinking we absolutely could have snuck food into this.

1475
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
I think we wouldn't have had any problems with it.

1476
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Yeah.

1477
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,000
We should have snuck apples in because of how loud it was.

1478
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,000
No problem.

1479
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Was there a menu of finger food?

1480
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Yeah.

1481
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,000
That's what we ended up with.

1482
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Sorry.

1483
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Fingering food.

1484
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
All right.

1485
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
You do need Jason on this team if you're going to show run.

1486
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,000
I like it.

1487
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Yeah.

1488
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,000
I think they could have had some double entendres in the menu.

1489
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,000
But there weren't.

1490
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,000
But yeah, that's how we got the mini beef Wellingtons or whatever.

1491
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
That's where that was from.

1492
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Wait, that wasn't from the bowling alley?

1493
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:20,000
No, the mini beef Wellingtons, sorry, were from Santa's Secret.

1494
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,000
From Santa's Secret, yeah.

1495
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Oh, guys.

1496
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Guys.

1497
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Even I have my limits.

1498
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:29,000
I thought it was just like, oh, no, it's upscale bowling alley, blah, blah, blah.

1499
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,000
No, you would have had the beef.

1500
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,000
You would have ordered the beef Wellingtons.

1501
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Yeah, sure.

1502
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
I mean, your hat would have flown off when you saw the price.

1503
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
But other than that, you would have had the beef Wellington.

1504
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Well, that's true.

1505
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:41,000
But that's a weird one to fuck up because it's just dough and beef.

1506
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,000
You'd think it would be pretty straightforward or something they could prep in microwave.

1507
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
But yeah, it was not a good excuse.

1508
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Yeah, but also in a converted mall food court, you might be running into trouble.

1509
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Right.

1510
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,000
I texted Gio, did you eat a big sandwich when we saw bridesmaids?

1511
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
And then I just wrote Jason's memory.

1512
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
And then he said, hmm, I might have.

1513
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Mostly true.

1514
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,000
I think Snopes would give that.

1515
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Yeah, yeah, so pretty good.

1516
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,000
I swear.

1517
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:13,000
I mean, I feel like he was practically doing like the fingies, like the don't mind if I do kind of fingers.

1518
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Like Dagwood sizing up a sandwich.

1519
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Yeah, because we we weren't by a subway.

1520
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
So we had to prepare.

1521
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Are you not maybe did you do this and you're putting this memory into another friend of yours?

1522
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:32,000
No, because when I would go to the Arclight, I would always get one of their chicken sausages.

1523
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Gio thinks you're right.

1524
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:37,000
OK, he says, lol, I think he's right.

1525
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
So your memory is Kurt was probably correct.

1526
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Yeah, no, and never again with a burrito in movies.

1527
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Yeah, you just got to be conscious of the smell in any sort of confined space.

1528
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Yeah.

1529
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:52,000
So let's see, we had Gingerbread Lady, the Snow Angel we talked about the.

1530
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Oh, so here's one one other note I would say.

1531
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:01,000
As this is going, it's kind of what we're hearing is Santa is a piece of shit, right?

1532
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Yes.

1533
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Like it's like kind of like like all these secrets are like Santa is did something not just like naughty, but Santa did something like bad.

1534
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Like Santa like exiled somebody for, you know, like like like like a four hadn't.

1535
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Oh, yeah, that's the Santa's secretary who had her who had the act where she sung.

1536
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:23,000
The thing was that that Santa's wife had an affair with Santa's secretary.

1537
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Right.

1538
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,000
And then Santa's secretary got punished somehow, maybe having this job as her punishment.

1539
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Yes.

1540
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,000
So it's like like all you're hearing is what a piece of shit Santa is.

1541
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
But then when he comes out at the end, it's just like, hey, it's Santa.

1542
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:37,000
You know, I mean, I was like, I think we need a moment of.

1543
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Just this guy getting his comeuppance or.

1544
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,000
His comeuppance.

1545
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Yeah, there you go.

1546
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,000
All right, you're on the team.

1547
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:55,000
I think I think we need a moment of that, or we need to just like skate, like make the secrets be body, but not like like like sins.

1548
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,000
You know what I mean?

1549
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Did you want to see Santa punished for his crimes?

1550
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,000
I mean, that's the thing.

1551
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,000
If that led to some sort of S&M thing, you know what I mean?

1552
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Like he was kind of being led around.

1553
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,000
All the characters take a turn.

1554
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
They'll take a turn, give him a little paddle.

1555
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
And then he's like, I guess I learned my lesson.

1556
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
I can be on the naughty list, too, or something like that.

1557
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,000
That might have been like a little bit of.

1558
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Right.

1559
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Somebody takes his somebody's paddles his balls.

1560
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Somebody paddles his butt.

1561
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Yeah.

1562
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Someone puts a nipple clamp.

1563
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Yeah.

1564
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
A cut cage on his balls and dick.

1565
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
What was the phrase? Cut cage?

1566
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Cut cage.

1567
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Oh, cut cage.

1568
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Yeah.

1569
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Oh, OK.

1570
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
I got it. I understand.

1571
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,000
With context clues.

1572
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Jason, you know what that is?

1573
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Sure.

1574
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Not my thing.

1575
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:41,000
We've started saying it's not my thing, but I know about it.

1576
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Yeah.

1577
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,000
So so they have this.

1578
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Oh, OK.

1579
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:48,000
So so oh, and this is the other thing.

1580
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
So sometimes there were double entendres.

1581
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Sometimes there were things like like like like, oh, you know,

1582
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:56,000
he he actually there was a different sort of cookie jar Santa

1583
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
liked reaching in.

1584
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:01,000
But like when they talked about this is another thing that really made me laugh.

1585
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
They said, you know, actually, Mrs.

1586
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Claus had an affair with Santa's secretary.

1587
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
It was like, oh, what the fuck?

1588
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,000
And the drag queen goes, that's right.

1589
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,000
She was licking snatch.

1590
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,000
There's no attempt at a Christmas pun or anything.

1591
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Did you say snatch?

1592
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Licking snatch.

1593
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Yeah.

1594
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Oh, OK.

1595
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,000
I wrote here.

1596
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:26,000
I'm looking at my texts with Lindsay and I wrote I was giving her some updates

1597
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,000
and I wrote Mrs.

1598
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Claus was licking snatch with Santa's secretary.

1599
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,000
And then I wrote under Wiger is dying laughing.

1600
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Is that specifically I felt like you sort of convulsing.

1601
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Yeah, I loved it.

1602
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Just that there's a point where like the lack of any sort of effort

1603
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
and being clever is makes it extra fun.

1604
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,000
I can appreciate that, though, too, because like you can only get so much

1605
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
like a cookie jar, like whatever.

1606
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,000
So much of that.

1607
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Sometimes when they do saying something filthy, you're like, well, it's good.

1608
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
It's pretty good.

1609
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,000
It was good.

1610
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
I was I was I was consistently entertained by that.

1611
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,000
They had.

1612
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:06,000
OK, another of his secrets was Santa's secrets.

1613
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Oh, that his brother was the Grinch, right?

1614
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,000
That led into.

1615
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Yes.

1616
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Scott was well, that's more like.

1617
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Was that later?

1618
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,000
It's a little later because there's we're talking about hard drugs.

1619
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Oh, right.

1620
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
We have Rudolph's secret, too.

1621
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Yeah.

1622
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,000
And then I don't know.

1623
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,000
I just have some of Scott's notes.

1624
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
There's crack in the candy.

1625
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,000
That's what it is.

1626
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Maybe that was the the the the gingerbread lady that I think that's what it was.

1627
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:36,000
And then at a certain point, just our emcee said like Santa came home

1628
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
with a beard full of crack.

1629
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Crack.

1630
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,000
What?

1631
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
What are we doing here?

1632
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Crack bewildering.

1633
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,000
But the amount of time they just kept saying crack, I was just that was really

1634
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,000
that was really making me laugh.

1635
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
That choice, I guess.

1636
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
But again, I guess boomers know that.

1637
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,000
I guess so.

1638
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,000
I guess they know crack because that's a little right.

1639
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Exactly.

1640
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,000
So I'm like, I guess I guess that's for them.

1641
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,000
And look, it killed.

1642
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,000
It did.

1643
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Yeah.

1644
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
So I guess they win with that choice.

1645
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
But yeah.

1646
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:13,000
So at this point, Scott writes in the notes, I guess there's been four secrets.

1647
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,000
That was that was part of it was unclear of what it was.

1648
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Is this a secret or is this not?

1649
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:23,000
That's when that's when that when you know the when the Ice Queen said that was

1650
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:27,000
the point where the Ice Queen said the secret number four and we're like, oh,

1651
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
I guess we must have missed one or two.

1652
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Yeah.

1653
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:34,000
I don't know if Ice Queen was just listing and forgot to say a number or we didn't

1654
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,000
hear because it was very loud.

1655
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
It was a very cavernous room.

1656
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
I mean, look, it used to be a food court.

1657
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:44,000
So the acoustics were not perfect in there for a bawdy show.

1658
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Some of these dirty things are a real journey.

1659
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Like, yeah, it's it's such a leap to get there when so much of Christmas snow

1660
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:58,000
snowflakes, even the icing on gingerbread cookies.

1661
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
It's cocaine or cum.

1662
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,000
It's right there.

1663
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,000
It's right there.

1664
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,000
Yeah.

1665
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Yeah.

1666
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Santa came home with a beard full of cum.

1667
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Yeah, it would work, too.

1668
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,000
That would work, too.

1669
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,000
I guess so.

1670
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Did they say the word cum?

1671
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
I don't think they said cum at any point in the show.

1672
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,000
I don't think they did say the word.

1673
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,000
I don't think they actually did.

1674
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Do you think there were words that were off limit?

1675
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
But didn't they say jizz?

1676
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Am I misremembering that?

1677
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
I feel like jizz is softer.

1678
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Yeah, it is a little softer.

1679
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,000
But maybe it's more of like a boomer writer.

1680
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,000
That could be it.

1681
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Yeah.

1682
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Yeah.

1683
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Rudolph has cocaine dick and he can't jizz.

1684
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:38,000
He can fuck, but he can't jizz.

1685
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,000
They had, OK, so they had, yeah, Rudolph comes out.

1686
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Rudolph has the coked up routine.

1687
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
It also does some aerials.

1688
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:53,000
This was actually another thing I wanted to note is just from a pacing standpoint.

1689
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:58,000
So it felt like all of the female acts were frontloaded,

1690
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:02,000
and then the males were saved for last, the males and couples.

1691
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Am I wrong about that?

1692
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Oh, um.

1693
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
I kind of felt like it could have been interspersed a little bit more.

1694
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Maybe, yeah.

1695
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:12,000
We could have done two women and then a hunk third, you know what I mean?

1696
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Just so there was something for everybody.

1697
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Because one demographic might get bored.

1698
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,000
That's what I felt like.

1699
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:24,000
I felt like this was appealing very much to the straight male gaze, if you will.

1700
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
That's what it kind of felt like it was appealing to initially.

1701
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:29,000
And it was just like, well, are we ever going to get to some hunks?

1702
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,000
And then when we finally did get to some hunks, that was great.

1703
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
But it would have been nice to see some of that earlier.

1704
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Going back and forth, sure.

1705
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Exactly, yeah.

1706
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,000
I get it.

1707
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,000
I don't know.

1708
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Maybe there was some sort of technical reason you had to do structure.

1709
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,000
It could be right.

1710
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Because they would send the wire back up to put a different apparatus on it

1711
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,000
before a different high wire trick happened.

1712
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:51,000
So somebody had the ribbons, somebody had a big hoop.

1713
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:54,000
I don't know if there was some logistical reason they had to do that.

1714
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,000
You're right.

1715
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Maybe all the wire work had to come first.

1716
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Was there?

1717
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Did I see right?

1718
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:02,000
There was pole dancing, but it was on an aerial contraption.

1719
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,000
That's what it was, yeah.

1720
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
That's very impressive.

1721
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,000
It was cool.

1722
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
I was a little scared for the performers, too.

1723
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,000
It seemed dangerous.

1724
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,000
It seems borderline unsafe.

1725
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
They both seemed dangerous.

1726
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:17,000
So combining them together, I'm like, well, that's very risky, I feel like.

1727
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Yeah.

1728
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,000
So I mean, there was definitely like...

1729
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:26,000
I felt like it was fairly equal as far as gender stuff.

1730
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,000
It was.

1731
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:30,000
It just was kind of like half and half, basically.

1732
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Yeah.

1733
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,000
The other thing I would say, and this was a thing you actually touched on earlier, Jason,

1734
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:39,000
when you're talking about the burlesque scene oftentimes has some body positivity,

1735
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,000
I will say I think there was a missed opportunity.

1736
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:48,000
The Santa guy was great, but there was a missed opportunity for a hot big guy

1737
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:51,000
with a big beard and a big belly to be Santa,

1738
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
because that's a type people like.

1739
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:58,000
And instead, everyone was like a cut hunk, like a Luigi Mangione body.

1740
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:01,000
And that's fine.

1741
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,000
That's fine.

1742
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:06,000
I like looking at the male body, but that's part of why I like wrestling.

1743
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:12,000
But it would have been nice to see a guy with a big belly there who also had some moves.

1744
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Sure, yeah.

1745
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
There could have been more diversity in that area.

1746
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Yeah, definitely.

1747
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,000
You know what?

1748
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:23,000
I didn't see anybody who looked jacked like Hulk Hogan standing with muscles.

1749
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
I would have liked to see somebody freakishly big.

1750
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Right, like a super muscly guy would have been fun, too.

1751
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:33,000
I would have found somebody that one hand bench pressed us while we were sitting on a bench or something.

1752
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Yeah, a big muscle man could have just been another type, just to vary it up.

1753
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Because again, everyone looked great, everyone was very talented,

1754
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:42,000
but it was pretty samey in terms of body types.

1755
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Yes, yes.

1756
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:51,000
But yeah, it felt, I don't know, it felt like they had put some thought into it overall, I would say.

1757
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Let's just put it that way.

1758
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:58,000
And then at the end, yeah, I would have liked a Santa either getting his comeuppance

1759
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:01,000
or Santa just coming in and being like, what's all this here?

1760
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,000
What is all this?

1761
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Comes in and says, you were having this party and you didn't invite me?

1762
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Right, takes his clothes, pulls his pants off.

1763
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
They were like, yeah, we love it.

1764
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,000
And we finally see his dick.

1765
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
And we finally see his dick.

1766
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,000
So one bit of nudity we see in the show.

1767
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Just some clinical Santa slowly lowering his red pants and showing his little dick.

1768
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,000
And then he just stands there.

1769
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,000
He doesn't even move.

1770
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:28,000
And then he pulls his pants back off.

1771
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Simply the best by Tina Turner plays.

1772
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Was there, were you guys alluding earlier to some sort of striptease?

1773
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Like, was there like a polar bear?

1774
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Polar bear, was there an unusual Christmas?

1775
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Like that were the Coca-Cola bears, like horny or something?

1776
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:54,000
No, I think if anything, they left some of that stuff on the table, like sugar plum fairy, not touched on.

1777
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,000
That felt like that was an easy one.

1778
01:29:55,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Yeah, Coca-Cola polar bears could have been something that, you know, and they did use the Grinch.

1779
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,000
They sure did.

1780
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:07,000
And that was like the, I think the secret was that Santa's, I think I said earlier, Santa's brother is the Grinch.

1781
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:12,000
And that was one of the couples routines where the sexy Grinch was wearing a Grinch mask,

1782
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:18,000
but like muscles out and then like a little bit of like furry gloves, very green gloves was doing it.

1783
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Oh, this was actually, this was the second time in addition to the cocaine use from Rudolph,

1784
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:31,000
where I was like actually scandalized because it seemed that Grinch's couples act was with Cindy Lou Who.

1785
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Oh yeah.

1786
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Which was like, seemed like it was in really poor taste.

1787
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Yes.

1788
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,000
Yes.

1789
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,000
I mean, did they say the name though?

1790
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Or was that just like, could it have just been another member, an adult woman from Whoville?

1791
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:46,000
I guess it could have been an adult woman from Whoville, but it seemed like it was kind of like that.

1792
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Mrs. Lou Who, Cindy's mom, let's hope it was that.

1793
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Let's hope it was that.

1794
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Even if they reconnected later in life, that can be very dicey.

1795
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
Jason, let me show you a photo of the Grinch right here.

1796
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,000
I don't know if you can make out.

1797
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Was there any, yeah, it's very green.

1798
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Grinch's wearing like assless underwear, like leather underpants.

1799
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
You can see his hairy butt.

1800
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
There's multiple missed opportunities there.

1801
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Yeah, seeing the Grinch's big green hog or like though the Grinch's Santa are brothers,

1802
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:23,000
and then they do the, like one of them puts the bow on the other, like the Folgers incest ad.

1803
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:27,000
You're my present this year.

1804
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Or they're like, they're like Santa and the Grinch are brothers,

1805
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:34,000
and then they go like step brothers and they start kissing or something.

1806
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Yes, because it's allowed.

1807
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,000
It's allowed.

1808
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Oh, it's allowed.

1809
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,000
It's allowed.

1810
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Yeah, it's allowed.

1811
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:47,000
America's losing its mind and it's mostly concerned with it being allowed.

1812
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:51,000
They should have had like somebody dressed as Ron DeSantis run into the show

1813
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:54,000
and try to shut it down during the show or something.

1814
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,000
That would have been fun.

1815
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Yeah.

1816
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
But I don't think people might not know who that is anymore.

1817
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,000
Yeah, I don't know.

1818
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,000
It came and went so fast.

1819
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Well, I think the only, I mean, yeah, I don't think this is necessarily the most politically engaged crowd.

1820
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,000
No, no.

1821
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
The only, oh, so there was...

1822
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
There was a little reference early, I feel like.

1823
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
There was a little bit, and there was also a point in the show where,

1824
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,000
so we all had like little cards to write secrets on,

1825
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:20,000
and it was like, tell your dirtiest secret or whatever, and they would collect them,

1826
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:28,000
and then towards the end of the show, the MC was reading them out.

1827
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Yeah.

1828
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Carlson has one of the cards here.

1829
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,000
I guess that's a blank one.

1830
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:34,000
This is the one that was not written on because ours was collected.

1831
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:39,000
And then all the secrets just, they all felt like made up Reddit, am I the asshole post?

1832
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Right.

1833
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:44,000
You know, like just like fake secrets that weren't really, you know, like I'm here with my girlfriend,

1834
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
but then I just saw my wife, you know, that sort of stuff.

1835
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,000
They all felt like bullshit.

1836
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Too perfect.

1837
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Yeah, exactly.

1838
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Too cutesy.

1839
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:54,000
And then, but then there was one that was like, that didn't really...

1840
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:58,000
It felt like one they put in there just to set up the impression, right?

1841
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,000
The President's one.

1842
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1843
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Because there was one that was about like, I think it was like I sucked Joe Biden off or something like that.

1844
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:12,000
And then the Ice Queen said, can you imagine if Trump sucked Joe Biden off

1845
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:16,000
and then went into a pretty good Trump impression of Trump blowing Biden?

1846
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Yeah.

1847
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Yeah.

1848
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
So that was as political as Santa's Secret got.

1849
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Okay.

1850
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:30,000
They weren't, yeah, they weren't, they weren't tackling any of the hard questions or the hard questions.

1851
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,000
You know what I'm saying?

1852
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
I get it.

1853
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Yeah.

1854
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,000
There's a lot of...

1855
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:40,000
So Scott wrote down a secret on our post, one of the postcards on our table.

1856
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:43,000
It was not read, but I believe, and I don't know if he has a picture of it,

1857
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:49,000
but I believe it was something to the tune of I am very into Amazon position and inflatable stuff.

1858
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Yes.

1859
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,000
There was some inflation fetish.

1860
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:57,000
An inflation fetish, but we were hoping, we were really hoping that the Ice Queen would read that, but that did not happen.

1861
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Okay.

1862
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,000
It was not selected.

1863
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,000
But it definitely felt a little bit state, like fake.

1864
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Yeah, it felt like they either had some prefab ones that they knew would hit or they just picked the most outrageous sounding ones that were made up.

1865
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,000
Right.

1866
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
But yeah, that's a fun element.

1867
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:19,000
I mean, it definitely felt like people knew, it definitely felt like somebody, oh, they're reading ours.

1868
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Yeah.

1869
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
So maybe there were at least a couple that...

1870
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Yeah, it might have been.

1871
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:27,000
And they may have all been giggling to themselves, oh, we're going to be naughty and write something there.

1872
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:30,000
There was a full bachelorette party up in that one area.

1873
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:34,000
I don't know if it was bachelorette, but they were all ladies in dresses, silver dresses.

1874
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:39,000
There were a bunch of people who were dressed up in Christmassy outfits, 60 Christmas outfits.

1875
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:43,000
And yeah, those women who were in the corners, a group of a half dozen women all dressed to the nines.

1876
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:48,000
They all had glitter dresses of sequined dresses of different shades.

1877
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,000
They'd all coordinated.

1878
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Yeah.

1879
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
So it was definitely for a lot of people, like, this is our big night out.

1880
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,000
We're going to stand in secret.

1881
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:57,000
We're going to get so horny and we're going to get fucking trashed.

1882
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
We should have dressed up, first of all.

1883
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Yeah, we should have.

1884
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,000
We did not really dress up.

1885
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,000
No.

1886
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,000
We didn't get that horny.

1887
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
And I think that was a mistake.

1888
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Yeah, and we only had a couple of drinks.

1889
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
We should have gotten completely fucked up.

1890
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:12,000
A couple of drinks, regular amount of arousal.

1891
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:15,000
It's an average Friday night for us.

1892
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:20,000
But yes, yeah, they, they, people might, because I went, I was like, is anybody going to be here?

1893
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,000
I didn't know.

1894
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Yeah.

1895
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:27,000
And the thing that did give me a clue that this is kind of a thing was that I think the night before,

1896
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:33,000
the Green Goblin himself, Patrick Page from Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark, who's in a lot of other things,

1897
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:41,000
he on Instagram posted a photo of his wife and he, or I think it was just his wife, at Santa's Secret in New York.

1898
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
So I was like, this is a bi-coastal event.

1899
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Yeah.

1900
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
The Green Goblin himself knows about it.

1901
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:50,000
And, oh, maybe this is more of a thing than I expected it to be.

1902
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Because, you know, we see all this stuff.

1903
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:57,000
We've all been to weird, quick pop-ups that go away very fast and feel half-assed.

1904
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:00,000
But I was like, oh, I think people know and are excited about this.

1905
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:06,000
It was, I would say the, one of the weirder moments was for me was just like stepping away to use the bathroom,

1906
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:12,000
which was just like a full fluorescent light, like mall bathroom that was right next to the space.

1907
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,000
That was not themed at all.

1908
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,000
No effort.

1909
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Yeah. I think actually did not go to the bathroom I'm thinking about, not there at least.

1910
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Yeah.

1911
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:21,000
But yeah, they should have done a little something in there, but maybe there's some sort of building code.

1912
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Probably.

1913
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,000
That you can't theme it.

1914
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:26,000
Was the music, could you hear, I mean, I guess it was loud enough you could hear the music in there?

1915
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Yeah, I know you could hear everything, yeah.

1916
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Oh, okay, so.

1917
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:32,000
I'm just thinking back, because when I was trying to figure out if I could go,

1918
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,000
I knew there was a walk-through element, I knew it was in the Beverly Center,

1919
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:40,000
and like theme parks, malls, casino, anywhere with a lot of walking nowadays,

1920
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:45,000
I opt for a wheelchair rather than the cane just for ease of like,

1921
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:51,000
I don't want to get eat shit or get overly fatigued just to do an event.

1922
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:57,000
And I'm just imagining now us in Santa's office and her going, who's naughty?

1923
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:02,000
And five adults turning around and pointing at the one in the wheelchair.

1924
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:05,000
It would have happened 100%.

1925
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Yeah, absolutely.

1926
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:11,000
I just want to read a couple of things we forgot to say.

1927
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:15,000
The Grinch's cock grew ten sizes bigger.

1928
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Right.

1929
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,000
First of all.

1930
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Okay, got manageable and comfortable.

1931
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Some of the music, there was a Meghan Trainor song,

1932
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:25,000
a Christmas song playing that I sound clouded and showed everybody.

1933
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:29,000
Then Charlie XEX was playing while the Grinch stripped off his fur.

1934
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Mrs. Claus likes to go to a strip club called the Toy Factory also.

1935
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,000
These are all little details.

1936
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Oh, right, that's what we got in the Nutcracker, yeah.

1937
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:40,000
And then she got a, I don't know who even wrote this.

1938
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:45,000
She got a lap dance from the Nutcracker and Santa saw it and got mad and made him stiff.

1939
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
That is Santa's biggest secret.

1940
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
And then his darkest secret is that it's Grinch's twin.

1941
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,000
So anyway.

1942
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Yeah, that was the other thing.

1943
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:55,000
It felt like we were going towards one big revelation,

1944
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
but they all kind of seem to the same level.

1945
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Yeah.

1946
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:01,000
That's really kind of out of his control if the Grinch is his twin.

1947
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:02,000
That's true, yeah.

1948
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
He couldn't have done anything about that.

1949
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:12,000
What I was about to say is that if indeed they want to do Uncle Sam's secret again this year.

1950
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:14,000
I'm kind of interested.

1951
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:17,000
You're saying I would want to see what they do with Uncle Sam's secret.

1952
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:21,000
You're saying you're a Yankee Donald Dandy in that case.

1953
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,000
I think so.

1954
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:27,000
So I don't know, Jason, you may not have to wait for Santa to come back around.

1955
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:33,000
I'll get my best Old Navy American flag t-shirt out and pop it on.

1956
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
We're not making a mistake again.

1957
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
We will dress up this time.

1958
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
Yeah, you got to have some sort of patriotic look.

1959
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
New president next year.

1960
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Exactly, there you go.

1961
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
We're going to be a whole different set of people.

1962
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,000
I already got the hat.

1963
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Sure.

1964
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,000
You're wearing the hat now.

1965
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Yeah, I'm curious what they would do because there's certainly more fantastical things

1966
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:59,000
and fun to be had with the Christmas aesthetic.

1967
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:02,000
I'm curious what they do with the sort of patriotic burlesque take.

1968
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,000
I'd want to see it.

1969
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,000
I'd go back.

1970
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:09,000
And it also seems like for an otherwise hulking vacant space in the Beverly Center,

1971
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:13,000
like basically half of a floor's worth of real estate,

1972
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:16,000
they were able to turn this into a profit center.

1973
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:19,000
So I understand why they're wanting to find a way to do it in other seasons.

1974
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Yeah, because they have it all set up, you may as well.

1975
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:28,000
But I feel like the chance for problematic things in the Uncle Sam version is high.

1976
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:33,000
I feel like they're going to have to really sidestep some things,

1977
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,000
but maybe they don't.

1978
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,000
Maybe they go there.

1979
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:36,000
Maybe they could lean into it.

1980
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,000
I don't know.

1981
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Maybe there is like a two-minute long monologue of like,

1982
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:42,000
hey, we had a lot of fun tonight, but let's remember,

1983
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:49,000
we're a country of different, we're more united than divide at a really heavy hand.

1984
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Yeah, well, let's hope.

1985
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:53,000
I mean, but maybe there's still a chance for us to influence the show.

1986
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
Maybe Weigert could show around Uncle Sam's secret.

1987
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
I'd love to get involved.

1988
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
But anyway, I did.

1989
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,000
I had a great time.

1990
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:03,000
Part of it is because Dad doesn't get out of the house as much as he used to.

1991
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:07,000
PWG hasn't been running for a year or two or a year and a half.

1992
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
I don't remember exactly how long.

1993
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:10,000
It's been a while.

1994
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,000
It's been a while.

1995
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Fingers crossed it comes back.

1996
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:16,000
So yeah, Dad, meaning me, hasn't been out.

1997
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,000
But I had a ball.

1998
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
I was so tired.

1999
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:23,000
I didn't even make it to Jimmy Angel at the smokehouse later because I was too tired.

2000
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:24,000
You bailed on Jimmy Angel.

2001
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Yeah, Jimmy Angel.

2002
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Because you said you were going straight there.

2003
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,000
I was.

2004
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:31,000
I go see Jimmy Angel because of a friend of the show, Trevor Zam, and I said this on the show before,

2005
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:37,000
introduced me to an 89-year-old rock and roll singer named Jimmy Angel, the last of the 50s Bobcats.

2006
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:42,000
And I was going straight from the Beverly Center to the smokehouse because Jimmy's set starts at nine

2007
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,000
and it would have been perfect.

2008
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:49,000
And I got so tired from all the raucous innuendo that I said, I'll see Jimmy.

2009
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,000
I'll see him next month.

2010
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,000
I'll just wait.

2011
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,000
So I had a great time.

2012
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Yeah.

2013
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:54,000
I had a ball.

2014
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,000
I had a lot of fun.

2015
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:56,000
I liked it.

2016
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Yeah.

2017
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
I look forward to future installments.

2018
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:04,000
You would have taken, next time you would have taken like a, you'll take a blue chew before you go in there.

2019
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Really up the excitement.

2020
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:10,000
Take the rowing, the new rowing one that's Sidenofil and Tatafil.

2021
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Wait, what?

2022
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Have you not seen these TV ads?

2023
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,000
I haven't seen them.

2024
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,000
I don't know who's watching cable.

2025
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,000
What is it?

2026
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,000
It's two things at once?

2027
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,000
It's both.

2028
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:23,000
It's Viagra and Cialis because Cialis stays in your system longer, but Viagra is faster acting.

2029
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,000
And it's both at once?

2030
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
It's one combo pill.

2031
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Oh my God.

2032
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Viagra, you know about this?

2033
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:33,000
I don't know about this, but I do know that someone just walked into our studio while we were having this conversation.

2034
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,000
It was.

2035
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
And we're not doing a blue chew ad read.

2036
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
It was an uncomfortable situation.

2037
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,000
I agree.

2038
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Well, we'll have to talk about it on another episode because Jason's just, again, telling me this information for the first time.

2039
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,000
I'm hearing it for the first time.

2040
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:48,000
But Nick Weier, You Survive podcast, The Ride.

2041
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Thank you so much for being here.

2042
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,000
It was a pleasure to hang out.

2043
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Oh my goodness.

2044
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,000
What an honor.

2045
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:54,000
I always loved doing the show.

2046
01:41:54,000 --> 01:42:03,000
And I think since we were behind the paywall, it's fine for me to not be talking about a parking garage.

2047
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Yes, I agree.

2048
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Well, I mean, yeah, I think it's fine.

2049
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:10,000
The Beverly Hills Center does have a pretty big and bad parking garage, I will say.

2050
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,000
And I do.

2051
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Multi-level maze.

2052
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,000
We ended up talking more about this.

2053
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
I know you wanted to talk more about points.

2054
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Yeah, I wrote a full page of notes on credit card points because I listened to your episode and I told, as I told you in the group text,

2055
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:25,000
I had to keep pausing it because I had stuff that I wanted to say.

2056
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
I think we had more than enough to talk about with Santa's Secret.

2057
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,000
We did.

2058
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
I mean, if there's one thing you want, do you want to say one of them?

2059
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
I mean, I don't want all this stuff.

2060
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,000
You could wait, save it for next time.

2061
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
I would just say like back on the Amex trifecta.

2062
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:43,000
I think the one thing that you are getting from the American Express ecosystem is for travel benefits.

2063
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:50,000
You get into a lot of airport lounges, including the Amex exclusive Centurion lounges, which are very nice.

2064
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:54,000
Oftentimes like a little step up from like a Delta Sky Club.

2065
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:59,000
And then they've also got their fine hotels, which you can use through their travel portal.

2066
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:07,000
And so that's really great for like, you know, we've had a lot of success like booking like a hotel at a discount with points.

2067
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:11,000
And then you get a bunch of like upgrades that are part of Amex perks through that.

2068
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:16,000
So that's one thing that I think that what I've been because I used to do a lot of churning.

2069
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:19,000
I used to do a lot of like trying to min max this.

2070
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:22,000
And then I reached a point where I was like, I just got to simplify this.

2071
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:25,000
I do about like 20 percent of the work that I used to do.

2072
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:32,000
And I still get about 80 percent of the results just by doing like three cards and keeping it simple as opposed to trying to get all these sign up bonuses.

2073
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:36,000
So I would just say like, find whatever works for you and just keep it straightforward.

2074
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Well, can I next year invite you to do points too?

2075
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
I would love to. With us.

2076
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,000
It would be the honor of a lifetime.

2077
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:48,000
I think I say this on an episode that's about to come out.

2078
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:52,000
But I know how to do point the credit card points to episode.

2079
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:56,000
I know I know what I want to do for it, but it's going to be a big episode.

2080
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
And you're obviously very passionate about this.

2081
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:02,000
And I assume you know all about fast food app points as well.

2082
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,000
One hundred percent.

2083
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
And I we need another heavy hitter in here.

2084
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Yeah, I would I would love to.

2085
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:11,000
We need to clear four hours for that.

2086
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:21,000
But I would like to formally invite you, if we do, if we're allowed, if daddy lets us to do points to next year in twenty twenty five.

2087
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Look, if there's ever a window, I'm always happy to do the show and talk about it.

2088
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:29,000
But yeah, credit credit card points are a thing that I have some strong opinions on.

2089
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:32,000
OK, well, exit to the gift shop as well.

2090
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Oh, yeah. Hey, check out Doughboy's podcast about chain restaurants and check out a get played podcast about about video games.

2091
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Great podcast. Check those out. Yes.

2092
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,000
And as for us, I don't know, this is second gate, you know, you know where you are.

2093
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Can you say, can you say, can you say, are we in club three?

2094
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:49,000
No, this is second gate. Sorry, I'm all mixed up.

2095
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Can I say Sheridan? You're too boring, you're confused.

2096
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Sheridan's going to be coming on an upcoming episode of Doughboy's Patreon.

2097
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Oh, yes, I heard, yes.

2098
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Something that I know you've also discussed on podcast The Ride.

2099
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:04,000
The quality of Wendy's lettuce. Yeah.

2100
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:07,000
I mean, it's not that it's not that narrow.

2101
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:11,000
It's not that narrow, but I've written a few things down.

2102
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:14,000
All right. Well, I'm excited to hear that. So yeah, check that out.

2103
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:18,000
And yeah, we'll be back to see Uncle Sam next summer.
