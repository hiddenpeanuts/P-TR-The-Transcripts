1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
FOREVER!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
DOG!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In 2003,

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
filmmaker-actor-auteur Tommy

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Wiseau released his directorial debut,

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The Room. The landscape

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
of cinema was forever changed,

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
as was the life of eventual podcast

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The Ride host, Scott Gertner.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The linchpin in this tale? Today's

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
guest, who starred in the cult

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
classic and helped Wiseau chase his dream.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And the best part? This guy

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
loves theme parks.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
If you know and love The Room, you're in for a treat.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
If you don't, stay tuned

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
for a big old Disney World nerd out.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's all HyParks

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
with The Room's Greg Sestero

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
on Podcast The Ride.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Welcome to Podcast

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The Ride, where we believe

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
if a lot of people love theme

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
parks, the world would be

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
a better place to live.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm Scott Gertner. Everybody

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
betray me. I'm fed up with Disney

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
World. But I'm

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
so happy I have you as my co-host.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It seems to me like you're a theme

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
park expert, Mike!

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Oh, thank you. Yeah. You know, whatever

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
it's interesting what you're doing.

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You're channeling something.

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Do I sound a little different or something?

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
A little bit, but not much. Not much, but a little bit.

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
There's some indiscernible

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
accent, unplaceable, no particular

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
like the kind of accent

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
where, you know, the person

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
would not ever answer what the accent

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
is or where it came from. Not important.

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
No, no, no. Doesn't matter. The mystery is

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
part of it. Yeah.

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Well, look, I will open up a little

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
to anyone who doesn't understand any of what I

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
was just saying and why.

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And say that if you don't know

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
what any of that was, then you

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
are clearly not familiar with Tommy

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Wiseau's 2003 feature film

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The Room. It is a

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
eternal

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
tale of love, lust, and betrayal

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
that I believe has

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
rightfully taken the mantle of

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
the most deliriously fun bad

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
movie ever made.

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I believe it rose to number one.

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Anybody tried

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
to dethrone it. I don't

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
think you could. Mike, you know that

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm very passionate about this film. Of course.

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yeah. I think we've talked about it before.

65
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
There's a long history with me

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and this film, which is why I've

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
been so excited for this

68
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
episode for a long time.

69
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Been trying to put together for

70
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
forever. And I'm so happy we're

71
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
here finally because we are today

72
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
joined by one of the

73
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
key figures in the story of

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The Room, Johnny's best friend

75
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Mark himself, the writer

76
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
of an amazing book about his experience called

77
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
A Disaster Artist, which was turned into a Golden Globe

78
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
winning feature film.

79
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
But for you, the podcast,

80
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The Ride Listener, what does all of this mean

81
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
to you if you don't know The Room? Well, I'm

82
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
thrilled to say that our guest is also

83
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
one of the biggest Disney Parks fans

84
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I've ever run into.

85
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So there is a ton to talk about and a ton

86
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
to do with our guest today. Greg Sestero.

87
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yeah. Oh, hi, Scott.

88
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yay.

89
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I mean, yeah, this episode

90
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
is 20,

91
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
over 20 years in the making. We've known each other.

92
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
We officially met

93
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
in February of 2004.

94
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
God, yeah, you knew the you knew the month

95
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
even. You remember the specific screening

96
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
where you finally where you like joined

97
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
the fray of all

98
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
of the weirdos making their way to

99
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
your film on the other side

100
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
after I'm sure what must have been

101
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
like a strange period after the

102
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
completion of the movie.

103
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I think with any actor, writer,

104
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
you always remember the first time you've

105
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
been in something that

106
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
like has a fan.

107
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And I remember, so I'd been in

108
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
a movie called Retro Puppet Master.

109
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So really, maybe without you, Scott,

110
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
that's all I would have is Retro Puppet Master.

111
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Wow. And you'd be you'd be dependent

112
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
on some weird nerdy

113
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
mega fan base of Retro Puppet

114
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Master, which there must be that at some

115
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
point. I think there is, but there's something about

116
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The Room like coming to that screening

117
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and seeing you

118
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
guys quote it.

119
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Like I, again, I like I was telling you earlier, I saw

120
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
myself in you

121
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
because when I was 19 and I saw Tommy

122
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
perform in acting class,

123
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I was quoting him.

124
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
We talked on the phone for hours because I just

125
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
loved hearing him talk and say things.

126
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You might have been 19? You were that young?

127
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Oh, wow, yeah.

128
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
July 11, 1998,

129
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I saw him perform Shakespeare.

130
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And I was like, this is, man, this is

131
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
so much, this is more fun than I've ever had in acting class.

132
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Like I don't really care about doing

133
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
David Mamet or any of this crap they're pushing on us.

134
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
This guy is like

135
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
where it's at. And so I approached

136
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
him to do a scene together and we

137
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
like get this really weird reaction.

138
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
He's like, what does this guy want with me?

139
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
No one in the class wants to even be

140
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
around him. He's like, yeah,

141
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
we can do a scene together, but I warn

142
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
you, we need to rehearse.

143
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm a very serious

144
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
actor. And I was like,

145
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
hell yeah, let's do it. He's like, well,

146
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I have a busy schedule, okay? So we

147
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
meet, you know, Bank of America, 3 p.m.,

148
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Market Street, and don't be late.

149
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Bank of America.

150
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I was like, does he work at Bank of America?

151
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I gotta see this guy in action.

152
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So I go to Bank of America, of course, there's nobody there.

153
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And so I'm sitting

154
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
outside Bank of America

155
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
on Market Street holding my soccer

156
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
ball because I'd go to Golden Gate

157
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Park and play soccer in the summer.

158
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And I was like 99% sure he wouldn't show up.

159
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And then I was like, now it's 20 minutes.

160
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And I was like, okay, do I just start walking?

161
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But then I was like, I just want to see what kind

162
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
of car this guy drives.

163
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
If he showed up, would it be a hearse?

164
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I picture him in like an ice cream

165
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
truck and can't turn off the siren.

166
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
This is a person, as we've said,

167
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
if you're viewing the film for the first

168
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
time, you can't put

169
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Tommy Wiseau in a box. You've never

170
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
seen anyone like this. You can't go,

171
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
he's this type of person, this type of person.

172
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Is he gothic?

173
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Is he undead?

174
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
What type of person am I looking at?

175
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Visually, when I saw him come up on stage,

176
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
he had like a vampire Michael Jackson thing

177
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
going on.

178
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
So like you just said,

179
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
what does he show up in?

180
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
A brand new Mercedes.

181
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So I get

182
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
in and I'm like, oh, nice car. And he's like,

183
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
look, don't talk about me.

184
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
He's like, in class, people talk, you know

185
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
what I'm saying? And I was like, oh yeah,

186
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
no problem. And so he

187
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
got like a little strange and I was like looking

188
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
and analyzing him. And then I see this like Burger King

189
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
crab thing attached to his

190
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
air conditioner. Like something like a

191
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Transformers discount

192
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Happy Meal toy.

193
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Any familiar, you don't recognize this line?

194
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm just trying to think, like there was the McDonald's

195
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
ones that like would transform from a burger to a robot

196
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
or something? Is it something like that? But this was like, this was

197
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
its own thing because it wasn't attached to any

198
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
franchise. It was like just

199
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
enough to be better than Happy Meal, but like

200
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I didn't know what the hell it was.

201
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And so I was like looking at it and

202
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
he's like, don't stare too long, he

203
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
may bite you.

204
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So I'm sitting there in the car going like, okay, why

205
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
did I think this would be fun?

206
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And then he's like, I need to

207
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
eat right now because I get cranky

208
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
if I don't eat. I'm sorry.

209
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Don't worry, I pay. I'm like

210
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
alright, so we go

211
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
to this pasta pomodoro

212
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
on like, I don't know,

213
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Mission Street or something. Immediately after the bank's

214
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
not part of it. He just picked you up and immediately

215
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
went somewhere else. And it wasn't like, it wasn't

216
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
the ideal place to pick up. There's a lot of people

217
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
honking in traffic. So

218
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
now we're in near Golden Gate Park

219
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
and we go to this restaurant and he orders

220
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
like all these dishes.

221
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And so he pulls out

222
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
the play and hands me the scene. He's like

223
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
let's start reading the scene.

224
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And so I was like, okay,

225
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
what scene? And I start reading and he's like, your

226
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
voice is too low.

227
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You need to go up.

228
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's monotone. You know what this means?

229
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And I was like, yeah.

230
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So he's like pushing

231
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
it and he's like, it's still

232
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
too low.

233
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And so I remember we finish

234
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
the lunch

235
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
and we finish the scene and I was like, okay,

236
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
maybe this isn't what I expected. Maybe it's

237
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
time to go to the park or do

238
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
something. And he's like, hey, wait. I see

239
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
you have this ball.

240
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
This ball. You want

241
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
to play, huh? I'm so jealous

242
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
you got so much extra time with this

243
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
man. All we get is the movie and the

244
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
interviews. You have this whole wealth of

245
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
years with the strangest

246
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
man anyone's ever seen. And so he's like,

247
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
let's go play soccer. And so we go

248
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
play soccer. He's dressed in like black

249
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
dress pants and like a white button down.

250
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And he's doing his best. He's chasing

251
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
the ball and we're playing. And we're in Golden Gate

252
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Park. The fog in

253
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
the summer is like, you can barely

254
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
see each other. It's like just us there.

255
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And he's like, hey, come here. You're a good

256
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
spore. I have a secret for you. I was like,

257
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
yeah, sure. Go ahead. He's like, closer.

258
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
There's nobody there. We're in the middle of this

259
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
like huge soccer field.

260
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Come closer. I was like, yeah.

261
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I have a secret. Guess what?

262
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I was like, what? Come closer.

263
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Vampire live here.

264
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Whoa.

265
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Really? He's like, yeah, but not just

266
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
any vampire. Vampire from

267
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Alcatraz.

268
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I was like, it's him, isn't it?

269
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So that's how it's

270
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
started. And he

271
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
he became more and more like

272
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
charming as time went on. Like he was

273
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
a tough read. Sure. But the quotes

274
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
were coming. He's like, let's go play soccer.

275
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Let's go. Let's go

276
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
eat, huh? We'd go and so we just

277
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
said all that stuff. Yeah. Wow. And we'd

278
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
rehearse. And then I remember

279
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
it was like we did one more rehearsal

280
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
and then we went to this Chinese restaurant

281
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
on Sansom Street in San

282
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Francisco. And we were sitting there talking

283
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
and he's like, I have I have dream.

284
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And I'm like, OK.

285
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I want to have my own planet.

286
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And he starts

287
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
describing what he wants.

288
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And I remember staring at him and

289
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I got these goosebumps and I was like,

290
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
something big is going to happen

291
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
with this man. I was like, no,

292
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
there's no rhyme or reason to it. I just looked at him

293
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
and I got these like chills.

294
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
This is going to be an important

295
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
factor. I don't know what it is. And I was at

296
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
a super low point because

297
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
the week before I met him, I had gone

298
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
on these bunch of auditions

299
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
living in San Francisco. It's hard to get films

300
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
because they weren't really filming up there.

301
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It was a movie called Wildflowers

302
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
with Eric Roberts, which at the time

303
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
was a big deal. Yeah. Oh, sure.

304
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yeah. And so it was

305
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
he's still he's still kicking, right?

306
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Nobody works more than Eric Roberts.

307
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
That's true. So I went to three

308
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
callbacks, played this bad boy boyfriend

309
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
opposite Clea Duvall,

310
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
who I didn't know at the time.

311
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I worked with her. That's funny.

312
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Yeah. And so I went back

313
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
for the third callback

314
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
and it was like my agent told me, like, you're on

315
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
hold. You're going to get it. And I remember

316
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
getting the call that Monday that

317
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I got released. And it was like

318
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
the worst feeling because I was like, now

319
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
what? Now what do I do? Yeah.

320
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I've done a few commercials

321
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
like back then moving to L.A. was a lot more challenging.

322
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And then I meet Tom.

323
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
That sort of led me to Tom. That was like

324
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I met Tommy that next

325
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
that night. This is so cinematic.

326
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
The down and out.

327
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You're at what could be your lowest.

328
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Which puts you in like a fuck it

329
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
state. I was in a total fuck it

330
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
state. I had no answer. I had no agent.

331
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I had no plan.

332
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It was like get that role and then that was

333
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
going to like jump start you.

334
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And I remember just being like

335
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
do I just give up? And then it was like

336
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
then I met Tommy. It was crazy.

337
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Crazy timing. Wow. All of these.

338
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Oh my god. I could hear these quotes from this man

339
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
forever. But I guess what I should drive to

340
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
is the how does

341
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
this coalesce into

342
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
and some of this is obviously

343
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
portrayed in a movie

344
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
which was created. Congrats on that.

345
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
But like in terms of Cliftonets

346
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
how does it become

347
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
this guy reveals that he has this

348
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
cinematic dream and then you help him

349
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
shepherd it along and appear in it

350
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
yourself. So we connected like tight

351
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
in those few weeks during the acting

352
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
class. And we were on a road

353
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
trip. We were lost.

354
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And he asked me you know class is

355
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
over. What do you like to do? And I was like

356
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I mean I want to

357
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
go to L.A. But it's tough.

358
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You know I've been working like a bunch of jobs trying to put

359
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
money aside. But like where do I start?

360
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
He's like why you tell me I have a place

361
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
in Los Angeles?

362
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And I was like a place. Yeah

363
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I have an apartment. I can rent you $200

364
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
a month. Wow. Geez.

365
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And I remember I was driving. We were lost. There was no

366
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
GPS. I don't know where the hell we were but I'm like

367
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
holy crap. This is this was

368
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
that's why I didn't get that part.

369
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I knew it was like this was the freaking answer. So

370
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
we go I go back home that night

371
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
all of a sudden I was like he's like yeah I have to go

372
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
next week. You can check out place. It's yours.

373
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And I was like

374
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
sure. And so then I had to explain

375
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
this to my mom and my mom had seen

376
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
a picture of Tommy and thought like

377
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
there's no way you're going to associate with this guy.

378
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Like he looks like he's been through the ringer.

379
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So he comes

380
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
to pick me up at Walnut Creek Bar station

381
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
and my mom has to come meet him. That's the

382
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
rule. We go up and Tommy

383
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
looks like he's been doing meth for like 60 hours

384
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
like exhausted. She's like she

385
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
has an accent too. She's a French accent. But she's like

386
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
hey you know how old are you? And he's like

387
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
oh Greg's age.

388
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Twenty eight.

389
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And she's like

390
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
sure. And what do you want with Greg? Like what's

391
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
your what's your draw? And she's like he's a cool guy.

392
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And she was like I was like

393
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
mom we got to go. Like he's got a meeting. She's like what

394
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
meeting? Oh I do business.

395
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's the movie. Oh my god.

396
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
No answers. And then finally

397
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
she says to him Tommy

398
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
no sex. And I thought like

399
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
ooh he's just going to shrug it off. But he goes

400
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
well we all do.

401
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
So anyway we had she lets me go.

402
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
We make it to LA.

403
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And we pull up. It's on Crescent Heights and

404
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Fountain. I was

405
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
expecting the worst. We show up. It's like a nice place.

406
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
The security.

407
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
He can't get into the security gate because he's like I

408
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
can't remember code. What is code?

409
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And then he pulls out these crumpled pieces of paper and the

410
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
code was one two three four.

411
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
So we get in.

412
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And the play there's no

413
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
furniture in this place. There's one bed.

414
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And like

415
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
there's a bunch of Hollywood reporters thrown all over.

416
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Years before.

417
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It felt like Sunset Boulevard.

418
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I always whenever I see Sunset Boulevard

419
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I think of the first night with Tommy.

420
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
There's Hollywood reporters everywhere.

421
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
And he's like don't rush you.

422
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You can take if you like. I was like this is actually this could

423
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
work. So I remember I sleep on the floor

424
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
and he's in the

425
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
shower singing

426
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
A Whole New World from Aladdin.

427
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Whoa. Wow.

428
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
That ties it to us. Oh my god.

429
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Which he was singing by the way

430
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
in general. I don't know if I've heard it.

431
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Does he sing? Yeah he started to sing

432
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
more. Oh really? Oh interesting.

433
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Is this available anywhere? Is there an album?

434
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Yeah please. I'll send you. I got a link to

435
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
like a Christmas song that he sang. Whoa.

436
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Wow.

437
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
So he's singing A Whole New World.

438
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm sleeping on the floor and then he gets out

439
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
and he sleeps in the bed.

440
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It's a small

441
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
studio. Yeah.

442
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
So the bed's like right there and the door's somewhat closed

443
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
and I'm like kind of half asleep and I hear

444
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
somebody's chicken.

445
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Oh my god. Oh no.

446
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And so I just thought like oh just Tommy

447
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
being Tommy but yeah I think I am a chicken

448
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I'm gonna fall asleep. So I fell asleep.

449
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I end up convincing

450
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
my mom that I'm gonna take the apartment.

451
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
So I move down

452
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
to, I drive down

453
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
in my crappy car

454
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
that barely works. September 18th

455
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
1998. Drive down

456
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
to San Francisco. No plan.

457
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'm just going and I had the key.

458
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Drive down, get to Hollywood around

459
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
1.30 in the morning. I pull up to the apartment.

460
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I go up to the place.

461
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You know a lot of emotions

462
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
going on. You're like is this gonna work? What am I thinking?

463
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I didn't really pack much.

464
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Go to open the door.

465
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
The key doesn't work. So now I'm stranded

466
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
in Hollywood. Now you live in your car.

467
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Yeah now I'm stranded in Hollywood.

468
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
The strange man you followed didn't make

469
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
good. My mom told me

470
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
don't like don't do this. Big mistake.

471
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm like is she right?

472
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
So I go to the Chevron on

473
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Creston Heights and Sunset. I'm trying to collect

474
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
call. And he's like hi

475
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm listening. And I'm like your key doesn't work.

476
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Oh yes it does. You just don't know how to

477
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
do it. And I was like okay

478
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I need to find it's 2.30 in the morning now and

479
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I drive down Sunset Boulevard and

480
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
there's like it's so intimidating. There's like the

481
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
strip clubs packed with people.

482
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I have like little

483
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
to no cash and I pull up to a place called the

484
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Saharan Motel.

485
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
And the guy's like screaming at me your

486
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
car doesn't fit in here. Yelling.

487
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I ended up staying in there

488
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
that night and there was like at that point it was like a

489
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
stripper like hotel. Just like walking

490
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
in and out. So that's where I spent my first

491
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
night in Hollywood. A stripper motel.

492
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
What a deep end of Hollywood.

493
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I ended up getting the door

494
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
open eventually. And

495
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I got, I landed Iris

496
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Burton agency who represented

497
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
like Joaquin Phoenix, River Phoenix.

498
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
And on my fourth audition

499
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I

500
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
booked the lead in

501
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Retro Puppemaster. Wow. Wow.

502
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
And I just couldn't believe it was like such a crazy

503
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
turn of events. So I

504
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
go and I tell Tommy I go to San Francisco

505
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
and I say you're not going to believe this Tommy

506
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
but like thanks to you

507
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I booked the lead in this film.

508
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And his reaction you

509
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
start screaming oh my god I need

510
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
candy.

511
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
And he's like starts eating all

512
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
these chocolates and stuff so

513
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
so anyway I film

514
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Retro Puppemaster in Bucharest

515
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Romania. Wow.

516
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Straight from San Francisco to Hollywood

517
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
to Romania. Wow. Which was yeah

518
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
which was out there. And then so when I move back

519
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
to LA, when I come back to LA

520
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Tommy's now living in the apartment.

521
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Oh good. Good news. He's like

522
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
oh yeah if you can do it I can

523
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
do it too. So all of a sudden. You gotta be

524
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
glad to have him there just to ensure that you

525
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
don't become a chicken. True. True.

526
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Keep your chicken meter up.

527
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
So

528
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
now we're roommates.

529
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
And he's going hardcore at Hollywood.

530
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
He is sending his headshots out.

531
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
He's going like all out.

532
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
He's trying to audition. He's doing what you're doing.

533
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Yeah. So when I first got in

534
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I mailed out all my headshots with

535
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
the Iris Byrne agency logo. And I got a meeting

536
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
at Disney Studios like a general meeting

537
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
because they're like oh she represents

538
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Joaquin Phoenix or River Phoenix

539
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
or Kirsten Dunst like this she must

540
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
but it wasn't her sending out the headshots

541
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
it was me. Sure. So they're like

542
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Iris believes in this guy. She's like oh I just

543
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
signed him like he seems

544
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
like a cool kid. Like can he act?

545
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
A lot of good early buzz

546
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
from Retro Puppemaster. Yeah.

547
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
That was a tough one. One of the best Puppemaster films.

548
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
So Tommy

549
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
goes hardcore. It's a really toxic

550
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
living situation.

551
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
For many reasons he's up till

552
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
5 a.m. My agent

553
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
can't call because he'll pick up and be like

554
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
don't call here it's too early. Hang up.

555
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
So it was not going well.

556
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
And then I remember it was the Night of the Golden

557
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Globes that year. Talented Mr.

558
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Ripley was nominated. I took him to see it.

559
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And he's like he

560
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
watches the film. He really gets

561
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
into it. And he tells me

562
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
after. He's like you know Hollywood think this is

563
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
drama. Well I'm sorry. They have surprise

564
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
coming. I will write a movie

565
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
and when people see my movie they will

566
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
not sleep for two weeks.

567
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I was like alright.

568
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
He's called the room. He knew

569
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
that already. He's called the room.

570
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It all takes place in one room.

571
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I will play Johnny. Sort of.

572
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It was

573
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
supposed to be an early idea.

574
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Like a theatrical play initially.

575
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
He's saying you will play Mark like

576
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
this guy Mark Damon.

577
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Mark's last name is

578
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Damon?

579
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It was supposed to be based on

580
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Matt Damon. But because of

581
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Talented Mr. Ripley he's trying to like

582
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
re-imagine the story.

583
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Wow that's interesting.

584
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
But he called him Mark Damon so that's why it's Mark.

585
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Mark Damon is a misremembering.

586
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Whoa that's incredible mythology.

587
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
So he's like that's what's going to happen. So he starts

588
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
writing the script while we're roommates.

589
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
And he's now separated the apartment.

590
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
So now he's got the living room

591
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
locked off with these

592
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
black curtains. I have the bedroom now.

593
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
So now he's the chicken.

594
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And so he's typing and typing

595
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
and he'd yell out like Greg how long is movie

596
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
script? How do you format? He'd ask me all

597
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
these questions. And so this

598
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
goes on for a few months and then

599
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
remember he was taking acting

600
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
classes on Brian Reese

601
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
studio like cold reading classes.

602
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
And he just tells me one night like I just don't think

603
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
like I fit in here and I think I'm going to take a break.

604
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
And he like disappears

605
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
for nine months. I don't know where he went.

606
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I get these cryptic phone calls.

607
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It's got to be a relief on some

608
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
level. You get nine months to yourself.

609
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I was kind of worried like where

610
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
did he go? Because he was so big on

611
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
the acting thing. Big on the script and he just disappeared.

612
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And then it was

613
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
so that but nine

614
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
months later I had like moved

615
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I was living across the street. A buddy of mine

616
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
moved to London to do like tech

617
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
stuff at the time. It was like 2000. So

618
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
that was booming. So I wasn't even

619
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
living in that apartment. And then Tommy

620
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
comes back. I remember the day May 7th

621
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
2001. He says

622
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm coming back from San Francisco. I want to see you.

623
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
So I go back over to the apartment

624
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
and he hands me a script

625
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
called The Room.

626
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
He's like I want you to read this here. You can't

627
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
take home. Like when you meet

628
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
on a marvel. Yeah right.

629
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Christopher Nolan.

630
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And so I sit there initially thinking

631
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
he's going to sort of reveal what's happened to him

632
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
in the last nine months.

633
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
And so I start reading it and I'm just

634
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
like this is my favorite thing ever. Every

635
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
character sounds like Tommy.

636
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I'm very busy. I'm very busy. You're my

637
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
best friend. Peter you're my best friend.

638
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Everyone coming and going all the time.

639
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Everyone has somewhere to be. Enters

640
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
rooms. Immediately leaves rooms. No matter what

641
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
your age is you always have

642
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
somewhere else you have to go goodbye.

643
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It was always like hello how are you today? Peter's like

644
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
did you get any clients Lisa?

645
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
No I didn't. Maybe tomorrow will be your

646
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
lucky day. It was like AI before

647
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
AI. And also

648
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
well to speak to our you know like Mike's

649
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
improv history the thing they tell

650
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
you like don't just have characters introduce

651
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
themselves to each other. Come in say

652
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
hello and then get like it

653
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
is like it violates all these like rules

654
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
of what make interesting scenes you know.

655
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Yeah and it was just so him

656
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
and he's like so what do you think?

657
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
You see reflections of your life?

658
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
And I was like I do I do.

659
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And that's how like it

660
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
started. He's like we need to make this

661
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
this film. We need to make this.

662
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
A few weird

663
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
things went down where he was like

664
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
wanted me to help him cast it and then

665
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
my girlfriend at the time read

666
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
it and some of the dialogue

667
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
she read out loud and it was one of the funniest

668
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
scenes. I wish it was in the film but it ended up

669
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
getting changed but it's like Michelle tells

670
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Lisa oh I thought the wedding was all

671
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
playing with Johnny. How was Mark in bed?

672
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
It was like out of nowhere

673
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
out of nowhere and so she reads it she's like you're not

674
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
doing this.

675
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
So like there's this fallout because Tommy's

676
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
like you believe girl over me

677
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
and my god. Was it hard also

678
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
to now you're like you're eschewing

679
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
important people in your life to follow

680
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
this man. And I was telling her at the time that

681
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Tommy was my cousin.

682
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I knew she wouldn't get it.

683
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I knew she would think like this is

684
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
If this is a person you can leave

685
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
at any time why would you not leave him?

686
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Yeah exactly and so she didn't understand we had

687
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
like a bond starting from the acting class

688
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
like we both really wanted to make

689
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
movies and she would I knew she wouldn't get that.

690
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
So we had we had kind of like a little break

691
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
and then

692
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
it was August it was August

693
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
of 2002 he tells

694
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
me Greg I will give

695
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
you one job because we're going to move into this other

696
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
apartment I was trying to figure out what I was going to do.

697
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I offer you a hundred dollars

698
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
come over 3 p.m. So I go over to

699
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
his apartment and he's got like five thousand

700
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
headshots because he put an ad

701
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
for Backstage West for the room.

702
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
He's like open headshot

703
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
pay you a hundred dollars. So I was like oh okay.

704
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
So I start opening headshots

705
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
and I was like

706
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
this is really therapeutic because now I'm

707
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
seeing what other

708
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
people are seeing behind the scenes

709
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
casting and all that. So I start opening all these

710
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
headshots and I all of a sudden

711
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
instantly become like the casting director

712
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
for the room.

713
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
And Tommy's got these HD cameras

714
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
like bought all the equipment. So I

715
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
go with him and I set up the

716
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
cameras and I call in all these

717
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
actors and honestly

718
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
watching Tommy audition

719
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
actors was the funniest thing

720
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I've ever seen. Because people come in

721
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
and they're like

722
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
hey do you have a script? No

723
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
get in front of camera. They're like whoa

724
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
okay oh just up on your feet.

725
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Okay you just won one million dollars

726
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
and they're like

727
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
so cut

728
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
where is acting?

729
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
And this

730
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
went on for weeks. It was the greatest

731
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
time ever. So that's

732
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
how it all started.

733
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I wasn't going to be Mark

734
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
because I was like I don't think I should be in this.

735
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
At this point you're like

736
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
does this do me any good

737
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
to have my face in this movie?

738
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Might be a big detriment in fact.

739
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
And back then it was a lot tighter. Indie film wasn't

740
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
something that was thriving

741
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
the way it is now. So it was like I was auditioning

742
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
for Terminator 3.

743
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I had done Days of Our Lives so

744
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
this was something that

745
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I was still aspiring

746
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
was something that like

747
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
more like would never go anywhere

748
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
because of the way the situation was set up.

749
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
You would imagine. You're like this is cool.

750
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
You're going to make a movie. What is that?

751
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
This odd guy wants to make a movie.

752
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
What could possibly become of that?

753
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Yeah and I figured okay it's something he wanted to do

754
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
but he was taking it so seriously. But I was

755
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
sort of the glue

756
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
that was holding it all together. I was the one that they would come to

757
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
and be like is this legit?

758
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
You seem cool. What are you doing here?

759
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
And they'd be like is this really going to happen?

760
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
So I was sort of the one keeping it together

761
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
but what I will say is

762
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
making The Room was the best

763
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
film school because

764
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
so much was on my back to produce it and keep

765
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
it going that I realized how

766
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
the general sense

767
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
of producing a movie goes.

768
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And it was like dealing with people

769
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
and the DP and what they need

770
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
and the morale on a set.

771
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
So it was such a crazy experience

772
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
and it opened me up to not just wanting

773
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
to like act but also

774
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
be involved in behind the scenes

775
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
writing, producing.

776
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
It was such a crazy

777
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
gift to go through that

778
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
and see how it works

779
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
on the other side. And in some cases

780
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
like the worst case

781
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
scenario. Yeah it was like how important

782
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
collaboration is.

783
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Because it was like

784
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
it was Tommy's vision and then

785
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
the actors didn't have a script. So they're like

786
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
wow. You know so it was

787
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
he had this vision

788
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
that no one else. That could not be strayed from

789
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
seemingly. That's what's odd is everybody

790
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
you feel everybody like stuck

791
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
doing precisely the

792
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
strange specific words

793
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
of this guy. But

794
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
you feel everybody like

795
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
trying to like break out and find

796
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
meaning in these phrases that like seem

797
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
like nothing just on their

798
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
face. It's the most like auteur

799
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
driven movie.

800
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Like one single vision.

801
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Yes. Because even even the greatest

802
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
directors there's plenty of people they rely

803
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
on. But this does feel like everyone's coming

804
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
came together to try to channel this

805
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
one man's brain. And

806
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
then that also it also taught me how

807
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
important it is to have a vision.

808
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Sure. You know because it's like

809
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
if he just kind

810
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
of went and improv'd it and whatever he wouldn't have

811
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
that intense

812
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
emotional strange charm.

813
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Oh sure. It has to be plotted out

814
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
to some extent. Yeah. Yeah. Because if you just

815
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
if they just like literally improvise the whole

816
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
thing. I think the thing that's so hypnotic

817
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
about it is that everything like

818
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
it seems every line feels like it

819
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
should have like meaning

820
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
or something behind it. But what

821
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
does it mean? Why does everybody just come in

822
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
and then leave immediately and like

823
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
all these odd phrases and we see

824
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
you should not think too much.

825
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
It may not come out right. What is this?

826
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Why does this have scary music behind it?

827
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Why are they on a rooftop?

828
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Why do people keep falling? It's just

829
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
an endless series of lies

830
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
that 20 years later

831
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
there's still no real answer for most of

832
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
them. Yeah. It's like these things that

833
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
could almost work like randomly

834
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Denny looks at Mark

835
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
and they have a moment it's like oh did he

836
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
look at him because like the drugs are on the roof

837
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
or there's just all these questions

838
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
that sort of line up. And I think it all

839
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
came down to

840
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
you know the earnest

841
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
creative expression, the frustration

842
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
of whatever Tommy had gone through in life

843
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
was just represented

844
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
in that film. Geez. Yeah. So Mission

845
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Accomplished. Well so that's alright

846
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
to start bringing it into the

847
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
well 2003 where our paths

848
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
merge finally.

849
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
So this

850
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
you make the film, you finish

851
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
the film and you get like

852
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
miraculously a little like theatrical

853
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
run. You get to what it's two

854
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
theaters in Los Angeles for

855
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
two weeks and you did

856
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
a screening, you did a premiere.

857
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Am I correct that there were

858
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
spotlights during the day

859
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
at the premiere? Yes. Yep.

860
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Those were Tommy's spotlights that he brought out.

861
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
He owned them? Yeah.

862
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
God the mystery

863
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
of this guy. How do you own spotlights?

864
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
He would use them at his stores in

865
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
retail stores in San Francisco. I helped him a few

866
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
nights on Haight Street and he'd put the Sky

867
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Trackers on Haight Street.

868
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Really? Wow. People were like, sale let's all

869
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
go. So I think he again he utilized

870
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
a lot of those marketing skills. And that's what some of

871
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
it is. He owned all these weird stores in San

872
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Francisco. I mean you get into some of

873
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
this in the book and the way you go to San Francisco with him

874
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
and he just has a key for everything.

875
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Just a

876
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
enigma. It's so fascinating.

877
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
But so at this

878
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
juncture there's a premiere

879
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
it's going to

880
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
be in theaters for two weeks. Do you have

881
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
any sense of

882
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
what did you think was going to happen at that

883
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
point? Nothing.

884
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I just remember I went to the premier

885
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I was moving places in LA

886
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
and I just

887
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
had given so much of my life to helping

888
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Tommy getting the film done.

889
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Five years?

890
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
You give him five years of your life.

891
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Yeah it had been

892
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
quite a journey especially

893
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
producing the room. I was there through the whole

894
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
thing and helped him with post and

895
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I think I was like yeah okay

896
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
you put the billboard up, the premiere

897
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
and that was it. I figured I would just move on

898
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
the project was done

899
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
so I went to the premiere

900
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
and it was really funny to finally

901
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
have an audience watch it that had no idea

902
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
what was going on.

903
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I remember these two critics in the lobby talking

904
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
like they walked out like ten minutes in

905
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
and the one guy said to his buddy I'll never get

906
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
hard again.

907
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
So that was funny

908
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
but I thought

909
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
If you haven't seen the room, and by the way

910
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
big encouragement to any of our audience

911
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
to see the room if you haven't seen the room

912
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
but the treat of Tommy

913
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
with his naked backside

914
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
which isn't even, you see his butt

915
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
during the sex scenes

916
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
but then you really see it when he just

917
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
gets up to go to the bathroom

918
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
and that's another why.

919
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
All nudity in film has some

920
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
intention, either it's for

921
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
sensual purposes

922
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
or it's to show somebody's vulnerability

923
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
and this is just like I'm going to go to Cannes

924
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
and you just follow him naked for no

925
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
what does that do other than

926
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
making the audience all yell and recoil?

927
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
You know what he told me right before that?

928
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
He said Greg I have to do it.

929
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I was like

930
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
what now?

931
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I have to show my ass to sell this movie.

932
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
He's like you know Brando would do it

933
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
and I was like

934
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
yeah it's true but I thought that was it

935
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
and then he literally went out and straight

936
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
up did it.

937
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
So maybe that was the most calculated

938
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
thing of like this is going to help

939
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
sell it. Like he literally

940
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
a little nudity is making him

941
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
titillate people and make them excited

942
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
to see it. Yeah mission accomplished.

943
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I also think it was

944
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
his chance to be

945
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Brando, James Dean leading man

946
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
and he was just going to go all out for it

947
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
and I think he had no idea

948
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
what it was going to turn into so he was truly

949
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
that's what's so authentic about it. You're seeing

950
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
a guy who's really shooting for the stars.

951
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Wow. Yeah and you feel

952
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
his influences. He wears those

953
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
on his sleeve in such a beautiful

954
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
way. But I guess

955
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
okay so at this point

956
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I thought that was it.

957
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I thought it would show for two weeks and

958
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
it's hard to get even

959
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
good films traction right?

960
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Movies come out and then they have a LA

961
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
premiere and they're good and then that's

962
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
it so I thought for sure this was going to be

963
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
like he did his thing and now it's time

964
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
to move on. Did you maybe

965
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
want no one to see it just in case

966
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
because you are in these odd sex

967
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
scenes? I did laugh

968
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
when because with the premiere he had

969
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
a few people review it so I

970
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
did kind of in a sick way want that

971
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
review where people were like what

972
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
in the hell did happen

973
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
and so in the review somebody

974
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
called my character something really funny so I

975
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
laughed about it but I just

976
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
did not think it could ever gain traction

977
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
in a serious way. I thought a few people

978
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
would see it and I really wanted

979
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
that cringe that audience to

980
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
experience the cringe but that was about

981
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
it. Sure sure just like alright

982
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
well I saw this through this has been an interesting

983
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
experience so I guess

984
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
now cut to

985
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
17 year old Scott Gardner

986
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
the summer between

987
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
high school and college

988
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
and I am bored

989
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
also I'm not

990
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
doing much kind of a listless time

991
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
for me and an angsty

992
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
time being in that like that middle

993
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
gap and college nerds and I

994
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I just

995
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
remember watching TV

996
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
like kind of like some

997
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
local channel and then seeing an ad

998
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
for this movie

999
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
which mainly just

1000
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
struck me as like it probably was barely

1001
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
holding my attention just like okay

1002
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
so this is some like odd pretentious

1003
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
little like independent drama or

1004
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
something until

1005
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Tom Uso yells you're

1006
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
tearing me apart Lisa and

1007
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
that was this instant

1008
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
earworm there's just this like

1009
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
you know there's just such a

1010
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
call from that

1011
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
like you can't forget it so it stuck in my head

1012
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I'm like that's interesting okay let me

1013
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
file that away just like maybe I'll

1014
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
mention this to somebody some day and then

1015
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
a week

1016
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
or so later I'm in the car

1017
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
with my friends David Nelson

1018
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
and Michael Rousselet

1019
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Michael Rousselet later of if any

1020
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
listeners have ever seen five second films

1021
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
of the movie Dude Bro Party Massacre 3

1022
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
which you are in Greg

1023
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
a great guy so

1024
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
we're just like tooling around

1025
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
the valley board

1026
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
trying to think of some way to kill the day

1027
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
and I'm like

1028
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
hey has anybody seen this weird

1029
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
ad where this guy yells you're tearing me

1030
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
apart and I will never forget

1031
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
the look on Mike's face where he

1032
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
spins around with just

1033
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
like bloodshot intensity in his

1034
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
eyes and he says yes

1035
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
what the hell is that

1036
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
like he'd also been thinking about it for a week

1037
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
but nobody to share it with and it's pre

1038
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
not pre internet but pre YouTube instead

1039
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
so like there's no way to like now there might be a way

1040
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
to like track that and what was that

1041
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
but it's just been like gnawing

1042
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
at him and me too and then like

1043
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
oh my god that yeah well what is

1044
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
that we gotta figure out what that is and we went

1045
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
searching I think one of us remembered the name of the movie

1046
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
and god is there any way we could see that oh that's

1047
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
what we should do we should go see that movie

1048
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
well how do we see it oh my god

1049
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
it is playing at the literal closest

1050
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
movie theater to us

1051
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
what are the odds of that so we

1052
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
just get so punch

1053
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
drunk on this idea that we could

1054
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
like oh we're gonna do it we're gonna go watch

1055
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
it but assuming that we would encounter

1056
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
something that is like vaguely

1057
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
funny three times because

1058
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
this is the thing when you're fishing with kind

1059
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
of crazy bad movies is like

1060
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
the death of it

1061
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
is always boring like a bunch

1062
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
just a big murk which is what

1063
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
you know most are honestly

1064
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
that's what I expected

1065
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
maybe there'll be some weird hidden treasure

1066
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
in this we walk up to the

1067
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
box office of the Lemley

1068
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Fallbrook 7 and we

1069
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
have shading and grins on our faces

1070
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
and we say three for the room

1071
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
please and the person

1072
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
behind the counter smirks

1073
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
and just like has to stifle laughter

1074
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
and then like

1075
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
do her job

1076
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
his job I forget who it was but the but

1077
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
this person then puts their

1078
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
just like breaks a little

1079
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
bit gets themselves together

1080
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
and then says would you like to see

1081
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
a review

1082
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
of the room yes we would

1083
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
that sounds great puts a review

1084
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
up that is printed out puts

1085
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
it up to the window of the box

1086
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
office and immediately there's that

1087
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
line this film is like getting stabbed in

1088
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
the head and now

1089
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
we're like hang on we are in for a lot

1090
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
more than I think we anticipated

1091
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
that we ever would be

1092
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
then this person

1093
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
immediately like stifles a little more laughter

1094
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
and would you like a copy of the soundtrack

1095
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
of the room what sound

1096
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
tracks are but I'm getting presents

1097
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
from this movie what have we entered

1098
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
here so like we're only getting

1099
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
more giggly as we as we walk in

1100
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
the lights go down

1101
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
with so films big ostentatious

1102
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
logo oh my god there's

1103
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
a production company behind this credit

1104
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
start you know just

1105
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
pretty like sincere seeming film the only odd

1106
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
thing is that his name is almost every

1107
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
credit but we are still

1108
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
just kind of like giggly where's this going

1109
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
and then he opens the door a moment

1110
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I will never ever forget in

1111
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
my life is the first time hearing him

1112
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
open the door and say hi

1113
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
babe and we

1114
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
it's just euphoria

1115
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
like we've never like

1116
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
the tension was building and building

1117
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
and then just erupted there was something orgasmic

1118
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
about this experience honestly

1119
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
not to be uncomfortable but just

1120
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
the but but truly where it's

1121
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
just like full body and then

1122
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
everything he says is in that tone

1123
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
and then his scenes and then a odd

1124
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
man child comes in a kid who they live

1125
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
with Denny who's this and then every other

1126
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
scene is a sexy and I don't need to recap the

1127
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
whole movie but just the point is we were

1128
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
so just like this

1129
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
delivered out of the gate

1130
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
in a bigger way than we'd ever imagined

1131
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
the thing I always say about it like

1132
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
every every it is

1133
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
as funny

1134
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
as often as a sitcom is supposed

1135
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
to be you know like the way like a sitcom

1136
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
they're like checking the jokes

1137
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
off like okay five per page

1138
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
that was this like I've just never

1139
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
seen anything like it so

1140
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
we stay in the theater

1141
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
the credits start rolling and we're like boy

1142
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
that boy that was something all right well you want to go

1143
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Michael Russoley says no

1144
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
we're not leaving we are

1145
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I'm calling every let's we all

1146
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
have to do it we all have to call everyone

1147
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
in our phone and get them to come here

1148
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
right now we're rolling this into

1149
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
the next screening wow

1150
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I didn't realize that right now and I

1151
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
can't argue against that because like that's insane

1152
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
what do you mean

1153
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
did you have to pay for it again

1154
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
well the dicey thing we know

1155
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
we just rolled through nobody asked about

1156
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
it some people came in and paid

1157
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
other people were like

1158
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
what are you talking about I don't want to do that that sounds like shit

1159
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
and Mike said we will open

1160
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
the theater doors and sneak you in

1161
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
go into the alley so apologies

1162
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
for cutting into the box office

1163
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
back then but it seems like everything worked out

1164
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
how many people were in the theater first that screening

1165
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
the first one oh good question

1166
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
so it was just me and my friends David

1167
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
and Mike and then

1168
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
a couple pockets there was a group of

1169
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
two and a group of two and this was part

1170
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
of the like strange like

1171
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
you know just

1172
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
full body shivers of the whole thing is that

1173
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
we were trying to stifle laughter

1174
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
but it was impossible because we were like who are

1175
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
those people and did they work on the movie

1176
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
or something and then

1177
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
two of them left

1178
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
midway through so few okay so they're

1179
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
said two of them stayed

1180
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
and then we asked like

1181
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
did you have anything to do with that or whatever

1182
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
and one of them just said worst

1183
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
goddamn movie I've ever seen in my life and then kept walking

1184
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
so we're fine we're fine

1185
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
so the next screening I think we're clear we'll just

1186
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
load this up with people

1187
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I think like ten people came the next night

1188
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
we went back probably like

1189
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
twenty to thirty people

1190
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
the next night which was the final night of the run

1191
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I think sixty people

1192
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
now we're like passing booze around we're all just like

1193
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
disgustingly sharing like one

1194
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
giant glass bottle of smirnoff

1195
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
that's just like going down the road

1196
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
so it's just it's becoming a fucking party

1197
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I think that bottle shattered it's just like

1198
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
it's a big fucking mess of

1199
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
a party

1200
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
and then it ended and we thought well

1201
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
that was that we got to experience this

1202
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
thing but we may never see this again

1203
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
did you know any of that was going on during

1204
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
that wow wow geez crazy

1205
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
because I think there was us and then the other one

1206
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
was in like mid-wilshire

1207
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
kind of neck of woods and I think a little group

1208
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
might have found it there so then it became

1209
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
this odd thing of like stalking the

1210
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
movie like are we ever going to get the chance

1211
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
to see this thing again and

1212
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
we were worried it would never happen and then

1213
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I'm checking the website every day

1214
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
these are my strongest memories of the beginning

1215
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
of college I should have been partying

1216
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I should have been trying to get laid I wasn't

1217
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
doing any of this so much room

1218
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
and then the room ended up being like this

1219
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
big ice breaker for me it became like the way

1220
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
that I like here I have a personality

1221
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I know about this weird movie you have to come see it

1222
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
they're showing it at this office building so anyway

1223
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
we're and then finally you guys

1224
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
start somebody start showing it

1225
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
oh you were saying the son

1226
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
of Carl Lemley founder of

1227
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Universal Studios see there is theme park

1228
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
talk in this you'll see and more and more

1229
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
to come we'll get into it with Greg cause there's a lot to talk about

1230
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
but that was a mind blower

1231
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
that Carl Lemley's son

1232
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
starts putting screenings together

1233
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
so it becomes a once a month

1234
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
thing yeah I would show it the Lemley Sunset 5

1235
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
last Saturday of every month

1236
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
and I would do the voice recording

1237
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
on the machine

1238
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
that Tommy had on the billboard he had a phone number

1239
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
which used to be my home phone number

1240
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
oh yes I would call that number wow

1241
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
that was you that used to be my own and then so I

1242
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
he would have me do the recording like hey

1243
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
come see the room last Saturday

1244
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
of every month well that sounds familiar cause

1245
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
you're trying to unravel the mystery like it's the billboard

1246
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
has a number to call and then you call it

1247
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
and it's mark answers

1248
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
that's wild yeah

1249
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
what's happening so we all are like

1250
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
what is happening on the other side of this

1251
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
and then I imagine at some point it happened to you

1252
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
too that like wait people are coming

1253
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
to this like there is a weird little audience

1254
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
so speaking of icebreakers

1255
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
it's funny it did the same thing for me cause

1256
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
now we're now we're 2005

1257
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
and it's the last Saturday of every month for free

1258
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
and so I'd be going around LA

1259
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
driving meeting people and I have the room postcards

1260
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
in my car and so I'd be like hey

1261
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I see this girl or whatever I'd be like hey

1262
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
hey what's up what's up you got this

1263
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
this going on I did this you know movie or whatever

1264
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
and then be like an icebreaker

1265
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
hopefully at that time I was like hoping they'd never

1266
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
show up but I remember there's this

1267
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
girl from South Africa I was talking to her at Starbucks

1268
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
and then she called me later she's like

1269
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
you know in her accent she said I don't mean to be mean but this movie

1270
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
looks like shite

1271
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
she's like you're in this

1272
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
so I remember I was doing that

1273
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
and then I went to a couple screenings

1274
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
in like 2005

1275
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I think I remember you guys

1276
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
were there and it was like a group of like

1277
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
40 sure and the spoons were

1278
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
starting oh boy great and so

1279
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
this is a whole wait let me say that

1280
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
really quickly that again if you

1281
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
might be very lost if you don't know the movie just watch the movie

1282
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
it's wonderful it's such a rewarding

1283
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
treasure of a movie get the where do people

1284
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
watch it now is it still DVD the main way to

1285
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Blu-ray and Blu-ray I

1286
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I owe a purchase of the Blu-ray I gotta

1287
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
see what's up with the Blu-ray but

1288
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
one of the odd aspects of it

1289
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
is that there is a framed photo

1290
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
of a spoon that's visible in many

1291
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
shots which I remember the discovery

1292
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
of that probably in the third time that we watched it

1293
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
whereas I think Michael Risalea yelled

1294
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
there's a picture of a spoon up there

1295
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
and then like it was so lit up about it so then

1296
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
the next night he's like

1297
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
here's an idea got

1298
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
an idea this is what's going to make

1299
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
it rocky horror we should bring

1300
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
plastic spoons and throw them at the screen

1301
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
and my now wife Aaron

1302
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
was part of our like so the group

1303
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
that was like starting to see this in these early

1304
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
days and she discouraged

1305
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
this from happening she

1306
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
was like you cannot do that that's going to make

1307
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
such a mess all these theater employees

1308
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
are going to have to clean those things up you gotta think about that

1309
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
so she almost killed you

1310
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
well now you've seen like what it like

1311
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
she probably could have saved

1312
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
in her success she could have saved a lot of

1313
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
cleanup around the world like I've been

1314
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
oh wow yeah people come armed

1315
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
with spoons like around the world

1316
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
that's the biggest mind-blower to me

1317
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
the movie for sure but specifically

1318
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
the spoon thing being there for

1319
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
like remembering someone

1320
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
having that idea and now knowing

1321
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
that spoons are thrown

1322
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
in Russia all over the world

1323
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
where have you because and this is a whole other

1324
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000

showing this movie now and

1326
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000

1346
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000

1347
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
and obviously we're gonna head into

1348
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
music parks up but I've been stopped at

1349
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Disneyland Disney World like

1350
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
the employees oh hi Mark

1351
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
oh wow everybody like

1352
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
a stormtrooper or Kylo

1353
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
you ever got like somebody in character

1354
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
did I send you the video wait I saw

1355
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
you post it I didn't want to put the sound on

1356
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
opposite and I think it was the guy

1357
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
who was playing Kylo is friends

1358
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
with somebody from Alan the draft house who

1359
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
recognized came up and I was like

1360
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
this is weird you don't really try to get their

1361
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
attention but they totally trolled me

1362
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
and the stormtrooper was like what have you done

1363
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
with the wookie and I was like

1364
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
everyone stared at me I was like I think

1365
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
he's that way

1366
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
but the no the spoon thing

1367
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
is like you guys are like the fact

1368
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
that you guys discovered that and it's become

1369
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
a worldwide like that's what everybody

1370
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
thought the publisher when I wrote disaster

1371
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
is wanted the cover of the book

1372
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
to be a spoon wow

1373
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
wow oh my god it's the icon

1374
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
of the whole well this is the whole

1375
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I mean like basically

1376
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
the like the

1377
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
at least my personal journey

1378
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
through this movie has always

1379
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
been so like positive

1380
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
and magical and like

1381
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
you know just like we said like it being

1382
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
this icebreaker and then like getting to the other

1383
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
side and like meeting you and the other people

1384
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
who are part of it like oh my god everybody's

1385
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
everybody's like cool and excited

1386
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
about it and like deriving positivity from

1387
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
it and then watching that honestly that

1388
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
that spoon that watching that

1389
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
grow from like I remember somebody having that idea

1390
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
to it happens all over the world the fact

1391
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
that I encountered the movie

1392
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
on the way to film school basically

1393
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
in a very like precarious

1394
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
summer in a summer of a lot of fear and like I'm

1395
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
gonna go chase my dream

1396
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
but is there any chance that I would ever

1397
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
do anything that anyone would ever see

1398
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
or that would spread or that anyone

1399
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
would ever respond to

1400
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
the room and the spoons

1401
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
and all of it always was this like

1402
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
beacon of hope for like wow

1403
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
if that can happen what else can happen

1404
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
if you just like make something

1405
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
that you try to do sincerely

1406
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
and try to have a vision for

1407
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
as you were saying so honestly

1408
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
let me just say sincerely like

1409
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
how inspiring the whole thing

1410
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
has been for me and like everything I've gotten

1411
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
to do since all the videos I've made this podcast

1412
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
it just like it like

1413
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
all provided an example of

1414
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
like you can start

1415
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
something with no audience and

1416
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
have it grow and have like tons

1417
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
of strangers be into it and be excited about it

1418
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
with no budget or

1419
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
that's another important thing yes

1420
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
as all things start as

1421
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
this podcast started as well

1422
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
it's just the power of getting started

1423
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
people wait for the perfect time

1424
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
or the perfect project and it's like

1425
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
you just gotta get out there and try

1426
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
and I think what comes with that may not be

1427
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
the first time maybe you meet somebody

1428
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
on the second project and you find your voice

1429
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
but it's really one of those things

1430
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
like I didn't expect anything

1431
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
from the room of anything I've ever done in my

1432
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
entire life it was the last

1433
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
thing that I thought would ever connect

1434
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
with people and it's just

1435
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
so fascinating it's like such a great lesson

1436
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
with film never look down upon

1437
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
something never think something is

1438
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
you just don't know and

1439
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
what's so interesting is like hearing

1440
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
your story I mean I've told your story

1441
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
to audiences for years

1442
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
watching this film like getting stabbed

1443
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
in the head that you guys saw

1444
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
I imagine I said all that when

1445
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
you interviewed me 10 years ago

1446
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
but what I'm wondering

1447
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
like do you think there's some sort

1448
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
of destiny like there's

1449
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
something there

1450
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
with the room like you guys were sort of the

1451
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
voice of that generation

1452
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
do you know what I mean like

1453
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
that's a weighty thing too

1454
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I don't know if I can speak to that

1455
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I don't know if that's my mantle to take

1456
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I think about it I think where you were at

1457
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
in your guys' life

1458
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
like the openness and maybe you guys were

1459
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
kind of that first audience that

1460
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
was could get

1461
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
like your minds were in a place

1462
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
where you could get it I don't think

1463
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
my parents didn't get it like my mom said

1464
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
oh hi Mark so I was in it but you

1465
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
guys were really the first audience that could

1466
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
sit there and

1467
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
be like

1468
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
digested the way it was meant to be

1469
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
digested

1470
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
I hope so that's an honor if you're saying that and by the way

1471
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
you legitimized

1472
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
it has always meant a lot to me that you

1473
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
put credit Mike

1474
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
and I in the book and as a picture

1475
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
of us in your but like it has always felt

1476
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
wonderful to like because you know sometimes you can feel

1477
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
like you know a hipster like oh I was

1478
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
there like yeah you're trying to like

1479
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
insert yourself as a I knew about this

1480
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
thing before but you like giving us any

1481
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
sort of credit for that has always been very

1482
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
meaningful but I

1483
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
yeah I mean I think what

1484
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I think hopefully what we all

1485
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
love about and what continues to resonate about it for us

1486
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
is the like the psychology at

1487
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
play you're not just watching the movie

1488
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
you know that there's a story here

1489
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
and that it all stems from the

1490
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
odd psychology of Tommy and as

1491
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
you were saying Mike he really does get like

1492
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
has anyone

1493
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
like put their unique

1494
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
brain into a

1495
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
movie more successfully

1496
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
I don't that somebody I was literally watching

1497
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
a video this morning about Stephen Soderbergh and somebody's

1498
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
like you know he does all the things himself

1499
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
and he edits while he's going and I'm like yeah

1500
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
that's true that like that is kind of rare because most

1501
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
you know big people yeah they they have

1502
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
other people they rely on to do a few

1503
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
of the things and they get the input but this

1504
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
the way especially hearing you describe it I'm like

1505
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
oh it's like he literally

1506
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
shaped it

1507
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
all directly

1508
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
yeah yeah I got a crazy

1509
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
story about you bring up Stephen Soderbergh

1510
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
I mean this is just like hard hitting

1511
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
but Simon Schuster

1512
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
sent a copy of my book The Disaster Artist

1513
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
to David Fincher yeah David

1514
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Fincher received it and looked at it and

1515
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
said oh the

1516
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
room my friend Stephen Soderbergh

1517
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
is obsessed with this film wow

1518
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
and like hearing David

1519
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Fincher say that I was

1520
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
like yeah oh

1521
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
my god wow

1522
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
I mean you're talking about like our and then

1523
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
another crazy story I was at the Palm

1524
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Spring Film Festival when The Disaster Artist came out

1525
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
and Paul Thomas Anderson was there for Phantom Threat

1526
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
and he was standing alone at the bar

1527
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
and I thought I'm just going to

1528
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
go up and I was sitting with the organizer of the festival

1529
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
and I went up to him and I said hey

1530
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
your films Boogie Nights and The Master

1531
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
really inspired me when I was writing The Disaster Artist

1532
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
and he just like shook my hand and said oh thank you

1533
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
and then I walked away and I was like oh my god

1534
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I shook like Paul Thomas and I'm talking

1535
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
to Jen who was like one of the PR

1536
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
people and so he walked away

1537
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
and went to the other organizer

1538
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
and said oh my

1539
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
I'm a little starstruck I met the guy from The Room

1540
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
and so I thought

1541
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
like

1542
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
what is this like yeah

1543
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
crazy world we're living in

1544
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
where somehow that

1545
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
movie has tapped into all the people

1546
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
you would have dreamt of working with

1547
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
in like such a twisted

1548
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
strange way I would like

1549
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
you know what you could have ever, as a struggling actor

1550
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
you missed a part in this movie like how could you

1551
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
have ever imagined like on the others

1552
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
in 20 years this is your path

1553
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
to all of cinemas greats

1554
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
yeah it's so it's such a

1555
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
twisted joke how

1556
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
you know and I used to always say out of the room

1557
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
like it's so bad I don't watch it but then like

1558
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
once anything

1559
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
any art has traveled for

1560
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
20 years and people still talk about

1561
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
it and watch it and it's been through generations

1562
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
like you guys were the first one that's now

1563
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
in 2025

1564
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
I can't really like

1565
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
judge it that way because it's like any

1566
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
film I ever do or make or

1567
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
like I would hope that like

1568
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
the dream is that people still consume it

1569
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
20 years later like it still works

1570
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
like something timeless

1571
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
and I'm like damn how did like

1572
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
how did it pull it off the strangest possible

1573
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
path there ever could have been to

1574
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
one of those well let me let me bring

1575
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
let me bring things of you know into our

1576
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
territory here a little bit and say so here's another

1577
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
so we hadn't I don't think we hadn't

1578
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
spoken since I you interviewed

1579
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
me for the this video that you've been

1580
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
showing when you tour the movie

1581
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
you show this little documentary you did about it

1582
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
and then you and then you show the film

1583
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
and you were showing it at this

1584
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
venue in Pittsburgh

1585
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
that we would really love to

1586
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
play at some point Bottle Rock at Social Hall

1587
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Chris Copen is the owner's name

1588
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
and I

1589
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
think so he was

1590
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
he was hosting you for your

1591
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
tour and the video

1592
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
before it comes up and I'm in it

1593
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
and he approaches you after and says

1594
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
wait a minute you know Scott Garner wait why is

1595
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Scott Garner in this what's going on here yeah he's like

1596
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
how did you get Scott Garner in here

1597
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
and I was like oh he's like one of the original

1598
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
who launched the room he's like no he

1599
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
has oh he's like I know you love

1600
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Disney you're always a Disney world like

1601
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
he has the best podcast

1602
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
about like music you gotta listen

1603
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
to it I'm like of course Scott does

1604
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
so that morning I

1605
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
reached out to Scott and I started listening

1606
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
to podcasts right all the way

1607
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
driving like across

1608
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
which then

1609
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
has caused a bunch of discussion

1610
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
for a while between you and

1611
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
I which has been such a delight the discovery

1612
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
that with all the okay there's

1613
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
that whole shared odd history that we

1614
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
have and the weird way that we met and now

1615
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
on top of it you are a mega

1616
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Disney parks person a mega

1617
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Disney world person I don't even

1618
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
know where to begin exactly

1619
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
with all of this other than I think when you first brought it

1620
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
up you really threw it all out there and

1621
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
said that you were you didn't even say

1622
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I go to Disney world all the time you framed

1623
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
it as I've been living in

1624
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Disney world four chunks at a

1625
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
time do you want you want to speak to that or what you're

1626
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
especially recent Disney sure

1627
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
yeah a quick so super quick backstory

1628
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
at the age of twelve

1629
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I went to Disney world for the first

1630
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
time and

1631
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
I didn't know it at the time but

1632
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
there's something called Disney depression

1633
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
you're probably gonna be like what the hell

1634
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
you know I've never heard that coin but I know what you're talking

1635
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
about because you're immersed

1636
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
you're immersed in this world every decision

1637
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
you're making is based on fun excitement

1638
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
nothing counts

1639
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
you're walking so much food food calories

1640
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
don't count right right everything

1641
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
it takes away all your problems

1642
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
and then you leave and it's like really

1643
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
hard especially world because you're

1644
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
in the world like everywhere you go

1645
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
it's Disney the music that you're seeing

1646
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
there's probably no more

1647
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
core memory for me

1648
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
and my parents still bring it up all the time

1649
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
than leaving Disney world from our

1650
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
first trip when I was seven and that

1651
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I was just like balling

1652
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
the entire time from the

1653
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
cab the airport I

1654
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
like it's it's among my earliest

1655
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
memories which are interesting things to be

1656
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
earliest memories because it's full of joy

1657
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
but also but the deep set

1658
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
and I think my parents knew then like this is a sadness

1659
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
that isn't just like we'll

1660
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
come back next year and they're like

1661
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
I think a personality is forming

1662
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
and perhaps a podcast in many years

1663
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
but anyway I know exactly so this

1664
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
so it was 12 for you yeah and so I left

1665
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
and I was just um

1666
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
yeah I was just like down I didn't want to go back

1667
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
to school it was like a late summer trip

1668
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
I went to the water parks I met

1669
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
this girl who we kept in touch like

1670
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
writing letters and I

1671
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
we talk about this all the time we always

1672
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
thought on a vacation we could like form

1673
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
new identities right like if I'm really

1674
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
confident at Blizzard Beach just

1675
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
askew everything I am back in Woodland

1676
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
well for me it was if I'm really

1677
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
confident a girl will come up

1678
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
and do all of the work as far as

1679
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
introducing herself to me

1680
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
then saying like hey let me show you how to

1681
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
kiss for the first time but that did not

1682
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
happen you actually had to talk to people

1683
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
to make that go down but I did not

1684
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
do it

1685
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
just these incredible memories I was

1686
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
kind of depressed to go back to school I wasn't

1687
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
a great student and I just wanted

1688
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
to find my way back to Disney World

1689
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
obviously being back in California

1690
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
that was a long way and then Christmas

1691
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
I saw the movie Home Alone

1692
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
and I

1693
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
I don't know what came over me

1694
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
but after I saw the movie

1695
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Home Alone I started I've never written anything

1696
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
before I took a pencil

1697
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
and a notepad and I literally

1698
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
hand wrote a 78

1699
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
page script Home Alone

1700
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Lost in Disney World a secret

1701
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
which is

1702
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
a good idea

1703
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
if they had somehow pulled that together

1704
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
then that's a that's a money prayer

1705
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
as the third movie yeah and so I

1706
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
and get this and I'm not

1707
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
making it up I wrote a part for myself

1708
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
that Kevin McAllister

1709
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
now had a buddy in Disney

1710
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
World to fight off the bandits who

1711
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
are now janitors

1712
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
were there to rob Cinderella's jewels

1713
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
and they called themselves the bling bandits

1714
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
wow

1715
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Cinderella's jewels that's so good you're not going to believe

1716
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
what I called my character in

1717
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
1990 oh god not Mark Dan

1718
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
what what it was

1719
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
I called myself

1720
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Mark that's insane

1721
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
insane so that's also insane that you didn't

1722
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
just say great that gets me great

1723
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
oh yeah yeah you're right you weren't so

1724
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
egotistical in your 12 year old writing

1725
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
just a tad um so I

1726
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
wrote a part for myself and I

1727
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
hand wrote the script to 78 pages

1728
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
and I wasn't doing homework I was

1729
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
just writing nonstop and researching back then

1730
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
it was really hard you had to get the newspaper you had to like

1731
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I looked at Home Alone photos

1732
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
and then I convinced my parents to get me a video

1733
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
writer I mean this was so

1734
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
archaic it was like a floppy disc

1735
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
and a little mini cursor with

1736
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
like it looked like old space invaders

1737
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
like 1960s style

1738
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
I wrote out the script

1739
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
drew a poster for it printed

1740
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
it went to Kinko's got on

1741
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
411 called 20th Century Fox

1742
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
found

1743
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
they're like you can't send it here you got to find

1744
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
John Hughes' production company we don't

1745
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
produce Home Alone

1746
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
found John Hughes' production company in Lake

1747
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Forest Illinois went to FedEx

1748
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
mailed the package my mom thought like

1749
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
I'm not putting any money in this like you're insane

1750
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
and I mailed the script out with

1751
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
a cover letter and in my cover letter I was telling

1752
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
John Hughes that combining the

1753
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Home Alone story with the Disney franchise

1754
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
would be an incredible marketing

1755
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
tool this is like 1991 I was like

1756
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
you were an executive

1757
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
it took me over

1758
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
I was like my life was this

1759
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
so I mailed it to John Hughes

1760
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
week goes by and I'm like I so

1761
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
believed this was going to happen

1762
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
I stopped like studying

1763
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
I didn't care about school

1764
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
and I was like a week's gone by I haven't heard from John Hughes

1765
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
two weeks go by

1766
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
my mom comes back from the mail and says

1767
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
there's a package for you from

1768
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
from Hughes Productions and I was like

1769
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
wow oh damn yeah

1770
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
okay here we go it's a go yeah we're

1771
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
making it next week yeah and so I

1772
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
open it and

1773
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
my script is in there and then there's

1774
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
a handwritten note that says like how impressed

1775
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
John Hughes was that I found him that I did this

1776
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
and that like keep believing

1777
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
in yourself and follow your dreams and I was like

1778
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
oh my god so

1779
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
what about the movie

1780
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
straight to the negative

1781
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
let's get this moment moving here

1782
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
and so it hit me pretty

1783
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
hard we didn't make it I couldn't watch Home Alone for a

1784
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
while but I knew there

1785
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
like that's what I wanted to do

1786
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
is I wanted to tell

1787
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
stories I like so now

1788
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
let's cut to

1789
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
2023

1790
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
late 2023

1791
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
I take a

1792
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
young family member

1793
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
to Disney World for the first time

1794
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
and I get to and I'd been

1795
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
a few times been to Disneyland I'd always had

1796
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
a good time but this is like July

1797
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
of 2023 and

1798
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
I see Disney World

1799
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
through her eyes

1800
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
and just have this incredible

1801
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
time and then I start

1802
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
to discover sort of what Disney World is now

1803
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
you have the resorts

1804
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
you have the extended

1805
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
hours

1806
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
and the magic bands and all this stuff

1807
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
and all of a sudden like

1808
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
I get like

1809
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
I get hit the way I did when I was 12

1810
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
wow oh so you were like you were

1811
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
into it never like fully bailed out

1812
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
but you were like fully reactivated

1813
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
yeah totally reactivated

1814
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
and I sort of like

1815
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
there's a new draw as an adult

1816
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
so for me I

1817
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
haven't seen a lot of the films like I just this last

1818
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
year watched Moana like I haven't seen a lot of

1819
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
films what drew me in was

1820
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
the imagineering and the park and

1821
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
the just the whole feeling

1822
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
you are when you go

1823
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
and so we went back

1824
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
for Christmas

1825
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
and it was incredible I sent you

1826
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
photos stay at the Grand Floridian the

1827
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
gingerbread house oh yeah

1828
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
it was just like this whole I was like okay now

1829
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
I'm back to where I was 12

1830
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
and I was like I gotta go back

1831
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
and revisit what I

1832
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
did and so I went back

1833
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
to it and I said you know what

1834
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
now I'm an adult

1835
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
I think I can

1836
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
do something with this now

1837
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
I'm gonna take this story and I'm gonna

1838
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
turn it into something and so

1839
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
for the past year

1840
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
I've basically like I said

1841
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
so my character in the story the script

1842
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
that I wrote lives at Disney

1843
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
World right he was

1844
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
where you live

1845
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
he was related to Walt

1846
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Disney oh he was trying

1847
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
to defend the vision of Walt

1848
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
but like it had been taken

1849
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
over so he was like

1850
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
living in the underground like

1851
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
parts of the park

1852
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
tunnels below the tunnels

1853
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
the secret little caverns that Walt

1854
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
built he was living he had

1855
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
keys to Walt's apartment like he had

1856
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
he had like the little underground

1857
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
magic that nobody else had and so he

1858
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
helps Kevin so

1859
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
I so he's the bird

1860
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
lady of like yeah

1861
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
totally I do have someone

1862
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
on my side in this crazy place and

1863
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
so I

1864
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
just got fully back

1865
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
and so when I go

1866
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
like I send you that list I've been to all the

1867
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
resorts I've gone to all

1868
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
the different I don't think I realized that that

1869
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
was because you've basically you've stayed

1870
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
everywhere but

1871
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
you're only missing two and

1872
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
I think I thought that was more of a like last five

1873
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
years or lifetime thing that's since

1874
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
that's only from 2023

1875
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
yeah that's starting 2023

1876
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
to wow to

1877
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
October of last year holy shit wow

1878
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
and that's the okay what

1879
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
what are you missing well let's go by what you were missing

1880
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
because otherwise you've been to every did

1881
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
you say Yachton Beach Club I haven't done

1882
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Yachton Beach Club I haven't done Boardwalk

1883
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
so

1884
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
those two but everywhere else you

1885
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
stayed at wow and for like

1886
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
big stretches like average

1887
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
of like three to five wow

1888
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
so fourth of July

1889
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
at Epcot is the

1890
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
best party like that is

1891
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
never done that no we've never done that it's an incredible

1892
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
time they have live music firework show

1893
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
is like the best I've seen so

1894
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
fourth of July is a really great way

1895
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
to kick it off and what's awesome is if you're staying

1896
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
near Epcot at Swann or Yachton

1897
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Beach Club or any of those like you just walk in

1898
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
right oh yeah sure yeah and

1899
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
and then for contemporary

1900
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
is one of the best spots

1901
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
because if you have a resort view you

1902
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
literally go on your balcony I think I

1903
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
sent you the video where you just look out

1904
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
and you see Magic Kingdom right you

1905
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
see the Grand Floridian you

1906
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
can just see everything from your balcony it's almost like

1907
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
I don't I don't need to go

1908
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
and so there's just

1909
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
yeah certain parts of the

1910
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
park that are just have this

1911
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
like I don't know when you when you're at Disney World

1912
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
everything your whole mood is

1913
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
different and I hadn't

1914
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
I hadn't you know

1915
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
I'd been back before

1916
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
but rediscovering

1917
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
the magic in a different way

1918
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
has really plugged me into the creation of

1919
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
it like how like

1920
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
riding Tron I sent you those

1921
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
those videos like just going

1922
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
into how they take the movie and how they take one

1923
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
idea and build it

1924
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
and like the joy

1925
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
it brings to to so many people

1926
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
it just

1927
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
I've rediscovered so much of it and I

1928
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
went actually to Marceline

1929
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Missouri which is where

1930
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Walt was from

1931
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Oh yes the basis of Main Street

1932
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
yeah yeah yeah that was a mind blow

1933
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
when you were yeah when you were giving me

1934
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
your stats and I was like I don't know we talked

1935
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
to anybody who's been to Marceline Missouri

1936
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
it's a tough one to get to I've been to Kansas

1937
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
City and it's just

1938
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
far enough to where you know you're going somewhere

1939
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
else and so this last time I was in

1940
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Omaha Nebraska

1941
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
and I was like you know what

1942
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
it's only two and something hours away screw I'm going

1943
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
like I'm not going to wait for the next chance and

1944
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
so I pull pull into Marceline

1945
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Missouri and it was so

1946
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
eerie and cool

1947
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
because it feels like you're on Main Street

1948
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
there's nobody there

1949
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
and you pull up and there's like

1950
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
the old theater and they have like the

1951
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
railroad that Walt used to like

1952
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
would inspire him to do all the railroads

1953
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
you go into

1954
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
some of the restaurants and they have some of the drinks

1955
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
from Disney World like Boathouse they have like

1956
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
really oh hey now we're talking

1957
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
wow

1958
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
you guys won me over here this is cool

1959
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
yeah yeah and then just getting to walk

1960
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
around the town at night and hear the

1961
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
railroad and then go to the museum

1962
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
I went to the old wishing barn

1963
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
oh yes now this was because we talk

1964
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
a lot about kind of odd Walt mythology

1965
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
and it's sudden like because

1966
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
it feels like things come up like oh he's got the

1967
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
lamp above the fire station

1968
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
and we're like I never heard of this lamp before

1969
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
and you're telling me now there's a whole other I

1970
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
didn't know about the barn and the tree

1971
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
there's a lot there's all these wishing things

1972
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
that yeah yeah I

1973
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
so I walked up to the wishing barn

1974
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
and it was so bizarre

1975
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
because this the cutest cat

1976
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
followed me around

1977
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
for an hour and 20 minutes

1978
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
like a real life figaro

1979
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
is it figaro

1980
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
yeah he literally and I kept videoing him and he was

1981
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
like followed me and would rub

1982
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
up against me and then I went into the wishing barn

1983
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
he just sat outside the door and looked at me and meowed

1984
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
the entire time and just sat there

1985
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
it would come out it was like it was I was like

1986
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
is this Walt?

1987
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
reincarnated

1988
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
the Walt's ghost is rubbing people

1989
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
before they go in the barn

1990
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
pretty magical right

1991
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
come to my parts

1992
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
bunny in the pockets of my ancestors

1993
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
or my relatives

1994
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
but it was it was if anybody

1995
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
is a Disney fan it was a great

1996
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
pilgrimage rolling in there at night

1997
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
and they have the old main street music playing

1998
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
really?

1999
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
which is like what turn of the century kind of

2000
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
yeah it's sort of like what you hear at the parks

2001
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
and I try to get a video for you

2002
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
like just to scroll

2003
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
over and see what it's like but it felt like

2004
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
you're on main street yeah yeah

2005
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
there was an odd like specific magic too that wasn't just

2006
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
like you know regular

2007
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
main drag small town like there's

2008
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
something to it was there a lot of people

2009
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
were there a lot of tourists there? there was nobody there

2010
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
nobody okay I was the only one walking

2011
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
around really huh

2012
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
I guess because it's kind of out of the way

2013
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
it's like two hours

2014
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
going each way and it's like unless

2015
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
you really lined it up and I'm so glad

2016
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I went during the winter

2017
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
it was like a lot cooler

2018
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
and it just had yeah

2019
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
and then not far from

2020
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
there is Hannibal, Missouri

2021
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
which is where Mark Twain is from

2022
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
which is where he got the idea to

2023
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
do the Mark Twain boat

2024
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
at Disneyland the Tom Sawyer Island

2025
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
I went to like that's only an hour and a half Tom Sawyer

2026
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Island is all near there

2027
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
so you could see the influences of

2028
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
the parks so clearly

2029
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
jeez jeez like true

2030
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Americana that's great so it's you

2031
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
recommend it as a pilgrimage but it's kind of a

2032
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
you don't stay at the there's not some magical

2033
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Marceline hotel you sort of gotta

2034
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
like pop in yeah

2035
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
oh they should why don't they do it

2036
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
there is a cute little motel there that has

2037
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
the old Disney posters like the

2038
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
old Monorail posters the old Pirates

2039
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
of the Caribbean so there is a cute

2040
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
little hotel in town like a mile out

2041
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
sure sure yeah they have no

2042
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
deluxe resorts there yet yeah yeah yeah

2043
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
it sounds like they haven't monetized this

2044
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
to the degree they could it sounds

2045
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
like they you know you in some ways you'd

2046
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
imagine like it's the Wisconsin Dells when there's just

2047
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
a bunch of shitty t-shirt stores

2048
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
being like Disney was here like

2049
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
it seems classier than it does that's what

2050
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
I liked about it yeah I felt like you were just in some

2051
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
small small town you could really get a feel

2052
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
of what you experience

2053
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
really cute little museum there

2054
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
that's very well done has a lot of artifacts

2055
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
some really great

2056
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
like 3D Disney art

2057
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
but again very subtle

2058
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
wow that sounds lovely

2059
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
so you're a

2060
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Disney World hotels aficionado

2061
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
particularly

2062
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
let me I guess let me ask is there

2063
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
if you had to commit

2064
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
to one you can only stay

2065
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
at one from here on out

2066
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
which one we talk about great question

2067
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
I was in so one of the most

2068
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
insane Disney things I've ever done

2069
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
is I went to

2070
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
the Grand Floridian for the 4th of July

2071
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
because we talk about like investigating

2072
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Disney depression right when you leave

2073
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
you just feel like you're going back to the real world

2074
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
and it's still there in a different way

2075
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
so this time I thought I'm going to try to

2076
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
to test it so I was at the Grand

2077
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Floridian for 4th of July

2078
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
my birthday flew to

2079
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Alani in Hawaii wow

2080
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
which is incredible Disney's worth

2081
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
they have all the characters

2082
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
and then from Alani

2083
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
flew straight back to the Disney World

2084
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
to the Polynesian for my

2085
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
family's birthday damn

2086
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
so I tested to see which is Hawaii

2087
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
just totally insane

2088
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
but when I was in Alani

2089
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
I got pulled aside

2090
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
and they're like have you heard of like DVC

2091
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Disney Vacation Club of course yeah

2092
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
and they're like yeah

2093
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
so they start saying you can like

2094
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
buy into a resort it's your home resort

2095
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
and when they're asking that question it made me think about it all

2096
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
and they were telling me like Revere is available

2097
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
or this is available

2098
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
and I would say for me probably

2099
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
my favorite that feels the most

2100
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
timeless is the Grand Floridian

2101
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
I love the idea of the monorail

2102
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
coming into the hotel

2103
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
picking you up

2104
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
taking you to the park it's those little things when you

2105
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
get older where it's like you've done

2106
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
the rides it's those little

2107
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
touches that like that's

2108
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
what gets you I think as you get older so I think Grand Floridian

2109
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
was incredible and then

2110
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
during the holidays

2111
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
at Christmas time the Wilderness

2112
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Lodge is

2113
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
spectacular they have one of the best

2114
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
trees I've ever seen it's like huge right

2115
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
yeah you walk in it's like a woodsy

2116
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
cabin feel and you

2117
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
look up and the tree is

2118
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
really anybody who hasn't done

2119
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
it during the holidays it's an incredible resort

2120
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
that's the thing I remember my parents carving

2121
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
out time to do and even in our

2122
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
childhood trips was like this

2123
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
day no parks or maybe we'll pop into one

2124
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
later in the day but today we're just

2125
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
going to go or we're just going to

2126
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
look at Christmas decorations

2127
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
in these hotels and look at those gingerbread

2128
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
yeah they knew how to do it

2129
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
I don't know how they even knew that that was an

2130
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
aspect of it but they were

2131
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
that part of it had a

2132
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
giant influence on me and the fact that I

2133
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
still try to spend as much time as I can in hotel

2134
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
lobbies still where I go to

2135
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
to write and relax and get away

2136
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
always chasing that vibe

2137
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
living at living at Disney where like I

2138
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
anytime I had a booking

2139
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
or something I'd always

2140
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
if there's in between week or

2141
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
I'd always be I was at Disney

2142
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
World for 36

2143
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
36 days

2144
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
and it was like again

2145
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
the fact if you have the annual pass thing

2146
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
it's fun because you have like

2147
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
the magic band and you can go in and do

2148
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
whatever you want but it was chilling

2149
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
in the resort going

2150
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
for a walk just the freedom to

2151
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
explore and then I found this

2152
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
like super cool

2153
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
experience that I did not know was possible

2154
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
if you're staying at the contemporary

2155
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
they actually rent boats

2156
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
yes I've done this yes

2157
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
and you can go and go

2158
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
cruise around the seven seas lagoon

2159
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
it's like I was the only person out there

2160
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
and it was the other one was

2161
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
the sheriff like the just waiting

2162
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
I was literally cruising through the Polynesian

2163
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
and it was like there's just so many cool

2164
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
things you can do and if you're doing something creative

2165
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
or want to get your mind off stuff

2166
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
like just that low stress

2167
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
being around creativity

2168
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
that's also what I love is like how

2169
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
they schedule those midday parades

2170
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
and you see people given they're all

2171
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
the dancers the emcees

2172
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
you're just around like happiness

2173
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
and creativity that it just

2174
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
it's such a good place to be

2175
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
just for that

2176
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
this is what people don't

2177
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
I mean people that are listening to this

2178
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
understand it but regular

2179
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
people don't understand when you're like well

2180
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
you go to disneyland a lot it's like yeah

2181
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
I do and then you will you go to all the rides

2182
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
every no no no no no no no no no

2183
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
you drive down you get a little

2184
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
meal you can do some work

2185
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
near it and

2186
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
you'll hear the music you'll

2187
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
smell the smells and then

2188
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
so much is just vibes and I

2189
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
go maybe I'll go on one ride and then I'll come

2190
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
back and then they just look at you like you're insane

2191
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
but you're like no no no come with me

2192
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
come with me and I will convert you I think

2193
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
I think if you were spending every day just like

2194
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
bouncing around the fantasy land

2195
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
dark rides and that is it

2196
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
if you're just around like carousel

2197
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
calliope there's something there's something

2198
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
odd about that I can see the lack of appeal

2199
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
yeah I think so yeah just around

2200
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
loud sounds and kids and

2201
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
and rides where things jump out at you but

2202
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
I do think that's one of the

2203
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
biggest like gulfs in trying

2204
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
to like convey any of this to anybody is like

2205
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
is the disney serenity

2206
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
because it's definitely there you've for sure experienced

2207
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
joy instead of the like I think every hotel

2208
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
has its version of just like

2209
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
oh it's so still and either people

2210
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
are already back from the parks or they're still at

2211
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
the parks so you kind of got this the fact

2212
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
that you could just like I got the boardwalk to myself

2213
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
how is that even possible

2214
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
just crickets chirping and water shimmer

2215
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
and it's like it is it's

2216
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
magical to think about it is it's just

2217
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
built to like experience

2218
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
joy like I was staying at the swan

2219
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
hotel and I walked out and there's like the white

2220
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
sand yes water there

2221
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
and there's a hammock in between two palm trees

2222
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
and I just like sat

2223
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
on it for a little bit I was like looking up and I was like

2224
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
you know you could be

2225
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
in so many different places but disney's

2226
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
found a way to take

2227
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
what you would feel in

2228
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
all these other countries that would take you so

2229
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
long to get there passports and

2230
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
like difficulties and they've brought it

2231
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
to you yeah that's what I think

2232
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
if you have the imagination you can

2233
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
go there and escape into

2234
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
kind of whatever you want it to do and that's also

2235
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
why Epcot's become one of my

2236
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
favorite parks too is because

2237
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
they've just found a way

2238
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
to bring you safety fun

2239
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
adventure and it's just

2240
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
all handed to you and like and just like

2241
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
like big strolls

2242
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
I feel like a friend of the

2243
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
show Jason Walliner was just there and I

2244
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
was like I feel like the big thing about

2245
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Epcot is just is just being

2246
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
there it's just taking a walk it's just

2247
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
like lagoon it's looking at that architecture

2248
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
even if you don't go do anything in

2249
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
the world showcase pavilions just

2250
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
like passing by and then this music gives

2251
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
way to that music and like I really

2252
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
think especially Epcot I think number one attraction

2253
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
is just is just

2254
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
vibe well I also think of boardwalk and

2255
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
everything as part of Epcot like the attraction

2256
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
wise I'm like well at night

2257
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
we're going to go to abracadabra

2258
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
and we're going to do this and yes if

2259
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
jelly rolls was still there if I mean it is still there

2260
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
right now but for me I would be like

2261
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
well we're doing jelly rolls that's part of Epcot in my

2262
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
mind so that's all rolls into one

2263
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
for me 100% right yeah I

2264
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
always think Epcot is like its own its own

2265
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
world yeah and then you can just literally

2266
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
walk over to Hollywood Studios

2267
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
yeah yeah right or a little boat

2268
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
or you do your little yeah yeah your little

2269
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
skyliner now yeah

2270
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
that's so much yeah that that aspect

2271
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
I had like true

2272
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
serenity in that zone

2273
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
you're describing Greg with the like

2274
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
when these guys I did not I

2275
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
it was a long day around the drinking

2276
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
around the world food and wine I

2277
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
did not have it in me to go to a dueling

2278
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
piano bar yeah at the very end

2279
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
of the long day even

2280
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
though they did and had a wonderful time but I

2281
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
was like I know what I need I know what my

2282
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
spirit needs so badly which

2283
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
is to just walk that

2284
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
the Michael Graves Causeway between

2285
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
the swan and the dolphin and then

2286
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
just kind of like go sit on the grass

2287
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
and just like put my feet out watch

2288
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
the water and it like

2289
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
it's just funny that it gives it gives you any if

2290
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
you're in the mood for dueling piano

2291
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
covers of give me one

2292
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
what did they play oh well they

2293
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
played like moving right along

2294
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
I think from the Muppet movie but then they you know I

2295
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
don't do they do don't stop believing it feels

2296
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
right if they didn't seems like if you want to hear some

2297
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
dueling piano journey you want but if you if you

2298
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
want just like peace

2299
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
you can get that to that's still what I'm dreaming because

2300
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
I'm coming off a crazy run like a big project

2301
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
that was very involved and then having a second

2302
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
child and really my happy place in

2303
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
the I was like and I still haven't gotten there but I will

2304
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
and when I'm there hey maybe when we're all over

2305
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
live show or something but the I'm like

2306
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
I'm going to get to one I'm getting balcony

2307
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
at whichever one has a balcony

2308
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
swan dolphin I like both

2309
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
swan to me I think is

2310
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
is better got better views like I did

2311
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
dolphin the first time it's good

2312
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
but swan's just got a better vibe and then I

2313
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
really like swan reserve swan

2314
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
reserve because it has the top

2315
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
level you can take it up and you

2316
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
literally go up there and you have a view of the

2317
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
entire Epcot it's one of the best

2318
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
views I would like to see that

2319
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
swan reserves got great restaurants it's

2320
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
it's newer it's like a newer DVC

2321
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
resort so it doesn't feel like hardcore

2322
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Disney it's just like a really nice resort

2323
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
but I think yes

2324
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
swan is great too yeah yeah

2325
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
in terms of

2326
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
this has been a long time

2327
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
with no like real specific ride talk

2328
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
but let's do a little

2329
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
of that what is

2330
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
first of all Epcot well what's your

2331
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
what's your Epcot what's like the

2332
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
big things you got to hit in a big

2333
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Epcot so Epcot what you said

2334
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
as well the vibe is great drinking around

2335
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
the world is so much fun yeah

2336
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
one of the things I did

2337
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
was sort of a ritual is

2338
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
kind of backwards but you go to the Rosenkrant

2339
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
bar in England you

2340
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
do a few whiskey shots there okay

2341
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
okay and then if you're still feeling

2342
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
like risky get one

2343
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
more drink and

2344
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
go ride guardians

2345
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
so riding guardians

2346
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
with that sort of like wild buzz

2347
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
you're not worried about nausea come back

2348
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
because people get nauseous even sober on that

2349
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
baby that's what I was gonna say so when I first

2350
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
did guardians

2351
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
I had a little bit you kind of

2352
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
hit me a little weird yeah and then

2353
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
I did the whiskey thing and

2354
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
since then it's been one of my favorites

2355
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
it's just you're just in the right

2356
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
mindset and you don't get affected

2357
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
by the turn so

2358
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
I love doing that having a couple

2359
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
shots of whiskey go to guardians

2360
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
damn I've never done that bar I gotta

2361
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
I will do this next time yeah I don't

2362
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
know if I can handle several shots anymore

2363
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
good for you

2364
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
maybe it's the kids thing

2365
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
something about that makes it

2366
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
tougher but yeah guardians

2367
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
is definitely

2368
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
is definitely really up there love test track

2369
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
it's down right now oh right yeah

2370
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
are you hopeful for the new one

2371
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
I mean I really enjoyed it

2372
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
I'm sure they'll add a nice nice twist to it

2373
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
I felt it felt a little 90s

2374
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
it's getting janky yeah

2375
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
a little tired yeah

2376
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
they'll do something cool and what I again what I love is

2377
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
when you have the extended hours at Epcot you get to

2378
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
stay till 11 okay and if you time

2379
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
it right you can get on your last ride at 11

2380
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
be there almost till midnight oh geez

2381
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
and then you're like if you're at like the opposite end of the park

2382
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
and then you can just like walk out

2383
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
slowly by yourself all things

2384
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
just shimmer and sparkle

2385
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
that's the best way to time is when you sort of walk

2386
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
out and you have the park to yourself one thing that

2387
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
happened that was crazy

2388
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
actually last summer is I don't know if you guys ever done

2389
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
this but you can eat dinner in the

2390
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
in Cinderella's castle I have never

2391
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
done it I know you've been doing this

2392
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
yeah yeah so the

2393
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
hack with that is if you go you get

2394
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
the last reservation

2395
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
you have dinner it's great um

2396
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
super cool experience and then you are

2397
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
escorted out as the last

2398
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
patron in the park oh really

2399
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
so I literally

2400
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
got to walk around Magic Kingdom

2401
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
as the last person and just hang

2402
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
that's a great hack that's a great

2403
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
tip it was you could just sit there

2404
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
and just take it all in they don't rush you

2405
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
super cool um like Kevin the

2406
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Callister but without the stress

2407
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
of being a child alone

2408
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
yeah and no bandits not that

2409
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
not that I saw yeah thank god

2410
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
you were there for one of those incidents right

2411
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
wasn't there some like scary people thought it was gunshots

2412
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
it was one of those nights I was in the castle

2413
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
um and we missed the whole

2414
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
thing people were writing me like hey are you alright

2415
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
I was like yeah I've got wine

2416
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
and I'm in the castle yeah

2417
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
I think I'm good and they're like oh there was some

2418
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
incident that went down I saw these videos

2419
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
just missed the whole thing

2420
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
and then that was one of the nights getting escorted

2421
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
out being the last people in the park and I got a ton

2422
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
of photos with it empty

2423
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
as inspiration for

2424
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
what the park would look like

2425
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
in the story oh sure yeah yeah yeah

2426
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
wow wow

2427
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000

and then like they did the

2432
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
like Rockefeller Center and the tree

2433
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000

and then he was he was obsessed why

2453
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Tommy wanted to move him here

2454
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
for the photo and so

2455
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
it was like he got he got lost in that

2456
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
I'm like no no I want to talk to you about Home Alone

2457
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000

01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
so the fact that like Chris Columbus and I asked

and I was like you've seen the disaster he's like oh we saw

2460
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
it like four times and I

2461
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
was just like Chris and Tommy had no idea who

2462
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Chris Columbus was oh my god

2463
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
he checked out after Rubble without a cause

2464
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
that's the only thing he knows about I feel like I have

2465
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
to ask do you have any

2466
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
is there ever been any discussion or proof

2467
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
of Tommy Wiseau going to

2468
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
a Disney park oh my god I have the perfect story

2469
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
for you oh great oh thank god

2470
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
I thought of it I thought of it a very interesting

2471
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
story Mark I thought of it

2472
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
on the way here and I'm so glad

2473
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
I jogged all my memories

2474
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
because

2475
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
2005

2476
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
I booked some convention

2477
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
in Orlando and I hadn't

2478
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
been in years to Disney World

2479
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
so he kind of tagged along

2480
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
I did the convention and we went

2481
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
to Magic Kingdom

2482
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
so we're in line for Splash Mountain

2483
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
and

2484
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
two really weird things happen so we're in line

2485
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
just getting to the corridor where

2486
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
you're starting to go down

2487
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
to where you're going to get on the ride

2488
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
and he and I were like just talking

2489
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
and there was a woman in front of us who was blind

2490
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
and she turned straight

2491
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
to me and said

2492
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
you have a lot to offer

2493
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
but you don't believe in yourself

2494
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
and I was like oh my

2495
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
god she's like I can hear it in your voice

2496
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
and I remember just like this

2497
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
woman with glasses staring at me

2498
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
like staring through me

2499
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
and I was like okay

2500
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
cool shook that off

2501
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
we get on the ride Tommy and I are going through Splash Mountain

2502
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
we're having a good time

2503
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
we're going like

2504
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
getting towards where we're about to rise

2505
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
and the person in front of me

2506
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
has the biggest wasp

2507
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
on their back that you've ever seen

2508
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
so I'm looking at it and I'm like

2509
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
oh no

2510
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
oh no

2511
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
and I like tap Tommy and he goes

2512
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
don't say

2513
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
don't tell her

2514
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
because she will freak out it will come straight on you

2515
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
and I'm like oh no

2516
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
oh my god so we're going up

2517
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
up to go

2518
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
to go on the fall

2519
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
and I'm staring at this wasp

2520
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
and he's like wait that's right after the bee

2521
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
part of the ride too

2522
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
oh my god

2523
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
and so it goes down I duck

2524
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
into a wasp so a very Tommy

2525
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
way to ride Splash Mountain he's like I told

2526
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
you

2527
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
so that was the Disney

2528
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
experience

2529
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
you have a bib wasp comes on you

2530
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
you know good thing happen bad thing happen

2531
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
that's life

2532
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
there's so many

2533
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
things like I quote it all the time

2534
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
and I think it's so quotable because that's

2535
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
one aspect of it is that like I don't think

2536
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
you could quote a movie so many

2537
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
bad movies are about like some crazy

2538
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
monster or something so how do you

2539
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
like it's about creatures and how do you fold

2540
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
that into your life there's so much the fact that the room

2541
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
is just about people and stuff

2542
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
and there's all these anonymous phrases

2543
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
that just like like Darren and I cannot

2544
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
cannot say if one of us says

2545
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
oh we'll see we have to say ah

2546
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
we see

2547
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
don't plan too much

2548
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
you should not plan too much it may not come

2549
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
out right is that

2550
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
good or bad advice Disney

2551
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
worldwide or are you a super

2552
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
planner should you plan too much or

2553
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
may it come out right

2554
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
great question now I've had the luxury of going

2555
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
a lot and knowing that I'm going a lot right

2556
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
so so you can pace it people that

2557
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
like go for the first time with their kids

2558
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
they want to just do it's a small world

2559
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
they want to like fit everything in something's

2560
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
twice yeah I for me

2561
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
I really enjoy

2562
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
depends on weather let's say it's like a nice day

2563
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
I really enjoy getting to the park

2564
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
a bit later I think the

2565
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
afternoons and the evenings are the best times

2566
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
to ride things and see things so I'm like

2567
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
a two thirty

2568
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
three p.m. nice

2569
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
stroll in and just take your time

2570
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
I think having

2571
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
a loose plan maybe having like a cool dinner reservation

2572
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
yeah cause in Disney World there's

2573
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
so many places to try you have all the

2574
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Epcot restaurants one of my favorites

2575
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
is Steakhouse 71 at Contemporary

2576
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
it's an incredible restaurant I haven't done it

2577
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
oh you told me about California Grill

2578
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
you haven't done California Grill?

2579
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
which I tried and it was great

2580
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
you got a little shit from Matt Cardona

2581
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
he's like there's a wrestler he's a big

2582
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Disney World fan who comes on the show

2583
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
he was mad that I only had pizza in the

2584
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
lounge at the California Grill

2585
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
so you haven't been?

2586
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
it was on Zoom

2587
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
so I wasn't as scared as I would have been in real life

2588
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
but yeah he thought that was sort of

2589
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
when I said I had been there

2590
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
he felt that was not legitimate

2591
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
that was not a claim

2592
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
I don't know that's a very judgmental

2593
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
way to view things though although I

2594
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
don't want shit from him

2595
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
cause you align with him on a lot of things

2596
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
I know I do

2597
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
you know what I can't help but ask

2598
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
living with the land

2599
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
I've done it a couple times

2600
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
where do you land?

2601
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
what's your feeling?

2602
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
there's some rides that you go

2603
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
and just sort of like

2604
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
it's like a mood

2605
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
I'll jump back on that again and take it in

2606
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
it's not like one that you're

2607
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
it's not like a soren where

2608
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
it takes you on an escape

2609
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
and you're like oh I'm gonna start with that one

2610
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
it's a mood one sort of like

2611
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
the figment ride

2612
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
if you're playful

2613
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
or spaceship earth

2614
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
it's a mood

2615
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
it's a mood alright

2616
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
I think it puts me in a bad mood

2617
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
no I have this whole

2618
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
I just fully don't like

2619
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
or get living with the land and this has been a battle

2620
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
for me on the show

2621
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
for years and years and I want to get it

2622
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
but yeah Cardona backs me up on it

2623
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
the thing that's so crazy is everybody's arguments

2624
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
for why I should like it

2625
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
I'm like I know that is what I like

2626
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
about a lot of things but it's

2627
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
what makes me like the Mexico boat ride

2628
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
the three caviaros ride

2629
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
that one has like I don't know

2630
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
everyone's arguments about living with the land

2631
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
I just apply to other things

2632
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
I think it's Q based honestly and you've talked about it before

2633
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
but I think it's that unpleasant

2634
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
cafeteria feeling

2635
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
that bottom floor of the land for all the magical places

2636
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
at Epcot especially

2637
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
I think it's just like crowded, stressful

2638
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
a lot of traffic, people coming out of bathrooms

2639
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
a lot of people trying to get to Soarin

2640
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
and a busy like really quick service restaurant

2641
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
I bet it's that

2642
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
I think so yeah

2643
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
as opposed to like entering this

2644
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
beautiful lobby with the

2645
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Joe Roady mural and like atmosphere

2646
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
and dim

2647
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
you get such a great pre-show

2648
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
I would say going into that thing

2649
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
as opposed to just like I don't know it's like kind of yellow

2650
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
and angry

2651
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
I was saying I was in the Cardona last one

2652
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
about Tower of Terror where like

2653
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
I didn't go to the Tower of Terror in California Adventure

2654
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
that much even though we love

2655
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
that ride

2656
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
but it's set back and forward

2657
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
the Q and placement of ride seems to

2658
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
matter and then there are rides on each coast

2659
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
that are more popular than

2660
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
the other and I do think it's like ride

2661
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
placement and then Q

2662
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
has a lot to do

2663
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
with popularity

2664
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
well honestly that's a great point because if you

2665
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
look at like Soarin

2666
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
which is in the bottom of that cafeteria

2667
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
and you go to

2668
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
California Adventure

2669
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
it's placed in like this redwood

2670
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
area that feels so much

2671
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
more exciting

2672
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
to go into

2673
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
I love that zone man that's the last

2674
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
I got to end my day there the other day and I just like

2675
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
I was ending a little early and I was still like

2676
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
you know what I think I'm good I get to soak this

2677
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
up and like oh man yeah

2678
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
yeah yeah instead of like you go into a

2679
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
tiny lobby on a bottom floor and then

2680
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
get squeezed through that's an unfortunate

2681
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
thing about that Soarin. It's so hard to find too

2682
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
it's like we're Soarin. Yeah

2683
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
another ride I want to ask

2684
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
you guys about

2685
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
the Finding Nemo at Epcot

2686
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
which

2687
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
so I went on for the first

2688
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
time it's newer and they have real dolphins

2689
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
in that

2690
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
I mean I'm going through Nemo

2691
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
and I see like a dolphin swim by

2692
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
and I'm like damn that looked really good

2693
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
and it was like that was

2694
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
a dolphin and then you go up and they have

2695
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
this whole aquarium and they have

2696
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
such an impressive collection

2697
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
like and there's dolphins

2698
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
like swimming in there so the dolphins are part of it

2699
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
I recall seeing dolphins there maybe I just am I crazy

2700
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
do you have dolphins in the actual urban seas

2701
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
yeah yeah well they have

2702
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
what manatees yeah

2703
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
manatees actually but the dolphins are swimming

2704
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
in like you're going through

2705
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
you're seeing the graphics of

2706
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Nemo but there's actually dolphins

2707
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
coming through that are part of it

2708
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
not every time but the time I caught it

2709
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
and then they had Mickey scuba diving

2710
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
oh right I've never seen that in person

2711
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
either that was a very like

2712
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
if you go there in a TGIF episode

2713
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
maybe there's a character snorkeling like

2714
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
scuba down there but that's cool

2715
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
so again the queue for that is not bad

2716
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
but I was really impressed when I tried

2717
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
the Nemo at Disneyland for the first time

2718
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
the submarine yeah again

2719
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
the queue is super cool you don't know where you're getting into

2720
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
it feels authentic so

2721
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
I think there's just something

2722
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
special off of retry

2723
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
but I'm with you living with the land is not something

2724
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
I'm going to seek out because

2725
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
it's sort of buried in a way

2726
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
that's not I don't know

2727
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
if it had a killer queue

2728
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
you'd give it more of a chance yeah

2729
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
yeah there might be something to that

2730
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
yeah maybe I have to like see past

2731
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
the queue I again say

2732
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
to listeners I want to get it

2733
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
I'm not trying to be a hater yeah

2734
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
and there's some things that are

2735
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
like a one time thing and you

2736
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
get it like I did space 2020

2737
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
the restaurant

2738
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
we haven't talked about this much have you been there Mike

2739
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
no I've never been I forgot

2740
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
about it last time we were there we meant to

2741
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
do it we meant to do it we own an episode

2742
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
on that yeah what do you think I think it makes it really hard

2743
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
because it's booked out so far in advance but I got

2744
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
a reservation

2745
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
really the experience is really cool the whole

2746
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
setting is cool they have

2747
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
incredible carrot cake

2748
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
okay it's like

2749
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
I don't know if it's a vegan carrot cake

2750
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
carrot cake was phenomenal but

2751
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
again it's one of those things enjoyed it

2752
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
super cool but it's not one

2753
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
that I would be like we got to book that again and again

2754
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
and again it's one of those things you

2755
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
that's what's so cool about Disney World there's so

2756
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
many first things to try

2757
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
some of you might love and become

2758
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
may become a mainstay but

2759
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
it's just worth it to give it a shot

2760
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
once have you been there recently when this

2761
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
new cake shop has opened up

2762
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
on the boardwalk that everyone's talking about

2763
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
you know what I'm talking about I don't know about the cake shop

2764
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
it's a very expensive cake

2765
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
shop oh I saw the

2766
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
construction of it every time I walk by for

2767
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
like weeks but I have not okay

2768
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
been in there because I am fascinated

2769
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
there's a lot of discourse I think they lowered

2770
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
the prices of the cake okay after

2771
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
opening because the cake was like thirty dollars for

2772
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
a slice or something for a slice really

2773
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
maybe it was twenty five or something but I think it's a little

2774
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
lower but then some some people went

2775
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
and like ordered every piece because all the

2776
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
vloggers the vlogger community there

2777
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
I just am impressed with how big

2778
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
it's growing every day but there's I've watched

2779
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
multiple vlogs now

2780
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
of people trying all the cakes

2781
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
it does seem like they like the cakes

2782
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
seems like cakes are good but okay I am

2783
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
excited it's a treat it's worth treating yourself

2784
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
some type of that's yeah that's a crazy price so I'm

2785
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
excited I don't know maybe

2786
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
there's a eighteen dollar cake

2787
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
I forget what the lowest

2788
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
yes

2789
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
I think the restaurants that I've really

2790
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
enjoyed the most at Epcot are

2791
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Le Selye in Canada

2792
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
it's a great setting

2793
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
phenomenal food

2794
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
and then the Mexico restaurant

2795
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
we should do the ride after

2796
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
I haven't sat down there I've only done the bar

2797
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
yeah the bar is wonderful

2798
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
yeah I mean you gotta like that's crowd

2799
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
you gotta like get in and get out immediately

2800
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
yeah drink it outside

2801
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
yeah yes but like but as I've said

2802
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
before like like downing

2803
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
downing a margarita really fast

2804
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
like to try to time it till right when you jump

2805
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
on that boat ride oh my god that's the greatest

2806
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
and it's a great atmosphere before

2807
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
the ride that's a lot of it

2808
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
that's perfect it's a perfect place to walk

2809
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
around yeah the vibes in there are

2810
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
perfect yeah it's that escape

2811
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
like when you get on that ride you feel

2812
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
like you're in some little

2813
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
area in Mexico yeah you know you've got

2814
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
the people playing it's just again

2815
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
it's not like a rollercoaster or anything it's just a vibe

2816
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
that is pleasant yeah boy

2817
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
I love the way you do that I love

2818
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
the way you go there I love that it's about

2819
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
kind of like taking your time and it's

2820
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
hotel oriented

2821
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
I'm trying to think

2822
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
anything else why would like is it

2823
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
anything that you're like

2824
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
anything that you would

2825
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
hasn't been doing it for you that you want to change

2826
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
or like it's something that they've closed

2827
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
that you're like

2828
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
or like any of these like recently

2829
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
announced things that you're particularly excited

2830
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
about I think so Cars Land

2831
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
I think is one of the best creations

2832
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
that they have at either park in

2833
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Disneyland I think Cars Land is

2834
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
phenomenal and I think

2835
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
Disneyland you can

2836
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
tell how handcrafted it was

2837
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
the theming is incredible

2838
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
and I think the Mark Twain boat

2839
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
fits there

2840
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
you know because you have New Orleans

2841
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
the Tom Sawyer Islands great the railroad

2842
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
the way it all works together

2843
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
so I totally get that and then in World

2844
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
it's a little bit more forced it doesn't

2845
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
quite have that charm that

2846
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
land does so I think

2847
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
what they're trying to do because

2848
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
with with land they expanded

2849
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
with the Star Wars world which is

2850
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
which is great you have everything right there

2851
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
and I think they're worried with Magic Kingdom

2852
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
that nobody's really doing the

2853
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Mark Twain boat because it doesn't really have the

2854
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
space and I think they know they

2855
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
can spice it up by doing cars there

2856
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
right right this is good as it being said

2857
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
without Jason here I think Jason might be

2858
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
livid at any discussion that taking away the boat

2859
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
but it's funny can any of us even name

2860
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
which boat that is?

2861
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
because it's weirdly not Mark Twain

2862
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
it's some weird other name

2863
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
I can't remember what it is

2864
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
so you're maybe positive

2865
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
on this change happening that's interesting

2866
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
yeah I mean again I love

2867
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
having the old school feeling it's a nice

2868
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
breather but when I

2869
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
went to land I just saw

2870
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
how well done that was and how well it works

2871
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
for Fantasmic at land

2872
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
because Fantasmic in

2873
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
world is at Hollywood Studios and it's in a whole

2874
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
amphitheater and it's really laid out

2875
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
it's got its corner but in land they work it

2876
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
into the with the Peter Pan boat coming

2877
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
in so land just has its fixture

2878
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
but I think that area

2879
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
in world could I

2880
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
don't think people will miss it within a year

2881
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
I think once Cars Land is up it's got a

2882
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
new vibe I was

2883
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
surprised because I do love keeping

2884
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
the OG but I really

2885
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
think worlds a different

2886
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Magic Kingdom it's a different

2887
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
beast than Disneyland yes like it's got

2888
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
the bigger castle it's just it's

2889
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
so I think it could use a little bit

2890
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
innovation and I think if it's done right

2891
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
I think people will be happy with it

2892
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
wow that's a cool positive opinion

2893
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
to hear because I feel like I don't think we've like

2894
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
particularly weighed in either way

2895
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
on that but for sure like the

2896
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
vlogger I think Disney

2897
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
online is like furious about

2898
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
the Cars Land and the river and there's

2899
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
there's kind of the worst of it I think

2900
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
you'll still wait oh so there's going to be like cars zooming by

2901
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
just right by

2902
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
we have a bet

2903
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
will you be able to hear engine noise

2904
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
from Haunted Mansion and Disney

2905
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
oh right

2906
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
right so we're like okay

2907
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
if they can block it out

2908
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
it's a success I forget who has the bet with

2909
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
one and who I don't remember who bet on what

2910
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
yeah yeah but I am more of the mind

2911
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
with Mater farting maybe

2912
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
will you be able to hear Mater fart from the Haunted Mansion

2913
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
that assumes that Mater farts anywhere

2914
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
because I don't think he doesn't in the existing

2915
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Radiator Springs racers so

2916
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
does he wait a minute somebody farts

2917
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
when the big the tractors

2918
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
when they go tractor tipping the tractors fart

2919
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
the tractors fart yes because my son's

2920
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
obsessed with this right now

2921
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
and you know what he used to be very afraid of it

2922
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
and now he's now it's his favorite scene

2923
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
nice to know that kids

2924
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
can overcome these fears that's what

2925
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
the parks are all about but yeah I think

2926
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
people are like it's just going to be like

2927
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
hamfisted in there and they're just putting it in for

2928
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
merch and I'm a little bit of the mind of like

2929
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
let's see what Imagineers can pull off

2930
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
and how they weave it all together I think if they do it right

2931
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
I think it'll bring some excitement

2932
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
to that area because Haunted Mansion

2933
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
it's more of like an East Coast theme it doesn't have

2934
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
the New Orleans vibe

2935
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
so I think there's some theming there that

2936
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
they can work with I will say

2937
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
I'm not sure about

2938
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Rock and Roller Coaster I'm not sure how that becomes

2939
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
the Muppets yeah yes because

2940
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
just the vibe of

2941
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
Rock and Roller Coaster next to

2942
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Tower of Terror it's got a nice

2943
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
feel to it so the Muppets I'm yeah

2944
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
that'll be a little

2945
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
confusing I think I'm not sure how

2946
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
that's going to be my favorite choice

2947
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
yeah it's interesting it's like

2948
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
a lot of weight I think

2949
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
becomes on that pre-show

2950
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
on the former Steven Tyler

2951
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
and Leonna Douglas I think it's like to make

2952
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
that's going to have to tie a lot together

2953
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
because I think you were saying Mike and they said it wasn't

2954
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
on like how does it it's not

2955
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
a ride where you can like do too much like

2956
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
you're passing you pass through like a big

2957
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
oh like it has to be so broad strokes

2958
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
so how do you get Muppets

2959
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
are all about like details and small

2960
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
things so how does that work as a

2961
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
yeah I agree there's a little skepticism

2962
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
so that's that's tricky because it's an exciting

2963
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
like

2964
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
blasting ride and it works with

2965
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
the concert and it works with Aerosmith

2966
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
you know if you look at Splash

2967
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Mountain and then became Tiana's

2968
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
that that theming

2969
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
you know it doesn't have Splash

2970
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Mountain had a villain and it had a goal

2971
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
but the theming with Tiana still works

2972
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
it's still charming it still has a

2973
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
musical element to it

2974
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
if you like that ride I don't think you

2975
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
you come away like

2976
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
that discerned but

2977
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
going from Aerosmith to

2978
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
the Muppets with you know

2979
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
I don't know are you going to how do

2980
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
you feel about Aerosmith are you going to miss Aerosmith because Mike's

2981
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
a big Aerosmith guy I think you're

2982
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
like I don't think that's all I don't think your

2983
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
feelings are 100 percent because you're

2984
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
sad Aerosmith's going away I think you have other

2985
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
concerns but that seems like part of it right

2986
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
like well it's part of it it just

2987
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
yeah I don't I can't it's the ride

2988
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
is so fast it feels

2989
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
right yes like

2990
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
I don't know it could be like I

2991
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
would honestly if they said like it was going to be Metallica

2992
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
and it's called like ride the lightning

2993
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
oh okay

2994
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
that'd be that'd be bad because Metallica

2995
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
is one of my favorite bands but like

2996
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
something that's literally the speed

2997
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
and rock and roll are my

2998
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
concerns and I'm like the Muppets are

2999
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
rather than animal pretty gentle

3000
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
like it doesn't I don't know

3001
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
because the feeling of the

3002
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
ride is so much for me of like

3003
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
what about can you picture

3004
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
that is a fast song

3005
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
yeah but not really

3006
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
I feel like what I like about rock and roll

3007
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
I mean that's not

3008
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
yeah I'm just

3009
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
trying to think of anything I'm not against the Muppets

3010
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
I'm just saying I think I feel like somebody

3011
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
was saying like what is it going to be like rainbow connection

3012
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
well no first of all that's not a Dr. Teeth

3013
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
song and second of all but it's not going to be

3014
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
I don't think it's going to be Dr. Teeth and I don't even know that

3015
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
they're going to stick to Muppet songs

3016
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
because it says other music

3017
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
they like teased other music acts as

3018
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
well oh that's a little scary

3019
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
so it could be non Muppets

3020
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
it could be Aerosmith songs sung by

3021
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Miss Piggy and Meghan Trainor that's what

3022
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
I said and guys joked but might not

3023
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
be far off is that you'll

3024
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
have like six new Muppet

3025
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
songs that could be other

3026
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
songs I am nervous given the

3027
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
the kind of performers who do the Christmas

3028
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
specials

3029
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
are you into the Christmas specials do you watch

3030
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
those like on ABC to try to like

3031
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
get your Disney Christmas magic

3032
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
I haven't seen too many I did

3033
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
do the when I was at the parks I did do

3034
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
the Mickey's Christmas night

3035
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
and that is a really cool experience

3036
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
because they leave the lights on

3037
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
in Space Mountain oh yes I yes I want

3038
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
to do this so bad

3039
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
with Christmas lights

3040
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
it's really cool I want to see this

3041
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
and then another thing I was going to

3042
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
mention is on the not so scary

3043
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Halloween party they have live

3044
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
actors like on Pirates of the Caribbean

3045
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
the Pirates come alive

3046
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
and Haunted Mansion you have ghosts

3047
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
like people like with the tombstones

3048
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
which is a good one

3049
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
but I have not yeah I haven't seen too many

3050
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
of the ABC specials I did love

3051
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Mickey's Christmas Carol growing

3052
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
up

3053
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
my guy Billy Corgan now

3054
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
is back in the

3055
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
not back now in the Disney family he did the

3056
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
last Christmas special so if you do

3057
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
a Billy Corgan

3058
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
collaboration with one of the Muppets

3059
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
you think maybe this may be a

3060
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Smashing Pumpkins is coming?

3061
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
I'm just saying

3062
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
it's hard to look

3063
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
of all the bands you talk about

3064
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
I can certainly handle

3065
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Smashing Pumpkins and Tonight Tonight

3066
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
on a coaster would be pretty

3067
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
moving right awesome yeah it'd be like

3068
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
going on the moon trip that they

3069
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
go on in the video that's maybe actually

3070
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
fuck the Muppets let's Smashing Pumpkins

3071
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
on Rock and Roller Coaster

3072
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
what I like about the Rock and Roller Coaster is

3073
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
the versatility of it yeah

3074
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
it's like it's a cool fit it's like not something

3075
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
I would have like guessed but it's a really cool fit

3076
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
and then the Monsters Inc

3077
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
I think could be

3078
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
unique in that area

3079
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
yeah it's gonna be good it's just

3080
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
a bummer that what had to

3081
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
what had to go to make it happen

3082
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
you mean Rock and Roller Coaster not Monsters Inc

3083
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
I mean the Muppets

3084
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
yeah I think the Monsters Inc

3085
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
will be good to great

3086
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
I'm not worried about that being good

3087
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
it's just like yeah couldn't you put it somewhere else

3088
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
you ever been to the restaurant Pizza Rizzo

3089
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Muppet what do you think about

3090
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
this here's another big debate on the show

3091
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
I won't even lead you to it

3092
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
because we haven't actually eaten the food there

3093
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
any opinions about Pizza Rizzo

3094
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
which will presumably be going away

3095
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
with the Muppet Courier going away

3096
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
I thought it was good

3097
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
the ones that have stood out to me

3098
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
at Hollywood Studios

3099
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
the Sci-Fi Dine-In

3100
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
oh yeah

3101
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
the theming is awesome

3102
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
I haven't done that in forever

3103
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
I know it was still there

3104
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
wow really

3105
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
I think I realized it a year or two

3106
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
when we were doing the show

3107
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
the Roundup Barbecue

3108
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Woody's Roundup Barbecue

3109
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
is surprisingly fantastic

3110
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
and then there's another hack

3111
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
I think is great that a lot of

3112
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
I found out about it recently

3113
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
but if you go to like

3114
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
Brown Derby which is like their nice

3115
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
kind of old Hollywood school restaurant

3116
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
you can get a VIP pass

3117
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
to watch Fantasmic

3118
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
and sit in the front

3119
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
all you gotta do is just go to one of those restaurants

3120
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
and have the receipt and you can go

3121
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
see Fantasmic like VIP seating

3122
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
this is good to have you in general

3123
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
because we are so Disneyland

3124
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
oriented and I'm sure there's a lot

3125
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
of people who are frustrated by like

3126
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
the giant swaths of things we've never talked about

3127
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
because you're naming restaurant after restaurant

3128
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
that I'm like ultimately I have

3129
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
I've only been to

3130
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Disney World way more than most people I know

3131
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
but still not enough to like

3132
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
we're missing out on a lot

3133
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
all these steak houses

3134
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
there's so much on the list

3135
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
that we have like a plan

3136
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
and when we go to do and then

3137
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
we do 20% of it

3138
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
we gotta go for two weeks

3139
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
that's what I'm saying you just run out of time

3140
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
even I haven't tried

3141
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
like so many different things because you're like next time

3142
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
next time and then

3143
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
but at least you get to like build that list up

3144
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
forever

3145
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
here's what I'm thinking if we end up around the time

3146
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
of Epic Universe opening up

3147
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
I'd like to make that a win instead of an F

3148
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
there's been a few things happening in Los Angeles

3149
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
I have a new little baby

3150
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
lots going on

3151
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
so

3152
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
what I'm hoping is by the time we get

3153
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
there that we will still be able to and some of it

3154
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
is confirmed be able to do rip ride rocket

3155
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
because I keep chickening out every time I go

3156
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
and I want to do this shitty coaster that

3157
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
no one likes before they close it

3158
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
that hurts me I will do it

3159
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
I hate the thing I hate the way it goes

3160
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
up I will do it

3161
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
are you a universal person or are you mainly Disney?

3162
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
I've gone there several times

3163
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
Pizza Rizzo I don't know

3164
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
there's been no announcement of closure

3165
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
as far as I know that we'll be able to do Pizza Rizzo

3166
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
Muppets

3167
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
one last time and jelly rolls

3168
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
jelly rolls supposedly closing as well

3169
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
now just don't make me do it at the end

3170
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
of the night because at the end of the night I need

3171
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
my little swan dolphin nap and knowing

3172
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
that I'm staying there next time

3173
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
I'm sure of this I've been dreaming of this for

3174
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
months it's been a beacon it's been my

3175
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
lighthouse during a very insane time

3176
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
of my life so you gotta really

3177
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
keep me on the hook because I might just drift

3178
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
to sleep

3179
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
if it's one Bon Jovi cover

3180
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
too many I'm like guys

3181
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
I got serenity ahead of me

3182
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
which if you had to hear one Bon Jovi

3183
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
cover what song would you want?

3184
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
Oh Runaway I like Runaway

3185
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
yes that one I can

3186
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
that's got a good that's got that like

3187
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
cool 80s

3188
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
what is on your list

3189
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
next time you go what's strongest

3190
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
on your list either that you haven't done or that you're dying

3191
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
to do again what's number one?

3192
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
the next one is I want to

3193
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
eat at the Moroccan restaurant in Morocco

3194
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
God I've eaten at a Moroccan

3195
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Moroccan restaurant there is there

3196
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
is there only one or is there

3197
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
there's two there's the one that's

3198
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
on the water that sort of like sit down like

3199
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
pick up like more snacky and then there's the

3200
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
Marrakesh which is deep in Morocco

3201
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
okay I have done that for lunch and I

3202
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
remember being pretty surprised at the

3203
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
quality I thought that was pretty top notch but I bet

3204
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
is it even is dinner even

3205
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
nicer yeah I think it's more like yeah it's like

3206
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
a sit down they do a different menu and then there's a

3207
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
secret pop up where

3208
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
Aladdin and Jasmine will appear in the

3209
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
back room with these like lit up lanterns

3210
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
you know these hacks

3211
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
they do like a secret photo thing

3212
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
it's like really really cool

3213
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
yeah

3214
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
so next up is the beach club

3215
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
okay oh great

3216
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
I gotta cross that one off that was my second

3217
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
trip of my life such fond

3218
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
memory like sand pool might be my favorite

3219
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
could be my favorite yes and that oh

3220
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
my god the shipwreck pool

3221
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
how have we never done an episode

3222
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
just the shipwreck pool

3223
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
I'll be the least articulate I've ever been in my life

3224
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
to say that it's cool and then you go inside and it goes all

3225
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
the way across the walkway

3226
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
such a little kid energy for me and they have one of the

3227
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
coolest little like old

3228
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
school restaurants called Beaches and Cream

3229
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
yeah yeah of course which is

3230
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
a really good one I haven't been Jason's

3231
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
I've been yeah those signs

3232
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
also the signage has never changed

3233
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
around it is such late 80s

3234
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
perfection just like that's what I love

3235
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
about Swan and Dolphin it's just like it is

3236
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
1988 it's the way I saw

3237
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
the first time I went to Disney World like has not changed

3238
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
yeah and it's got the most like

3239
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
impactful you see those swans

3240
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
from so far away I was gonna ask you guys

3241
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
is there a ride

3242
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
that you just like

3243
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
secretly avoid or like slightly

3244
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
afraid of or is like intimidated

3245
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
rip ride other than rip ride rocket

3246
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
that you just hope doesn't come

3247
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
up yeah I don't I'm

3248
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
not dying to do like full

3249
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
centrifuge mission space

3250
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
yeah I don't like mission space

3251
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
I used to be such a

3252
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
it's been a whole thing I used to be such a wimp

3253
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
about like maybe the group just won't want to go on

3254
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Splash Mountain like the drop was too much

3255
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
for me at one point and I'm happy to say now

3256
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
I've done Tiana Tiana coming

3257
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
it rolls off my back

3258
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
my back now I'm fine on that

3259
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
now but

3260
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
yeah what I'm sure there's a big

3261
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
one I just haven't even

3262
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Everest oh I love Everest

3263
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
I loved Everest but I'd

3264
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
be I'd be nervous getting on it again

3265
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
it was like maybe it was maybe like one percent

3266
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
out of my comfort zone

3267
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
in a good way I mean I loved it but

3268
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
I'd be I will be sitting in that chair again

3269
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
kind of with heart pounding for sure

3270
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
it's weird it's like mine is like

3271
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
goofy sky school

3272
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
or the yeah good choice

3273
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
ferris wheel like

3274
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
oh ferris wheel I've never done the ferris wheel

3275
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
I haven't done the one that like

3276
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
the cars that slide and even I went in the

3277
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
regular one and like slow heights

3278
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
is kind of a weird thing for me so like

3279
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
when the goofy sky school is like

3280
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
it's on the edge slow and on the edge like

3281
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
that starts making me go in

3282
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
a way that when you're going fast on a coaster

3283
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
it doesn't that's in the same way like

3284
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
um uh rip ride

3285
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
rocket going up like that which

3286
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
I've done it once at this other

3287
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
similar coaster it nots

3288
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
that freaks me out like

3289
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
I just kind of panic a little bit on the way

3290
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
up so that's those are more

3291
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
of what I get freaked out by

3292
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
yeah and I like I'll

3293
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
guess we have to do the swinging

3294
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
cars eventually you'll be

3295
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
okay I think you'll be okay you can you can zen

3296
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
your way through that probably but I truly

3297
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
kind of had a little panic attack doing the

3298
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
regular car I kind of disassociate

3299
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
like I disassociated for like 20 seconds maybe you wouldn't

3300
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
like that look you don't need to you

3301
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
owe this audience nothing you owe the show

3302
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
I owe them everything

3303
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
oh well that's a but now I look bad

3304
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
that's a much better quote

3305
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
my body is theirs I put my life

3306
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
on the line wrap a go pro to me and I'll

3307
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
do it is there anything you avoid

3308
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
so I was

3309
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
terrified of velocity coaster

3310
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
so every time I was there

3311
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
I'd be a group and like this is the best freaking

3312
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
ride oh my god you leave your

3313
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
soul behind you got to do it and I kept thinking like

3314
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
every time

3315
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
it broke down and I'm like

3316
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
yes next time

3317
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
finally I had to face

3318
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
going on and I couldn't back

3319
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
out tried the whiskey thing

3320
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
okay so I had

3321
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
that liquid courage going in

3322
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
it's still terrified the hell out of me

3323
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
like you're going so fast

3324
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
and you are like out of your seat for

3325
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
part of it it's and so I'm like

3326
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
closing my eyes and like

3327
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
so I did it once and it's

3328
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
still knocked me out so

3329
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
that's one that I'm like

3330
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
tentative on okay

3331
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
okay wow didn't you still yeah

3332
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
that doesn't help that doesn't help my cause

3333
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
I don't know I know I got to

3334
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
it's fast like it's like Tron is like

3335
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
57 miles an hour Tron

3336
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
is nothing compared to I know

3337
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
it's not I can tell yeah

3338
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Velocicoaster they said is like 75

3339
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
but it feels like 30 miles

3340
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
an hour faster it's I think

3341
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
about it I love I did it three times

3342
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
last time really yeah and it's my like my

3343
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
favorite thing I couldn't stop

3344
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
talking about it for months after we did it

3345
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
I was like I take it back to the Velocicoaster

3346
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
I wish I could be like you and it doesn't affect me

3347
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
it's crazy cause I was

3348
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
I'm not such a crazy coaster guy

3349
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
but for whatever

3350
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
like I felt like this euphoria came

3351
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
over me it's a great ride I mean it's a great ride

3352
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
it just hits like it's so smooth

3353
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
is the thing too cause like Hulk I

3354
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
understand if you go come on Hulk

3355
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
and Hulk rattles your skull

3356
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
that sounds terrible to me Hulk rattles

3357
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
your skull so thoroughly

3358
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Velocicoaster is fast but

3359
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
it's smooth you're like floating

3360
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
the whole time and I was just like laughing

3361
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
like a madman like

3362
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
you know what I think it's one of the

3363
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
best rides at any of these parks

3364
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
is Hagrid's yeah

3365
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
absolutely no I'm a big Hagrid's fan

3366
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
that I can handle that's like right

3367
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
that's intense but that's an intensity I can

3368
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
do and it doesn't do like the

3369
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
move you know we're not like

3370
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
there's not inversion it's that bit you know what it is

3371
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
the what are they cause they call it the top hat

3372
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
on Velocicoaster I'm so scared of the top hat

3373
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
I don't know if I can do the top hat

3374
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
I don't fear anything

3375
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
while I'm on the Velocicoaster

3376
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
for some strange reason and I fear everything

3377
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
in my regular life yeah I was going to say

3378
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
all your fears go away

3379
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
that's for me wow I fear everything

3380
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
24 7 except when I'm on

3381
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
Velocicoaster I love how you can do like the toughest

3382
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
ride and be like oh for whatever

3383
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
reason yeah you're routed in an interesting

3384
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
way I sure am

3385
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
listeners of this show know that

3386
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
you've been listening long enough

3387
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
for a while I avoided Space

3388
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
Mountain in Orlando

3389
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
I don't know why like as a kid

3390
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
my first time going I could go on it back to

3391
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
back to back yeah and then one of those times

3392
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
I just felt kind of like shaken

3393
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
which luckily

3394
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
went away but I will say

3395
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
the Space Mountain at land

3396
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
I think is a better ride

3397
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
yeah well it also feels

3398
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
rickety in Florida

3399
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
it feels old and like it's similar to the Matterhorn

3400
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
out here it feels like a 70's

3401
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
this feels old

3402
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
so I think in that way it's charming

3403
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
and you feel like the old school

3404
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Disneyland but the last

3405
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
time I went on the Matterhorn

3406
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
I mean it's a it's a rough ride but I

3407
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
was like joking with my

3408
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
friend and like the way I leaned up

3409
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
the bar hit my knee

3410
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
oh yeah and I was like blinding

3411
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
pain I was like take

3412
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
a break from Matterhorn yeah I might

3413
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
be done with Matterhorn until I

3414
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
do something yeah I don't need it doesn't give

3415
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
me anything that outweighs the

3416
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
bad stuff yeah the only

3417
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
thing they're gonna do is implode it like there's

3418
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
no way that they're gonna fix the problem

3419
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
because it's impossible to fix the problems

3420
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
with it because I feel like

3421
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
constructed I do love how Disneyland

3422
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
stays authentic to a lot

3423
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
the best way that it can but

3424
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Matterhorn I know there's a better

3425
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
ride that could be in there

3426
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
sure yeah but you're right

3427
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
so we know like the next level yeah they gotta

3428
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
rebuild it though that's the thing and supposedly

3429
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
of course somebody I've said this on the show before is

3430
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
a fact I read that they need to

3431
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
rebuild it within 25 years just

3432
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
because it is falling apart the structure is

3433
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
falling apart so like they will have

3434
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
to do something to it within

3435
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
let's say 20 25 years unless

3436
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
there's a horrible day where the Matterhorn

3437
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
topples over it's possible just

3438
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
tips yeah oh we would all

3439
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
we all have children and all of us

3440
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
are inner children would all weep

3441
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
well but maybe if people were under they could catch

3442
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
it and they could push it back up save it heroically

3443
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
right when you guys go to world

3444
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
what are you excited

3445
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
because you guys you guys go to land frequently

3446
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
what are you excited to see what are you excited

3447
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
to like oh I mean

3448
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
it is like Disney World

3449
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
is becoming like me trying

3450
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
to tap into the 90s a lot which

3451
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
is why it's like mundane stuff like

3452
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
people mover and

3453
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
country bears that

3454
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
Sunny Eclipse hasn't changed

3455
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
I love that you knew who Sunny Eclipse was

3456
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
we're big Sunny Eclipse heads yeah going on the monorail

3457
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
hanging in the Polynesian

3458
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
lobby it's a lot of like nostalgia

3459
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
just walking around contemporary

3460
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
but then other hotel stuff

3461
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
that I haven't done because we didn't

3462
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
get much of a chance to do that last trip

3463
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
yeah so like some other

3464
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
going to some other hotels Hooptie

3465
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
do review I've never done and I meant

3466
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
to do that last time and that's still on the list

3467
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
for sure yeah and that's been going forever

3468
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
but it's nice to have guardians now as a like

3469
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
that's not nostalgia that is a

3470
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
current cutting edge thing that kicks

3471
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
ass that's like you know because

3472
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
you start to fear that like is Universal

3473
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
getting the upper hand and Disney isn't

3474
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
producing at the

3475
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
volume that that Universal is but

3476
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
but guardians is you were the one

3477
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
that made me go back

3478
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
and get back into guardians because I did it

3479
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
the first time kind of made me uncomfortable and I was

3480
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
like huge into Tron and you're like

3481
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
no guardians number one Tron

3482
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
too and I'm like oh it's like okay let me

3483
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
go back and give it a shot and I went back I

3484
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
got conga oh great

3485
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
that really did it for me for

3486
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
whatever reason so I have my favorite song in

3487
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
the world I just like I don't know it's made

3488
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
for that ride yeah yeah it really works

3489
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
for me yeah and I caught it I'm like

3490
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
okay I get I get what he's saying wow

3491
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
oh great I'm glad I was part of that I let

3492
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
the fear like the fear go and I just

3493
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
and it was like now it's

3494
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
a brilliant it's a brilliant fantastic and I like

3495
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
your whiskey plan that's good stuff

3496
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
I feel like you wind it down I'm so

3497
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
happy you've you've you've talked to us for

3498
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
for so long here and just to get to talk

3499
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Disney with you after talking room

3500
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
with you the thing that's echoing in my head

3501
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
really to tie it all together is just that

3502
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
I wish the great movie ride was still

3503
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
there and that they would do some kind

3504
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
of redo and acknowledge one of the most

3505
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
prominent films I feel of

3506
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
the 21st century if only there was

3507
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
a room sequence in

3508
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
the great movie ride that I think

3509
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
it deserves it very badly

3510
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
yeah I think

3511
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
I think there's a number I think you could it could

3512
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
be all animatronics but also you know it could

3513
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
be one of the things where the the gangster

3514
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
or the cowboy get on the car with I think if

3515
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
I think if Chris R got

3516
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
in the car with you and threatened

3517
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
you like asked for your money the

3518
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
guests money I like that

3519
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
yeah yeah I think that's that's as strong

3520
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
as old west bandits

3521
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
and it's it's funny you say that because I was

3522
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
on I was at the man's Chinese

3523
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
there where it's now Mickey's runaway yeah

3524
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
yeah and I was in line with my family

3525
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
and these two guys

3526
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
come up and they're like

3527
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
Greg Sestero wow oh

3528
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
my god we get a photo and

3529
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
I just thought to myself like

3530
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
12 year old me would saw

3531
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
this would be like holy crap oh man

3532
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
I had no idea like

3533
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
what what what did you do I was like you

3534
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
can't see that movie yet

3535
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
you gotta be 18

3536
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
it pains me that I like you know like

3537
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
we've talked about Aaron

3538
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
my wife and we were both like at those screenings

3539
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
together and then we started dating after that now we've

3540
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
made two children together and we're like oh it'd be great

3541
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
to like share a movie that helped us get

3542
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
together no maybe not till

3543
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
you're no maybe maybe they'll never be an age

3544
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
where I want to watch the very

3545
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
awkward sex scenes in this film with our sons

3546
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
but we'll see we'll see

3547
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
yeah they'll find it eventually

3548
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
but that was the fact that you

3549
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
you've told this story now of like

3550
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
arriving in Hollywood with

3551
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
a dream to go live at a weird apartment

3552
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
and your key doesn't work and you gotta

3553
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
go to a Sunset Boulevard shady

3554
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
motel and now you're at

3555
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
man's Chinese theater

3556
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
the fake version in Florida and

3557
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
you are the star being recognized

3558
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
this is a beautiful

3559
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
what a roller coaster ride

3560
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
pun intended

3561
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
that's beautiful

3562
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
well look thank you for

3563
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
talking with us for a long time thank you

3564
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
for making for pushing

3565
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
the room into existence

3566
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
and clearly you must be

3567
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
at this point that like look the joy

3568
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
I've gotten from it

3569
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
clearly the joy you've gotten from it

3570
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
traveling the world in this Disney

3571
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
world existence it's just so like

3572
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
it's been a beacon of joy for me

3573
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
like the goddamn Disney parks are

3574
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
and I hope it's the same for you too

3575
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
I mean it really gave us like

3576
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
so much in such a

3577
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
weird way that's I mean it's what you'd hope

3578
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
you know if you made Back

3579
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
to the Future a movie that classically

3580
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
worked you know it's somehow

3581
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
roundabout hit a home run in the opposite

3582
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
direction

3583
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
to the degree where like every moment of Back to the

3584
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Future works every moment in the room

3585
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
doesn't work but in a way that I want

3586
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
to experience again and again

3587
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
it's really it just it delivers

3588
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
I think I mean it shows with you

3589
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
and I think with my

3590
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
experience is like if you have the right mindset

3591
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
you can turn any situation

3592
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
into something that will work

3593
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
for the best and I think that's what

3594
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
you had the sense of humor

3595
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
to like give this crazy

3596
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
trailer that you saw a shot

3597
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
and like root for something

3598
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
that didn't make didn't work

3599
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
or nobody else got at the time

3600
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
Tommy called to me like he called to you in reality

3601
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
yeah it's a wonder there was there's just something

3602
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
I guess I chased what you were chasing

3603
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
in this weird other way yeah

3604
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
yeah more today than ever I

3605
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000

3607
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000

3608
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
