1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
When your town has let you down

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
When your port has fallen short

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
When you're too worn out to run

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And need some ribs or a Cinnabon

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You need a place, a place for rock

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
A place for roll

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
A place where Oakland Raiders merch is sold

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
A sublime hot topic and billabong

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
A place where you can purchase a candy thong

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So let's go take a walk

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Let's all go to City Walk

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Tonight, tonight

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Let's go take a walk

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Probably one of the first, probably the first podcast, The Ride, that has involved some intoxication.

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Not that we're all a mess, but on the good boy spectrum, you know, two to three drinks is getting up there.

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So I just want to be forthcoming, which has been a tradition in my life.

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
If I've ever been slightly stoned and then I go out into public, I always immediately tell people,

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm slightly stoned, so keep that in mind while I'm talking. Let me make you very uncomfortable with this assertion.

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm at the point where I already have like that headache kind of going on, I think.

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So I had like a drink and then as we'll find out, a drink I thought had alcohol in it, but I don't think did.

23
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It didn't?

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I don't think it did.

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Do you think was it not even alcohol?

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You drank two huge ice cream smoothies?

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm pretty sure that I was tricked into ordering.

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That's our guest, Eva Anderson.

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Eva, you're the worst.

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Sorry.

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm just so shocked.

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Because as I was drinking and I go, there's nothing going on.

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What did you do?

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
A lot of things on the summer menu didn't have alcohol.

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You had to go to the bottom where it said like adult beverages.

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So you had two non-alcoholic drinks, because I gave it a taste and I told you it tasted like strawberry compote that would be on the top of IHOP pancakes.

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I have to look at this.

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
He drank 64 ounces of like ice cream.

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
This is almost as big a folly as what I did in this sector.

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Because you heard me say, oh, this is delicious. I love how this tastes.

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And obviously the reason is that there was no alcohol in it to ruin the taste of a sugary treat.

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You and my little sister.

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm pretty sure.

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I kind of look at the...

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
We're getting ahead of ourselves.

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Get to the website while you...

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Here, let's be more inviting to Eva.

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Hi.

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Thanks for coming back.

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You're now a podcast, The Ride Luminary.

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm so excited.

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You know, you came here before to talk about the American adventure.

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Amazing.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And now we're talking about some of America's most adventurous restaurants and chains.

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yes.

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And we had a big adventure while enjoying these.

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And you requested this sector from a list of...

58
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Actually, I don't think you saw the full list as bestowed by the sector keeper.

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But before you knew what fell into what sector, your knee-jerk thoughts were Bubba Gumps and Tony Romas.

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yes.

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I went to Tony Romas a lot as a child.

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I don't know why, but I ended up there a lot.

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So I had a very vivid memory of Tony Roma.

64
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
At that one.

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And there were more Tony Romas around Los Angeles and the earth before then, but that specific...

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yeah, I feel like it was a City Walk thing.

67
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And then I went to Bubba Gump once like four years ago and I was like, this place is fucking insane.

68
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And I showed up there just as Jay Leno was leaving, which to this day is like one of the biggest talk ciphers to me.

69
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Star sighting.

70
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
What was he doing at Bubba Gump in City Walk?

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Like he could eat anywhere.

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
He's so rich.

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
He's a man of the people.

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I had the full experience, the full Bubba Gump experience, and I was like, this is amazing.

75
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Wow.

76
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Because it really is.

77
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I currently feel...

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I think I'm...

79
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
My mental pummeling is in thirds.

80
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
One third is a tiny amount of alcohol.

81
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Another third is sun because it is horrible in Los Angeles right now.

82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's a horrible heat wave.

83
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And the other third is just that we all had a lunch where you could not look in any direction without 19 signs all screaming at you.

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Screaming things from the movie, Forrest Gump.

85
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
From a movie that is...

86
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What's the...

87
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's 24 years old.

88
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Also, 1900 calories apiece probably when you add up all that food.

89
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Oh my God.

90
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Should we throw to the sector here real quick to announce what is in this sector?

91
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Please, oh great sector keeper, elucidate us.

92
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
What are we talking about today?

93
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Hello, boys.

94
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Hello, Eva.

95
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Today's sector is sector six.

96
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Tony Roma's, Bubba Gump, and Wasabi.

97
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Good luck.

98
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Okay, thank you, Forrest Gump.

99
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
He seems nice.

100
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Yes, he's a sweetheart.

101
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And he's at it rough.

102
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And it's cool that he's able to be so nice.

103
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:23,000
He's a child trapped in purgatory essentially forever having been poisoned by the City Walk fountains.

104
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Oh no.

105
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Yeah.

106
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So he's...

107
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's cool he's still able to be nice and help us out.

108
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Mike, any progress in what you're looking up over there?

109
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
No, because I realize now that the menu I ordered off of was like a supplemental menu.

110
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
There's no way to solve this problem.

111
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So on the main menu when I go to the Hollywood location, there's no record of the drink existing.

112
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So either you drank six shots of Everclear or none.

113
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Here's what I'm thinking too.

114
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
The refill on the drink was $1.50.

115
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It was $1.50.

116
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:06,000
There's no way an alcoholic drink refill is $1.50 unless you've got some like Vegas seafood buffet thing going on where it's like all you can drink for 13...

117
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Well, see if you're a dirty alcohol glass.

118
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Give me your souvenir glass.

119
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I have a souvenir glass.

120
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
See if you get any oomph of like a...

121
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It just smells like strawberries.

122
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's just strawberries.

123
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I mean, a few of us all drank like strawberry sundaes.

124
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
There's no way it wasn't just two Slurpees.

125
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
There's no way.

126
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
We all carpooled here after this outing and Mike was talking about something unrelated

127
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
and Jason caught, are you licking the sugar off of the rim of the souvenir glass?

128
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Game recognize game friends.

129
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Which now it occurs to me, I was driving and I probably...

130
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Well, now we know it didn't have alcohol in it, so I would have been in the clear.

131
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:00,000
But if a police officer had seen a sloppy man licking sugar off of a full glass, not even a can or something.

132
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I would love to breathalyze you right now.

133
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's probably I'm fine.

134
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I probably could drive a car.

135
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You drink giant like four milkshakes.

136
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
We should all try these.

137
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
But they're all like Slurpees, so they're like less caloric than a milkshake.

138
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Are they?

139
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yes.

140
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Yes.

141
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Yes.

142
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
But there at Bubba Gump?

143
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Well, I saw and I announced to you guys before we started at Bubba Gump that I saw there's an icy machine behind the counter.

144
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So we could probably look up what like a medium to large icy is.

145
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yes, there was an icy section on the menu.

146
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I didn't order it.

147
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Icy branded.

148
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Well, that's because also in New Orleans, there's like these daiquiri bars everywhere.

149
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yes.

150
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
We can walk around with a giant daiquiri as big as your head.

151
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:50,000
My drink was topped with Mist Twist, which is the current branding for Sierra Mist.

152
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Oh, really?

153
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
My candy drink had Sierra Mist in it.

154
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Boy, my candy drink was the sweetest wine I've ever had.

155
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yeah, you and your wife both just had a couple of glasses of white.

156
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You got Cupcake brand wine.

157
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I heard you.

158
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Yeah, that's right.

159
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Yeah.

160
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I've had it.

161
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's good.

162
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
That's the only wine that you can have.

163
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's not as good as this just Slurpee I drank out of a...

164
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You lit up...

165
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You really specifically said, I love this drink.

166
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Yeah.

167
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Now we know.

168
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Now we know because there's no alcohol to ruin the taste of it.

169
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It was just sugar.

170
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You have no excuse for any sloppiness in this episode.

171
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Michael though demolished a skillet of mac and cheese and the waiter came back and was

172
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
surprised at how quickly it would that shrimp mac and cheese.

173
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I really haven't eaten very much today also.

174
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yeah.

175
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Cool.

176
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Look, I'm not trying to make a show of myself.

177
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm not trying to be a spectacle, but maybe I made some interesting choices today.

178
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Okay.

179
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So should we go through the day chronologically?

180
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I want to start with wasabi.

181
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Okay.

182
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Right.

183
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Because we didn't go to wasabi today, but I went to wasabi when this series was first

184
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
mentioned as a possibility.

185
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Am I breaking the timeline by alluding to that we aren't always doing these?

186
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Mostly we've been at City Walk every day for the last six days.

187
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
There's no way we could all go to three restaurants in the time we had.

188
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
No.

189
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That's okay.

190
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
There just isn't enough time on this earth, which is unfortunate.

191
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
We'd all always love to go to three City Walk restaurants every single day.

192
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:30,000
But when this, I did this as pre research, I went to wasabi, which is a restaurant that

193
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
serves sushi food at City Walk.

194
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And I wanted to get something, you know, it's pretty just basic and I wanted to get something

195
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
you could only get at City Walk.

196
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
That was a little unusual.

197
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And so I got the Terminator role, which is of course-

198
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Are they named after all universal properties or things that would be in the park?

199
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
There are only three things on the menu that are universal related.

200
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
One is the universal role.

201
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
One is the spicy Hollywood role.

202
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And one is the Terminator, which is spicy tuna wrapped with salmon and avocado topped with

203
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
jalapenos, seven flavored chili, chili oil, ponzu, sriracha, and green onions.

204
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Hasta la vista, baby.

205
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So this is a menu item themed after an attraction that has not been at Universal Studios for

206
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
five to seven years.

207
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm not sure exactly.

208
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And it was good and not a level of spicy through me.

209
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And is that all I have to say about wasabi?

210
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It had sake that was enjoyable.

211
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
The service could have been a little faster.

212
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And that's maybe the end.

213
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I don't know.

214
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I think one interesting fact might be that Panda Express has a Panda Inn.

215
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And one of the only existing Panda Inns still in the world is wasabi.

216
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Oh.

217
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's owned by that company.

218
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And there's only like four or five of them.

219
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Oh, yeah.

220
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Because there used to be a Panda Inn next to it, but that's Dong Po Kitchen now.

221
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yeah.

222
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
So anyway.

223
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So it's one of those odd offshoots of Panda Express that is not particularly-

224
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
That's sushi.

225
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Taking off.

226
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Okay.

227
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Okay.

228
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
So they haven't done the best job of branding these spin-offs or what?

229
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Although didn't we determine, although maybe this one's in the future.

230
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I think it's in the future.

231
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
All right.

232
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Save it.

233
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Save Panda Express facts.

234
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Oh, is there a Panda Express in CityWalk?

235
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Yes.

236
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
So you guys have to do Dong Po Inn and wasabi inn.

237
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
But they're in different sectors.

238
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
So-

239
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yeah.

240
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'll be next week.

241
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
So yeah.

242
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
The sector keeper would be very unhappy if we crossed sectors and didn't talk about the

243
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
ones in this one.

244
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,600
However, I am curious before we get into the places that we went together, any other CityWalk

245
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,000
stores or restaurants that you are a fan of in other sectors.

246
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Or yeah, experiences at CityWalk.

247
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,080
I really liked that fountain, which makes me sad that when I was a kid that a sector

248
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,080
keeper died there.

249
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,080
Yeah.

250
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,080
That's unfortunate.

251
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:06,000
I always go to Howl of the Moon, the piano bar before I go to Horror Nights.

252
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Oh boy.

253
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Oh yeah.

254
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I don't say my opinion about it, but it is always the place I go.

255
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,160
And I remember in the nineties, there was like a, not nineties, the oh-ohs.

256
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,640
There was like a very weird bookstore there.

257
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,120
Upstart Crow?

258
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,120
Yes.

259
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,640
Was it called Upstart Crow?

260
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,640
At some point in time.

261
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,320
That was the one with the coffee bean in it?

262
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,320
Yeah.

263
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,440
It was like a fancy, a fancy coffee, like fancy bookstore.

264
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,440
Yeah.

265
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,360
Or just like fake fancy.

266
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,440
And I think that was in the era when they were trying to pretend that CityWalk was a

267
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,440
real city.

268
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,440
Yeah.

269
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,600
Because there was a time when they actually polled residents and said, what would you

270
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,040
want out of a development like this?

271
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:51,800
And they said, education, which is why there's a UCLA extension up there.

272
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,800
Maybe no longer.

273
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,800
I think it's not.

274
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,080
No longer functioning, but there were classrooms up there.

275
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,080
Oh, my mind is blown.

276
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,080
The sign's still there.

277
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,880
You could go there, take classes, go to Upstart Crow.

278
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,880
Yeah.

279
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,880
It was like a whole quad thing.

280
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,880
Yeah, you could do your homework in Red Esses.

281
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,880
It was a whole.

282
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,880
Yeah.

283
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,560
Howl at the, and then you go to Howl at the Moon.

284
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,640
And then you could buy a store that has giant things in it.

285
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,280
Have we talked about that in any of these?

286
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,280
No, I don't think so.

287
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,600
I don't know what sector it was in.

288
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,560
Also, I'll just include it in sector six.

289
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:22,920
But my friend Tyler, I believe said there was a store that sold big things, which is

290
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,280
the close, related to my nightmare of gigantism.

291
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,160
No, yeah, you wouldn't like that.

292
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,160
Yeah.

293
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,960
And it was presumably in a closed off space.

294
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,240
But I don't know.

295
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,720
Did he list an example?

296
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,320
Maybe you could buy a big pencil.

297
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,320
A big wine.

298
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,760
I remember a couple of knickknack stores back in Ithaca, like one had a giant wine glass

299
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,760
in the center.

300
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,960
It might've been like kitchen and cooking supplies, but there was also like a comically

301
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,680
large wine glass or.

302
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,680
Hmm.

303
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,560
There were several places at Ithaca.

304
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,560
No, just one.

305
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,560
Okay.

306
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,560
I was trying to remember what it sold.

307
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,040
And I know they sell ones too, like novelty ones where it's like, it's a big wine glass

308
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,120
and it holds a full bottle.

309
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,120
That's fun.

310
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,120
Yeah.

311
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,120
That is fun.

312
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,160
But why would you ever, how would that be deployed?

313
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,760
Oh, well, like once at a party and then put in a closet.

314
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,200
Have you ever guys ever seen that picture of Jonathan Gold when he won the Pulitzer

315
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,200
Prize?

316
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,200
No.

317
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,720
He's drinking out of a wine glass that big and it's pouring all down his chest.

318
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,720
Oh man.

319
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,720
Doing it upright.

320
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,720
Yeah.

321
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,720
It's, it's, it's shocking.

322
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,720
It's great.

323
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,000
I mean, it's a man who just won a Pulitzer, the first ever Pulitzer prize for food criticism,

324
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,400
just like living it up.

325
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,240
But it is an insane photo.

326
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,240
He was number one.

327
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,240
He was the first.

328
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,240
Yeah.

329
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,240
For food criticism.

330
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,080
I mean, other people won for other types of criticism, but he was the first one.

331
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,800
Do we know if he's ever weighed in on a city walk establishment?

332
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:49,000
He did a very funny review of like 10 years ago of Olive Garden that he did on April Fool's.

333
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Okay.

334
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,960
But it was, it was pretty funny.

335
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:57,000
I might just casually while we're talking, I might see if Jonathan Gold's ever do that

336
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Google search.

337
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,960
Jonathan Gold, Pulitzer prize wine glass and did not get a picture.

338
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,440
Just look up Jonathan Gold wine glass.

339
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,440
I did.

340
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,440
What?

341
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,120
That was the first thing I didn't want to, I just edited myself.

342
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,880
Getting images has this lockdown.

343
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,680
Well, we'll figure that out.

344
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:19,040
Um, he's maybe he's talked about David Chang, who is, is David Chang the owner of, um, Ludo.

345
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,280
He talks about Ludo all the time.

346
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,280
Okay.

347
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,280
Oh yeah.

348
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,280
But he hasn't specifically reviewed Ludo.

349
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,280
He loves David Chang, loves Ludo.

350
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,280
Okay.

351
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,920
Um, but Hey, we're talking, we have two, two of the finest restaurants in Los Angeles,

352
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,400
America to cover today.

353
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,000
And we went to, we went to both of them.

354
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,920
Did you find a picture about winning Pulitzer?

355
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,920
Did I spell his name?

356
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,680
Here it's guys.

357
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,040
Just look at it really quick.

358
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,040
Yeah.

359
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,040
That's worth the pass around.

360
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,040
That's great.

361
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,000
And it's like, show it to me.

362
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Google Jonathan Gold.

363
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Oh God.

364
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
That's we're like, it's just Jonathan Gold Pulitzer.

365
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'll get you there.

366
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,480
I'll get you the first picture that comes up.

367
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:00,520
I thought it would be, uh, well, that's what we'll do when we win the Pulitzer for city

368
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,560
blogger based podcasts.

369
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,960
Uh, we'll head back up to Tony Roma's and do it all over again.

370
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,040
Um, so Tony Roma's, huh?

371
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,040
Tony Roma's.

372
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,280
Um, why do you think you ended up there all the time?

373
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,520
Um, I think my, um, I think, I think the eighties was, am I wrong to think the eighties was

374
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,400
all about people who were into ribs?

375
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,000
Like a little more than they are now eighties and nineties.

376
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,480
I don't think for sure I was way into ribs.

377
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,720
Shelly spent a lot of money marketing ribs.

378
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,720
Yeah.

379
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,440
And reading the Tony Roma story, cause he's, you know, is it still called Tony Roma's a

380
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,120
place for ribs?

381
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,120
Maybe not.

382
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,360
That was the name of it for a long time.

383
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,280
They might've yanked that for the sake of broadening out.

384
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,280
Yeah.

385
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,880
So it was a very like rib centric restaurant.

386
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,480
I remember you would just go there and get racks of ribs and onion loaves and, um, reading

387
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:53,320
about it, uh, Tony Roma was the, the food culinary manager for the playboy club.

388
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,320
Is that what it said?

389
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,320
Oh yeah.

390
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,320
Yeah.

391
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,320
Colony director.

392
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,720
So that, then he opened that his restaurant in, was it Dallas or was in Florida?

393
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,720
Miami is what I saw.

394
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,720
In Miami.

395
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,720
Yeah.

396
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,720
Um, and yeah.

397
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,000
And then they had ribs as like a weekend item, but then everyone loved them.

398
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,120
So they became like an everyday thing.

399
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,120
Oh, it was, yeah.

400
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,400
They like tried it out one time and it took off like a lightning.

401
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,400
Yeah.

402
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:24,040
There's like a lot of baby back ribs being tossed around in those days.

403
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,040
They were very trendy.

404
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,600
Nobody got ribs at either of these places.

405
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,520
I have in the past gotten ribs, but I did not today.

406
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,800
We did have the onion loaf.

407
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,800
We had the onion.

408
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,800
That was tasty.

409
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:39,200
I've had, I've eaten a brisket sandwich there and I've had some ribs.

410
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,200
Was it good?

411
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,920
I look, I don't want to give my sum up already, but again, fine is the answer for most of

412
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,640
what Tony Romans has to offer.

413
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,640
It's fine.

414
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,640
It's fine.

415
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,640
Right.

416
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,280
Well, I will say that we walked in, it was not very full and it was like a Saturday afternoon.

417
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,680
It was one 30 right at the end of the lunch rush.

418
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,480
It was probably about a half to a third full.

419
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,600
It's not what I would describe it as less than lively.

420
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,600
Unlike the place we would go after.

421
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,600
Yes.

422
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,480
Which we said the name of multiple times.

423
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,400
Yeah, lively, spoiler.

424
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,320
Spoiler, it's bubblegum shrimp.

425
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,320
It doesn't touch.

426
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,320
Yeah.

427
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,040
So like I've had the ribs there and they were fine.

428
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,880
Like they are, you know, chain ribs.

429
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:27,920
Like maybe the Chili's level, maybe Chili's level of ribs is at least is what I had, you

430
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:32,640
know, a year or two ago when you'd find yourself in a Tony Roma's at CityWalk.

431
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:39,520
Be sure to sampler platter today with chips and salsa and what was the dip?

432
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,920
There was some spinach dip.

433
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,320
There was an onion loaf as said.

434
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,320
And potato skins.

435
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,320
Potato skins.

436
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,600
I haven't had a potato skin in a long time.

437
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:52,880
I once declared my favorite food when I really specifically wanted to go to TGI Fridays as

438
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,880
often as possible.

439
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,240
You declared that was your favorite food?

440
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,240
Yeah.

441
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,200
It was always my graduation present for middle school or elementary school.

442
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,040
I would go to TGI Fridays and get potato skins.

443
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,240
That was also my favorite restaurant.

444
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,560
I liked TGI Fridays a lot.

445
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,560
Very reliable skins and sampler platters there.

446
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:14,280
That's funny because that actually makes me think of when I would eat ribs, which is when

447
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:20,160
my grandparents would take us out for some sort of event, graduation or like a birthday

448
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,560
and we go to a place called Dover Straits.

449
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,360
It was a seafood restaurant and I would always order ribs.

450
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,280
I'd order a whole slab of barbecue ribs and eat all of them.

451
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,560
The half slab versus the full slab is like an emotional decision you have to make.

452
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,320
It's a lot of ribs.

453
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,320
The full slab of ribs, which I have not attempted in many years and I don't eat ribs often,

454
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,320
but maybe once or twice a year.

455
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,720
The full slab really looks like an animal.

456
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,560
It's a full animal.

457
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:52,120
You could imagine, it just looks so intimidating.

458
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:56,280
It just like, Jason's looking at me like, would you eat a full slab of ribs?

459
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,880
No, I don't think I could pull that off.

460
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,120
Unless it was ribs a la carte, I guess.

461
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,560
But then I think I'd probably fill up or get sick of ribs.

462
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,480
I'm very logy.

463
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:12,600
This much fried food and a couple of drinks, one of which was essentially a strawberry

464
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,600
sundae.

465
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,680
It's a lot on my body.

466
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,400
What did you all drink at Tony Romus?

467
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:24,440
I had a Romerita, which was not as, I could have gone premium Romerita and I'm glad I

468
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,440
didn't.

469
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,800
Eva drank a glass of black ink.

470
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,800
It was a purple?

471
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,800
It was purple.

472
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,280
It was a purple martini and it was delicious.

473
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,040
It tasted like a grape something.

474
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,480
I had a cherry hurricane.

475
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,480
Oh yes.

476
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,280
Which had a bunch of rum in it.

477
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:44,040
You got the drink that the bartender said, this is a little much for everybody.

478
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,040
Yeah.

479
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,040
That, please.

480
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:51,440
He for sure said that was the one to not get because it was too sweet.

481
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,480
I said, well, I have to try that.

482
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,360
Then he did it and he made it for me and he goes, this is going to be strong.

483
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,880
He goes, and he kept asking, is it bad?

484
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,300
Is it okay?

485
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,840
If you want something different, I will give you something different.

486
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,840
He kept saying that to me.

487
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,840
Did it taste like medicine?

488
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,840
It looked like it did.

489
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,040
Well, rum to me always generally tastes like medicine.

490
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,720
Wait, like cherry, with cherry it seems like it would taste like Ropitosa.

491
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,560
Like cough syrup or something?

492
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,560
No.

493
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:21,040
It tasted, honestly it tasted like any chain restaurant rum drink.

494
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:26,300
I think he accidentally poured too much rum in it though, which I think probably that

495
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:32,880
slight intoxication is what made me think the drink I was drinking at Bubba Gump made

496
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:38,100
like, I feel like I was feeling the effects of that drink while I was drinking this non-alcoholic

497
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,560
slushy drink going, wow, I'm getting fucked up.

498
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:44,280
And then getting a mild sugar rush from just how sweet it was.

499
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,280
Can I read you guys something?

500
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,760
This is what I was looking for in my phone.

501
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,360
I'm sorry, I looked rude.

502
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:53,080
But I found this earlier and I had to dig through a website to find it again.

503
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:59,800
So from this website called The Balance, it's a list of Tony Roma's mission statement and

504
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,040
the way they train their employees.

505
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,400
And so the mission statement, okay, here's the thing.

506
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,200
Okay, so The Balance seems like it's analyzing every restaurant's mission statement in a

507
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,060
cool way where they're like, this one works, this one doesn't.

508
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:16,200
The Tony Roma's mission statement does one thing that every good mission statement should

509
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,200
do.

510
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,000
It defines the motivation that all employees should have behind everything they do by clearly

511
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,240
defining the goal that is the most important thing of the company.

512
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,240
In this case, the ultimate goal to Tony Roma's is guest loyalty.

513
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:35,720
The mission statement of Tony Roma's restaurant is great food delivered by professional friendly

514
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:42,920
team members resulting in guest loyalty, dot, dot, dot worldwide.

515
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,760
Along with this mission statement, Tony Roma's has identified qualities that expects its

516
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,440
employees to demonstrate in order to do things the Tony Roma's way.

517
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:58,560
Although these qualities are not labeled as such, in essence, these PICI squared, so there's

518
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:03,840
PICI and then a little two, qualities could be considered service standards.

519
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:11,680
The Tony Roma's PICI squared qualities are passion, intelligence, compassion, integrity,

520
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,680
intensity.

521
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,680
Wow.

522
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:19,680
Well, that first of all, for part of the family now, Marone, welcome.

523
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:24,560
I've never heard intensity as part of like any mission statement for any restaurant,

524
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,240
especially like a ribs restaurant.

525
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,800
That's like a third fall.

526
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,040
What does that even mean?

527
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,040
What's intensity mean?

528
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,040
I don't like an intense weight.

529
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,520
I want to chill late.

530
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:38,400
The first thing I think of about the whole thing is the loyalty thing, which of course

531
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,680
makes me think of Trump and like what he would say to James Comey at dinner that he wanted

532
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,200
loyal, he demanded loyalty from him.

533
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,480
So like that's the first thing.

534
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,360
And then yeah, these, the language is very severe.

535
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,360
Yeah.

536
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:55,080
It is a thing that like dumb guys talk about a lot, like loyalty family.

537
00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:01,920
Well, wasn't, wasn't the restaurant like mostly invested in by like the owner of the Dallas

538
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,840
Cowboys or someone like that?

539
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,280
Oh, I think I caught that.

540
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,280
Yeah.

541
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:11,120
So it was like the Playboy Club guys opened it and then the, I'm blanking out his name,

542
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,920
but he was like, I think the owner of the Dallas Cowboys and he came to eat there and

543
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,280
he was like, I'm paying for everything.

544
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,920
It's a franchise now.

545
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,880
So he franchised out Tony Romus.

546
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,880
Gotcha.

547
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,080
And it seems like loyalty is a thing that like an owner of a sports team would care

548
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,080
about.

549
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:31,240
And so same with intensity, but it's not the same as like a rib man who's making ribs for

550
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,600
rib people and onion loaves.

551
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,560
Imagine like being the person who writes these mission statements and the people who carry

552
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:43,640
out these mission statements, not the, the thing I can imagine being is being like a

553
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,800
server or bartender at a place and like rolling your eyes and leaving and complaining about

554
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,800
it at the end of the day.

555
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:54,260
The people who drink the Kool-Aid for these restaurants, I don't, I cannot wrap my head

556
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:58,280
around the kind of person you have to be to like, because we're all about compassion.

557
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,280
That one's important.

558
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,280
Don't forget compassion in the list.

559
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,360
I know it's in the middle, so you might forget it.

560
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:06,040
It's overshadowed by those last two eyes, but compassion's a big one.

561
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,440
What were the last two eyes?

562
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,440
Sorry.

563
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:12,320
Intensity, intensity, integrity, integrity and intensity.

564
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,420
This is what's crazy too is the other thing this reminds me of is there's a professional

565
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,840
wrestler named Kurt Angle.

566
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,680
He was a real gold medal winner.

567
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:22,880
He won the gold medal in amateur wrestling and he joined WWE and his catch phrase that

568
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,760
he would say on WWE TV was his three eyes and they were intelligence, integrity and

569
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,760
intensity.

570
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:35,160
So those are very similar to the Tony Roma.

571
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:40,280
So there's an Olympic thing about intensity and integrity that is carried over through

572
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:45,440
this sportsman into the Tony Roma's like whatever video you have to watch when you get hired

573
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,440
at Tony Roma's.

574
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,720
Cause I remember when I worked at California pizza kitchen, we had to watch like days of

575
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:54,800
videos about just making us understand like their whole take on it.

576
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,800
Right.

577
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,880
Cause every take is different and some are better than others.

578
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,220
Some people say intensity.

579
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,560
Some people say family.

580
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,560
I don't know.

581
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:11,200
But aren't they all just swirling around the same sauce?

582
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,680
They're just delivering food to people and asking them what they want a drink.

583
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:21,680
This is why you most want to be working at like some guy's restaurant.

584
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:25,000
He's never had time to make a video cause he's been running the restaurant.

585
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,800
He's been doing real things.

586
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,560
He's back there cooking and doing it.

587
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:35,280
I'm suspicious of any entity that refers to their family or their community.

588
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,280
Like I'm immediately suspicious.

589
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,280
Well it's a mob thing, right?

590
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,600
Yeah, it's mob.

591
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,600
It's crazy.

592
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:47,240
It's like the Playboy club was probably had a weird Sinatra mob connection anyway.

593
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,240
Of course.

594
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,600
If he was cooking for the Playboy club, he's cooking for all sorts of bad, bad, bad.

595
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,280
That was one of the first Atlantic city casinos was the Playboy casino back in 76 when they

596
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,880
legalized gambling.

597
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,880
Not good.

598
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,640
And what's funny is Tony Roma's this location, which I don't think there was one you said

599
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,040
in the valley somewhere else.

600
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:09,800
Yeah, I used to go in and see.

601
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:14,960
They can't have any vibe of the Playboy club at Tony Roma's and at City Walk.

602
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:20,080
But on the wall, the pictures, there's some wise guys hanging out in the pictures a little

603
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,080
bit.

604
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,600
But you really can't tell unless you walk up to them.

605
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:27,600
So it's the least aggressive, but it's a little nod to Tony's past, I feel like.

606
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,520
We are living in a post Gotti world.

607
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,920
The Gotti movie is out.

608
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:38,520
Are they seeing a spike in business at Tony Roma's from like, you know, respect.

609
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,520
It's about respect.

610
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,520
Intensity, integrity.

611
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,520
Intensity, integrity.

612
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,520
That's what I look for in my capos.

613
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,000
Let me tell you something.

614
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,200
Tony Roma's is the greatest restaurant in the face of the earth.

615
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,760
You don't understand this.

616
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,760
Oh boy.

617
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,760
Have you seen, has anyone seen Gotti?

618
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,760
I saw it.

619
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,760
We saw it.

620
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,760
Yeah, we saw it together.

621
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,760
I forgot you hit and run.

622
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,760
I ran in and ran.

623
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,760
Should I see it?

624
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,760
If I like bad things.

625
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,760
Yeah, you do.

626
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,760
Yeah, you would like it.

627
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,760
But it gets boring.

628
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,760
It is more boring than you would think.

629
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:12,760
Except for that beginning makes you think you're watching the best movie that's ever happened.

630
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,760
Okay.

631
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,760
I might see half of it.

632
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,760
You know what you should do actually?

633
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,760
Go see the beginning and then leave 15 minutes in, go get a drink at a McGuffin's type bar,

634
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,760
a bar in a movie theater.

635
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,760
And then go back in, try to time it to see the last 20.

636
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,760
You heard it here first.

637
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,760
This is how to watch Gotti in a movie theater.

638
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,760
And that's how you got a Gotti.

639
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,760
I'm going to do it.

640
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,760
We saw it on a Monday night and it was packed.

641
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,760
The theater was full.

642
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,760
There's no space.

643
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,760
People believe that campaign.

644
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,760
They're like, don't listen to critics.

645
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,760
Listen to your own heart.

646
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,760
Yeah.

647
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,760
Go see it.

648
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,760
Who cares?

649
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,760
Just like John did.

650
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,760
There was a very odd, the man next to me that he sat down with, he was like, I'm going

651
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,760
to go see the movie.

652
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,760
I'm going to go see the movie.

653
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,760
I'm going to go see the movie.

654
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:52,760
There was a very odd, the man next to me that he sat down later than we, than I did.

655
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,520
And I sat down pretty late in the previews.

656
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,760
He did not stop heavy breathing for 45 minutes.

657
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:03,080
He was beaten off.

658
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,760
If he was beating off, he started before he got in the theater.

659
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,760
Just the idea.

660
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,000
I could have been in the outfit.

661
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,760
I could have been one of the man.

662
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,760
John Gotti was a real man who existed.

663
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,760
He stood up to his damn kids.

664
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,760
Which I'm unwilling to do.

665
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:25,760
You know, the best stuff in Gotti is the real life footage of people like in the neighborhood

666
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,760
that were like, John Gotti ain't so bad.

667
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,760
He kept the neighborhood good.

668
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,760
He should leave.

669
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,760
He should get out of jail.

670
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:35,360
Like just there's plenty of real life footage of those type of guys and just like some really

671
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,160
funny characters, like just tearing the neighborhood up when he goes to jail.

672
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:43,520
But then he, those are the real people and that happens towards the end of the movie.

673
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:48,320
And so, but until this point, you haven't heard the idea or seen it presented that Gotti

674
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,680
was a good man.

675
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:54,480
So all you've seen him do, one time he did a fireworks show and when the cops said stop,

676
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,520
he was like, yeah, get out of here.

677
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,600
And then they did.

678
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,600
And then that's really good.

679
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,320
The rest of the movie is like beating his children.

680
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:07,040
So what they know, if he was a good man, they never conveyed it with his actions.

681
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,720
But I go out to be careful because did you see what happened where our friend who we,

682
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:16,440
I'm not going to name for the sake of his own life, our friend tweeted something bad

683
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:23,840
about the movie and within 30 minutes was like in a Twitter thread with Gotti's daughter.

684
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,840
Whoa.

685
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,840
Yeah.

686
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,840
Don't, we're in trouble.

687
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,840
Why are we even talking about this?

688
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,840
We should not talk about this.

689
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,840
We're going to be dead by the time.

690
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,160
We're not going to make it to sector 12.

691
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,160
I'm not a fucking rat.

692
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,160
Okay.

693
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:40,440
Can I say, I keep thinking about how maybe the reason that Tony Roma is popular with

694
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:46,880
wise guys because they're imagining that they like killed, put a hit on somebody, skin them

695
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,440
and are now nippling their little ribs.

696
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,160
Oh, wow.

697
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,880
That's interesting.

698
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,800
Their bloody ribs with their bloody hands that they then get a little wipey towel to

699
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,800
wipe off.

700
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,240
And that's like, don't use your sleeve.

701
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,360
Don't use the wipey things.

702
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,400
Have a little thing that say don't use a sleeve on them.

703
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:10,400
So my thing is I think I saw the two main demographics at a Tony room is when we were

704
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:15,320
there one, it's families who were like, oh, let's go somewhere nice today.

705
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,320
Yeah.

706
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,240
And I saw a couple of big families eating lunch there.

707
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:27,160
The other thing was I saw a guy in the classic khakis plaid shirt, blue blazer.

708
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:33,440
I am traveling for business, probably staying at the Hilton just across the street and just

709
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,200
wanted a decent lunch that he could expense account to.

710
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,440
I think those are the two main.

711
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,360
You didn't see any gangsters eating the ribs of his enemies?

712
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,520
No, those gang.

713
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,920
Those are probably like the wannabe guys working in the back of the house.

714
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,920
They go to the Valley.

715
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,920
Yeah, they were in the old Tony.

716
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:57,880
That's the real Tony Tony.

717
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:02,360
The third Tony's I know in the Valley.

718
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,040
You know, they've tried to get away from this.

719
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,040
This image.

720
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:09,480
So we all associate it with mobsters eating their enemies flesh.

721
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,720
This is what mobsters do.

722
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,320
They kill them and they just eat the ribs.

723
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,200
There's that scene in Gotti where he eats his enemies ribs.

724
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,000
No, no, no, no, no.

725
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,160
Hey, Vincenzo, put it on the grill.

726
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,160
Cook this guy's rib cage up.

727
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,160
And they're bloody so your hands get bloody.

728
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:27,160
More gravy for my enemies ribs, please.

729
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,160
Yeah, so what?

730
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,160
John Gotti ate the ribs of his enemies.

731
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,160
Who cares?

732
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,160
He shouldn't be in jail.

733
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,160
Free John Gotti.

734
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,160
He's a good man.

735
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,160
He had integrity.

736
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,160
He had intensity.

737
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:40,720
I'm just trying to eat my enemies fucking ribs.

738
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,200
Classic scenes from the classic film.

739
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:49,000
So what they've basically they've tried to do a rebrand in the last couple of years.

740
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
It's not happening.

741
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,200
It's not happening.

742
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,960
It's so specifically hasn't happened.

743
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,160
Let me tell you something I ran into.

744
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,160
I found this really boring.

745
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,840
I was trying to find YouTube videos of Tony Romas and I found this really boring corporate

746
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:06,120
video that was about how they're rebranding to be TR fire grill.

747
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:11,020
They're taking one of the one of the locations in Orlando and that's going to be the base

748
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:15,600
of operations for the new model of Tony Romas, TR fire grill.

749
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,320
And this is part of a wave of restaurants doing this kind of thing.

750
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,560
I didn't learn until this bit of research that Hooters has tried to do a casual Hooters

751
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,440
in Chicago only.

752
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,720
And it is it is called Hoots.

753
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:31,440
Does anyone is this come across anyone's desk?

754
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,360
No, I don't know anything about Hoots.

755
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,560
So all of these when you guys go to Schomburg, you should go to Hoots.

756
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,560
We will.

757
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,560
That will definitely be part of Schomburg.

758
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,280
Yeah, it's still around, but it just hasn't expanded.

759
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,200
There might also there are TR fire grills.

760
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,400
One of them is in Hawaii and one of them is in Malaysia.

761
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,320
So is it like fast casual ribs?

762
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,040
Because that's the least fast casual food ever.

763
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,200
You don't want them to be fast and you know, like someone just like, OK, drops like you

764
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,640
put a little number on your table, someone drops a slab of ribs and then you and they're

765
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,240
like, this is your enemy's ribs.

766
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,720
They give you a quick sheet of the bullet points of his back story and why you'd want

767
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,720
to eat him.

768
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,720
Why you'd want to lick his blood up.

769
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,640
He was a bum and didn't respect no one.

770
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,640
All right, enjoy your ribs.

771
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,640
No integrity, no intensity.

772
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,640
No integrity, no integrity.

773
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,640
Oh, good.

774
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,920
That's those are against my values.

775
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:21,480
Anyway, this was this is something that the company Tony Romas parent company Roma Corp

776
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,440
Inc. tried to do.

777
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,600
And I watched this boring video about it and there's this guy rambling on, running his

778
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,600
mouth.

779
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,160
His name is Stephen K. Judge.

780
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,720
He is kind of ambiguously European.

781
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,240
He's a British, I guess British.

782
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,240
I can't tell.

783
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,240
It's just a snooty accent.

784
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,320
I don't think this guy has integrity or intensity.

785
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:43,240
He's going on and on about this is going to be this is like and I even do the vague European.

786
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:49,320
This is going to be the model of the Tony Romas for the next five to seven years.

787
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,960
This is the direction that we are going and this is base of operate.

788
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,120
People want millennials.

789
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:58,920
They want the best casual dining experience and going on.

790
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,840
This is the boring eight minutes of this bullshit about how T.R.

791
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,240
Fire Grills, the future of Tony Romas.

792
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,100
Not only are there only two of these, not only did this crash and burn this guy repping

793
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:14,320
this thing, Stephen K. Judge, but the video I watched was from October 3rd, 2016 by June

794
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,720
21st, 2017.

795
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,280
He was out the fucking door.

796
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:23,080
He's now the president of Cafe Operations for Hard Rock Cafe.

797
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,360
Oh, no.

798
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:29,520
So what right does this punk have Stephen K. Judge to go around talking about the five

799
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:34,880
to seven year plan for Roma Corp and then it fails.

800
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:41,680
He torches the whole thing and leaves, goes to his his hot new mistress Hard Rock Cafe

801
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:48,120
and his second guy in command, the VP, the regional VP of Operations, Dave Cully.

802
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,940
He moved to Steak and Shake.

803
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:55,920
So these guys, how dare they take a beloved brand of a family and intensity and they flush

804
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,240
the whole operation down the toilet with some half assed millennial gastropa.

805
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,000
They read one article about what millennials want and then they change the whole thing

806
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
around.

807
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Massive failure.

808
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,240
The whole company is in jeopardy now and they go and get other jobs.

809
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,600
Man fucked up.

810
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,600
I'm furious for days and I'm glad I could finally talk about.

811
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,600
Yeah, sorry.

812
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,600
You had to deal with that.

813
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,800
Yeah, and their wife for their gum.

814
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,800
It's just terrible.

815
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,640
It's just unheard of.

816
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:28,120
No compassion, no compassion, no respect, no loyalty, no loyalty.

817
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,200
John Gotti kept the neighborhood together.

818
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,480
Stephen K. Judge tore the neighborhood apart.

819
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,320
It's not even a place for ribs anymore.

820
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,320
We don't know what it is.

821
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,320
Can we just go to plus it?

822
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,320
Can we plus this up?

823
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,360
Can we just call it Gotti's or can we call it?

824
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:44,560
Let's lean back into the I think we take it back.

825
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,560
Take it back.

826
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:50,280
This T.R. fire grills bullshit because they're not even putting the great Tony Roma's name

827
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,280
in it anymore.

828
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,960
I mean, the bug main would just tell us to bring back the worms and dirt.

829
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,200
If I'm remembering correctly, this is where the children's dessert worms and dirt.

830
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,520
Oh, that used to be there.

831
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,280
Oh, it was created in Tony Roma's?

832
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,520
I don't know it was created, but at least served.

833
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,280
Like dump cake kind of like it looks like.

834
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,440
Yeah, it's just like pudding and gummy worms.

835
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,440
I mean, I would love that.

836
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,440
And the little Oreo crumbles.

837
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,440
I want more goombas.

838
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,200
Yeah, yeah, there's a we haven't done it yet, but I don't know why we would, because it's

839
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,800
just a restaurant and we're not a restaurant review show.

840
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:26,600
No, Portillo's in Buena Park, which is a very theme parky area.

841
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,140
And there's of course many portals where I come from.

842
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,320
They have a gangster theme inside.

843
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,320
People love it.

844
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,000
The one in Buena Park specifically.

845
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,400
There's mannequins with Tommy guns.

846
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,240
There's bootleg and stuff.

847
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,000
Why is this not in the Tony Roma's?

848
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,760
Why are they trying to get away from it?

849
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:49,120
Isn't stealing a restaurant idea something that somebody with no integrity and no intensity

850
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,120
would do?

851
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,120
Maybe intensity.

852
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,120
It sounds like they already don't have integrity.

853
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,640
Yeah, I want it to be a more threatening Bucatabepo.

854
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,640
Sure.

855
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,640
You should feel unwelcome.

856
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,680
Yeah, you should be a little scared.

857
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,680
You're on your toes.

858
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,640
It does seem a little out of place in city.

859
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:10,880
I don't know out of place is the right word, but it does seem like it should be gone.

860
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,880
You want it gone.

861
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,880
You want it.

862
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,160
I don't think it should be there anymore.

863
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,160
It's old.

864
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:21,360
I agree that it should be gone unless there's a whole change over in thinking and you come

865
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:26,540
in and everyone's pinstripe suits and there's a whole theming and you get like the great

866
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:34,360
movie ride, 30s gangster comes up and serves you, you know, era appropriate food and drink.

867
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,360
Bugsy.

868
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,360
It could be bugsy.

869
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,360
I'm not saying.

870
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,600
Yeah, it has to be.

871
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,600
I would love that.

872
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,600
I would go there once a month.

873
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:46,480
Yeah, because right it is now is just like a very generic space with a couple of pictures

874
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,080
on the wall and then like a red curtain around the ceiling.

875
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,080
Like very minimalist.

876
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,640
We had a lovely bartender.

877
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:57,200
Oh wait, Scott, tell me the thing you learned about the original position of it in city

878
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,200
walk.

879
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:03,520
Oh, there was a the venue that shifted from that ended up as Saddle Ranch.

880
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:09,280
And before that was something called Womp Hop, Pompers, Womp, Pompers or majors hoppers.

881
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,120
I'll put an extra M in Womp, Pompers.

882
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:16,000
And then also was the other one country star restaurant.

883
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,360
The failed Hard Rock Cafe, but just for country.

884
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,360
That's what that was.

885
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:24,400
OK, well, that was the first time I ever went to Universal Studios.

886
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,400
That was a Tony Roma's.

887
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,880
I got two story Tony Roma's.

888
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,880
Yeah, it was massive.

889
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,880
That was a giant.

890
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,920
And if you ever anybody went to Saddle Ranch while it was there, there are many, many.

891
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,200
I feel like they had capacity for 700 people.

892
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,800
It was a compound at Saddle Ranch.

893
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,800
Wow.

894
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,880
There were rooms aplenty for a Gotti like figure to do business.

895
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:50,100
He could have like all 20 of his associates in there and that wouldn't even that would

896
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,840
only take up, you know, 10 percent of the restaurant.

897
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,200
And that's the one I went to.

898
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,200
That's why I thought it was cool.

899
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,200
Oh, OK.

900
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,160
Now, was you did go to that one?

901
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,480
Yeah, I remember the ceiling being lower, though.

902
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,480
OK.

903
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,560
And then when we went to, I was like because it was there was a lot of floors.

904
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,240
Well, it was it was the Saddle Ranch building.

905
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,680
The Saddle Ranch was not two floors, I don't believe.

906
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:12,620
I well, I don't know if they let you up.

907
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,600
Maybe at the time they let you on at the second floor.

908
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,800
I just wasn't even aware.

909
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:20,040
I just remember it was giant and very ornate and it had that 80s restaurant thing where

910
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:25,400
it's very brown and brick and production design like a restaurant hula hands.

911
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,440
Oh, I've been to hula hands.

912
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:32,280
Yeah, it was that one that warm, you know, that way when Sizzlers used to be fancier

913
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,280
and really heartfelt.

914
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,960
It sounds like this was a good version of Tony Roma's.

915
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,960
I liked it.

916
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,960
Yeah.

917
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,960
Yeah, I remember that.

918
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,080
So that must be why you buy either of us have affection for it is it was that we go to that

919
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,080
fucking place we went today.

920
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:48,200
You just shoved in some corner of this dumb mall.

921
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:54,080
Yeah, that place has no history, no family, doesn't tie the neighbor together.

922
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,080
Nice bartender, though.

923
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,080
Oh, yeah.

924
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,240
He was nice.

925
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:01,620
He tried to get me to not have that drink and he was very nice to do so.

926
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:04,880
But I was stubborn and insisted on finishing all of it.

927
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,280
And look at you now.

928
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,640
That was high off the alcohol that was only in that drink.

929
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:17,160
Well, we should move on to number two, as we've talked about, you know, obviously, theming

930
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:22,000
a restaurant off of a very specific film is an idea we're passionate about.

931
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,840
And you know, long before there was Gotti's, eventually there was Bubba Gump Shrimp Company.

932
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,980
Bubba Gump Shrimp Comp.

933
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:34,800
Which was I've always wondered what the deal was, like, why?

934
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,800
Why is this?

935
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,520
And it's that is it Paramount or Universal who made the movie?

936
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,520
Paramount.

937
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:47,720
Paramount approached the Rusty Pelican chain and was like, will you make a Bubba Gump restaurant?

938
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,400
And so they it was their idea.

939
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,720
Originally, they were like, we're going to license.

940
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,320
It's never been done since.

941
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,320
Right.

942
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,840
That's just a movie.

943
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,840
One movie.

944
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,840
I don't think so.

945
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:03,000
We're going to make a we're going to make a restaurant off this movie we got.

946
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
You just came up with a plan.

947
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,600
And they said a year later, Rusty Pelican came back and was like, OK, Rusty Pelican,

948
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,240
I guess is like it's a Newport Beach.

949
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,800
It's like a seafood restaurant.

950
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,120
They came back with a plan.

951
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:17,440
They opened the first one and then the rest is history.

952
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,680
Yeah, it seems like an idea now that would be just like people are opening up like that

953
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,240
saved by the Bell restaurant.

954
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,660
Yeah, it's a big thing.

955
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:28,280
Theme parks now is back to like themed restaurants and experiences.

956
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,560
It seems like a dumb thing that would happen now.

957
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,800
You go, did you hear they're making a forest?

958
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,840
Oh, man, they're really running out ideas to make a Forrest Gump restaurant.

959
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:40,120
I know that happened like 15, 20 years ago.

960
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:45,960
They never would, though, because the affection, any affection for Forrest Gump was left in

961
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:46,960
the 1990s.

962
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:52,560
And in fact, it's so commonly cited with the hindsight of history is how does that get

963
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,360
all the Academy Award attention?

964
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,360
Not Pulp Fiction.

965
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,640
It's obviously the wrong and it's not like a location in the movie.

966
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,880
You like, oh, you could only go.

967
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,880
There's no location in the movie.

968
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,440
You hear about it like vaguely.

969
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,440
Yeah.

970
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,040
No, it's like Bubba Gump wants.

971
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,720
Bubba wants to open it.

972
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,640
He does open it.

973
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,640
Do you ever get to see it?

974
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,640
No, I don't think you ever say it.

975
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:14,640
You hear about it.

976
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,960
Yeah, you vaguely hear about it.

977
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:19,480
It's a line in a movie and they made all franchise out of it.

978
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,720
A restaurant franchise.

979
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,720
It's insane.

980
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:22,720
Yeah.

981
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,880
I love shrimp and how he drank.

982
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,440
What's the percentage of people that go into it that don't know it's related to Forrest

983
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,440
Gump?

984
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,440
I bet it's very high.

985
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,680
Well, it reminds me of the Bill and Ted show at Universal, where most of the people there

986
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:39,120
only knew about Bill and Ted from the Bill and Ted show.

987
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:42,600
Like most of the teenagers there were not born yet when there was a Bill and Ted movies.

988
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,920
They're like, oh yeah, Bill and Ted, those guys from the show at Universal.

989
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:46,920
Right.

990
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,920
Yes.

991
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:48,920
So now kids go to the restaurant.

992
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,720
They go, oh, this movie about those people from the restaurant.

993
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:52,720
Yes.

994
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,600
So it's kind of it's reversed now.

995
00:44:54,600 --> 00:45:00,560
And there's details of this that are, I mean, all over the walls, there's photos of the

996
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,560
obscured characters.

997
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:08,880
I saw a framed photo of, I only remember who it was because she was on, she was on SNL

998
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:09,880
for a season.

999
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,720
Shabon Fallon is this actress's name.

1000
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,880
She's a mean bus driver in the movie.

1001
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:15,880
Oh my gosh.

1002
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:16,880
She was framed on the wall.

1003
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,880
Yeah.

1004
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:23,920
I mean, she's a chain smoking bus driver has a tribute within this, this location of Bubba

1005
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:24,920
Gump.

1006
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:29,400
Also, there's a photo of young Jenny framed in one area that it took me a second to be

1007
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,120
like, who am I looking at?

1008
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,280
Young Jenny.

1009
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:37,520
There's a fake sign for a forest is company, I believe from the army.

1010
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,920
Oh, who was in the bathroom?

1011
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:45,040
And then photos of you start seeing photos of Haley Joel Osment.

1012
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,560
And until you guys cracked it for me, he's the kid.

1013
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:52,800
He's for a son who is the subject of the line.

1014
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,760
Is he like me?

1015
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:59,120
Which I keep thinking about keeps coming up for me in the recent pet, which is funny that

1016
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:07,280
Haley Joel Osment was that this very uncomfortable moment with this, this handicapped child.

1017
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:13,720
And then he's also the kid from Walker gave me, Walker says I have AIDS from the famous

1018
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,920
shown on Conan Walker, Texas.

1019
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,800
Haley Joel Osment had a rough and all these parts.

1020
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,880
But he also, he's not like for us.

1021
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:21,880
He's smart.

1022
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:22,880
Oh yes.

1023
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:23,880
Yeah.

1024
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,240
That's what he is breaking down thinking he had a special son and so I know he's very

1025
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,240
smart.

1026
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,240
Okay.

1027
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,240
Yeah.

1028
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:34,000
Haley handled these heavy, heavy, heavy scenes for a young actor and he's tributed through

1029
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,960
framed photos.

1030
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,800
It's the same photo like five times all over the restaurant.

1031
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:45,840
It is like, first of all, I will be honest, I had never been in this restaurant.

1032
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,760
Were you shocked by like the theming of it?

1033
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:55,560
I was not shocked, but very impressed because it seems like they could, again, nobody really

1034
00:46:55,560 --> 00:47:00,120
walks in here going, well, we got to go to that line, that restaurant from the line in

1035
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:01,920
the movie from 25 years ago.

1036
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,400
They're just like, well, shrimp, I like shrimp.

1037
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,400
And they go inside.

1038
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,560
So I figured they can get away with something that's much more Tony Roma's esque as far

1039
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,000
as theming is concerned.

1040
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Yeah.

1041
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,520
So when it was in there and I'm like, wow, they really like did it up.

1042
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:18,360
And like, if you're a nerdy forest gum fan, there's something for you in here.

1043
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:19,360
Yeah.

1044
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:25,120
And it's also like, if you like TGI Friday, like OG TGI Friday, like crazy crap on the

1045
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,600
walls, there's crazy crap everywhere.

1046
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:33,420
Did you guys see, did you guys notice the racks of hot sauces on the walls that were

1047
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:35,720
not present on the table?

1048
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:36,720
Oh, really?

1049
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:41,800
Have you ever gone to like a fish restaurant or like a honky tonk or something?

1050
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,120
And it's like, we got lots of kinds of hot sauces.

1051
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:47,640
Like that is a kind of restaurant that I've been to.

1052
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:52,320
And this seemed like it had the simulation of that because there was hot sauces like on

1053
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:55,440
the walls, but like high up.

1054
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,760
From what I could see, there was only one kind of hot sauce on our table.

1055
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:02,720
Yeah, it was like a Tabasco and I had to dig around in a bucket to find it.

1056
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:03,720
Yeah.

1057
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:10,480
So if Bubba Gumps was a legitimate restaurant, like just somebody's homegrown restaurant,

1058
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:15,360
where would you, when you, if you were to buy into the story of the restaurant, where

1059
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,360
are you?

1060
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,360
Myrtle Beach.

1061
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,360
Shreveport.

1062
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:22,680
I guess that's what they're, damn it's like an old rusted out shack that we took, which

1063
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,600
is kind of the vibe of that old Tony room as well.

1064
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,560
Or the place you use, what's the Wisconsin Dells.

1065
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:31,920
Oh, I mean, are you speaking about a specific restaurant or just that area in general?

1066
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,560
No, I'm just trying to think of like where this would make sense.

1067
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:39,560
That's not really, there's not, there's a little water near there.

1068
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:42,080
I want like a big, I think there needs to be a lot of water.

1069
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,080
Yeah.

1070
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,280
It's like an Ocean City, Maryland situation.

1071
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,280
Yeah, that's right.

1072
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,280
I mean, yeah, that's perfect.

1073
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,280
That place is gross.

1074
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:49,280
I don't know.

1075
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,280
Yeah.

1076
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,280
I don't know that.

1077
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,280
Maybe you'll love it.

1078
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:55,960
There's like a different, there's a different mini golf course on every block.

1079
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:56,960
Oh boy.

1080
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:57,960
And it's all these.

1081
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:58,960
That's the sign of quality.

1082
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:03,120
It's like a 40s science for like weird liver restaurants and it's crazy.

1083
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,120
Wow.

1084
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,120
You like that.

1085
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,920
Where people would really go to get fucked up where I grew up.

1086
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:08,920
Yeah.

1087
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:11,160
Like that for senior week or after prom and stuff.

1088
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:15,400
My family went to Ocean City, New Jersey, a dry town.

1089
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:16,400
We're nice people.

1090
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,440
America's number one family resort, according to the travel channel.

1091
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,440
I didn't know that.

1092
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,440
That's great.

1093
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:22,440
It's dry.

1094
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:23,440
There's dry cities in New Jersey.

1095
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,440
Uh, that is the main one I know of.

1096
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,660
They never changed the blue laws.

1097
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:30,040
So it's a barrier Island.

1098
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:34,640
So there's like three big bridges into town and you can bring alcohol in and have it at

1099
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:35,840
your home.

1100
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:41,240
That's go nuts, but not like at the restaurants or at public at the bottom of each bridge

1101
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,400
right outside of town.

1102
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,720
There is a warehouse size liquor store.

1103
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,720
That's so crazy.

1104
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:46,720
Yeah.

1105
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:50,600
Do you think any of those restaurants serve what I have now confirmed is a non-alcoholic

1106
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:52,720
drink called the strawberry mango chiller?

1107
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,560
Mike, you did it.

1108
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,560
You're so crazy.

1109
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:00,120
Why did you do that?

1110
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,120
Love this drink.

1111
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:04,720
I'm first of all, nothing I said at the time was wrong.

1112
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,200
I did love that drink.

1113
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,560
I still love it.

1114
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:10,280
I did think maybe I was getting a buzz from it.

1115
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:14,480
I was not, but I was getting a sugar rush.

1116
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,000
I was getting a sugar rush obviously.

1117
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,520
And I was too giant.

1118
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:22,520
It's as if I had like an extra large Slurpee while I was eating a meal.

1119
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:26,480
Uh, in my meal of shrimp, Mac and cheese, shrimp, Mac and cheese.

1120
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,800
Like a true child.

1121
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:35,440
I had a strawberry basil smash and I know for a fact, mine supposedly had vodka in it.

1122
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,040
I could not taste vodka.

1123
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:45,800
It was a couple of leaves of basil, ice, Sierra mist, excuse me, mist twist and a lot of strawberry

1124
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,800
puree.

1125
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,920
Which you said that Sierra mist is no longer Sierra mist.

1126
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,480
It's called just mist twist.

1127
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,040
It's called like mist twist.

1128
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,680
I think they rebranded it.

1129
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:57,040
That's impossible to remember.

1130
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,040
What'd you drink?

1131
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:02,040
I had like a Lynchburg lemonade type thing, which was great.

1132
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:06,280
I picked like the lower calorie thing and the fancy drinks and it was like a whiskey

1133
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,280
lemonade.

1134
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,280
It was fun.

1135
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,280
Fantastic.

1136
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:14,240
We did on the, both of us did for the meal and I'm so glad because everything they list

1137
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,440
the calories on everything.

1138
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,920
It's all a thousand to two thousand.

1139
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,120
And we already split this sampler platter.

1140
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:25,760
I feel like I'm alive today because you noticed the soup and salad combo.

1141
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,280
I really might've missed that.

1142
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,480
Let's see what my calories were from the meal.

1143
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,480
Oh yeah.

1144
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,520
I do want to know because we kept it pretty light.

1145
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,760
We came in around like 500 calories for our little lunch.

1146
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,720
By doing just kind of a side salad.

1147
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:38,720
A little cup of gumbo.

1148
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,720
You did a gumbo.

1149
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:40,720
Oh my God.

1150
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:41,720
What did you eat?

1151
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:42,720
A thousand calories.

1152
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:43,720
Wait, for the drink?

1153
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:44,720
No, for the shrimp, mac and cheese.

1154
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:48,560
I want to know, oh, but you don't know about the drink.

1155
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,320
I'm trying to, you could've gone a lot higher.

1156
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,320
There was a lot of 1500, 1800.

1157
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,640
That was actually a pretty reasonable choice.

1158
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:56,240
Can you look up, I just had the calamari.

1159
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,240
Like just a basket of fried calamari.

1160
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,240
Was that under appetizers?

1161
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:00,240
Yeah, it was under appetizers.

1162
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,240
Uh, calamari.

1163
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,240
Oh, that's not bad.

1164
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,240
Six, six forty.

1165
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:04,240
Okay.

1166
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,240
We're ruining this for ourselves.

1167
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,240
That's true.

1168
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,240
Why take it back?

1169
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:11,560
Uh, well I think it's a good service to the listeners that we save them a trip to the

1170
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,960
BubbaGump.com calorie counter.

1171
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:14,960
Yeah, of course.

1172
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,520
But I don't want to save them a trip to BubbaGump, which I fucking love.

1173
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,920
We had a fun time.

1174
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:24,920
We did the, uh, uh, we watched people do like birthday dances.

1175
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,640
They make you dance if it's your birthday.

1176
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,440
I don't understand how that was a dance off.

1177
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:32,600
Once it began, they said it's these two people's birthdays.

1178
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:33,600
So they got to, you know what that means?

1179
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,300
They got to do a dance off and then everybody clapped.

1180
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:40,720
And I, the whole time I was waiting for the dance part to start and it did not, as far

1181
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:41,720
as I could tell.

1182
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:42,720
Am I wrong?

1183
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:43,720
Were you guys confused?

1184
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:44,720
I was confused.

1185
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,920
We sort of danced up and down and like waved our arms a little bit and then it was over.

1186
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,320
That counts as dancing.

1187
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:52,000
More specifically, we did the trivia contest.

1188
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,080
The most immersive part of the day.

1189
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,080
Yeah.

1190
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,080
Our waiter was great.

1191
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:57,080
It was awesome.

1192
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:58,080
Shout out to Corey.

1193
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,080
Shout out to Corey.

1194
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,080
Corey ruled.

1195
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:05,520
Uh, the one kind of intense thing Corey said to us though, so intense he almost belonged

1196
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:10,520
at the other restaurant when he said, actually Forrest Gump used to be my favorite movie

1197
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,520
as a child.

1198
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,920
Haven't watched it once since I got hired here.

1199
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:22,160
Cause I asked, would you be able to do this trivia without having been hired here recently?

1200
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,160
And he said, yeah.

1201
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:27,560
He said that and it started off really fun and then like had a little boo at the end.

1202
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:28,560
Yeah.

1203
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:31,160
It was a little earnest, a little intense.

1204
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:33,920
How could you watch the movie if you worked in that restaurant?

1205
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:37,240
You would be a crazy, there's one guy who does both and he's insane.

1206
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:38,240
Yeah.

1207
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,680
He's the worst person you've ever met.

1208
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:44,880
He's like that OJ juror that showed up wearing the like Star Trek outfit or the whitewater

1209
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:45,880
juror.

1210
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:46,880
Yeah.

1211
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:47,880
Yeah.

1212
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:48,880
I remember that.

1213
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:49,880
I don't actually.

1214
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:52,240
During whitewater, a juror like got selected for the whitewater jury and then showed up

1215
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:58,560
the day of in a full Star Trek next generation outfit with a, like a, like a bloop bloop thing

1216
00:53:58,560 --> 00:53:59,560
on her chest.

1217
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,560
Whoa.

1218
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:05,560
She's in that movie Trekkies and she hid that part of her personality until the first day.

1219
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:06,840
And then she showed up like that.

1220
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:12,440
And through the entire trial when the president was on trial into complete chaos.

1221
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:16,160
Which probably is what Tina Fey was making fun of a 30 rock when she was like princess

1222
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,840
Leia in a jury.

1223
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,900
Oh, that was it.

1224
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:20,900
Did she get dismissed?

1225
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:21,900
Did they get rid of her?

1226
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:22,900
Immediately.

1227
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:23,900
They're like, what are you doing?

1228
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:27,120
She's like, I just wanted to show people that what I believe in.

1229
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,120
Wow.

1230
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:29,120
This is my true self.

1231
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:30,120
But it made Clinton go few.

1232
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,640
But she didn't do it to get out of jury duty.

1233
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:33,520
She wanted to be on the jury.

1234
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:37,240
To show off her cool pins.

1235
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,240
Who could blame her?

1236
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,240
Yes.

1237
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:40,240
I have to do this.

1238
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,240
I have to say, I'm falling asleep.

1239
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,240
I'm yawning.

1240
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:44,240
We all are.

1241
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:50,080
One thing as we sat down and we're taking it all in and when we first met, Corey, he

1242
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:52,920
said, so what brings you all to Bubba Gump today?

1243
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:55,560
And I think we all had a beat where we're like, should we lie?

1244
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,960
How do we answer this question?

1245
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:02,320
Like we all said, he asked if we'd been here and we all said no, because we thought we'd

1246
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:05,760
get kind of a more from the ground up experience if we said no.

1247
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,360
And we kind of did.

1248
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:08,360
Yeah.

1249
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:11,760
Though I really showed my cards when I asked for the trivia game specifically.

1250
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:12,760
Oh yeah.

1251
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:13,760
Yeah.

1252
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:14,760
I guess that showed that I'd been there.

1253
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:15,760
Yeah.

1254
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,840
What did we, we struggled to come up with the answer.

1255
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:18,840
Yeah.

1256
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:19,840
The trivia game was great.

1257
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:20,840
It was very fun.

1258
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:21,840
Yeah, that was a lot of fun.

1259
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:25,280
Do you remember that any of the most obscure stuff in there?

1260
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,320
Like a town, the ones where I didn't know.

1261
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:29,320
Shreveport?

1262
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:30,320
No, it wasn't Shreveport.

1263
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,320
It wasn't Shreveport.

1264
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:34,760
It was written on the license plate that's on the table because there's a license plate

1265
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:37,880
that says go run for us run and then you can flip it over and say stop for us stop.

1266
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:41,160
And when you do that, you mean it's like an Korean bar.

1267
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:43,760
You want the waiter to come by and say, yeah.

1268
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,760
The other one is like, stay away from us waiter.

1269
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,760
We're having a good time.

1270
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:48,760
That's what that means.

1271
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:53,040
The trick question, what color was Lieutenant Dan's shrimping boots?

1272
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,000
No, or shrimping boots.

1273
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Excuse me.

1274
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,080
I feel like he still wore shoes even though he was, had no legs.

1275
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:01,080
Yeah.

1276
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,280
Oh, you know, he's on the boat.

1277
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:04,280
No, he's got, he's all no legs at all.

1278
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:05,280
Right?

1279
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,280
Yeah.

1280
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,680
He doesn't have shoes because he's been mean.

1281
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:11,960
He hasn't come around and got his titanium legs and his wife yet.

1282
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:15,120
And he's like, I have a wife now and she's from Vietnam.

1283
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:17,560
That's how you know he's become a good man at the very end.

1284
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:18,560
Right.

1285
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:19,560
Oh, for sweating.

1286
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:20,560
Uh huh.

1287
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:24,600
And he's like, here's his, this is young Jean or whatever.

1288
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:25,920
It's how you know this.

1289
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:30,120
The whole, the movie has all of the, like when you mentioned that there's a framed photo

1290
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:35,720
of Jenny, like Jenny is the young Jenny is abused in the film.

1291
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:38,480
And then in the, and then in the movie she gets AIDS.

1292
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,480
She tries to kill herself.

1293
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,360
She tries to kill herself.

1294
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:47,560
So to ignore all of these things, I guess I don't want them to address it, but implicitly

1295
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:53,280
a Forrest Gump restaurant has to ignore AIDS, suicide and abuse.

1296
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:59,360
It's like, I guess, was this ever talked about in the, did anyone have a, a, a kind of a

1297
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:04,320
cultural sensitivity discussion in starting this restaurant or were they just like, yeah,

1298
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:07,040
but the mesquite shrimp is going to be delicious.

1299
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:12,480
I think that because the trick trivia question was about how Lieutenant Dan's leg was like

1300
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:17,000
doubling amputee, they're like, I guess they don't really care.

1301
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,840
They're like, we'll talk about that one.

1302
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:23,840
Also the trivia questions are like, essentially you're helping tell a chronological story

1303
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,120
of Forrest's life.

1304
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:26,120
Yeah.

1305
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:31,360
It's just like the nice, I mean, not all the nice stuff, but like a lot of nice stuff.

1306
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:36,700
None of the historical events that Forrest falls into as a rail bows.

1307
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:40,440
He didn't in this part of the trivia contest, ask us if we thought the Vietnam war was a

1308
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:41,440
just war.

1309
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,580
There's only one right answer.

1310
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:46,240
He would accept if we didn't say yes.

1311
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:51,000
All of us, he would have kicked us out of the restaurant.

1312
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,120
Can I say a not nice story from my past?

1313
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:55,120
Oh, sure.

1314
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:56,120
Oh, please.

1315
00:57:56,120 --> 00:58:02,280
Well, I wouldn't, probably the first one of these I went to was in Maui in Hawaii on a

1316
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:03,280
trip with my family.

1317
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:08,440
And I remember having all the confusion about, huh, it's a restaurant based on Forrest.

1318
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:09,880
This is weird.

1319
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:15,000
And I, so I was confused the whole time and my dad was kind of like zoning out.

1320
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:20,560
He was kind of weirdly quiet and the whole dinner was like, what's going on here?

1321
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:29,040
And about 45 minutes in my dad said, oh my God, this is where my dad had a heart attack.

1322
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:35,760
Like when it was, when it was not Bubba Gump's, whatever the previous locate, whatever the

1323
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,960
location was previously.

1324
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:45,520
Um, my, yeah, my dad's dad had a heart attack at the table and like fell into his soup.

1325
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,520
Jesus.

1326
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:51,280
Yeah, like this is my end, my dad watched my dad unlock this terrible memory.

1327
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,560
And then right then like, okay, so you guys remember the movie Forrest Gump?

1328
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:58,720
What did they say when they wanted to stop when he was running football?

1329
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,800
Uh, it was, yeah, my dad was just like got lost.

1330
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:07,480
The rest of them, it was, uh, yeah, I, uh, I could flash to that memory very easily.

1331
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:08,480
Wow.

1332
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:09,480
That's crazy.

1333
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:10,480
He survived.

1334
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:11,480
I mean, he made it.

1335
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:12,480
He didn't die at that Forrest Gump.

1336
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,440
He did not die at that restaurant.

1337
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:17,480
No, it is not, you don't want to die at Bubba Gump.

1338
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:22,920
No, uh, although we did, we did restaurants though, worst chain restaurants.

1339
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:23,920
Yeah.

1340
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:27,120
Jordan Morris just declared he'd be happy to die at Margaritaville, which I think any

1341
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:31,400
of us might be, especially due to a plane crashing into the wall.

1342
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:37,360
Um, the, I was thinking the, there's another thing that's sort of a Forrest Gump themed

1343
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:39,720
experience that's not Bubba Gump.

1344
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:40,720
Cause I was like, well, that's weird.

1345
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:43,280
And then I was like, oh, well there is something.

1346
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:48,080
There's another entity that tours using a character of course from Forrest Gump, but

1347
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:49,080
it's not a themed experience.

1348
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:50,080
You know what I'm talking about?

1349
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:51,080
Oh, I do.

1350
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:53,880
I'm talking about of course, Lieutenant Dan Band.

1351
00:59:53,880 --> 01:00:00,600
Gary Sinise's charity band usually for, which we can't make fun of it, I guess, cause it's,

1352
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,520
he donates money to the military.

1353
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:06,800
Except that he like has become a little crazy fucking conservative.

1354
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,640
So yes, we can make fun of him.

1355
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:11,080
And we can't go on mission space anymore.

1356
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:17,840
Because Gary Sinise is now only tweets insane military things and tours with the Lieutenant

1357
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:18,840
Dan Band.

1358
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:22,160
It's like he thinks he was Lieutenant Dan.

1359
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,560
That's what he served.

1360
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:24,560
That was his service.

1361
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:25,560
What's that movie?

1362
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:27,040
He was in that movie.

1363
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,720
He's an honorary troop.

1364
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:32,200
I think there's three strikes against any older actor.

1365
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:38,640
The obvious one being harassment of any kind, but the other two, not as important, but almost

1366
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:45,800
their strikes I think are crazy right wing tweets and playing white guy blues music.

1367
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:49,680
These are the three worst moves that any older actor could make.

1368
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,720
So Bruce Willis doesn't pass.

1369
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:56,080
Yeah, from one of the three and I hope not more.

1370
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:58,280
I don't know the whole story of Bruce.

1371
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,280
There's a story of Bruno, but.

1372
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:02,160
But James Dolan is okay.

1373
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,920
He's the New York Knicks owner.

1374
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,240
His blues brand is cool.

1375
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:06,240
Yeah, yeah.

1376
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:07,240
He's doing fine.

1377
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:09,680
Wait, who's the guy who made a crap?

1378
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:13,560
Who does like mom and Big Bang Theory Chuck Lorre?

1379
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:14,640
He's a blues guitarist.

1380
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:20,360
I saw him at LACMA once like playing with like the jazz outdoor jazz at LACMA.

1381
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:24,000
We don't have time to get into Chuck Lorre since.

1382
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,880
I'm sure the other categories are spotless.

1383
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:30,000
Moving on.

1384
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,160
I'm sure his blues is great as well.

1385
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,240
I would like to speak about the gift shop briefly.

1386
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:37,560
Of course, yes.

1387
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:39,280
Were you going to play a Lieutenant Dan Band song?

1388
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,480
Is that why you're pulling it up?

1389
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,760
No, I mean, I was just looking to see what was there.

1390
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:43,760
We don't need to.

1391
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:44,760
We don't need to do that.

1392
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:48,120
We love to hear a friend of the devil by the lieutenant.

1393
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:50,280
Do they only play patriotic songs or they play like.

1394
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,800
I'm trying to find a set list honestly.

1395
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,320
Run through the jungle I bet.

1396
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:55,440
But you can talk about gift shop while I'm doing this.

1397
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:57,840
The gift shop is full of, it's huge.

1398
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:59,800
It's like half the size of the restaurant.

1399
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:06,760
It is full of stuff like t-shirts, license plates, things, but all with phrases from

1400
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:08,440
Forrest Gump on them.

1401
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:09,440
Things that you forgot about.

1402
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:13,160
Like they're stupid as the stupid does, but there's also like for a long time, last time

1403
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:16,480
I was there, there were a lot of shirts that said, I got a P, which is what he says to

1404
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:17,480
JFK.

1405
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:20,480
But just having a shirt that says I got a P on it.

1406
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:23,280
There's so many steps where you have to be like, that's from Forrest Gump, especially

1407
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:26,400
in like 2015, which is when I saw this shirt.

1408
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,120
Also, so here's what it is.

1409
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:34,880
A couple years ago, after I'd been and I just marveled at the gift shop, I met a friend

1410
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:39,240
of a friend who was a manager of a bubblegump.

1411
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:45,640
And I asked him, what I was wondering is like, has it always been the same shirts?

1412
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:51,520
And he's like, no, every six months entirely new, I got a P shirts come in.

1413
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:57,660
They remainder or whatever the old ones, like that's like new layout of I got a P on a new

1414
01:02:57,660 --> 01:03:02,880
color of shirt and they have to replace everything in the gift shop, like every six months.

1415
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:06,920
And so, but it still says I got a P, it's just like a new design.

1416
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:09,200
And that happens, it's been happening this whole time.

1417
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,200
And you asked, right?

1418
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,200
You went to the cash register.

1419
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,200
Well, no, no, no.

1420
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:13,200
Oh yeah.

1421
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,200
I asked for it to see if there was an, I got a P thing.

1422
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:16,200
Cause there wasn't any, I got a P stuff.

1423
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:19,600
And I was like, that's the most egregious of all the phrases for me.

1424
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:22,720
Cause it's just a little bit just offensive.

1425
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:27,880
That would, I guess, bug me, you know, walking around in the war or in a fancy setting of

1426
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:32,260
some kind to see I got a P and I would not think of gump.

1427
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:33,260
That's for sure.

1428
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:34,260
You have to look really like underneath.

1429
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:35,260
He says, Bubba gump shrimp.

1430
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:36,260
You're like, what's that?

1431
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:37,680
And it's like, oh, that's movie for scum.

1432
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,680
Oh, he does say that that one time.

1433
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:40,680
It's one.

1434
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:41,680
Yeah.

1435
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,320
I don't think it really took as a catchphrase or anything.

1436
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,480
It sure didn't take.

1437
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:49,960
Uh, did, but they, are you saying that they sell, they sell out of it or they have to

1438
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,120
just keep representing?

1439
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:52,640
I got a P in different ways.

1440
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:53,640
Yeah.

1441
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:55,800
They just have to get rid of the ones that are there and make some new ones.

1442
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,800
And it's just like, that's the slog.

1443
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:03,600
So I don't want to go open up another whole lieutenant band, the Dan band thing.

1444
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:06,400
First of all, I want to make it clear to the audience when they search, we're not talking

1445
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:07,920
about the Dan band.

1446
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:08,920
No, they're real.

1447
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:09,920
They're a different band.

1448
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:10,920
They're a different weird band.

1449
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:13,920
They're a different cool band.

1450
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:18,000
So lieutenant Dan band, Scott, I think you were incorrect just thinking these guys just

1451
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:23,120
play blues music because according to the lieutenant Dan band and the Mandalay Bay concert

1452
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:31,200
they did in 2011, they cover songs by Kelly Clarkson, Evanescence, Beyonce, Lone Star,

1453
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,880
the Zach Brown band, and many more.

1454
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:40,080
And I just pulled up them doing wake me up inside by Evanescence on YouTube.

1455
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:41,880
Should we all experience this together?

1456
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:43,440
Is Gary singing?

1457
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:47,080
I don't have any, I, this is fresh.

1458
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:48,600
My heart is racing right now.

1459
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:49,600
I'm really worried.

1460
01:04:49,600 --> 01:05:01,040
Can you see Gary Sinise there?

1461
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:03,680
What's he bringing to this operation?

1462
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:09,240
Is that him dancing?

1463
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:10,240
With the tambourine?

1464
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:16,160
No, he's not on string right now.

1465
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,320
This is the lieutenant Dan band.

1466
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:22,840
Wait, I think he plays bass.

1467
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:23,840
There he is.

1468
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:28,840
Oh my God.

1469
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:29,840
Wake me up.

1470
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:30,840
Forrest Gump.

1471
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:31,840
There he is.

1472
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:32,840
Oh my God.

1473
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:33,840
He's not singing.

1474
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:34,840
He's just playing bass.

1475
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:35,840
Why don't they have a camera on him?

1476
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:36,840
Why did it take that long to get a shot?

1477
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:37,840
He's the star.

1478
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:45,440
Why would you see this for any reason?

1479
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:46,440
I think you wouldn't go.

1480
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:50,720
If I told you they were playing the OC county fair, you would be there with me.

1481
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:51,720
Yeah.

1482
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:53,520
Scott, can you record this weekend?

1483
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:54,520
I can't.

1484
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:56,360
I'm going to see that lieutenant Dan band.

1485
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:57,360
Going to a thing?

1486
01:05:57,360 --> 01:06:00,880
I mean, they do do Superstition by Stevie Wonder.

1487
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,840
Does he sing that?

1488
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:04,560
Is it always that woman?

1489
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:05,560
Oh man.

1490
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:08,400
There he is smirking, making bass face.

1491
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:11,560
I think he doesn't sing in the lieutenant Dan band.

1492
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:12,560
Never?

1493
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:13,560
I'm trying to find.

1494
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:14,560
He must banter or something.

1495
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:18,880
Lieutenant Dan, he's got a banter.

1496
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:23,840
Doing like a mild cover of Uptown Funk.

1497
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:24,840
Oh no.

1498
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:25,840
All right.

1499
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:26,840
I don't think he sings that.

1500
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:27,840
No, I don't think he sings.

1501
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:28,840
He just plays bass.

1502
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:29,840
He just plays bass.

1503
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:31,360
He gets to call it lieutenant Dan band.

1504
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:32,360
It's just his hobby.

1505
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:34,200
He doesn't want to be the star of his hobby.

1506
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:36,800
As in films, he's a journeyman.

1507
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:41,520
He's a, he slides into whatever the role calls for.

1508
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:44,920
He's not seeking the spotlight.

1509
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:49,000
Perfectly fine New Year's band.

1510
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,960
The new lieutenant Dan band.

1511
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:55,760
How much would it take for us to book the lieutenant Dan band for the, for, for a live

1512
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:56,760
show?

1513
01:06:56,760 --> 01:07:00,760
Podcasts, the ride, anniversary party, the podcast, the ride, anniversary bash.

1514
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:02,360
It's probably startlingly expensive.

1515
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:05,360
You have to delete this episode.

1516
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:06,360
Yeah.

1517
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:10,160
You know, I've seen them at a church that I've been to with my parents.

1518
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:15,080
So if we could somehow convince them that it was like a Catholic fundraiser, if we could

1519
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:20,600
trick Gary Sinise into thinking that money is that he doesn't have to be paid because

1520
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:23,060
in order to help pay the Catholic church.

1521
01:07:23,060 --> 01:07:33,400
We also, what we really have to do is tell them that Jason has PTSD.

1522
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:37,360
He fought in the Iraq war.

1523
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:38,360
Straight out of college.

1524
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,000
He was over in Iraq.

1525
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:46,000
I was in the theme park wars, Disney versus Universal is a hell of an orange race there

1526
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
in the late nineties.

1527
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,480
And Jason had his legs blown off.

1528
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:59,480
That cable got loose on one of those drop rides.

1529
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:04,200
I think this seems like, do you think that us tricking Gary Sinise into thinking he's

1530
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:06,120
part of a Catholic PTSD benefit?

1531
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:10,160
Couldn't we just dress me up as a Jesuit?

1532
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:13,920
Isn't that just easier to get me a robe and a rope tie?

1533
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:18,120
I just want to check if you guys think that this is something that people with compassion,

1534
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:20,240
integrity and intensity would do.

1535
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:22,960
Oh, forget about it.

1536
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:25,600
What am I talking about?

1537
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:28,920
You know, yeah, we can't think too hard about the moral dilemmas here.

1538
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:34,640
We have to get to the present part of the podcast, which is Eva, because you thank you

1539
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:40,000
for because of your interest in the in the Bubba Gump's store.

1540
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,800
Hang on a second.

1541
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:44,680
I want to send you on a one way trip down.

1542
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:45,680
Eva Boulevard.

1543
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:46,680
Oh my God.

1544
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:47,680
You got that.

1545
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:48,680
It's a customized sign.

1546
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:49,680
I'm sure in invaluable.

1547
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:50,680
So sweet.

1548
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:51,680
Thank you.

1549
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:52,680
You're very welcome.

1550
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:53,680
Such a nice gift.

1551
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:54,680
Did you get a picture of it?

1552
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:55,680
Oh, yeah, we should.

1553
01:08:55,680 --> 01:09:00,680
Before I leave, I'll take a picture and you can put it online.

1554
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:01,680
Yes.

1555
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:02,680
Yeah.

1556
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:05,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1557
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:08,560
The world should see what Eva Boulevard is like.

1558
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:10,720
I want to point out, it doesn't just have a Bubba Gump logo.

1559
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:15,200
It has a tiny feather because that's what Forrest loves is that tiny feather flies in

1560
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:16,200
the air.

1561
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:17,200
Feather.

1562
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:18,200
Uh huh.

1563
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:19,200
Oh, yeah.

1564
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:20,200
Feather at the top.

1565
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:21,200
Thank you, guys.

1566
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:22,200
I didn't really stare at it for long.

1567
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:23,200
You got a feather.

1568
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:24,200
Oh, yeah.

1569
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:27,000
And it's kind of like a like a glossy photo of the of the bub this particular Bubba Gump's

1570
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,120
location, your favorite restaurant.

1571
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:32,520
And guys, look, the stone is appearing for this sector.

1572
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:33,520
The Sector Keeper Stone.

1573
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:34,520
The Sector Keeper Stone.

1574
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:37,840
It's half a rib and half a feather.

1575
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:41,360
It's a nightmare and a little.

1576
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:44,120
It's a spread of wasabi smeared on top.

1577
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:45,120
Oh my God.

1578
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:48,520
Before we go, I just want to share maybe my favorite thing that happened all day.

1579
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:49,520
Oh, wait.

1580
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,480
Yeah, we didn't even talk about this.

1581
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:55,440
So this restaurant is part of the Landry's family of restaurants.

1582
01:09:55,440 --> 01:10:00,720
And Jason immediately realized that his father was a Landry's VIP member, which of course.

1583
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:02,920
We all spent some time going, oh, it's a Lowry's.

1584
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:03,920
No, no, it's a Landry's.

1585
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:04,920
We Jason and I are Lowry's VIPs.

1586
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:05,920
We're Lowry's VIPs.

1587
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:06,920
All three of the hosts are Lowry's VIP members.

1588
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:07,920
Eva, are you as well?

1589
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:08,920
No, I'm a Musa and Frank VIP.

1590
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:09,920
You're represented.

1591
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:10,920
I just have to be a Lowry's VIP.

1592
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:11,920
It's very easy.

1593
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:12,920
It makes a lot of sense if you go to Tama, Shantar once in a while.

1594
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:13,920
I know I got to do it.

1595
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:14,920
So you were like texting with your father trying to make sure that you were a Landry's VIP.

1596
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:15,920
I said, hey, do you use your cell phone number for that?

1597
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:16,920
I'll put your number down and get the points.

1598
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:17,920
I'll put your number down and get the points.

1599
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:34,560
So there was a whole thing where I tried the bill at the end and I realized that Scott

1600
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:37,120
has a universal pass, so that's 10%.

1601
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:39,440
So we're putting the card in there.

1602
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:41,520
The guy wrote the phone number down.

1603
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:46,960
And then you want to give points to your dad because he has the Landry's VIP status.

1604
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:48,480
And he'll get money off.

1605
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:49,600
And he'll get money off.

1606
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,560
So we're going to try to help your dad out too, I guess.

1607
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:52,560
So we're doing a lot of stuff.

1608
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:53,560
The benefits.

1609
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:57,280
He's writing down the phone number and you're trying to look up which phone number of your

1610
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:58,280
dad's it should be.

1611
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:02,880
And he puts it down and he comes back to the table and he lets you know that you had $25

1612
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:08,120
in credit on your Landry's VIP account and that he's applied it to our bill.

1613
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:10,200
It automatically just goes to the bill.

1614
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:13,280
You look like someone's shot you in the head.

1615
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:15,680
You look like you're stunned.

1616
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:17,520
You remember what you said?

1617
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:20,280
You said, I don't want to use that.

1618
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:22,160
I said, I didn't want to use it.

1619
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:24,200
He goes, oh, it just goes on automatically.

1620
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,200
Don't worry about it.

1621
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:26,200
I'm like, okay.

1622
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:31,240
You stole $25 off a meal of a bunch of friends.

1623
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:33,720
An expensive meal gets $25 off.

1624
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:34,720
And your father's expense.

1625
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:38,520
It's already been 10%ed off and then we get more.

1626
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:40,440
And your dad can't use those points.

1627
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:42,520
It's like he's starting over from zero now.

1628
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:48,080
No, I think like he still got some points, but it's like he got maybe a dollar's worth

1629
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:49,080
of points.

1630
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:53,440
It was possible that he spent a lifetime working and accruing those points.

1631
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:56,440
No, that's not on your birthday.

1632
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:58,160
And that you just go to that.

1633
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:00,560
We went to like chart house like two years ago.

1634
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:01,560
Yeah.

1635
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:03,560
You fucked your dad over.

1636
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:05,920
Hey, that's why he was upset.

1637
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,160
No, we didn't care.

1638
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:10,160
He's like, I probably just got another card and cared.

1639
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:11,160
He worked hard.

1640
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:15,480
You come out to Hollywood to just have this free wheel and lifestyle doing theme park

1641
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:16,480
podcast.

1642
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:18,360
He worked hard for those points.

1643
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:20,960
I am just now covered in flop sweat.

1644
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:23,320
Because you know it's true.

1645
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:25,860
I am trying to give them back.

1646
01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:27,280
We all watch you try to give them back.

1647
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:29,280
I want to say that that said, have them away.

1648
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:30,840
You played it with the man.

1649
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:32,720
Please give the points back.

1650
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:37,720
Also, usually they say, oh, it's got to be your name on the card for the bill.

1651
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:38,720
Oh, none of that.

1652
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:41,320
He had three different cards with three different names on it today.

1653
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:42,320
He didn't care.

1654
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:43,320
Yeah.

1655
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:44,320
It was great, by the way.

1656
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:45,960
One, a one truly a great waiter.

1657
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:46,960
Very fun.

1658
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:54,240
So can we book the Lieutenant Dan Band to re-raise those points?

1659
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:59,280
Your dad was a military vet and he subsists on points.

1660
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:01,400
He was not draft.

1661
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:03,380
Like he just just dodged it.

1662
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:04,800
His number did not come up.

1663
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:05,800
My dad too.

1664
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:09,440
My dad is your dad a draft misser?

1665
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:10,440
How old are your father's?

1666
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:14,200
My dad, I don't think he's too young.

1667
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:15,200
Would have missed it.

1668
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:16,200
He missed it.

1669
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:18,200
Oh, my dad fled the draft.

1670
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:19,200
Oh, you've been overseas.

1671
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:20,200
I can say that now.

1672
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:26,520
He moved all over the country and maybe will lie on his behalf.

1673
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:29,280
He failed to have an address to be pinned down at.

1674
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,280
No permanent address.

1675
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:31,280
He was a street performer.

1676
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:32,280
Well, that makes him the smartest person.

1677
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:33,280
Oh, that's true.

1678
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:34,280
Yeah.

1679
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:37,280
That was got away with it.

1680
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:39,880
Well, that magic really came in handy.

1681
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:40,880
It really did.

1682
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:41,880
It was disappearing.

1683
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:42,880
You never see me.

1684
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:45,880
You never saw me.

1685
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:49,000
Well, yeah, but all but none of them served.

1686
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,560
We have no fathers that served.

1687
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,040
No, no, no, no.

1688
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:57,840
But we will edit that out before we book the Lieutenant Dan Band for an important point

1689
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:58,840
razor.

1690
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:04,320
I want to book him, but it'd be like we just we just don't want the drummer and we don't

1691
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:05,320
want the singer.

1692
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:10,440
We don't want the guitarist or the piano player, the tambourine woman.

1693
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:11,440
We just want to book.

1694
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:12,440
We would like Dan.

1695
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:13,440
We just want Dan.

1696
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:14,440
We just want Lieutenant Dan.

1697
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:19,440
We've only got one mic and one bass amp.

1698
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:22,320
Can you make it work, you think, anyway?

1699
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:26,040
Can you still wake me up by evidence?

1700
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:29,960
We find out Gary's and he's just like Primus good.

1701
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:37,520
Well, only one way to find out and Sector Keeper, you're invited.

1702
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:38,520
We'll see you there.

1703
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:41,360
Eva, thanks so much for hanging out with us.

1704
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:43,320
So blessed out by this whole day.

1705
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:44,320
What an afternoon.

1706
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:45,320
Nice day.

1707
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:46,320
Thanks for having me.

1708
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:47,320
Thanks for doing it.

1709
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:48,320
You're blessed out.

1710
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:49,320
Mike is wasted.

1711
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:50,320
Strawberry jam.

1712
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:53,320
He's bouncing off the walls like a toddler.

1713
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:55,920
Hey, this has been a blast.

1714
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:56,920
We'll see you tomorrow.

1715
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:59,960
Hey, Lieutenant Dan Band, play us out.

1716
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:04,280
Now we have to remember to do that.

1717
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:09,280
I'll add it in later.

1718
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:12,280
Sure.

1719
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:27,280
My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold until you find it there and leave it back home.

1720
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:30,280
Wake me up inside.

1721
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:33,280
Wake me up inside.

1722
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:37,280
Call my name and save me from the dark.

1723
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:42,280
I lost my love to run before I come undone.

1724
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:47,280
Save me from the last thing I'd become.

1725
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:48,280
Forever.

1726
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:53,280
