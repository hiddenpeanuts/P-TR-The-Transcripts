1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,480
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,280
Welcome to Podcasts to Ride the Second Gate.

3
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,720
Turn in your passports at the door.

4
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,000
This is the Magic Kingdom.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,920
You might not be allowed to leave.

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,840
I was going to say, what's your name?

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,840
I'm Jason Sheridan.

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,520
We were laughing very loud, so I wasn't sure what's going on.

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,520
He was letting the laugh die down.

10
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,520
I was letting the laugh.

11
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,520
But he was being polite, right?

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,440
And laugh, and laugh, and laugh.

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,880
And now he's serious.

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,600
We should do that more when I think I say something really hilarious and I go like, hold

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,600
on a second.

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,040
Let's let the listener at home catch their breath, or say it out, and hold for laugh.

17
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,840
I'm Jason Sheridan, and joined, as always, by Mike Carlson and Scott Gerner.

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,840
They're here.

19
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,440
Hold for massive applause, hold for huge applause, as everyone applauds when the hosts are introduced

20
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,960
when they are alone.

21
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,960
Everyone driving, please take your hands off the wheel and clap.

22
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,640
You had that line, so I let you do it, but I thought of a little song to kick it off

23
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,640
if you want to hear that.

24
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,640
Oh, please.

25
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,640
Sure.

26
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,640
Okay, here we go.

27
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,800
Disney fans, this new park's gonna save the company.

28
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:33,480
Abu, Abu Dhabi, authentically Disney, but distinctly Emirati, Abu, Abu Dhabi.

29
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,480
Hooray.

30
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,480
That's pretty good.

31
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,480
Yeah.

32
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,480
Yeah, I thought so.

33
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:44,040
I wanted to do a musical salute to our new favorite place, a place that, okay, full disclosure,

34
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,360
I've only heard of this place for the first time right now, and I heard it after the name

35
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,360
Disney, so therefore I love it, and I refuse to look up anything else about it.

36
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,940
It's a great place, a perfect place, because they're hosting the Disney company.

37
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,240
That's all we need to know, and that's all we need to say.

38
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,520
I think, right, end of episode.

39
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,520
Yay.

40
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,120
Welcome to Abu Dhabi, Disney.

41
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,000
Everything seems copacetic about this.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,040
Don't look to your left, please, let's go over here.

43
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,000
As long as you keep your eyes focused on Yas Island only, as long as we don't go looking

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,280
around other parts of the country or, you know, people who are being detained in basements

45
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,840
in different parts of the country, and everything should be fine.

46
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,840
That's right.

47
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,840
So anyway, here we go.

48
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,840
Yay.

49
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,960
Yeah, we're excited with no qualifications, especially because we've got, I mean, all

50
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,600
right, let's just explain the whole thing.

51
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:54,240
Disney's seventh resort is open, Disney's not resort, it's seventh theme park destination

52
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,880
is opening.

53
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:03,640
And it is opening in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.

54
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:12,760
I got this information, this broke about a week ago, and I got it during a hotel stay,

55
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:20,480
I got to do an overnight for my anniversary, Aaron and I, 11 years, and it was a thrill

56
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:28,000
to get to go do a big old Disney day, and it was a magical, perfect Disney day.

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,280
As good as they come, we got everything we wanted, we got Guardians, we got Carthay

58
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,120
Manhattan's end of list, anything else is bonus on top of that list.

59
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,120
Yeah.

60
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:45,320
But it was like a magical one where everything worked out for us and luck was on our side,

61
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:50,880
and then just in all these little ways, everything worked out perfect, and it was like, wow.

62
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:57,000
The next morning, just like exhausted, but just blown away by how magical a Disney day

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
can be, and how perfect, we really got the best of the company.

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:10,160
And then I checked my phone, and I immediately saw the worst of the company, the sobriety,

65
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:16,040
the splash of water in the face of like, wow, we really did it, the company really provided

66
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,920
for, oh no, what has happened, what are we paying into?

67
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:29,280
Yeah, I had to double check to make sure it wasn't a speculation site or a rumor site.

68
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,200
Sometimes you also see those parody Disney sites now.

69
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,240
Have you caught this?

70
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,280
Have you gotten sent a parody Disney news site, like the Onion for Disney fans?

71
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,640
Oh, that's grim.

72
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,400
I've been sent this from my mother or something who thought it was real.

73
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:48,960
It'll be like the silliest stuff, they're replacing the water on Pirates of the Caribbean

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,400
with bubblegum or something.

75
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,680
It'll be like that level of like, but it's like, it's called, I shouldn't know the name

76
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,680
of it.

77
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,520
With the worst Photoshop or possibly AI art you've ever seen, I feel like I've seen one

78
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,920
of these, and the illusion lasted for me for 1.5 seconds, and I did not click through to

79
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,960
anything else.

80
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,960
You know what's funny?

81
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,680
I'm all off on tangents here.

82
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,960
I was in line at the grocery store, and I realized now, I overheard a cashier telling

83
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,960
somebody that they're turning Guardians of the Galaxy back into Tower of Terror, and

84
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,000
it took all of my strength not to interject and say, that is not happening.

85
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,400
That's not, he's saying the wrong thing, and the people in line were like, they were skeptical

86
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,920
too, but they were just like, oh, okay, or whatever.

87
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,400
So I feel like I'm battling misinformation a lot on different playing fields.

88
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,000
Excuse me, Mike Carlson, Podcast The Red.

89
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,060
You probably recognize me.

90
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:43,080
If you don't, if I must, I do host podcasts about this stuff, and I would have heard about

91
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,080
this.

92
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,200
Pull up.

93
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,680
Well, I had my badge at the ready in case I decided to say anything to prove it.

94
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,680
Did you have your gun?

95
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,120
Yes, I did.

96
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,080
Always armed, always on duty, the podcasters motto.

97
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,720
My Toy Story Midway Mania gun with the pull toy.

98
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,720
It's massive.

99
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,640
Yeah, I pulled that out of my pocket.

100
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,200
Excuse me, misinformation, stop.

101
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,200
Click, click, click, click, click.

102
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,640
Oh, my wrist hurts.

103
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:08,080
That's 10 yanks of a rope that tells you that this is false information.

104
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,080
Yes.

105
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,600
So anyway, that was, it was real.

106
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,600
The story was real.

107
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,040
Let's save it for, you know, the audience are the people at the grocery store.

108
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,040
Yeah.

109
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,040
Yeah, of course.

110
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,400
If you spoil all your scoops there, then they don't get what they pay for here.

111
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,400
Okay.

112
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,600
So, well, so, all right, but we can confirm that.

113
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,960
We're sure that's not happening.

114
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,480
That's, I don't know.

115
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,080
Maybe this person has insight info.

116
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,080
Maybe, maybe.

117
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,080
It would be surprising.

118
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,400
It wouldn't make any sense, but yeah, I guess it's possible.

119
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,680
I think we're all thrown, though, by this Disney Abu Dhabi news because I don't think

120
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,320
anyone had heard this rumor even remotely.

121
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,320
This is not leaked.

122
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,320
Yeah.

123
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,320
Yeah.

124
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,320
Yeah.

125
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,320
As far as I know.

126
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,320
I don't think so.

127
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,320
So it was quite the cut to that.

128
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,880
There wasn't even like, we didn't even get a moment of, oh, my God, they're going to

129
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,880
do this.

130
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:02,960
It was straight to Eiger, Demaro, the Abu Dhabi guys, the Yass Island guys, Mickey and

131
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:08,240
Minnie on a weird stage built into the beach with mouse ears.

132
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:14,640
And then concept art that is as generic as you could possibly produce, that is the least

133
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,880
committed to art you've ever seen.

134
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,520
Yeah, very blurry.

135
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,560
The castle is just some squares.

136
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,560
Yeah.

137
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,800
There are just some squares and diamonds and like what, like.

138
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,080
Could be a crystal cathedral.

139
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,260
It very much seems like crystal cathedral, it seems like, eh, this isn't European.

140
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,760
They don't like that shit.

141
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,760
So crystals.

142
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,600
Yeah, like glass is what we read.

143
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,600
Beach guy stuff.

144
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,600
Yeah.

145
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,480
So I mean, today, I believe even today was confirmed that it's all indoors.

146
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,880
I saw something like literally today, somebody confirmed that it's all indoors.

147
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,840
So I wonder if this is even representative of anything they're actually doing or this

148
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,880
is just sort of an abstraction of the idea of a theme park.

149
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,880
I don't know.

150
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,880
I'm not sure.

151
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,160
Yeah, because the heat there is, I mean, it's a desert.

152
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,160
It's terrible.

153
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,320
There's literally laws.

154
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:08,200
There are basic labor laws saying they cannot build between like twelve thirty and three

155
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,080
thirty because the heat and sun are so bad.

156
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,080
Yeah.

157
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,080
All right.

158
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,080
Will these rules be followed?

159
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,080
This we will see.

160
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,080
Yeah.

161
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,680
Maybe when Disney's in play.

162
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,680
Will any.

163
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,680
We're giving up.

164
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,680
We put mouse ears on them with a little brim, a little special brim that'll keep them.

165
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,680
No, I was curious about heat.

166
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,080
They in July last year, they hit one twenty three.

167
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,080
Yeah.

168
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,760
An average in July is like one oh four to one eleven.

169
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,520
So yeah, it's going to have to be.

170
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,520
It has to be.

171
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,520
Yeah.

172
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,520
Mostly.

173
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,760
But that's not reflected in the concept art, huh?

174
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,760
I don't think so.

175
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,560
I mean, it can't really tell, though, because they've they've figured out a better like

176
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,960
Universal.

177
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,120
We haven't talked too much on the show about the UK park that they've announced in that

178
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,320
concept art.

179
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,080
You can tell these are concepts that they've just done some light, either Photoshop or

180
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:05,000
some little tweaks to to try to hide what is pretty clear, like it's pretty clear that

181
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,400
Back to the Future Hill Valley is in there and they just maybe remove the top part of

182
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,120
the clock tower or something like they did.

183
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,240
They did some slight changes to to make you not sure exactly.

184
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,240
To abstractify a little.

185
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,680
What are the other big things with that?

186
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,040
Jurassic Park, I believe is the rumor.

187
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,040
Haddington.

188
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,120
Haddington.

189
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,360
I believe that there looks to be a Waterworld type like show in the back, but it could be

190
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,360
James Bond.

191
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,360
Yeah.

192
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,360
James Bond.

193
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,360
James Bond.

194
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,360
They mentioned James Bond.

195
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,640
They mentioned James Bond in like a press release or something.

196
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,720
Finally outside of that one thing.

197
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,720
That one.

198
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,720
Yeah.

199
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,720
Dominion attraction.

200
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,720
Yeah.

201
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,240
With only Judi Dench, that Judi Dench in the pre show.

202
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,240
Yeah.

203
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,200
And no Brosnan in the ride.

204
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,200
Sure.

205
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,200
No Brosnan anywhere to be seen.

206
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,480
So that's when the rules as established by Indiana Jones were not the star and back to

207
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,480
the future.

208
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,680
The rules used to be no star.

209
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,160
Pick your secondary character.

210
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,160
No star.

211
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,160
Yeah.

212
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,600
Now I think we may be kind of expect stars.

213
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,600
Right.

214
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,600
And it's interesting with James Bond.

215
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,240
It's like we're in the middle of they're in the middle of figuring out what the next one

216
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,240
is.

217
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,600
So I don't know who it would be.

218
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,600
Yeah.

219
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,760
So I guess maybe the next one.

220
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,760
I don't know.

221
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,760
Whoever is the next Bond.

222
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,760
It's up to Jeff Bezos.

223
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,760
It really is.

224
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,760
He could be him.

225
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,760
Yeah.

226
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,960
He could be on the tux.

227
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,680
It certainly seems like that's where he thinks he's headed with his his new look.

228
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,600
I'd be really excited if they bought it and then that was the direction that's what they're

229
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,600
doing.

230
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:40,440
Well, this new James Bond is hot and cool in his mid 60s.

231
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,480
He's not a dork who works in a computer on a computer in a garage for sure.

232
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,960
Do you think he does hair for that?

233
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,960
Or does he?

234
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,960
Yeah, hair.

235
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,960
Yeah.

236
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,120
The baldness is hot.

237
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,660
So he stays in my dream.

238
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,880
It's the most obvious wig of all time.

239
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,880
Yes.

240
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,880
Maybe.

241
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,880
Yes.

242
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,240
Maybe he does the look that all the Trump A.I. photos are of like Trump should go grow

243
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,960
a beard and shave his head bald.

244
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,080
He looks so powerful.

245
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,600
He looked like Jeff Bridges and first Iron Man.

246
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,980
He did kind of look weird.

247
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,440
Like it kind of cool, I guess, in those photo shops.

248
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,440
Oh, Obadiah Steyn.

249
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,440
Yeah.

250
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,040
Regular Iron Man villain Obadiah Steyn.

251
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,600
I watched that entire movie and I didn't know his character's name was Obadiah Steyn.

252
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
Correct.

253
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,600
Yeah.

254
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
Obadiah Steyn.

255
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,600
Yeah.

256
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:40,760
So I saw this news and I I'm not an expert by any means, but I've been reading like I've

257
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:46,640
been reading news about the Middle East since college, maybe even high school.

258
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,440
So it's a generic statement, I suppose.

259
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,720
I mean, I guess technically I have.

260
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,720
There's a lot.

261
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:59,760
But I've been like, you know, it's hard to tell which governments have been overthrown

262
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,880
and replaced by Western or CIA interests.

263
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:10,400
But I let out a groan because when I saw it was Abu Dhabi, I was just like, oh, God, there's

264
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,880
so much money there.

265
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:19,780
And sure enough, I found an article in the Arabian Post headline, Abu Dhabi tops global

266
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:24,760
wealth rankings with one point seven trillion in assets.

267
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:31,040
OK, so that's why all those these companies are going there, because there is so much

268
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,040
money.

269
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:37,200
I don't know, though, because I heard Eiger and Damar saying that Abu Dhabi is the crossroads

270
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,200
of the world.

271
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,120
So I thought that was why, because it's crossroads of world.

272
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,960
Well, yeah, I mean, who are you going to believe?

273
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:50,720
Eiger, you're lying eyes, you know, I think it's almost one of the funniest aspects to

274
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,560
me is that it's straight to that, that it was just like straight to the big dogs.

275
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:00,200
There they are. They are there out there hustling us, selling us on this.

276
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,480
That had to be Abu Dhabi dream.

277
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,200
That had definitely had to be part of it, I think, because it does feel like something

278
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:11,480
that like, well, we even talk about how it wasn't so much publicity surrounding like

279
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:16,520
Tokyo, like Disney, see, like it wasn't like my family didn't know about that.

280
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,680
They didn't know Tokyo, Disney, see, existed or whatever.

281
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,600
I don't know that there was a big I obviously the Internet didn't exist.

282
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,800
But it's harder to say we were I mean, when it was planted, we were like 14.

283
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,120
So it's true. Yeah, but no, I know.

284
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,840
In my mind, it was like it was just there.

285
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,840
Like I say, it was one it was one link I saw on like on my sage.

286
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,920
Oh, there's a whole new park there. Right.

287
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,920
So it felt obviously it's different because of the Internet.

288
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,000
But like this definitely felt like a big flashy rollout for this thing.

289
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,760
Yeah. Well, it was a great photo shoot.

290
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:53,520
It's Mickey and Minnie giving big hugs to the people from from the morale.

291
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,840
That's it. Right. Right.

292
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,440
Well, yeah, that's how I was saying it.

293
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,240
I'm not sure that's wrong.

294
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,920
I think so.

295
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,960
I yeah, that's that's another one of my I always love.

296
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,800
You really know you're being sold something when a name is said.

297
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,680
You've never heard before. Yeah.

298
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,760
Disney to partner with Miral.

299
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,960
We love our partners at Miral.

300
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:18,080
Mickey is the most excited to give hugs to his new pals from Miral.

301
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,080
What's Miral?

302
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,800
So don't start saying that like I know what that is.

303
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:27,720
Why Mickey is here with his friends from DuPont Chemicals, DuPont,

304
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,320
just any entity, any company.

305
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,080
It's like, why? Yeah.

306
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,960
Mickey is here with the creator of the Remington rifle.

307
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,600
Tell me who I got a hug.

308
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,280
Just tell me, point me in the direction of the hug I have to give it.

309
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,400
I'll do it.

310
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,560
We have to get out of your questions.

311
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,440
Mickey and Minnie and me and Minnie are not married.

312
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,160
We're in kind of like a no, no kind of relationship,

313
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,720
which is illegal in this country.

314
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,720
So we got to get out of here before they kill us.

315
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,080
The rules are different for me.

316
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,400
I'm a star. It's allowed for me, right?

317
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,720
Yeah, I don't know.

318
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,640
Well, and so so it prompts you.

319
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,480
You just have to start asking the questions immediately.

320
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,080
OK, well, what is what is Miral?

321
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,120
And they are the people who have

322
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,840
are they are the people who have developed all of the theme park

323
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,000
entities that have been forming in the specific part of UAE

324
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,480
and the specific part of Abu Dhabi

325
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,880
that we that we now know and love as Yass Island. Yes.

326
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,200
Pronunciation wise, I've looked it up and seen.

327
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,640
Yes, I've seen.

328
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,600
I've seen more of a Z like Yass.

329
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,080
That's what I saw Iger do.

330
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,480
I'm going to follow his lead. Yeah.

331
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,960
If I get it wrong, it's Iger's fault.

332
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,600
And what has he ever done wrong? Never. Nothing.

333
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,120
Has anybody gone wrong following Bob Iger?

334
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,960
But anyway, I'm going to try.

335
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,800
I'm going to go with the Oz Island.

336
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,320
But whereas this is like, I think here and there,

337
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,880
maybe we have brought up the Warner Brothers Park there.

338
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,000
It's come up in fits and starts.

339
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,520
But now with this, we absolutely have to pay attention to Yass Island.

340
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,040
This becomes the addition of Disney to this area.

341
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,560
Now it is one of the like primary

342
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,920
burgeoning theme park zones in the world.

343
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,520
Yeah, for sure.

344
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,600
I maybe this is this is we should talk about this later.

345
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,240
But I this is I do get the feeling with the Universal and now this news

346
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,400
that we are maybe like on the precipice of like crazy,

347
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,200
rapid expansion worldwide as well. Yeah. Of everything.

348
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,280
Because especially in the last so many years,

349
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:44,600
as the movie business collapses and the TV business consolidates,

350
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,640
whatever you want to call it.

351
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,080
I feel like these companies are just like, these make a lot of money.

352
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,480
And yeah, if there are people or if governments are willing to pay,

353
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,640
we are willing to build and Universal, obviously,

354
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,680
is out front with more of it right now.

355
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,640
But are we not going to be able to get away with talking about new developments

356
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,680
that have shown up within a 25 mile radius where we live?

357
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,040
Are we going to have to travel across the world?

358
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,320
No, don't worry.

359
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,800
They're not going to build anything in domestic parks.

360
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,560
They'll just keep kicking that football down the line.

361
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,560
I know. I know. That's how it feels.

362
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,920
I mean, this whole thing feels kind of like a big middle finger

363
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,400
to the domestic parks.

364
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,680
Like, OK, well, you know, we got a new parade where we're which it's

365
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,760
it's now called light of dreams.

366
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,200
Celebrate a wish, not wishes of light.

367
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,880
Dream a celebration.

368
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,240
So you excited for that for 2026?

369
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,240
OK, anyway, entire new.

370
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,720
We are officially spending $10 billion in Abu Dhabi.

371
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,840
I wish that they would make it like they would by government

372
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,600
mandate in America, make it so that the parks were its own business.

373
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:53,520
Find independence of the studio, because that's like it just doesn't

374
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,520
even though they are building stuff in the domestic parks,

375
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,720
it's just never going to ever be the priority

376
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,040
when it's just like it's already making a ton of money.

377
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,000
They can put a little money into it to keep it like fresh.

378
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,160
But they're never there's no incentive to put like all these

379
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,360
likely cool things are about to put into this park in America.

380
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,960
Why, that sounds like breaking up a monopoly, Michael, that

381
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,320
never happened.

382
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,840
They're only now getting around to Google punishment for that.

383
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,920
It's just, you know, it's just divorcing it from the possibility of like

384
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,560
a bunch of movies bombing, although they've been on a roll.

385
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,280
They've been on a pretty decent roll, I think, Disney lately.

386
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,680
So maybe I'm damning the domestic parks

387
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,800
to a worse fate, if I say this.

388
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,120
Well, and they they said in the announcements for this.

389
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,840
And again, I'm taking them at their word.

390
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,160
They did say because they did like Iger did some sit downs

391
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,040
with CNBC and CNN and other places on the day.

392
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,400
And they reiterated the massive investment

393
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:59,000
in domestic parks that is, sure, supposedly coming and perhaps

394
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,200
already in progress. Some a little bit.

395
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,640
Avengers is being built.

396
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,480
Yeah. So that's that's right. Yes.

397
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,880
And they are the animal kingdom.

398
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,160
Yes. Yes. Some of the things they've said.

399
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,960
Avengers or new Avengers or Thunderbolts, Asterix.

400
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,800
I'm confused.

401
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,800
I think I think regular Avengers. Oh, OK.

402
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,920
Yeah, I wasn't sure.

403
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,520
I wasn't sure it was Thunderbolts, Asterix.

404
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,880
Do you not like that? Hold on.

405
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,320
Is that a question? No, I thought that was funny.

406
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,520
I actually did.

407
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,200
You're putting a lot of spin on that ball.

408
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,480
It made me feel like you didn't like that.

409
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,320
Oh, no, I was making fun of it because it's a little silly,

410
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,000
but it's the kind of silly I like.

411
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,400
Oh, OK. I just couldn't tell.

412
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,440
I'll jump in and say I don't like it.

413
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,440
That's fine. I knew the answer to that question.

414
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,200
I knew the answer already. They're driving me crazy.

415
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,640
You know, tough to slip out and see movies and stuff.

416
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,120
I still got a new little one.

417
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,480
And like it's the mockery of that when that asterisk

418
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,120
pulls up to me at an intersection, when a big bus rolls up

419
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,040
and right in my window is the big asterisk, like, what is it?

420
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,160
When am I going to know?

421
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,360
Now, was I annoyed that the real part of New Avengers

422
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,880
was that Spider-Man Wolverine joined the Avengers

423
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,320
and Sentry was kind of like a leader thing.

424
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,560
But I'll take it because it's more Sentry focused. OK.

425
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,200
OK, so that's more of a nuanced opinion.

426
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,560
Yeah, that's my opinion of comic books for about 20 years ago

427
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,400
that we all care about.

428
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,880
My opinion is, I don't know what Sentry is.

429
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,640
Sentry. He's Sentry.

430
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,800
That was helpful. OK.

431
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,920
Oh, yeah. He's kind of like a godlike Superman character.

432
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,160
They all just like copy the same character and they just put

433
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,720
a different name on it and a slightly different personality.

434
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,440
To me, for years, it's just been like, so what's his?

435
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,400
Oh, he can like make light shoot out of his hands. OK.

436
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,640
He can stop the other.

437
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,960
He can stop the bad light that's shooting into the sky. OK.

438
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,200
Most powers are they can shoot light and they're like kind of hot.

439
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,440
That's mostly the powers of all the superheroes.

440
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,600
They're all kind of hot.

441
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,640
They can shoot stuff out of their.

442
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,200
God, if you get into the movies, probably just see sinners or friendship.

443
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,640
That will probably be the most rewarding thing for you.

444
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,120
Oh, yes. Friendship.

445
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,400
I'm going to try to make it a friendship. Yeah.

446
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,320
Anyway, where did where to start with this?

447
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,880
I mean, one, I think one important thing to say

448
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,400
is that due to this partnership with Miral, what made the why Miral?

449
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,040
What made them partner with Miral?

450
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:23,880
Is it that Miral is paying for 100 percent of this project?

451
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,240
Yeah, paying 100 percent operating the park.

452
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,720
But then I believe still paying a licensing fee for the park. Yeah.

453
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,400
So it is very similar to the Tokyo

454
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,920
Oriental Land Company right arrangement,

455
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,520
which should get that.

456
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,040
You start getting excited about that because that leads

457
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:47,200
to some of the best parks in the world. Blank check. Yeah. Yes. Yeah.

458
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,080
But then you get start you stop being as excited

459
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:55,480
when you do any googling of UAE in any social issue of any kind.

460
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,600
It's not it's not ideal. No, it's not ideal.

461
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,800
No. Yeah.

462
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,400
Put it mildly.

463
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,720
It's definitely some Trump to who gives a shit.

464
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,200
It's like that's what I was wondering, too.

465
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,280
Is it no rule? No rules.

466
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,600
Like, do they like delay the announcement a year?

467
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,880
And they're like, I'm not sure it's going to happen.

468
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,160
If Trump is back, we can do this. No problem.

469
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,000
They were on a plane, whatever the day was, November 6th, the day after.

470
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,720
They were like, are we getting on the plane?

471
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,600
Are we going to Abu Dhabi? Possible. Yeah. And let's go.

472
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,400
Yeah. Daddy tomorrow had his formal bomber jacket.

473
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,840
Steamed and everything. Ready to go.

474
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,160
I would like to do a big I told you so about daddy tomorrow.

475
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:41,160
I this this announcement and these photos are exactly why I have been

476
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:45,520
needling this issue for a long time, because I swear to God, it's like

477
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,040
pandemic is kind of, you know, sort of winding down.

478
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,360
Not really. They are at least enough to open the parks.

479
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,280
And I just start seeing all these posts are like this guy.

480
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,120
I saw him. I was I was there on morning one and I I saw him.

481
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,880
And he was wearing he was wearing a mask with Buzz Lightyear on it.

482
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,600
And I thought he's he's one of us.

483
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,680
He's me. I am him.

484
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,680
And to have one of us running the parks and not just go to the parks.

485
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,000
I mean, this guy is and then cut to him,

486
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,560
shit eating grin with the morale people like. Yeah.

487
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,440
All right. Excited to do some work in the capital of no homosexuality.

488
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,440
Like I'm like, OK, this is. Yep.

489
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,120
You know, you're no executive is your friend.

490
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,680
This is the point. Yeah. Yeah. At the end of the day.

491
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,520
Besides, obviously, Michael Eisner would sit with no qualifies.

492
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,240
Yeah, he would have.

493
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,440
He would have navigated everything perfectly.

494
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,880
So but other than that, yes, I hear. Yes.

495
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,480
You would have got he would have gotten this done

496
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,680
and made them go change all their laws so that they're better now.

497
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,120
It is. Well, that's true. Yes.

498
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,040
Well, that yeah, that would have been fine.

499
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,920
If he could have worked that out, he would.

500
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,560
He's a master negotiator.

501
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,000
So likely he could have.

502
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,760
Yeah, I mean, it's really like it's just the world is is money.

503
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,120
The world is just money.

504
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,880
And that's what it is.

505
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,240
I mean, I think Carly pointed out, like, well, this is kind of

506
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,280
this seems like against the company's values.

507
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,560
Now, I am more cynical. Yeah.

508
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:14,280
I say, well, they have done something against their values,

509
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:19,200
like against the things that like the the product stands for.

510
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,040
Because if you think about it enough of when I say enough,

511
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,960
I mean, like 20 seconds, the the

512
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:32,440
the heads of this country are essentially the empire

513
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,040
or the bad guys in all the Disney stuff.

514
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:41,880
So like, what what are they putting in this part?

515
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,520
It is. Well, that's a good question.

516
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,320
But I was just going to tell your point.

517
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:49,120
It is interesting because there's people in the company

518
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,280
because it's such a crazy big company.

519
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,160
There are people in the company that do care a lot about this.

520
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,800
You know that we have seen people make the movies and whatever.

521
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,280
Usually it's not executives.

522
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,560
But like it is interesting where it's like you feel like some of the Disneyland

523
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:06,800
changes are like they're so worried about making sure they change things.

524
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,400
And sometimes I think it's a little bit of an overthink.

525
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,840
Jessica Rabbit can't wear a dress and any Disney anymore.

526
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,200
I'm like, it's a little bit over the top.

527
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,240
That was a preview of the device. Well, right.

528
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,440
This is right.

529
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,040
Most of those changes are made in good faith to try to whatever,

530
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,680
to to make things more inclusive or not make them whatever.

531
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,920
But yes, there's certain people, there's pockets of the company

532
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,280
that are concerned about things like that.

533
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,320
And then ultimately, the company is like any other company

534
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,720
that just consume consume at all costs.

535
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,440
It's got a dead sweet executives that they got to deal with.

536
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,240
Let's hear from the guys themselves.

537
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,080
They had just been announced and then they went on CNBC

538
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:53,320
and our two favorite daddies said some really cool stuff.

539
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,760
Why Abu Dhabi? Why now?

540
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,560
Money?

541
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,280
Well, first of all, let's start with the region and we'll focus on Abu Dhabi.

542
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,160
This, in many respects, is the UAE is the crossroads of the world.

543
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,600
About 500 million people that are income qualified,

544
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,440
meaning they can afford to visit one of our parks, live within a four hour

545
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,960
plane trip here.

546
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:20,040
And about 120 million people will actually come through Dubai.

547
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,560
That's the mess. That's the main.

548
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,560
OK, I'm sorry.

549
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,960
I wrote down income.

550
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,560
That's like the most dystopian thing I've ever heard.

551
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,080
Income qualified.

552
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,000
Yep, yep, yep.

553
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,640
Yeah, no, that's yeah.

554
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,280
He really should have gotten some more flowery language for that answer.

555
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,320
That was very dry and like robotic,

556
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,640
like people who have

557
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,520
strong enough imaginations.

558
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,640
Yeah, have big enough hearts like we like.

559
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,960
There's so many folks around here that haven't experienced the Disney magic.

560
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,240
And now that it's closer,

561
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,000
they'll be able to come and they'll be able to ride on the back of a rainbow

562
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,640
right into the new magic kingdom.

563
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,080
Like you'd be like, well, at least that sounds fun.

564
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,880
At least that's a more fun way to put it.

565
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,440
This is the first episode I think we've done in eight years

566
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,000
where I spent a lot of time on Human Rights Watch

567
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,680
unintentionally.

568
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,320
But the I mean, really, we all should have been doing that

569
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,560
when we were talking about David Copperfield's island.

570
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,200
Oh, well, that's true.

571
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,600
No island.

572
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,000
But Human Rights Watch says

573
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,120
you UAE based migrant workers

574
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:35,160
who form 88 percent of the UAE population.

575
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,360
So that means less than 20 percent are just like regular citizens.

576
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,560
And I guess I read something like this.

577
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,760
Yeah, go ahead. A lot of those regular.

578
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,120
I can't prove that he read it, too.

579
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,360
Anyway, go on. Huh?

580
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,600
I can't prove that he also read it.

581
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,600
Anyway, go on. I want to prove I was smart.

582
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:57,640
But like so that means like less than 20 percent of the population is like

583
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:04,400
not the workers who toil at the like slave labor wages and such.

584
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:10,800
Uh, but there's a lot of very rich people in the UAE.

585
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,120
Sure. Yeah. That's what he's talking about.

586
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,600
I feel like. Yes. Yeah.

587
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,800
You've been reporting this like this is big news several times in the episode.

588
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,800
Now, again, get buckle up.

589
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,120
There is money there.

590
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:27,480
But I think that's so 80 percent is like saying, yeah, migrant workers.

591
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:32,000
And that's also like an insane process where they lure people there.

592
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,800
The visa costs and the travel costs cost so much.

593
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:40,400
And then they put the cost to pay that off on the workers

594
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,880
and they pay them practically nothing.

595
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,120
So then they just get caught in an endless cycle.

596
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:51,960
Those sorts of travel costs should really be shouldered by the companies,

597
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,280
not the people.

598
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,720
Well, we haven't seen their plan yet.

599
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,040
Well, yeah.

600
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,640
Will they come on and tell us?

601
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,240
I I read a Guardian article when they were building like

602
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,880
because there's a Louvre and a Guggenheim on another Louvre.

603
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,800
Really? Yeah.

604
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,800
Louvre, too. Wow. I didn't know that.

605
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,560
Oh, and Sadiyat Island, which is a different

606
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,000
Abu Dhabi island that translates to Happiness Island.

607
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,120
Oh, you mentioned happy.

608
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,440
Yes. Yeah.

609
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,400
So and I think there was supposed to be an NYU campus.

610
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,680
I don't know if that ever got NYU.

611
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,440
This is they're just they're gathering,

612
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,080
gathering a ton of crazy stuff.

613
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,200
I look, they call American college, love

614
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,920
sending riot cops against college students in America.

615
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:50,360
So I can only imagine what they would do to them on Sadiyat Island.

616
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,880
I don't know. I don't want to talk about it.

617
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,560
What other miserable articles did you read, Jason?

618
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,880
I read a lot.

619
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,840
Well, I this is why, see, you get like, you know,

620
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,800
the the non mainstream media gets in your head

621
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,800
and they mess you up with all of these thoughts.

622
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,960
I let me present how my news sources,

623
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:17,800
how this was presented to me by the real media, by the true media.

624
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,520
Look how ABC presented the news the morning.

625
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,800
Who owns that?

626
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,000
Stop right now, because we have a brand

627
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,960
new announcement from our parent company, Disney.

628
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,120
New world is being revealed.

629
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,920
And it's an Abu Dhabi where Rebecca Jarvis is for us.

630
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,360
Whatever you whatever you're doing, stop right now.

631
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,880
Stop it now.

632
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,400
Get away from your children.

633
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,800
If you're trying to take them to school,

634
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,400
cease that, that doesn't matter anymore.

635
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,920
Our parent company has an announcement.

636
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,360
Yeah. You have to say it's for legal reasons. Yeah.

637
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,040
But they seem like they seem prouder than one other.

638
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,600
You know, yeah, sometimes you're reading like an article.

639
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,560
It's critical or something.

640
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,480
And then in parentheses, it's like we should say this is our parent company.

641
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,320
Right, right, right.

642
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,840
This is what you watch. Good morning, America.

643
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,080
They they love it. They were they embrace it.

644
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,600
George Stephanopoulos is smiling huge.

645
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,600
He loves the parent company. Right, right.

646
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,360
There's a lot of speaking of smiles, actually smiles

647
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:21,760
leads me into my next little section because I know how everyone is

648
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,040
being so open arms in this room, because if we listen to the parent company,

649
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,640
they are telling us that this is actually a time to smile here.

650
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,560
Oh, OK, good.

651
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,080
So this is the rendering we have.

652
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,440
I'm smiling because I'm smiling.

653
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,720
It's pretty much that's him showing the my smile program is activated.

654
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,240
I'm smiling because it makes me smile.

655
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,920
And that's weird in its in its own way. Right.

656
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:54,360
But then several minutes later into the same piece,

657
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,240
now we meet the guy in charge of morale.

658
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,440
What does he have to say?

659
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,280
Tell me a little about your company and what you aim to do with Disney.

660
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,080
Our company is based on creating smiles.

661
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,960
We're here to create happiness.

662
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,320
And this is what this is all about.

663
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,800
What I truly love.

664
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,080
Everyone got together.

665
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,760
Smiles the smile like what's what is something?

666
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,640
There's going to be some weird reaction to this news.

667
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,280
What's something you're going to argue against a smile?

668
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,080
See a baby smile.

669
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,480
That makes you happy, doesn't it?

670
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,080
That's the language I guess I was looking for.

671
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,760
Earl from the clip earlier.

672
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,720
It's just like, what are you doing here?

673
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,920
Trying to create smiles.

674
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,680
Yeah, that income qualifiers should be out.

675
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:38,080
Smile havers or potential smile havers or future smile havers.

676
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,160
You're a smile haver in the region.

677
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,320
Be our guest.

678
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,640
You know what? When people ask what I do for a living,

679
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,280
I don't say a podcaster, I say smile creator.

680
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,480
That's because that's what I'm looking to do for the listener is create a smile.

681
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,280
I like that. And people say content creator.

682
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,160
And that's so formal. That's not what it's about.

683
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,640
What is the goal of the content?

684
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,800
And it's always to make you smile, to make you smile.

685
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:05,160
I like to say, like I make people smile like that movie Smile and Smile 2.

686
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,360
Now I've only seen the first 10 seconds of both trailers.

687
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:13,320
So but I'm assuming those movies are all about smiles that you are thinking about

688
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:17,120
in the next Halloween season, watching 10 minutes of smile and then.

689
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,360
Or you hold on, hold on, just at least the trailer in the full.

690
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,760
Yes, baby steps.

691
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,240
Yeah, the entire trailer.

692
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:29,440
I don't know. I turned it off because something seemed to miss.

693
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,400
OK, like maybe they weren't smiling because they were smiling.

694
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,880
But I did like all those people smiling behind home plate at baseball games.

695
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,720
They were loving the good sportsmanship.

696
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,680
I don't know what that's referring to.

697
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,320
Is that in the trailer of Smile?

698
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,560
No, we haven't watched the first 10 seconds like you.

699
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,560
That was like live marketing.

700
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:53,240
When those movies came out, they would buy the tickets behind home plate

701
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,720
and people would be sitting there.

702
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,200
So the whole there, the whole game, huh?

703
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,440
The whole scary would have a couple.

704
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,880
Yeah, they will. They will be in and out in the game.

705
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,080
They will be behind on plate smiling.

706
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,640
Oh, interesting. Promoting the movie.

707
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,920
This is yeah, I'm seeing I'm seeing what you're talking about here.

708
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:14,040
Why would this they just they're they're creeping out.

709
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:17,280
Everybody at baseball games to get people into a movie theater.

710
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,280
And I think it was like the playoffs.

711
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,480
It was later in the season, I feel like.

712
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,880
If we stand up and look like Vincent D'Onofrio in Full Metal Chicken. Wow.

713
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,120
That is really funny.

714
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,880
It worked. It got a lot of coverage.

715
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,400
Yeah. Well, you're still promoting it three years after it happened.

716
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,640
It made an impression.

717
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:41,000
Twenty twenty two is the article about it. Yeah.

718
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,560
An impression enough to what?

719
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:47,680
Did you watch 10 seconds of both trailers or in in different years?

720
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,640
Or was or was it at the same time?

721
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,440
Was it in one sitting you watched 10 seconds?

722
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,400
Oh, I just keep revisiting it because I like smiling so much.

723
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:59,600
Yeah. Well, I just, you know, I live the gimmick of smiling.

724
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:06,040
Anyway, so, yeah, it's just a bunch of smile

725
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,800
makers who are going to go to an island and make a bunch more smiles.

726
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,000
Who could have an issue with that?

727
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,280
Do we? Yeah.

728
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:16,840
I was going to say, do we think it'll be like you think you'll be able to?

729
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,440
Is it going to be very expensive, is what I'm saying, to get into this park?

730
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:25,840
Like, look, will a ticket cost like 50 times what a ticket is elsewhere?

731
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,840
I don't think 50.

732
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:31,080
But I think it'll be at the higher end of what they are doing is already very.

733
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,600
I guess like Warner Brothers.

734
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,480
Warner Brothers world isn't, I don't think, too expensive.

735
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,280
Yes. But that's not the Walt Disney Company.

736
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,720
No, it is not. Yes.

737
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,360
They're they're always going to push things as much as they can.

738
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,280
Should we talk a little more about Yaz Island?

739
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:53,320
Yes. Sure. The kinds of because I think that phrase has been ringing in our heads.

740
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:58,080
I think we've you know, we've we've come across it here and there.

741
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,560
But that's it's yeah, it's now like a going to be such a giant,

742
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,640
crucial destination.

743
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:09,960
And I think it's all kind of risen up without us paying a lot of attention to it.

744
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,640
In 2006, there was no such place.

745
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,080
It did not. Right. Right.

746
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,200
There wasn't even the land carved out for it yet.

747
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,360
So that's when the development begins.

748
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:23,120
And then by 2010, they have something called Ferrari World.

749
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,160
Ferrari World boasts the fastest roller coaster on Earth.

750
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,600
Formula Ross Rosa.

751
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:36,200
It is it is one hundred and fifty miles an hour.

752
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,800
This is do you guys?

753
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:44,120
Is Velocicoaster probably the fastest coaster either of you either of you have been on?

754
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,480
For sure. For me.

755
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,840
Uh huh. Any any idea if you've done it and done anything faster?

756
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,160
I don't know if I've done anything.

757
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,000
Maybe start just a little faster.

758
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,400
Forget. I don't think it is.

759
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:59,400
I'm not sure. I could be wrong, but I yeah, I think.

760
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,560
What is that top out at 70?

761
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,280
70 is Velocicoaster.

762
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,680
So Formula Rosa is

763
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,720
twice more than twice as fast as the fastest ride anyone in this room has been on.

764
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,560
Yeah, I would do it. I would do it.

765
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,840
I think. I mean, I would do it.

766
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,040
Oh, man, I'd love to do it in that honey.

767
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,880
One hundred and twenty degree heat.

768
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,440
Yes, we have no choice. Yeah.

769
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,560
But you'd be going so fast.

770
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:28,800
I wonder is like the hot air even does it cool going that fast on your face?

771
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,440
Like in the wet, like out of a car window.

772
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,880
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Yeah. Yeah. So fast.

773
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:38,560
Well, here's what what I read is it require it requires.

774
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,840
I guess this isn't a heat thing, but they do require passengers to wear goggles

775
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,040
because Abu Dhabi is subject to heavy sand and dust.

776
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,000
Oh, yeah. I was going to ask about the sand storms. Yeah.

777
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,680
They might still be running it in a dust.

778
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,840
If you're going to go all the way there, you still want to go on it. Sure.

779
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:59,200
Oh, man, when you're riding in a Ferrari car and you put your big goggles

780
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,800
on, it's a trademark of Ferrari.

781
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,720
You bring goggles. Yeah, of course.

782
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,360
I feel like you would like that because that feels like a turn of the century

783
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,440
thing. You're driving goggles. Oh, yeah.

784
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,560
It's kind of a throwback. Yeah.

785
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,720
Or burns. Mm hmm. Yes, exactly.

786
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,720
I know that's that also got me curious.

787
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,720
What is the fastest ride I've ever been on?

788
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,080
And I get and let me here's here's how to

789
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,880
I was surprised by the number here.

790
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,240
Do you know the fastest ride at Walt Disney World?

791
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,680
Do you know Walt is all the parks? Yeah.

792
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,840
You know what? I believe at least all the domestic Disney parks.

793
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,440
Do we know the answer to this?

794
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:39,600
Is it and you're counting just roller coasters, not like how fast

795
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,200
the Tower of Terror shoots up or something?

796
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,640
No, no. Yeah. Forward motion.

797
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,080
Is it guardians? The new guardian? It is not a guardian.

798
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,240
Is it a credit coaster? It is not a credit. Oh, OK.

799
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,440
Yeah. The answer is a little surprising.

800
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,720
I'm obviously I can rock a roller coaster. No.

801
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,720
Weird, right?

802
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,960
Can you even contract?

803
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,200
It is still test track.

804
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,480
The speed run of test track at 65 miles an hour.

805
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,640
It's funny. OK.

806
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,400
That's kind of surprising to me. Yeah.

807
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,960
And also and I.

808
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,920
Radiator Springs does not have an equivalent part that goes nearly that fast.

809
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:17,880
So test tracks still the fastest ride, at least in domestic Disney parks.

810
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,120
I think Disney parks and universal parks

811
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:26,200
always seem to put an emphasis on like the theming and such.

812
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:32,520
Yeah. Whereas Cedar Fair, Six Flags, those are always bragging about.

813
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,520
It changes every year.

814
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,280
But it's like this is a fast roller coaster in America.

815
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,680
This is the tallest coaster.

816
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,120
And then immediately gets topped by another project.

817
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,920
I think Cedar Point has it right now in America.

818
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,720
I couldn't tell you the name, but on the list I saw,

819
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,360
because I looked at a list and the list also had an asterisk on it

820
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,880
because Formula Rosa is going to get

821
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,760
dethroned by another ride

822
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:05,520
that's also going to it's like the not only the it's like the fastest

823
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,280
and the tallest, it's everything.

824
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,400
It's something called Falcon's Flight.

825
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,360
And this is in Saudi Arabia.

826
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,400
This is Six Flags, Kidia.

827
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,480
Oh, yeah. Which is an entire other fake place.

828
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,440
This is an entertainment city

829
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,560
that is being invented from an even bigger, faker place

830
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,440
that costs even more money.

831
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,960
Is that 70 billion dollar development?

832
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,800
Yeah. Does that start with a Q?

833
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,800
Yes. Yeah. I think it's Kidia. OK.

834
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:40,480
Do you know about Neom, the city that the tax city?

835
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,760
No. That's being built inside.

836
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:46,320
It's another like non thing.

837
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,200
Like, it's a thing that they're like, oh, in 20 years, this is going to be

838
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,880
there was all there's already been influencers.

839
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,840
They were like, we've moved into the dormitory apartments here in Neom.

840
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,280
It's so great.

841
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,600
And the cafeterias are wonderful.

842
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,040
And it's like, oh, that's a.

843
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,480
That's an op.

844
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,200
Like, that's that's a plant.

845
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,400
That's a that's not a real person.

846
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,480
You know, you mean the influencer, an influencer.

847
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,520
But you're saying that they've created the influencer to sway

848
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,960
like a public opinion or you're saying you're saying

849
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,360
it's not a familiar influencer to you.

850
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:27,280
It just it's it's like it's kind of bullshit.

851
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:30,320
If somebody's yelling at me at the beginning of a video

852
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,760
that I'm trying to watch with the biggest captions

853
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,400
that could possibly be on the screen, then I immediately trust them

854
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,440
and I take their advice on everything.

855
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,720
Oh, and I hope those captions get every fourth or fifth word wrong.

856
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,800
They often, yes, of course.

857
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,680
Yeah, the ones I trust the most get even more than that.

858
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,040
Right. You're lucky if you're you're lucky if half are correct.

859
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,200
I hope they're auto generated and I hope they never check them.

860
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,680
You know, it's all about it's all about that five second.

861
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,160
It's all about how much can you fit into the five seconds

862
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,960
because you're competing against people clicking away.

863
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:08,080
So but you can't like, hey, I just want to tell you about something

864
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:12,000
you can't the speed can't you can't forego the loudness.

865
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,720
You in being really fast, you also have to be the loudest man who has ever lived.

866
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,480
Yeah, that helps. Yeah.

867
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,760
It's a it's a difficult art.

868
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,400
I wouldn't even begin to put my my foot in that game.

869
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,320
Yeah, frankly, I'm just not loud enough.

870
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:28,160
No, I like the ones where like it's an ad.

871
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,560
And then you you realize like, oh, this person's insane

872
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,920
because they're talking about Satan being hitting it,

873
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,760
hidden in posters or degeneracy.

874
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,080
Sometimes if you wait, that's what happens.

875
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:43,720
That's what that well, someone reposted like a crazy person

876
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,880
going like Mr. Peace Logos.

877
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,760
They have the colors of the transgender flag.

878
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,200
They're trying to indoctrinate.

879
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,240
Yeah. And I'm like, oh, good.

880
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,840
Everyone's Alex Jones, Alex Jones now.

881
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,720
This is awesome.

882
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:58,040
And those ads end up just on everything.

883
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,440
Yeah. Mm hmm.

884
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:04,360
Oh, boy. Yeah, I'm on the Yas Island website.

885
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,040
Did you go on the website? I think I did.

886
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,280
Yeah. And there's a lot of way.

887
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,160
Maybe I didn't. I was on the morale website.

888
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,920
I want to know where all's been up to.

889
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,480
No, but they have like a like a tourist website

890
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,040
and they do have a list of all the things.

891
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:19,000
And it is like I didn't realize there was so much,

892
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,240
I guess, really, I'm getting at here.

893
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,400
Yeah, it's already bonkers. Yeah.

894
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,480
So much going on there.

895
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,720
And we've talked about the Warner Brothers world for a while.

896
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,240
Anytime you look at a video of Warner Brothers world,

897
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,320
it seems like there's nobody inside.

898
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,720
I don't know if that's true or not.

899
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:34,640
I don't have attendance figures, but it definitely seems empty.

900
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,880
So I'm wondering if they're like, we need a big thing.

901
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:42,920
And this is like why they put together an offer Disney couldn't refuse.

902
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,520
Is Warner Brothers world and its perennial emptiness

903
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,640
a visual representation of every streamer

904
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:53,680
and every movie that is watched by 70 billion eyeballs on every streamer?

905
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,720
It's possible. Yes, possible.

906
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,360
But they have Sea World there.

907
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,600
There is a Sea World there.

908
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:03,520
And I watched somebody somebody's video from there that was raving about it.

909
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,480
They loved the Sea World.

910
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:09,160
Apparently, it is like levels of theming way beyond

911
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:13,120
any Sea World that has ever existed, entirely indoors.

912
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,760
It is this like no orcas.

913
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,400
What's that? No orcas.

914
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,760
That's well, and that's the path to the future.

915
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,240
They can't orcas cannot be the future for them.

916
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,400
So and very few rides.

917
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,400
And yet this person was raving and raving.

918
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,560
I didn't check out everything that the raves were about.

919
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:33,400
But I know there was a show where you like when you're

920
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,240
again, who needs orcas when you can sit in like a stadium kind of crowd

921
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:43,720
and then watch drones that are fake

922
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:47,040
dolphins and turtles flying through the sky. Yeah.

923
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,200
That move in perfect patterns of swimming.

924
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:53,080
Like you're looking at sky turtles. Right. Right.

925
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,600
I mean, that's pretty undeniable.

926
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,400
I'd like to see some sky turtles.

927
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,120
Yeah. The Disney is Abu Dhabi is going to be incredible.

928
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,320
There's going to be the craziest technology you've ever seen.

929
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,800
But it's a check.

930
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:09,120
But but I'm worried about the technology.

931
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,600
Yes. Now, let me put the word Disney next to it.

932
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,920
Now, are you concerned?

933
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:18,040
Well, not as I mean, I just think that the money is going to be such

934
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:21,640
that there's a bunch of like concepts that like were deemed too expensive

935
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,320
for anything domestic.

936
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,920
So maybe they get like they get the good versions.

937
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,640
That's what I'm guessing. Yeah, maybe.

938
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:31,160
I mean, I'm just I'm just going off of the Disney situation where

939
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:36,200
they open a better Pooh Bear ride and that the Pooh Bear right here

940
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,960
is going to be insane.

941
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:41,800
You're going to get in the honey and it's going to be like your inner actual honey.

942
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,240
It's going to be sticky in there.

943
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,640
But then you're going to be clean when you come off.

944
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,560
You're not going to know how it happened. Wow.

945
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,560
There's going to be so much.

946
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:52,000
There's going to be weird VR honey sticky technology micro drones.

947
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,720
They're going to use hard light technology, hard light like that

948
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:59,600
shot out of the hands of all the superhero characters.

949
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,640
Scott goes like, what if that's right?

950
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:02,840
Yeah. Yeah. Uh huh.

951
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:05,040
Yeah. The real hard hand lights.

952
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,200
Yeah, that's very exciting.

953
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,160
Well, I got concerned, though, because then the guy,

954
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:12,760
the chairman of Moral and also the head of the Abu Dhabi

955
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:17,560
Department of Culture and Tourism, Mohamed Khalifa Al Mubarak,

956
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,200
just talked a lot about gamification.

957
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,400
And that's where I got concerned.

958
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,600
That's gamification and Disney.

959
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:28,720
No, no, no. Well, that man, has this worked out lately?

960
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,280
No, that's that's a problem worldwide, industry wide,

961
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:36,160
with the gamification, gamification, augmented reality.

962
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,360
Throw me in the dustbin, please.

963
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,680
That's that's a frown maker, not a smile.

964
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,240
Build some robots.

965
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,120
All we want is animatronics.

966
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,720
Yes. Yeah, I don't know.

967
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,720
That's the thing that we had in plenty in the 60s and 70s.

968
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,560
Yes. The things that we the things that we had no shortage of

969
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,120
when LBJ was president.

970
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:57,760
This is what we want now.

971
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,760
And yes, they've applied modern technology to them now.

972
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,200
And they're like, wow, guests are really responding to these.

973
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,440
Like, yeah, no shit.

974
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:10,840
Like what would be really funny, I think, is if they built some like

975
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,160
if they built a new Everest there

976
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,040
and then they made the Yeti even bigger and he worked, he would obviously work.

977
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,840
So like if they were do it, like to take the things that people have,

978
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:23,480
like as far as gripes of the domestic parks and then like fix them, make them better

979
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,440
and then only have it working there.

980
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:30,160
Yeah, that would be really like a slap in the face to the parks fans domestically.

981
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:33,600
Scott, I'm glad you said there are no orcas there because I'm like,

982
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,120
I don't even know if sea light can survive those temperatures.

983
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:40,720
I don't even know if metal can survive those temperatures.

984
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,840
We're talking about that roller coaster.

985
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,560
There's some sea life in there.

986
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,960
Yeah. Yeah.

987
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:49,880
So you got and what's crazy is all these places are right next to each other.

988
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,960
They're all kind of jammed together.

989
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:57,240
Ferrari World, Sea World, Warner Brothers and then some other.

990
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,840
That's that's not all. There's all kinds of things you've got.

991
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:07,760
You know, why kick your feet up at any one of our spacious

992
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:12,360
Yass Plaza hotels, which are different than the Yass Island hotels.

993
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:14,600
Right. Rent a boat at Yass Marina.

994
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,720
Catch some sun at Yass Beach.

995
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:21,440
Challenge yourself to hit a hole in one at Yass Links.

996
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,880
Shopping and dining are plentiful at Yass Mall.

997
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,400
And to get to all of these places, just climb aboard Yass Express.

998
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,920
Well, did you know there's a Yass annual pass, too?

999
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,400
For everything, for everything, for all things.

1000
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,880
Unlock a year of unlimited fun with your Yass annual pass and enjoy year run

1001
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,480
access to four record breaking theme parks.

1002
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:44,400
Ferrari World, Yass Water World, Warner Brothers World and Sea World.

1003
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,840
I didn't even say Yass Water World.

1004
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,080
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yeah.

1005
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:53,600
So it's the only water park where the water evaporates immediately.

1006
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,160
So, yes, it's dry.

1007
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,160
The pools are dry.

1008
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,400
It's mostly sand there in the morning.

1009
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,800
Yeah. Yeah.

1010
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,560
The fact that there is an annual pass that ties all this together

1011
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,640
because it is all morale.

1012
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,560
Do we end up with something that feels very un-Disney,

1013
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:12,800
which is get a big pass for a bunch of shit.

1014
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,400
And Disney is one of the things.

1015
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,960
Well, they had that SoCal pass.

1016
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,760
Wasn't there like a universal SoCal Disney pass

1017
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,160
where you could kind of get both parks for a while?

1018
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,160
Yeah, there was like a Southern California tour.

1019
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:32,120
It's like you're coming to Southern California to do all the tourism stuff.

1020
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,760
So they have partnered with PO.

1021
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:34,960
They have done things like that.

1022
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,200
So, huh, the version of it.

1023
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,520
But doesn't it? And that speaks to me to kind of the bigger weirdness,

1024
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:45,760
which is like is Disney Abu Dhabi or whatever ends up being called,

1025
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,560
because it may not be the name.

1026
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:52,000
Is it like leagues better than these other things

1027
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
and it blows them out of the water?

1028
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,520
Or is it just one of like because if it's just like

1029
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:04,360
and it's about as good as SeaWorld Abu Dhabi, then that's weird, right?

1030
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:07,240
If it's just kind of like one, like is there a kind of a cheapening

1031
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:12,200
effect, potentially, if this is not truly Disney Sea next level?

1032
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,960
I think it's going to be.

1033
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:16,280
I think it has to be. But I could be wrong.

1034
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,320
I think you got that.

1035
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,040
I think you got pixie dust in your brain again.

1036
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,560
Don't you think it's possible that it's just like a bunch of screens

1037
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,280
that look good in promo videos?

1038
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,360
And then you get there and none of it works.

1039
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,160
And it's all very unpleasant.

1040
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,280
It's possible.

1041
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:31,720
I this is I've made up my own headcanon that like they're like, look,

1042
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:34,360
this isn't doing quite as well, this whole area.

1043
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:39,000
We need like a big, big draw and let's pony up.

1044
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,640
Let's put the money up to make the craziest Disney park.

1045
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,640
That's the number one.

1046
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,480
They're going to do some crazy stuff and then we'll get fly

1047
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:51,280
all the influencers in and they'll show out how crazy this is.

1048
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,360
And this will bring a lot of tourism to the area.

1049
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:57,000
You think that the same influencers

1050
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:01,240
and the same smile makers out there would rave and rave

1051
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:03,360
about whatever they put there?

1052
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,320
Like, why does it need from their end?

1053
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,640
Why does it need to be the best park they've ever done?

1054
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:12,040
Well, I I think that there is a like, I think a lot of people

1055
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:14,440
and I'm not saying that people didn't have a good time at the Starcruiser

1056
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:15,840
because I think they did.

1057
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:19,040
But most people I saw online liked it.

1058
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,600
Most people said it was good.

1059
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:25,160
But I don't know in the videos if it was conveyed to your average person.

1060
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,320
Obviously, that was expensive to do it, too.

1061
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:31,200
I don't know that there was an extra level of like the influencer says it's good.

1062
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,720
And I can see in the video that I need to do this thing.

1063
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,440
So I do think there is an incentive to not only have a bunch of people

1064
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:41,640
say this is good, but also be like, here's the crazy thing

1065
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,000
that you can see in here.

1066
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,680
Here's the crazy point of like ride video.

1067
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,520
And you can see you can't do anything like this in America.

1068
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,800
That's my logic.

1069
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,600
This is I would agree with you if it were universal

1070
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,480
who's been making good on these kinds of things.

1071
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:58,760
That's true. Disney have been big old Laurel wrestlers lately.

1072
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:01,520
Yeah, but I think they could put up anything and people would be raving.

1073
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:06,200
I think you're also miscalculating these people who can attend,

1074
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:09,080
who are, quote unquote, income qualified.

1075
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:12,240
It wouldn't matter to them.

1076
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:17,320
It would be nothing to them to just fly to America or fly to Japan

1077
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,960
to like visit the real Disney. Sure.

1078
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:24,800
I mean, I guess the like people that are like billionaires

1079
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,080
aren't necessarily going to be watching theme park vloggers.

1080
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:33,680
But I do think that they're getting a crack.

1081
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,920
I'm sure the money is insane. Yeah.

1082
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,120
And I'm sure that the reason they're paying up

1083
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:42,680
for Disney is to get a elevated level of quality.

1084
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:44,480
I'm sure that's why.

1085
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:48,160
Because like it's, you know, we've heard that this Warner Brothers world is good,

1086
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,960
but you don't like nothing we've ever seen has been like

1087
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,400
absolutely mind blowing from a video.

1088
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,760
Right. Oh, and it's hard to tell if that Batman ride.

1089
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,960
I mean, the Batman ride looks OK, might be good,

1090
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:02,240
but it's still kind of even hard to tell.

1091
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:05,720
I just think that they're going to have to have some things in here

1092
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:09,720
that are so crazy looking that it drives

1093
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,160
the type of tourism they're looking for here.

1094
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:15,960
Now, maybe I'm being a little naive and thinking thinking that people

1095
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:20,000
won't just come because it's Disney and it's what Disney Park.

1096
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,320
But I don't know.

1097
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:23,960
I think I think the money involved in here

1098
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:29,320
is is making me believe that they are going to do some like crazy stuff.

1099
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:31,880
That's that's my guess. Maybe that's naive.

1100
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:35,400
I don't know. Yeah, but no one's cheaper than really rich people.

1101
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,520
You know, sure.

1102
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:39,000
But then they wouldn't pay for Disney. Huh?

1103
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,040
And they wouldn't have paid for Disney is what I'm saying.

1104
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,400
Yeah, but I think they're paying.

1105
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:47,840
Disney's doing it for the free money and they're doing it for like,

1106
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:52,320
though, we said the reputation with sports washing theme park washing,

1107
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:53,800
whatever washing.

1108
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,200
Well, let's get a guess here.

1109
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,600
What are you are you expecting for like early

1110
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:01,480
California adventure level of like OK-ness?

1111
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:05,560
No, no, but I'm I'm expecting Shanghai.

1112
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,520
Exactly. Well, which seems good.

1113
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:13,320
But well, scenically, it's not Tokyo Disney as far as the layout of that place.

1114
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:18,080
But certainly is some crazy big technological leaps and rides.

1115
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,560
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1116
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,760
That pirate looks incredible. Yeah. Yeah.

1117
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,520
I bet it's I I bet it's like that.

1118
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:29,040
But more of that couple Shanghai Pirates.

1119
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:36,160
I don't know if it's enough to draw people with a hostile climate.

1120
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,720
Everything that like relationships between men and women

1121
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:44,000
that aren't marriage are pretty much banned.

1122
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,360
Women are second class citizens.

1123
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:48,960
Homosexuality is outlawed.

1124
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,120
Like that's so much stuff.

1125
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:54,680
Let alone this is another thing from Human Rights Watch.

1126
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:59,040
The UAE deploys some of the most advanced surveillance technologies

1127
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:03,080
to erasively monitor public spaces, internet activity,

1128
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:06,200
even individuals, phones and computers.

1129
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:11,520
The authorities block and censor content that they perceive to be critical

1130
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:16,400
of the UAE's rulers, government policies and any topic.

1131
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,760
Shit, our UAE listeners are not even going to get this episode.

1132
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,120
Oh, no. It's not going to be.

1133
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:24,680
Well, how powerful is the Patreon paywall?

1134
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:27,800
Maybe like that sounds pretty powerful, but maybe they haven't.

1135
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:32,320
The Patreon paywall is it is probably more secure than what was its signal

1136
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:35,200
that the Trump people were using to do war plans.

1137
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:39,560
Signal is actually a pretty secure messaging website,

1138
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:42,840
so at least they weren't using like WhatsApp.

1139
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:48,040
They want to if they want to go, if they want to trade military secrets

1140
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:51,000
in the comments of our second gate episodes, be my guest.

1141
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,480
That's totally fine.

1142
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,360
As long as you pay us the five dollars.

1143
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,520
Yeah, I'm inspired by Disney's money grubbing.

1144
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:01,640
If that's a secure place, just text emojis of planes and boats to each other.

1145
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,360
Try to code it a little bit for your own purposes.

1146
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,960
Yeah. Besides that, I don't know.

1147
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,840
It'll be a fight. It'll break up the bug main comment.

1148
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:11,320
Make sure to use that comment that that combo.

1149
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:18,680
That's like the emoji fist American flag fire, because that is cool.

1150
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:21,240
That's a that's a bad ass run of emojis.

1151
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:24,800
I don't know what the the goals necessarily are.

1152
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,000
What it looks what success looks like.

1153
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,240
I mean, it's it's interesting because it's just you're trying to figure out

1154
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:34,680
just as a consumer, as a person that's ethical, like what are the rules here?

1155
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:35,960
What are you supposed to do?

1156
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,480
But like you look at this island and it's like

1157
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:42,320
Bill Burr is performing in Yaz Island and Trevor Noah is performing there.

1158
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:43,400
So is that true?

1159
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,480
Yes, it's true.

1160
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,320
Every major act has been right.

1161
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:48,760
It's not as if there has been some like wide.

1162
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,600
We read and not go.

1163
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:51,920
No, the list is.

1164
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,720
By the way, I'm not dismissing the human rights situation.

1165
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:58,840
I'm just saying as a person who's just trying to navigate the world

1166
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:02,360
and navigate, you know, the companies that you pay attention to.

1167
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:03,840
You're like, well, what are the rules?

1168
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:04,360
What do we do?

1169
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,640
It's hard to know what to do because you're like,

1170
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:10,120
nobody knows that Jennifer Lopez is just playing concerts here.

1171
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,640
Like, what is right?

1172
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:14,000
What is so I honestly, I just don't know.

1173
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,040
I don't know anything, really.

1174
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,560
Well, I think you you said the other day when we were talking about it, like,

1175
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:21,920
I think your phrase was like international waters.

1176
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:25,560
Like Bill Burr and Trevor, they get like international.

1177
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:26,960
They can say whatever they want.

1178
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,320
They can do whatever they want because they're rich in fame.

1179
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,520
You mean in there or in general when they're no, not

1180
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,840
I've heard them on podcasts.

1181
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:37,960
I think they say whatever they want here to have big balls.

1182
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,320
Look, comedians are greatest truth tellers.

1183
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:42,400
And we take that very seriously.

1184
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:45,720
I pointed out when you were gone is that that's something you say all the time.

1185
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:46,720
That is. Yeah.

1186
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:50,120
Oh, I'm making fun of us and our peers.

1187
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:51,560
I do.

1188
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:52,920
No, we're not.

1189
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:53,440
I don't know.

1190
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,960
Our truth telling boasts.

1191
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:57,120
No, but I think like, yeah, they don't.

1192
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:01,320
They don't really get for like, yes, Island, they get

1193
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,680
you know, a little more wiggle room.

1194
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:06,880
Sure. But I know that's the draw.

1195
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:07,840
There is just money.

1196
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:11,120
They're not going to like say a couple extra jokes about Trump or something.

1197
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,520
I don't. I think.

1198
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,120
I mean, from what I've I was doing a little bit of research.

1199
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:21,520
And I think there's people who are there, I think, not just for the money, but to

1200
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:25,360
I just I saw this docu series about a guy who's trying to add

1201
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:31,200
a whole lot of hearts to every adventure that he has on Yass Island.

1202
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,480
And that is I'm talking about Kevin Hart.

1203
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:37,680
Yes. If you guys if anyone anyone's been concerned about this place

1204
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,720
or about visiting Abu Dhabi, I think all of your fears might melt away

1205
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:46,680
if you watch the original series that Kevin Hart did for visit Abu Dhabi's

1206
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:48,720
YouTube channel. Oh, my gosh.

1207
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:54,120
Kevin Hart, as we know, is a he's very choosy in his projects

1208
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:55,560
and in his endorsements.

1209
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:59,080
And I know that's a face that's not going to appear next to just anything.

1210
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:03,440
So when I saw that he went to Abu Dhabi

1211
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,880
and that he was going to put his stick his neck out there

1212
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:10,480
and become the world's first chief island officer.

1213
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:14,520
Oh, well, figure out how to heartify everything about Yass Island.

1214
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:17,440
I knew that I could finally trust this place. Sure. Yeah.

1215
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,200
And I there's one that we haven't mentioned of all of the cool stuff

1216
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,640
on Yass Island.

1217
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:27,920
You can go to CLIMB, which is spelled CLYMB.

1218
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,760
That is the it's the biggest wall in the world.

1219
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:34,800
And he went he went to he did all of these things.

1220
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,960
In this video, I'm going to show it's 52 seconds long.

1221
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,280
He was the first chief island officer.

1222
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,560
He hardifies it. He brings a little heart to everything he does.

1223
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:44,080
And he takes it to a whole new Kevill.

1224
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:47,400
Oh, Kevill. You think have a whole new Kevill. Wow.

1225
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:51,080
So just if anybody's been worried about any of this,

1226
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,640
I think this video will shut down everybody's fears.

1227
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:59,360
That's a title card about how he's heartifying

1228
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:03,280
CLIMB Abu Dhabi, because it looks good already.

1229
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:06,840
But what couldn't be better with a little bit of heartification?

1230
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:11,720
Yes, Abu Dhabi hired me to elevate every moment on the island.

1231
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:14,040
But here's the thing. We don't do moments on Yass.

1232
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,240
No, no, we do momentous.

1233
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:19,480
Check out what your chief island officer just want to make sure that landed.

1234
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,400
They don't do moments there.

1235
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,360
And we've said a lot of stuff about this place,

1236
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:26,000
but I want to be very clear. They don't do moments there.

1237
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,680
They do momentous.

1238
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:30,600
Have you guys look me in the eye and tell me you understood what he just said?

1239
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:33,720
I yeah. Well, I can't look you in the eye.

1240
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:35,440
Why are you looking at me in the eye?

1241
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,880
They do momentous there. Kevin Hart told me so.

1242
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,080
He's the chief island officer.

1243
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:40,400
I glance at your eyes for a second.

1244
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,920
Takes it to another Kevill.

1245
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:47,600
Yeah, I know that Jason's with me. He understands.

1246
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:50,360
He could draw me a map, a graph that shows me how Kevill's work.

1247
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:51,160
I just double check.

1248
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:54,760
Did you say they have the world's tallest wall wall?

1249
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:56,880
I think it said that somewhere.

1250
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,080
That's a phrase. That's a phrase.

1251
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:01,520
Building literally build. OK, that's not right.

1252
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:02,720
We'll build it.

1253
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:05,560
They must mean world's largest climbing climate.

1254
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:09,080
Yeah, I would guess because the Burj Khalifa is in the sea.

1255
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:13,680
Yeah, if you if you consider those walls, I think they mean a wall within walls.

1256
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,640
They mean a wall inside walls.

1257
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:16,520
That's what they're saying.

1258
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:19,840
I mean, look, he's he's swole, but he's jacked.

1259
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:21,240
We know he's jacked.

1260
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:22,560
He's tiny, but he's jacked.

1261
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:24,440
He's a rock's best friend.

1262
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:26,960
But he's not going higher than Tommy Cruise.

1263
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:30,400
You know, I'm not sure that he even went on it at all.

1264
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:33,920
But I don't think you have to be on climb to take climb to a whole new Kevill.

1265
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:34,920
OK, good.

1266
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:37,480
Look behind me.

1267
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:42,320
That is crime. Abu Dhabi today in that building is the tallest wall in the world.

1268
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:43,440
And I'm renaming that way.

1269
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:44,960
That is where I got it from. Wow.

1270
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,760
Well, Kevin Hart, it's the tallest wall in the world.

1271
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:53,440
Oh, in that building, which is made of walls, is the tallest wall in the world.

1272
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,680
Wow. That's interesting.

1273
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:58,280
That's a real mind blow that something could be the tallest wall

1274
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:01,200
and also be surrounded by walls that by the definition of walls

1275
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,800
have to be taller than it to fit it in the walls. Right.

1276
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:08,040
Scott, I wasn't doubting that you would hurt, but I was like,

1277
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:10,520
I know someone said the world's tallest wall.

1278
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:11,760
I was starting to doubt.

1279
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:15,000
I was like, did I write something down that was wrong?

1280
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,640
And now I've learned.

1281
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:18,240
OK, no, we've established it.

1282
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,880
It was established that it was not my mistake.

1283
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:20,960
It wasn't Kevin's mistake.

1284
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:21,960
It was no one's mistake.

1285
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:26,640
It's the biggest wall in the universe thing I ever pondered before.

1286
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:29,000
How many views on that?

1287
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:34,000
That says a a completely real one point six million views.

1288
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,200
Wow. That is OK.

1289
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,960
That's I was I was thinking it'd be like five thousand.

1290
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:40,400
This is this is a hit series.

1291
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:45,040
It put that those numbers put it at the number thirty nine.

1292
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:48,080
As far as Kevin Hart episodic series

1293
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:50,360
produced in the last two years goes.

1294
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:51,360
Mm hmm. Mm hmm.

1295
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:53,800
Mount Kevin Manjaro.

1296
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,360
That's something else he's doing.

1297
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:59,720
He is taking things to a whole new Kevil and declaring that climb

1298
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:01,880
is now Mount Kevin Manjaro. Wow. OK.

1299
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:03,760
There's so I've only played half.

1300
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:05,840
That's only in 30 seconds.

1301
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:07,400
How many phrases did we learn?

1302
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,240
How much information did we learn?

1303
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:11,680
This is an exceed this blows Anthony Bourdain out of the water.

1304
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,600
You know, I think Disney has already got a leg up on this

1305
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:21,160
because just talking about this place, I am starting to experience

1306
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:25,760
unreality ish and the world's biggest wall

1307
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:29,680
in Mount Kevin Manjaro is not helping.

1308
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,080
They already if what are they going to do?

1309
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:32,480
They're going to build a new big thunder.

1310
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:34,840
Is that going to beat Mount Kevin Manjaro?

1311
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:36,160
I don't think so.

1312
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,840
And then at the end, they tell you that you can book a vacation

1313
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:40,640
that's hard to beat.

1314
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:45,160
Wow. They've I think every frame of this has a new phrase.

1315
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:49,680
Is something in the other like sort of Kevin Hart commercial verse

1316
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:53,400
he uses or in like his is that or is that like a yeah,

1317
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:54,840
has that been like a long time?

1318
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:56,400
Like if yeah, I don't know.

1319
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,640
I faintly recall that Kevin Hart at one point did stand up comedy

1320
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:03,520
and maybe in that, you know, before he was like an investment broker.

1321
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:07,560
But now, like so in that maybe Kevil was like a running

1322
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:10,280
quote within. I don't know.

1323
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:13,200
Confusingly, he had a special called Kevin Hart presents

1324
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:16,200
the next level, not the next Kevil.

1325
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:19,120
So, OK, not sure. Not sure.

1326
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:23,400
All I know is there is a shot of him that is the same shot

1327
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:27,680
in all 10 episodes of Chief Island Officer, the series that it's all done

1328
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:31,520
in front of the same hotel wall and every in every one of them.

1329
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:34,280
He is committed. He has fresh energy.

1330
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:38,480
They definitely don't start with the energy of him being told, OK,

1331
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:39,880
we got nine more of these to go.

1332
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:41,080
So come on, let's make it.

1333
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:43,600
Yeah, let's keep going.

1334
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:46,840
Yes, I know that we hired me to.

1335
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:50,520
So anyway, I reckon I recommend the whole series later.

1336
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:53,440
I mean, if that one wasn't enough, there's another one where he

1337
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:56,800
actually joins the Justice League.

1338
01:04:56,800 --> 01:05:00,240
He declares that he's going to change the face of funhaving as we know it.

1339
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:01,840
Well, I'm interested in that.

1340
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:02,960
Yeah, I love that.

1341
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,200
That's what he's trying to do, too.

1342
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,880
That's all everybody's trying to do is change the face of funhaving.

1343
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:10,280
He also you guys appreciate this because you're comics guys.

1344
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:14,240
He is he's naming, you're right, Superman and Wonder Woman.

1345
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:17,200
Then he tries to come up with his own name and it's a heart dude.

1346
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:20,560
And then he's like, he's still working on the name.

1347
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,480
OK, so he's not sold on it.

1348
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:25,440
No, but that's what he but he's he's brainstorming again.

1349
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,560
When he was once a standup comedian.

1350
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:31,280
So he changed the face of funhaving

1351
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:34,760
and the rock changed the balance of power in the DC universe.

1352
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:37,640
Here's the reason these guys are so good.

1353
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,800
There is, yes, there's something only they get.

1354
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,800
They are gods amongst men.

1355
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:46,480
Yeah, yeah. And only only by taking things to a new kebel

1356
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,480
can they get experience, any joy.

1357
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:50,800
They've already done everything this world has to offer. Right.

1358
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:56,120
Jason Momoa also did some time as the chief island officer.

1359
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:59,040
Sure. A whole other series of wonders in himself.

1360
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:03,080
Moa Moa was sitting down that road, too, nowadays.

1361
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:06,600
I think, yeah, they better make some room in the car on their road trips

1362
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:10,960
for for any item and any film.

1363
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:15,840
Can I go back to Eiger or is there more Kevin business?

1364
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:17,920
You want to know that's fine.

1365
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:21,440
If after all that, if you want to talk about it, a chief executive officer,

1366
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:24,760
it might seem like a letdown having talked about a chief island officer.

1367
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:26,960
But that's that's fine and fair.

1368
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:31,840
OK, the one thing in the promotional because like on the Disney parks blog,

1369
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:35,400
they they kind of sum up what's coming.

1370
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:39,640
And there's like a three minute video, which is mostly clips

1371
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:42,680
from movies and a lot of marketing gibberish.

1372
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:48,480
But I could not get past Eiger saying this park is going to be authentically

1373
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:51,480
Disney, distinctly Emirati. Yeah.

1374
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:55,560
Because that is just what they said for Shanghai.

1375
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:00,200
This park will be authentically Disney, distinctly Chinese.

1376
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:02,560
We were that is by that a long time ago.

1377
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:07,280
That is so shitty to not come up with a new marketing phrase.

1378
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:09,800
That's so condescending.

1379
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:11,680
And there's also no video.

1380
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:13,280
I think I know why.

1381
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:18,040
There is no video of Eiger speaking Arabic or Mandarin,

1382
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:21,880
probably because there's a lot of hate crime,

1383
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:26,960
racist psychos in America who just loop it nonstop.

1384
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:30,160
I yeah, that is that is very funny.

1385
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:35,880
Authentically, authentically Disney, distinctly Emirati is exactly

1386
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:38,320
the same phrase as I did the last time.

1387
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:39,840
There was an account. I don't know.

1388
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,880
I mean, I follow all these different universal accounts.

1389
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:45,040
And I there's one account that's like was tracking the jet,

1390
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:48,840
like the Disney jet, because you can track private jets online.

1391
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:52,400
And they attract like they were like, oh, you can see that the jet was in

1392
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,520
like Abu Dhabi a lot.

1393
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:56,280
So like, obviously, that's what they were doing.

1394
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:59,120
But then they've also pointed out the jet was in like Texas a lot lately.

1395
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:03,720
They're like, oh, we know that was that.

1396
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:07,960
Oh, that no, that's just where Tesla is in Texas.

1397
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,960
Oh, yeah, there's a lot of it.

1398
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,400
I mean, a lot of things are in Texas.

1399
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:13,000
There were there. Yeah, there could be other reasons.

1400
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,720
There's I would say one million other reasons to go to Texas.

1401
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:21,000
Texas, I just knew it as a home of Tesla and the boring company.

1402
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,760
And oh, well, and the comedy mothership, if that's what you're getting at.

1403
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:27,520
Oh, well, the smile left and right.

1404
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:29,280
Somebody was speculating.

1405
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:32,280
Oh, I mean, because Universal, obviously, is doing is Texas.

1406
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,080
Yeah, perhaps Disney.

1407
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:36,960
So like, could they say, like, you know, this this new Disney

1408
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:41,000
Texas park, hypothetically, would be distinctly Texan to distinctly

1409
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,880
Texas by your cowboy hat.

1410
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:45,200
Yeah. Cowboy hat is definitely there.

1411
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:47,040
Boots cowboy boots.

1412
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:49,520
Maybe Abbott presents him.

1413
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,600
Yeah. Cowboy boots.

1414
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:53,720
Sure. Yeah, I think so.

1415
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:56,880
But I was just trying to imagine that you're going to use this phrase a lot.

1416
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:00,280
And a regulation big piece of straw to stick. Yes.

1417
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:02,080
Yeah. Oh, yeah, absolutely.

1418
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:05,000
Yeah. So they'll be measured like the length that they like it.

1419
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:06,080
Right. Right. Mm hmm.

1420
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:09,600
So it's like 11.5 to 13.5 inches.

1421
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:12,120
The right length of big straw. Yeah.

1422
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:16,160
I wouldn't be so I wouldn't be shocked if this phrase gets dusted off a lot in the future.

1423
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:19,640
I don't know if it's going to be like crazy, like Universal expansion, but we'll see.

1424
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:21,520
I don't know. Yeah.

1425
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:25,160
I think these companies, especially Disney, is like these companies

1426
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:27,040
cannot just make the money they make.

1427
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:29,800
They need to make more and they need to build more.

1428
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:33,640
So but that's also that's a phrase that could apply to everyone.

1429
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:35,680
All companies always. Absolutely.

1430
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:37,560
I'm just saying it's they're they're part of it.

1431
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:42,560
So like I wouldn't be shocked if if Disney, Texas or something is on the table.

1432
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:44,600
Other companies, other countries are on the table.

1433
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:49,360
Texas, Brazil, I think, you know, the was discussed.

1434
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:53,600
Oh, I feel like for a long time in the past, because, you know,

1435
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,800
there's so many Brazilian tour groups that come to Florida.

1436
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:59,280
It's like, what if we build it in Brazil?

1437
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:01,680
Mm hmm. I want to look.

1438
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:03,880
What do I mean? Do I want Disney Schomburg?

1439
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:06,000
Yes. Disney Schomburg, Illinois.

1440
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,280
The build next to Woodfield Mall, a full Disney park.

1441
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,880
And I want it to be distinctly Schomburgian.

1442
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:14,400
I want it to be. Well, how do you make something distinctly Schomburg?

1443
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:18,960
Oh, the pizza is really big pizza, Culver's burgers in the park.

1444
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:22,960
Um, the sausage, Italian sausage,

1445
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:28,000
Italian bears, the Mike Ditka ride, probably.

1446
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:30,480
Or might you haul up like a great moments with Mr.

1447
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:31,880
Lincoln, but it's Mike Ditka.

1448
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:34,320
Oh, which would be pretty good.

1449
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:36,480
I think about it. I'm just kind of meandering.

1450
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:39,040
It's like, yeah, I'm doing any interview with him. Right.

1451
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:41,320
Disney can just have the white socks.

1452
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:44,200
They're like a thread usually.

1453
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,520
Yeah. Yeah. So throw them in with the deal.

1454
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:50,280
I mean, yeah, generally speaking, that's in Chicago proper, but not.

1455
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:55,520
But you can't but you count Ditka for you as opposed to Chicago.

1456
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:59,240
Well, no, I mean, I'm just trying to think of something

1457
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:01,080
that would at least make it this. Yeah, I guess you're right.

1458
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:02,800
It should be more of a local Schomburg hero.

1459
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:03,880
So it should be.

1460
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:06,840
Who's the most famous guy from Schomburg? Is it me? Is it?

1461
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,760
I feel like I need to look that up.

1462
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:11,400
Do you think it's do you think it's even pod?

1463
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,640
Do you think you're in the top 10?

1464
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:16,040
Do you count Robert Downey Jr.'s

1465
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:18,360
producer wife, who went to Schomburg High School?

1466
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:21,440
As being famous, I guess she is.

1467
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:23,640
She's probably married to one of the most famous men on Earth.

1468
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:25,840
So I guess she's been photographed more than you.

1469
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:27,960
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, yeah.

1470
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:29,880
So she's above me.

1471
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:32,640
Let's see a couple of actors who are probably more popular.

1472
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:35,240
Notable people.

1473
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:37,920
Hmm. Somebody somebody named

1474
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,280
Shane Madej from Buzzfeed.

1475
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:43,680
Madej. Yeah, I know Shane.

1476
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:46,520
Let's see. Yeah, there were Susan Downey's in the list.

1477
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:50,360
Kurt Kittner from The Bears and the Falcons.

1478
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:53,000
I don't know. There's not 10 names in this list.

1479
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,760
How many? Maybe you're in the 10.

1480
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:57,400
I could be in the 10. Yeah, I'm number 10.

1481
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:58,840
That's that's fun.

1482
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:00,960
You know, the idea that I would be the top in the top.

1483
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:03,720
Says you're right under the Green River killer.

1484
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:05,160
What?

1485
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:11,760
Pete, Pete Wentz is not from Schomburg, but he's from around there.

1486
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:14,520
This is a weak list. I think I think you're.

1487
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:16,400
Yeah, I think you're good.

1488
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:19,760
I think I'm in the top 10 most famous Schomburgians of all time.

1489
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:21,000
That's pretty cool.

1490
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:24,560
Yeah. Well, you got to be right.

1491
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:26,760
Well, somebody had Mike, I guess.

1492
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:31,200
Yeah. You need the Wikipedia to begin with. Right.

1493
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:33,360
Do you think podcast The Ride is enough?

1494
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:36,120
Or do you like if you were going to like because I feel like some of these people

1495
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:37,680
have two things in the list. Right.

1496
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:42,720
You know, performer, professional Call of Duty player and the CEO of 100 Thieves.

1497
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:45,200
What is your 100 Thieves?

1498
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:47,360
It's a great question. Yeah.

1499
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:50,600
Mansors format, one episode of Mansors.

1500
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:52,880
Mike has Mike has had to bury his answers.

1501
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:55,160
That's right. I know you're not going to ever see that again.

1502
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:59,880
Mansors or just the the mighty

1503
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:02,000
Akron, the work I've done for the mighty Akron.

1504
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:02,680
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1505
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:03,440
Atticus, maybe.

1506
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:05,680
Coiner of the term mighty Akron. Right.

1507
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:07,360
So that's pretty good.

1508
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:10,760
So I think that'll be I really haven't been invited back to the high school.

1509
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:12,400
I don't know if they do that with high school.

1510
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,440
So you get invited back to college.

1511
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:15,640
Mike, you should be.

1512
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:18,440
Disney should commission you to make some phrases

1513
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:20,280
they should commit like what?

1514
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:22,040
Well, you came up with mighty Akron.

1515
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:23,480
Oh, right. Right. In that way.

1516
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:26,600
It seems like mostly they make phrases nowadays.

1517
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,400
They are phrase makers.

1518
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:31,440
Stinkly like smile makers, phrase makers.

1519
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:33,520
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1520
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:34,200
Well, I don't know.

1521
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:36,920
Yeah. Is there some way to

1522
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:40,280
tout Disney Abu Dhabi in an elevated way?

1523
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:43,440
Yeah, I don't know.

1524
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:44,760
How do you how do you phrase it?

1525
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:47,080
How do you sell what you're imagining,

1526
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:49,920
which is the craziest park they've ever done?

1527
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:52,160
I say, check it out.

1528
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:54,960
I say, hey, get a load of this.

1529
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:58,360
I say, hey, whoa, look at that.

1530
01:13:58,360 --> 01:13:59,720
What if you combine a few of those?

1531
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:02,000
Check out a load of this.

1532
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,680
Nobody's ever thought to combine them.

1533
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:04,760
It sounds a little weird.

1534
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:06,560
Yeah. But you do that all the time.

1535
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:07,160
You do. Yeah.

1536
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:10,960
Once you say a compliment to a ride that's very sexual.

1537
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:13,000
Yeah. But when somebody else says that, I don't care for it.

1538
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:14,840
When it comes out of my mouth, it's good.

1539
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:17,680
So if you had just said, check out a load of this, you would have liked it.

1540
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:20,760
If I had said, check out a load of this, it sounds good.

1541
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:22,680
Now that I said it out loud, it sounds good.

1542
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:25,400
You just had to reset it, pretend you didn't hear it from me.

1543
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:27,120
It says it in, yeah, when I say it in my own voice.

1544
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:29,120
Well, then I'll just be the ghostwriter of the phrase,

1545
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:30,960
check out a load of this.

1546
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:34,600
That won't be on my Woodland Hills, California, Notable People section.

1547
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:37,840
Yeah. I'll cede it to you because I'm that kind of a man.

1548
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:43,880
I'm taking it to the next Michael, Michael, Michael, Michael, Michael, yeah.

1549
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:44,600
Carl, Carl.

1550
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,080
Check out a load of this.

1551
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:49,560
Taking it to the next Michael.

1552
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:51,280
And I'll be a Wall Street raider,

1553
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:54,520
so I'll just wait for check out a load of this to really drop.

1554
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:55,960
And then I'll scoop it up.

1555
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:56,960
Check out a load of this.

1556
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:59,440
It's going to drop and scoop it up after it does.

1557
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,320
Oh, no.

1558
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:03,240
Hey, you said it.

1559
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:06,080
I just I just love the phrase.

1560
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:08,320
It sounds better when I say it out loud.

1561
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:11,040
Yeah, it sounds better when I say it out loud.

1562
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:12,480
Most most things do.

1563
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,280
All right. Well, check out a load of this.

1564
