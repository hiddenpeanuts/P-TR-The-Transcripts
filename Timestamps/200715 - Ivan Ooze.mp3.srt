1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,320
I'm just gonna say it's morphin' time.

3
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,280
Welcome to podcast the Ride the Second Gate.

4
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,200
Joining me as always, I'm Mike Carlson by the way,

5
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,960
I'm really screwing this intro up.

6
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,880
I am of course the purple ranger, sorry Scott.

7
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,200
Scott Gairdner here, what color ranger are you?

8
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,880
Orange because I looked at an orange item in front of me,

9
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,200
so therefore orange.

10
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,840
Orange ranger!

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,300
And Jason Sheridan is the what ranger?

12
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,720
I always liked the red ranger because in the original cast

13
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,080
he was named Jason and had a sword,

14
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,240
and then when they asked for more money

15
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,920
they immediately recast him.

16
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,680
Is that what happened?

17
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,560
That is what happened, yes.

18
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,560
Very sad, it's the cruel.

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,320
Hype Saban, what are the worst men in America?

20
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:14,320
Power Rangers famously made very cheaply reusing footage,

21
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,920
and then once it was a huge hit,

22
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,280
some of the actors decided they'd like to get paid

23
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,620
real TV money, and he said no,

24
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:27,220
and fired the ones who were gonna walk away,

25
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,060
and then recast them, and of course like,

26
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,380
idiot kids like me were like, huh,

27
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,380
I like those other characters,

28
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,020
but okay I'll keep watching.

29
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,020
You proved Saban's point.

30
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:45,820
Saban, the company Saban made a lot of our beloved

31
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,880
90s children's entertainment,

32
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,700
but again, just screw job after screw job,

33
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:56,700
made so cheaply, and I'm sure people made a fraction

34
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,780
of what they should have been paid,

35
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:02,740
because just churning out the merchandising too,

36
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,580
merchandising huge for Power Rangers and X-Men.

37
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,300
Right, these people who were on the show

38
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,460
should have made a lot of money for it,

39
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,420
because there was a ton of money to be made,

40
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,800
and they were making, and Power Rangers is still going today,

41
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,900
and they've been in different forms,

42
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,340
there's been many, many different series.

43
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,980
I'm not a huge, I was very into the first two series,

44
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,400
and now I have not followed it since then,

45
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,900
but yeah, it's made so much money,

46
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,000
and I'm sure, I don't actually have the numbers

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,300
of what everyone was making on the first season,

48
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,780
but I'm sure it's just, I'm sure it's like $1,000

49
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,960
an episode, it's criminal, I think it's that low.

50
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,620
And probably for the film as well, I would imagine,

51
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,020
it's just like a favor to them to let them be in a movie.

52
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,020
I would assume, maybe they got a little bit of a bump

53
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,220
because it was gonna be on a bigger screen.

54
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:03,260
But to be clear, and to just cut through,

55
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,380
this episode is not about the Power Rangers in general,

56
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,960
I don't wanna take things off the table,

57
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,740
but I'm not even sure that it's about

58
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,780
the Power Rangers at all.

59
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,540
I think what we need to focus on,

60
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,420
what I'm excited to focus on,

61
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,760
is the villain of Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers,

62
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,180
the movie, and that is Ivan Ooze.

63
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,840
Yes, of course you're right,

64
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,540
Ivan Ooze is not responsible for these problems,

65
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,140
these grievances that we have.

66
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,580
Ivan Ooze is bad, but he wouldn't give all his riches

67
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,820
to the Clinton Foundation.

68
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,620
Right, oh, Bernie Sanders, I hate him.

69
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,700
He would never say that.

70
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,220
Even I have limits.

71
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,460
He seems like a nice man.

72
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,540
I think there's gonna be a lot of Ivan Ooze voice today.

73
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,580
I was thinking that and prepared to do so,

74
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,380
but it's a little in question how you do an Ivan Ooze voice

75
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,140
because it's pretty different.

76
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,340
Yes, that's true.

77
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,860
In every scene, in every line.

78
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,380
Yes, that's a good point as well.

79
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,900
I'm doing the one where he's obviously imitating WC Fields.

80
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,060
That was what I was thinking too, that was my plan.

81
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,900
That seems like the most fun one to do.

82
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,780
Yeah, the Ooze is back.

83
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,060
Just having a ball in this movie.

84
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,380
And I mean, I don't know about you guys, Mike,

85
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,380
I know you said you had a little,

86
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,220
I was all in on Power Rangers for a few seasons.

87
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,980
And when this movie came out,

88
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,940
it was probably one of the highlights of 1995 for me.

89
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:44,540
Yeah, no, I was, I'm in all this garbage,

90
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,340
this kid garbage with robots and monsters, I love it.

91
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,300
It came on the air and I remember thinking,

92
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:55,060
I knew it was not, I knew I was old for it.

93
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:59,500
I knew I was too sophisticated maybe to really enjoy it.

94
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,780
That being said, I loved the monsters, I loved the robots,

95
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,180
and I watched it for a few seasons.

96
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,540
And when this movie came out,

97
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,500
I also was very, very excited about it.

98
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,580
I read a bad review in the newspaper

99
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,420
and I was just upset before.

100
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,500
And then I was like, no, it has to, it should be good.

101
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,180
I'm sure it's good.

102
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,420
And I saw it and I was like, it was good.

103
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,020
And it was, you were completely justified.

104
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,380
100% right, yeah.

105
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,020
Incredible performance.

106
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,140
Have I explained my Power Rangers connection on the show?

107
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,180
I feel like I might be repeating a story, but.

108
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:35,060
No, I feel like you said you had less affection for it

109
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,580
than either of us.

110
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:40,940
What happened was it was starting to build

111
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,540
and everyone around me was getting into Power Rangers

112
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,060
and watched Power Rangers a little bit.

113
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,420
And then there was this one time

114
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,980
where I started explaining it to my parents.

115
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,420
And it's so cool in this red one

116
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,500
and why won't they all have different colors?

117
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,380
And they all do fighting and they're all part of a robot.

118
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,140
And then the robot forms into a bigger robot

119
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,620
and there's toys of all of these things.

120
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,100
And my parents wheels started turning

121
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,660
and then they just laid it out real clear to me.

122
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:12,540
They said, Scott, you just did Ninja Turtles.

123
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:16,140
We just got through Ninja Turtles and that was fun.

124
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,300
And you got all those toys of all the different kinds

125
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,900
and the cartoons and the movies.

126
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,860
Do you have to do this one?

127
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,420
Like, do you think this is so great

128
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,860
and do you really feel like you need to do it?

129
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:35,860
And I thought, and I was like, no, no, that's a good point.

130
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,100
Maybe I don't.

131
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,020
And so my parents just like coldly talked me

132
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,940
out of being into Power Rangers.

133
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,860
They just used logic on me and I listened

134
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,540
because I'm a good boy.

135
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,380
Wow.

136
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,860
I've never, you have not told that story.

137
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,260
It's pretty old showing.

138
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:57,780
That is, yeah, I was much more of the,

139
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,500
listen up everyone, we're doing this now.

140
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,100
This is the way it's gonna be.

141
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,820
This is complimenting the X-Men

142
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,420
and they are all going to fight each other.

143
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:14,220
I will be reasonable in my request.

144
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,740
I was not a kid who had to have all of them.

145
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,380
And I was not a kid who like, I would,

146
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,020
I was like, no, I don't need the big Megazord.

147
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,900
I will take just the Dragonzord.

148
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,260
Well, that's fine.

149
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,460
And that'll be the big Christmas present.

150
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,980
You're talking to a kid who needed all of it.

151
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:37,420
I made, we had had the Dragonzord on a hold from Toys R Us

152
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,020
cause they didn't have it and they put it on hold for us.

153
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,460
And this is a story.

154
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,660
I don't know what was going on in my mom's life at the time,

155
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,140
but she was very, it was a night

156
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,980
where she seems very stressed out.

157
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:50,740
And I very rudely demanded we go to Toys R Us

158
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,460
because they just called saying it had come in.

159
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,700
So I forced my mother to take me at like 8 p.m.

160
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,260
over to Toys R Us to get that Dragonzord

161
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:03,060
cause I was so obsessed and I was so excited about it.

162
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,580
I'm so rudimentary.

163
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,980
I don't know what a Dragonzord is.

164
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,860
I was so hard out when my parents, what's a Dragonzord?

165
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,020
Well, so the Dragonzord is Tommy the Green Ranger's zord

166
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,300
and it's sort of separate from the other zord.

167
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,140
So the Megazord-

168
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,580
You gotta, wait, wait, wait, wait.

169
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,420
Let's back up.

170
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,260
What's a zord?

171
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,100
I don't know what a zord is.

172
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,540
Okay, okay.

173
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,820
Let's establish some language.

174
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:28,420
So the Power Rangers, like the core five Power Rangers

175
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,440
are like red and then they have a dinosaur

176
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,340
that's affiliated with them.

177
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,780
Or like, I guess Mastodon is not a dinosaur,

178
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,540
but like, you know, when they put up the,

179
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,820
like those coins with the little communicator,

180
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,660
whatever you call it.

181
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,500
It's not a communicator.

182
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,340
It's a-

183
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,180
Sure.

184
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,660
Well, and that's the, those are the robots

185
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,220
they individually inhabit.

186
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,940
They're all based on different creatures

187
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,860
and then they all form into one.

188
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,620
So they each have their own little robot

189
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,660
that forms into the big Megazord.

190
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,820
Then they introduce Tommy the Green Ranger

191
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:03,220
and he had a separate zord called the Dragonzord.

192
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,060
And then that thing could combine with the Megazord as well

193
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,020
and make a bigger thing.

194
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,420
It would make armor.

195
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:13,140
It would make armor that would surround the Megazord.

196
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:13,980
Right.

197
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:18,980
And then there was a third zord called Titannus, I believe,

198
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:24,620
which was like a white kind of a dinosaur robot thing.

199
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:29,100
And then that would form on top of the mix of Megazord,

200
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,580
Dragonzord would form on top of this other zord

201
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,100
and make this Ultrazord.

202
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,020
I'm not gonna say that my parents were wrong.

203
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,100
I'm not sure that they were wrong.

204
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,140
I think I'm siding with them more than ever.

205
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,300
Well, you're a parent now.

206
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,140
So I think you're, you may be especially,

207
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,980
you could see the writing on the wall of like,

208
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,980
when does this end?

209
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,420
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

210
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,340
At least we have the internet now too,

211
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,860
where like you can scrounge this stuff together.

212
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:00,860
Like this was the start of the like toy, the toy, you know,

213
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,860
the toy mania that you saw in like Power Rangers toys

214
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,380
and Tickle Me Elmo and Furbies, Tamagotchis.

215
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,860
Like I feel like I could be wrong.

216
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,860
I know Cabbage Patch dolls were really big too,

217
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,900
but in my mind, this is the start.

218
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,660
Scott, we should also explain to you

219
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:24,540
how Power Rangers still gets made to this day.

220
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,980
Well, I know some of this.

221
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,620
I know that it's, you know, the films,

222
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,260
not with the actors who do the dialogue,

223
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:35,380
but it's done with like stunt actors in another country.

224
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:40,380
Yeah, so it started in Japan as a show called Super Sentai.

225
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,460
And then what would happen in America

226
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:45,060
was they would take the action footage

227
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:48,620
and then they would reconfigure it, dub over it.

228
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,260
And then they would film like connecting scenes

229
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:54,380
of the characters and totally change the stories.

230
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:59,380
And this has been going on for over 20 years.

231
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,820
No, how long?

232
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,660
Since like-

233
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,500
Yeah, over 20 years.

234
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,340
Over 20?

235
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,340
Okay, yeah.

236
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,100
So, and they have to do this every time.

237
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,740
So like, if you see what the current Sentai show is in Japan,

238
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,660
you'll probably, it's like, oh, okay,

239
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,780
the Zords are trains now.

240
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:18,020
So in a few years, you'll know the American one,

241
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:22,100
they'll have to justify its trains.

242
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:22,940
It's like-

243
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,340
And in our case in America, at least in, you know,

244
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:29,860
when we were kids, the filmed in America,

245
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:34,460
connective tissue scenes was done with a sheen of

246
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:39,460
saved by the bell lights, broader than broad sitcom acting.

247
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:44,940
I'm not sure any two actors that have been broader

248
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,620
in front of cameras than the people who played bulk and skull.

249
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:53,620
Who are still the dumb bullies who were, who bumbled around.

250
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:58,060
I believe bulk is still around on the new series.

251
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,940
Tommy still around a lot too.

252
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,780
Really?

253
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:05,500
He's also like, he does MMA as well.

254
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,780
Yeah, other characters will come back sometimes.

255
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:12,260
The movie filmed, like the movie is original.

256
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:15,660
The movie is original in the fandom circles,

257
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,140
it's apparently known as alternate canon,

258
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:21,820
meaning it is not directly tied into the TV show.

259
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:26,020
It kind of runs parallel to the like second, third season.

260
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,740
That's why you have the cast.

261
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:31,620
But that's why Ivan Ooze is exclusive to this movie.

262
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,500
Does not show up on television,

263
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,460
which is a shame because he's great.

264
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,820
Yeah, it seems like I'm not so much of a fan

265
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,660
of the broader thing,

266
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,020
but I imagine it makes this movie very special.

267
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:46,780
That there's this one off who wasn't made less special

268
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:51,780
through, you know, duller day to day

269
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,100
TV appearances.

270
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:53,940
Right.

271
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,940
Yeah, although it did drive me insane in the movie

272
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,540
because they used like the Power Rangers whipped out

273
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:03,860
like some handheld weapons that do not exist in the TV show.

274
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,500
And I was as a kid, I was like, the hell is that?

275
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,420
Why does she have a jump rope

276
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,100
that she can launch at someone?

277
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,260
Like that's weird.

278
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,140
I remember being a little confused

279
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,780
because they shot the movie thing in Australia.

280
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,620
And I remember going,

281
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,860
that's not what Angel Grove looks like.

282
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,540
Angel Grove.

283
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,740
Looks like, yes, as Scott was saying,

284
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:27,140
the saved by the bell set and then like a park playground

285
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,940
and outdoor scenes from Griffith Park.

286
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:34,860
Yeah, I think it was largely shot in Valencia is what I saw.

287
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,180
And if you knew, which is the city that Magic Mountain is in.

288
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,740
And it's a very that's like a city with no skyscrapers,

289
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,860
essentially, it's very suburban.

290
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,220
So then weird to see this city with, you know,

291
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,180
with a huge observation deck with the with the CN tower.

292
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:55,020
And a lot most of this movie is in this one pit.

293
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,180
Yes, 40 percent.

294
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,540
Yeah, it doesn't feel like Valencia whatsoever.

295
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,900
Yeah, I was confused as a child, but I was willing to go with it.

296
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:08,740
Also, CG, so much CG in this movie, which I'm sure we'll get into.

297
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,660
And I loved it.

298
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,140
Well, which is sort of what some of what we talked about

299
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,140
when this came up before.

300
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:20,340
I this was so long ago because we're doing this

301
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,940
because it came up in another episode.

302
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,620
I don't remember why you brought this up before, Mike.

303
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:27,780
I don't even I'm pairing someone to I have a news.

304
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,380
Oh, yeah. What was it?

305
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,460
Because I think I was specifically referencing the scene in the movie

306
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:37,220
where I have a news dresses up as like kind of a huckster at a carnival.

307
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:42,260
And I can't remember why it was it was it

308
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,780
light magic pixies is that why it's very possible.

309
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,260
I actually this is one of those where I just don't think I'm going to remember.

310
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,300
I don't think so either.

311
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,900
I don't I know we in an episode you exposed me to Ivan who's for the first time

312
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,100
because I I stopped watching by the time the movie came out.

313
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,860
And I was so instantly smitten.

314
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,740
The image that you sent, which is rare, because usually when you guys

315
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,020
are texting me photos during episodes, it's something horrifying

316
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:14,540
and skin crawling that 85% of the audience loves and thinks is cute.

317
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:19,620
But in this case, I fell in love with Wizard Ivan who is so quick.

318
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:24,260
I've been dying to do this episode, and I was delighted by my viewing of this film.

319
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,700
My first viewing of the movie.

320
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,100
What how how long ago is next year?

321
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,980
Any 25 years after it came out?

322
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,580
Mm hmm. I am interested.

323
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:36,660
I I thought, yeah, as long as I have a news wasn't a baby,

324
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,580
I thought you would like him.

325
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:44,980
Shockingly, with me shockingly, not a baby, because he takes on a lot of forms.

326
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,220
He does not become a baby.

327
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,860
Yeah, yeah, he is a shape shifter.

328
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,740
It's kind of weird.

329
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:54,500
You don't see any sort of it seems like a move they could have done.

330
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:59,220
And I think guys, just imagine what this movie, this movie's vibe,

331
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,820
what how they would have portrayed a baby Ivan ooze.

332
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,500
I think it's guaranteed that you guys would think it was cute

333
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,180
and I would think it was weird.

334
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,740
I think there's a good chance you're correct.

335
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,660
It would depend if he really like so.

336
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,100
So we haven't even really for anyone who doesn't know what we're talking about

337
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,300
and doesn't want to Google it.

338
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:21,460
He is like a purple man with like almost like kind of claw,

339
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:24,820
like twisted little claws coming out of different parts of his head.

340
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:29,060
I was having trouble figuring out how to describe what he looks like.

341
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,620
Yes, he's very purple. There's definitely horns.

342
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:38,940
He has a like two swirling horns that swirl into a point on his chin,

343
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,860
like where a beard like a devil's beard would be.

344
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,500
And then he's just very craggy.

345
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,100
And I called them like flesh thorns.

346
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,180
That seems like what's all over his head.

347
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,940
Flesh thorns. That's very good.

348
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:55,860
Yeah, I mean, he's he's he's not dissimilar to like a Star Trek alien,

349
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:00,780
but he is a little bit more like, I don't know, it's a little more even aggressive,

350
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:04,500
I guess, because he's like bright purple and it's a good design.

351
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,900
I do believe that that's it's cool.

352
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,660
It's a cool design.

353
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,540
I think he looks great. Absolutely.

354
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,180
I think the costume's good.

355
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,580
He's got a lot of stuff going on.

356
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:18,780
And as and as we keep implying, the performance is good.

357
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:23,140
This is about as good of a scenery chewing

358
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,220
90s kids movie villain as you're going to find.

359
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:30,100
Yeah, he he almost deserves to be in like a better movie.

360
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,540
Yeah, like, yes, good point.

361
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,420
He should have been I'm trying to think what where he would fit

362
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,220
in a better what better movie it would be.

363
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:42,660
But like, I mean, he would like a like he could be in like Star Wars or something

364
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,820
or I mean, he should Star Trek, honestly, is probably perfect for him.

365
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,460
Yeah, this this is you could just plunk this character

366
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:55,940
and performance and put it on next gen and like for for five episodes.

367
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,140
I don't think you'd bat an eyelash.

368
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,620
Yeah, I think I know.

369
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:04,220
I think I think maybe we could like like memory hole this for people

370
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:07,460
and just like start acting like he was on five episodes.

371
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,700
And people would be like, oh, yeah, I think I remember that.

372
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,660
Can we talk about the actor for a second?

373
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,500
Yes, sir.

374
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,740
He's a guy named Paul Freeman.

375
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:22,420
And I had written that name down and I knew he had done a bunch of roles.

376
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:27,860
But I did not until I just double checked it right before we started recording.

377
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,700
And I was like, oh, my God, he's that guy.

378
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,860
He's the other archaeologist.

379
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,020
He's Renee. Yeah.

380
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,100
Is it Belac Beloc from Raiders?

381
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,940
Yeah, the French guy in the white suit who's always snake and indie.

382
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,660
Yeah. Yeah, he's great. Mm hmm.

383
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,900
He's great. This is so funny.

384
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,220
OK, apparent. This is a quote for the L.A. Times.

385
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:52,940
They describe as one of Britain's best regarded actors,

386
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:56,340
classically trained with stints at the Royal Shakespeare Company

387
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,780
and the National Theatre.

388
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,220
Yeah, as soon as this movie was done,

389
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,780
he went back to the British theater to play Prospero in The Tempest.

390
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,620
Yeah.

391
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,900
You went straight from that to this, and you could find

392
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,060
snooty British theater reviews that are like now he was just in the

393
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:19,620
Power Rangers movie, yet he manages to pull off a decent performance.

394
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:24,020
They were. Yeah, they don't get the artistry of Ivan who's.

395
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,340
I mean, he's so committed.

396
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,780
I just think he's all in on this role.

397
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,300
Yeah, he's really good.

398
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:35,740
Maybe I should maybe I'll play a little taste here.

399
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,060
Let me remember how to do this on on the zoom.

400
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:44,660
The this this is the introduction to his character.

401
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,940
You guys see in video there? Yeah. Yes. Great.

402
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,340
OK, so just just so you get a sense of of his vibe.

403
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:54,860
And this is the this is when the Power Rangers meet him.

404
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,100
I guess it's not his introduction to the movie.

405
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:03,740
He's already met the typical Power Rangers villains, Rita Repulsa and Lord Zed.

406
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:09,500
They've awakened him from an egg that he's been in for thousands of years.

407
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,700
But this is when he meets the Power Rangers and they have just run into

408
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,180
a security guard who seems a little suspect.

409
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:20,660
And then he morphs into the man who will introduce himself.

410
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,820
Oh, gross.

411
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,900
Too kind.

412
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,260
Allow me to introduce myself.

413
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:37,020
I'm the galactically feared, globally reviled, universally despised.

414
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:40,380
They call me Ivan.

415
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:44,100
Well, pack your bags, because we're sending you right back where you came from.

416
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,900
This scene, I think, is important and illustrates a lot

417
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:56,380
because you get a sense from that of how fun he is

418
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:02,540
and how comparatively flat the Power Rangers actors are.

419
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:07,140
It's like he just dives in and it's this huge performance.

420
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,700
I was green goblin as you might say.

421
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:13,060
And then like, well, pack your bags, because you're going back where you came from.

422
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,460
This guy could not be more sedate.

423
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,020
I think that's the Red Ranger.

424
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:21,700
And not only that, but it's so he like points his arm

425
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:26,300
way out in a very stiff way and his pointing finger is out of focus.

426
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:29,740
Which that's kind of par for the course for this movie.

427
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:33,260
This is like things that are very well done and other things where they're like,

428
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:34,940
let's just get through it.

429
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,300
Let's get it done.

430
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,660
Like, hey, do you want me to do another take of my line?

431
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,220
No, no, no, it doesn't matter. Let's keep going.

432
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,100
We got to keep going.

433
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,060
We're going to leave. They start filling up this pit in two days.

434
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,820
We got to get out of here.

435
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:52,820
It's that that really is the contrast throughout the movie.

436
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,460
God bless these actors.

437
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,420
They're great and fun and fine.

438
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:01,380
And I think work well on a syndicated type television show.

439
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,940
But something about you,

440
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:07,660
put you film them with a film camera and put them next to a Shakespeare level actor.

441
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,100
And the contrast is clear.

442
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,500
Yes, that's true. I mean, I think

443
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,300
I think of all the Power Rangers actors, I think the

444
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,740
Amy Jo Johnson was the Pink Ranger, was on Seventh Heaven, I believe.

445
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,620
She she is Canadian and Felicity.

446
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,300
Was it Felicity? Am I wrong? Yeah, maybe it's Felicity.

447
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,660
It's Felicity.

448
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:33,340
And then she had a career in on like Canadian TV shows.

449
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,940
So, yeah, they're very much like T.

450
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,420
I don't want to say this is insulting, like TV actors, as you're saying.

451
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:44,180
And then, yes. And then you have like a man who's

452
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:48,420
been entertaining thousands live for years.

453
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,700
He's trained.

454
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,740
And here he comes.

455
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,860
And I think that probably just like do whatever you want.

456
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,860
Do the lines however you want. We don't care.

457
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,020
I think you're right.

458
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:05,140
And as we noted, you know, that voice that we just heard is very W.C.

459
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,860
Fields, as Mike said at the top.

460
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,820
But it changes throughout.

461
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,780
Sometimes he's more British than other times.

462
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,700
It's all over the map.

463
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:17,660
And he I found an interview where he justifies it in an in an acting sense.

464
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:22,300
He he says that in the first script, there was even more shape shifting going on.

465
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,300
Like what just happened where he was a security guard and then he turns

466
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,340
into I have a news. I think that happened left and right.

467
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:32,620
So his take before the script changed a bunch was, well, I should just do

468
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,580
my lines different every time.

469
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,140
It was like a choice he made.

470
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:40,300
Like, let me just be all over the map because they can't pin this guy down.

471
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,940
We don't know. You know, we don't know his vibe exactly.

472
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,740
I mean, that makes sense.

473
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:49,860
And actually, his interviews revealed something else,

474
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:53,260
which is perhaps a good thing that changed about it, which is that he,

475
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,860
you know, in that case, he was just kind of like a white security guard.

476
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,460
I think that that's that's regular Paul Freeman.

477
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,900
But he says in the first group, he read that he would morph it

478
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,860
from being other things such as a woman or a black man.

479
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,420
Oh, my goodness.

480
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:11,740
It is probably for the I don't know what their plan was with any of that.

481
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,820
But the idea of that scares me.

482
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:17,100
So I'm glad, glad they cut some of that morphin.

483
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,740
Yeah, that sounds like a good call.

484
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,780
Probably. Yeah, I miss some bullets there.

485
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:27,380
The I think the voice changing so much is also justified in

486
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:32,340
just how powerful he like his list of powers online

487
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:39,100
are shape shifting, liquefaction, shrinking materialization.

488
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,580
He can create simple objects out of nothing.

489
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:49,300
Hypnosis, lightning, henchmen generation and immense durability.

490
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,900
He really is just everything.

491
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,020
It's all the things.

492
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:58,700
It's just everything because not only does he make ooze men from lightning,

493
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:03,060
he makes Tengu warriors, which are weird bird men.

494
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,100
And he like

495
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:10,420
towards the end of the movie, he's created these

496
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:15,180
these big robot beings that seem to be like they are.

497
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:19,300
As with the Tengu war, he creates life like all the time constantly.

498
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,460
But he makes these big robot creatures that seem to be autonomous,

499
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,700
like they work on their own.

500
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:28,580
But then the Power Rangers weaken them and he fills them back with life by.

501
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:34,580
I'll describe it as a missing himself into the center of the robots.

502
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:38,060
He like becomes a big purple worm

503
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,900
through very 90s CGI,

504
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:45,140
injects himself into the middle of the robots and now they're alive again.

505
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:51,900
And the robots take on his face as opposed to their previous robot face.

506
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:55,340
So he changes metallic structure also.

507
00:25:55,940 --> 00:26:01,300
Yeah, I read his zords are I had never seen this term before.

508
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,100
Ectomorphicons.

509
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,140
Mike, did you come across the word?

510
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,660
Oh, yeah, I have it written down right here.

511
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:13,460
Morphicons are the evil monsters.

512
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,500
Yeah, I have. Where did it go?

513
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,980
It was a school of Scorpotron or something.

514
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:22,020
And Hornet or Hornet or there it is.

515
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:22,900
Yeah. Yeah.

516
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:26,140
Scorpotron and Hornet or

517
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,860
amazing words.

518
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,980
We're new. Good words.

519
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,140
Yeah. And those were new.

520
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:33,300
We had never we had not seen those characters before.

521
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,100
We had not seen those.

522
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,420
And the ninja zords were new, although

523
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:41,660
in some form get worked into the TV show,

524
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,220
because like in the movie, the Power Rangers do get ninja powers

525
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:50,900
in the TV show, but not from the woman they get them from in this

526
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,820
from a giant blue guy named Ninjor.

527
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,460
OK, so they don't.

528
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:01,060
Scott, Scott, they don't get them from Dulcea.

529
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,700
The warrior woman in this movie,

530
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,060
they get them from Ninjor.

531
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,260
OK, OK.

532
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:13,100
You know, Dulcea, now you mention, I'm glad we're mainly talking about

533
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:17,340
Ivan who is and not the rest of the movie because the scenes with Dulcea,

534
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:20,580
who's sort of a proto Wonder Woman.

535
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,580
Like, how would you describe what is she?

536
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:27,780
She's kind of a Xena like warrior woman.

537
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,820
Yes, yes, yes.

538
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:33,300
Yeah, that very 90s depiction

539
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:38,140
of an ancient goddess that mainly involves like a leather bikini.

540
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,700
And that

541
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,340
it was a pretty illuminating

542
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:48,300
behind the scenes that I watched of this movie that revealed that

543
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:53,140
they shot for a long time with Mariska Hargitay

544
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:57,980
in that role, who then was let go for unclear reasons.

545
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:02,220
I she tells the story on Seth Meyers

546
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:05,340
and says that it was to do it had something to do with scheduling,

547
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:08,260
that she wanted to go home for Christmas and they had her locked.

548
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:11,660
And then just because of that, they were like, no, you're out.

549
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,220
And they re-filmed everything.

550
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:16,140
But the director says that all the scenes were bad and not necessarily

551
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,780
because of her, like they were sort of poorly designed.

552
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,540
They were so instructional and involved, no fighting.

553
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,860
And kids were getting bored.

554
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,700
So they just yanked it all.

555
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,820
I think she got some of the stink on her of the scenes being bad.

556
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:31,540
So one of TV's most successful actresses, Mariska Hargitay,

557
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,820
not in this film.

558
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:37,780
I still if the whole idea was to make those scenes more interesting,

559
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:40,820
I was bored as a 34 year old.

560
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,820
So I think we should.

561
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:46,140
I think what we should do now is because it's very successful.

562
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:50,100
Campaigns have been happening to get different cuts of the movie released

563
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,540
of movies released.

564
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:54,060
Let's release the Mariska Hargitay cut

565
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,500
of the Power Rangers movie. Let's get this going.

566
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,620
I would like to see.

567
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:03,860
And in the in the world of no in quarantine world

568
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,580
where nothing's going to get shot for a long time, this is all we have

569
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:11,140
is things that are long in the can that can be re-edited and slapped together again.

570
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,620
Yeah. So yeah, release the Hargitay cut.

571
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,260
Release the Hargitay cut.

572
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,340
Hashtag, let's get this going.

573
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:21,860
It's too bad this is a Patreon episode because it'll be a smaller audience

574
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,060
to get this army built.

575
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,740
Sure. Maybe they're more motivated.

576
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,820
That's true. That's true.

577
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,820
And we can spread it.

578
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:30,580
We can spread it to the to the general audience as well.

579
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:35,580
There's a ton of like really produced photos of her.

580
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,820
They show them all in her Seth Meyers interview.

581
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:41,140
And I like this is like an Eric Stoltz situation and Back to the Future.

582
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,860
This might be one of the bigger

583
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:45,820
they shot a ton of firings and then dumped it all.

584
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,820
Maybe there's there's ever been.

585
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,180
Wow. They should also release the Stoltz cut.

586
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,580
How huge would that be if they let us see some?

587
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,740
There are. Oh, my God.

588
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,980
You've seen a little of it, right?

589
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,220
Yeah, just like silent shot.

590
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:02,820
I don't think I've ever seen him speaking lines as Marty McFly.

591
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,060
I think there are scenes online. I could be wrong.

592
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,380
Let me look. I think maybe I think I've seen.

593
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:12,220
He's in a different outfit or is he in the same outfit or is he in leather?

594
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:15,820
Is that right? Is he in like all black instead of like the puffy vest?

595
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,060
Maybe more often. That sounds right.

596
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,660
Maybe. I can't remember if I'm just misremembering.

597
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,300
I've never.

598
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:26,580
Look myself. I've never seen him speak as Marty.

599
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:30,060
I mean, I'd like to release anything that's in a can anywhere.

600
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,900
Put it out. I'm just thinking of maybe the footage because they did show

601
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,300
footage in those like behind the scenes things.

602
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,900
I'll look it up later.

603
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,820
And then, of course, that's also a conspiracy theory that I like.

604
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:44,820
I don't like for poor Eric Stoltz is that they were just they used him

605
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,820
to kill time until Michael J.

606
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:49,900
Fox could be out of his family ties commitments.

607
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,380
Oh, my God.

608
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:55,220
And that they added then they edited around Stoltz to make him look bad

609
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,700
to show the studio that they needed Michael J.

610
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,100
Fox for six months.

611
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,620
It was a six month ploy. Was it six months?

612
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,940
I think it was a lot.

613
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:08,380
Maybe not. I think it was like I think it was like a month and a half or two months.

614
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:11,740
I think maybe some of the six weeks I could be six months.

615
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,020
Six months is crazy.

616
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,420
I don't know if the whole movie took six months.

617
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:21,060
Well, speaking of releasing things that have been trapped for a long time,

618
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:24,500
that's kind of the story with Ivan Use.

619
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:29,940
He is he's in an egg that is in that happens to be in this construction

620
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,860
pit where the majority of the movie takes place.

621
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:38,140
He is explained by Zordon,

622
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:42,500
who is the mentor figure to the Power Rangers and kind of an ancient being.

623
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,580
His backstory is explained.

624
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,820
And I'll do it sort of in Zordon voice.

625
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:53,380
Six thousand years ago, a morphological being named Ivan Use ruled

626
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,420
the world with a reign of terror.

627
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,820
So he's like this.

628
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:02,620
Ivan Use and Zordon have old beef going way back.

629
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:06,500
And it seems I think Zordon trapped him in this egg.

630
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,020
But now the other villains are releasing him.

631
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:12,860
So he's swearing vengeance and he goes and destroys the command center

632
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:17,420
where Zordon communicates with the Power Rangers and then wreaks greater

633
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,860
havoc on this on the earth.

634
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:22,140
But first, Zorda, his eyes is revenge is set on Zordon.

635
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:26,540
Right. So because he takes out the Power Rangers base and he takes out Zordon,

636
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:30,340
who's in case you don't know, Zordon's like just the floating head in the like.

637
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,020
I don't know what you would call it.

638
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,820
Like it's not it's like a tube.

639
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:37,260
It's like a giant. It's very it's very Wizard of Oz.

640
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,220
Yeah. Kind of projected.

641
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,900
So that's so that stops

642
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:47,220
the Power Rangers from sort of having access to their regular powers as well.

643
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:52,860
Yeah. And there's something in there that I sort of got caught on

644
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:56,460
that I just want to explore a little bit, which is that, you know,

645
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:01,020
they have this ancient conflict and the conflict happened 6000 years ago.

646
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:05,420
6000 years ago is pretty specific.

647
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,620
That's not that long ago.

648
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,780
Oh, why have I heard that number before?

649
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:15,420
I don't know. Oh, I have heard six thousand before.

650
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:21,060
Oh, isn't that what people isn't that you track back to the.

651
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:26,300
Like creationists think the earth is only 6000 years old.

652
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,500
Oh, weird.

653
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,940
Is this from a creationist point of view?

654
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,140
I don't know that.

655
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:37,180
Is that implying that Ivan Ooze and Zordon were like

656
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:41,300
warring around the time of Christ or that they are?

657
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:44,540
Or wait, if this is the beginning of man or sorry,

658
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,500
maybe they are God and Satan.

659
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,900
Oh, yeah.

660
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:56,660
It could be. And the Power Rangers, the power Rangers are Christ

661
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,260
because they're sort of the children

662
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:03,980
serving the greater power that Zordon is sort of leading them on.

663
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,780
And it's sort of the eternal fight between God and Satan,

664
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:11,380
because obviously they had they've had conflicts over such a great span of time.

665
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,060
It'll never really end.

666
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:17,660
Yeah. Maybe I've a news morphed into the snake in the Garden of Eden.

667
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:20,100
Oh, man. That's 100 percent what happened.

668
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,620
He looks like a devil.

669
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,260
I mean, he's he's a devil guy.

670
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:28,620
Ivan Ooze also alludes to the fact that, oh, like Zordon,

671
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:33,100
Zordon, you're a teenager is like, yeah, like, like that seems to be a common thing, too.

672
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,820
Zordon always recruits some kids to do his dirty work.

673
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,260
Yeah, this is sort of an odd.

674
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:42,580
That's what's what's the phrase.

675
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,500
He's not to call to mind too dark of a thing.

676
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,940
Oh, I don't know.

677
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:49,020
I don't know what you're trying to think of.

678
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,820
The what's what is Michael Jackson do?

679
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,780
Oh, grooming. Oh, yes.

680
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:57,700
Zordon is grooming the

681
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,180
not to get to not to get too dark.

682
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,420
Meanwhile, the darkest one of the dark.

683
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,140
Yeah, sorry.

684
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:06,220
Lots of us try to avoid saying that, yeah, we're already dealing

685
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,260
with a very dark character.

686
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,180
I have a news. I didn't want to say the darkest character, Michael Jackson.

687
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,860
They do have to deal.

688
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,500
They do eventually deal with this.

689
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,220
I don't know the full solution,

690
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:19,580
but I think after 20 years of Power Rangers,

691
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:22,140
which I believe Disney owns now, of course,

692
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,820
or did for a while, I forget.

693
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,700
But they they did like

694
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:33,900
at some point go like, by the way, all Power Rangers seasons are canon

695
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,020
and they're all back for one.

696
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:40,580
But like there's there's an episode where like every Red Ranger

697
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:43,340
comes back for a big fight.

698
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,860
Oh, oh, they all.

699
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:47,660
Yeah, which sort of this things like that in Turtles where they all

700
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:50,300
multiple types all hang.

701
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:54,780
I believe I believe Hasbro owns Power Rangers right now.

702
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,460
OK, at least it did own it briefly.

703
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,500
I believe that's right.

704
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,980
But I 2018 Hasbro purchased it.

705
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,900
OK, yeah, because all this Bond stuff,

706
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:07,100
Big Bad Beetle, Borg's, V.R.

707
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:11,100
Troopers, that all falls under load of crap.

708
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:15,060
We should we should probably do a Big Bad Beetle, Borg's episode,

709
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,060
because it's got that weird guy who looks like Jay Leno.

710
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,900
Oh, yeah. Oh, that's right.

711
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,940
That covers so good. Yes. Yes.

712
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:25,180
Yeah, I would love to.

713
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:28,060
Can I say something else on this 6000 years point?

714
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:31,020
Yeah, if we aren't if we aren't

715
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:34,420
using the creationist point of view and we're going by

716
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:38,620
like the generally agreed upon is this historian timeline.

717
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:42,340
Like it just feels to me like a sort of like kind of like setting

718
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,700
Tomorrowland in 1986.

719
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:48,180
It's like a little too close to because 6000 years ago.

720
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,620
There's there's a lot going on.

721
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,900
It's really specific.

722
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:55,700
Like I was like, what was the earth on 4000 B.C.?

723
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:59,420
We're talking about the it's the copper age.

724
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:03,260
You're seeing like wheeled carts for the first time.

725
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,660
Plows are are getting used.

726
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:11,260
The potter's wheel was invented around this time in China.

727
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:15,180
The Yangshou culture is is in effect.

728
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:18,660
You know, people are in huts and eating millet.

729
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:23,460
And, you know, under the backdrop of all this is all under the shadow

730
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:27,460
of a purple devil man who sounds like W.C.

731
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:30,620
Fields, who controls all of it.

732
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:33,300
And and and this is also this is pre,

733
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:37,380
you know, civilizations all traveling and meeting each other.

734
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,740
So so Ivan Ooze is in charge.

735
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:43,700
And you've got the copper age over in Europe and Yangshou in China.

736
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:47,460
And then California, which is where Angel Grove is, where he was

737
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,260
ended up being trapped in an egg.

738
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:52,300
That's like just a little bit of indigenous culture.

739
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:56,620
You maybe got some, you know, you've got like indigenous peoples,

740
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,060
you know, trading spears and shells.

741
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:02,380
And then every once in a while, this purple man shows up

742
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:05,060
and like steals their shells.

743
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,340
But then like, I got to go, I got to go check on.

744
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,100
Hey, don't worry about that.

745
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,660
There ain't nobody else. I just got to go see.

746
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:15,660
So he's keeping the different nations separate,

747
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,820
but controlling it all at the same time.

748
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,180
It's really complicated. Wow.

749
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:21,100
I never thought of that, Jason. Sorry. Go ahead.

750
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:26,060
I was going to say, and he he helps place it time wise about he.

751
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,780
There's a quote where he says, oh, the things that I have missed.

752
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:33,740
The Black Plague, the Spanish Inquisition, the Brady Bunch Reunion.

753
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:37,140
So like he's not only aware of the Brady Bunch,

754
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:39,980
he's aware of the later reunion special.

755
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:44,620
Yeah, not only which I don't know why he finds that so egregious.

756
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,700
The Brady Bunch reunited several times.

757
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,300
And to me, they're all varying degrees of fun.

758
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:52,260
I don't know why that's the maybe he just isn't.

759
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:55,060
It hasn't been exposed to enough terrible culture to know like that's

760
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,100
hardly the the nadir.

761
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,300
I think he knows.

762
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,700
I think he knows it's bad and he's making a joke.

763
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,540
Yeah, that's a joke for mom and dad.

764
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,980
You know, we know that's totally what he's doing.

765
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,940
I just you know, it's hardly the worst thing.

766
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,660
Oh, sure.

767
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:16,060
I that's you know, that's not only this, but there's a lot of things where

768
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:22,060
ancient villains then know pop culture stuff like they'll know.

769
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:26,340
You know, they'll know to do to do like clap on the clapper.

770
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,500
Another 10 million years old.

771
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:34,220
I maybe is this a common move with villains to like

772
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:38,460
bone up on pop culture to sort of, you know,

773
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:43,620
is that sort of a manner to ingratiate yourself with with people and make it?

774
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:46,820
Oh, he's one of me. He's not some weird warlord guy.

775
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,580
He knows about stuff I know.

776
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,300
Yeah, I think that's to make.

777
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,980
Yeah, to sort of because this you have to sort of be

778
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:57,220
like you have to be seducing to be a villain.

779
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,900
You have to be seductive.

780
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:02,580
And what better way to do that is that know some of our best pop culture?

781
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:07,940
Like that was it's a little bit akin to the police doing the Macarena.

782
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,180
Yeah.

783
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:14,060
Some of our best pop culture, relevant culture.

784
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,740
If we learn this dance, then we can trick them.

785
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:23,060
It's classic Ivan who's tactics and we're seeing it left and right.

786
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:26,020
Ivan who's invented Ivan who's invented all these tactics.

787
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:32,020
The only thing following the Ivan who's handbook down pat, we can't trust them.

788
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:37,180
The fandom page for Ivan who's notes this in.

789
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:42,940
There's a couple funny instances of like, oh, yeah, this is this is kind of

790
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,820
charming because there's clearly like not an editor.

791
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,180
It's just fans.

792
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,300
This is what they say.

793
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:54,500
He could also become bored easily as the adults were taking too long to dig up

794
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,940
his ectomorvacons.

795
00:40:56,340 --> 00:41:03,260
Ivan ordered an adult to dance, quote, do the swim showing he knows modern dances

796
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:09,980
and music. I love taking up some hacky movie line like that and then dressing it

797
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:12,660
up with like serious essay formatting.

798
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:17,500
The swim, that modern dance of 1995.

799
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:23,500
My other my other favorite little bit of language from that page.

800
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:28,180
Overall, Ivan could be described as insane and megalomaniacal.

801
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,380
Damn, that's harsh.

802
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:32,020
I am looking at that page as well.

803
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:35,100
And my favorite part is where they they list like, you know, his powers and his

804
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:39,300
skills. They list his goals and then they list his crimes.

805
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:41,740
Yes.

806
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:49,660
Serial abuse of power, attempted destruction, usurpation, brainwashing,

807
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:53,220
enslavement and attempted universal hegemony.

808
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:54,900
What is that word?

809
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,660
Hegemony, hegemony, hegemony.

810
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:58,940
Is that what it is? Hegemony.

811
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,020
Yeah, hegemony. Sorry.

812
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:03,540
And then says this type of villain, tyrannical alien.

813
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,700
They're not wrong. Yeah, they are wrong.

814
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:10,860
It's all accurate. Yeah.

815
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:15,540
I also spent a little time on some some fandoms or some Wikipedia's because in

816
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:20,180
trying to figure out the historical context of Ivan Ooze, I was also like,

817
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:24,340
wait, OK, so all right, if he's if he's in an egg and he's buried in California,

818
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:27,780
then what was going on in 6,000 BC and wait, Angel Grove is in California.

819
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:30,660
So what and I was like, what else is up with Angel Grove?

820
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:35,260
And some posters have found some other historical inaccuracies because

821
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:39,340
there's an episode where the Power Rangers, you know, got a time stone

822
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:44,140
or some shit and they go back to Angel Grove back during the Revolutionary

823
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:46,540
War when it was occupied by Britain.

824
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:51,820
Right. You know, this California town in 1775

825
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,740
that was occupied by Britain.

826
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:59,020
And there's scenes that take place in lush forests, you know, like the kinds of

827
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:02,900
like what you'd see in Virginia where the Revolutionary War was fought.

828
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:06,860
But then there's other episodes where they time travel and Angel Grove is a desert

829
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,580
or it's like the old west.

830
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:11,140
So Angel Grove makes no fucking sense.

831
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,820
And if you're going to have a time stone, then why don't just get like get

832
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:17,540
get like a travel stone to to get you to the East Coast?

833
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:20,060
Why is why does the Revolutionary War have to be in

834
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,660
fucking like next to San Diego?

835
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:24,780
I like that idea of the travel stone.

836
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:25,540
That's good.

837
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:28,020
I'm around a lot.

838
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:32,060
Just if there's going to be one stone already dealing with magic and stones,

839
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:35,180
the second stone, that should have been one of the Infinity Stones

840
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:38,100
and the Infinity Gauntlet in the Marvel movies, the travel stone.

841
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:40,260
That's nice.

842
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:41,380
Who doesn't love to travel?

843
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:42,900
Yeah, I'd make a nice stone.

844
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:44,100
I agree. It would be a nice.

845
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,780
It would be a nice stone.

846
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:47,500
A nice stone. Agreed.

847
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:52,220
So, yeah, but his plan

848
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:56,780
kind of becomes

849
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,540
he's I think I missed that.

850
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:02,900
And I forgot that the construction site that he's buried, but then also is.

851
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:05,980
Would you say ectomorphicons?

852
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:07,700
Yes. Well, he is.

853
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:11,100
Yes, he's ectomorphicons, which also need to be dug up.

854
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:13,820
That's why he mind controls the parents of the town.

855
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:16,340
Well, OK, yes.

856
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:19,660
Yeah, because not only are they used for that, but they're also used

857
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:25,020
to to make his his booze to they're used on an on an assembly line in a in a.

858
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:29,580
I was going to call it a sweatshop, but honestly, the besides the mind control,

859
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:31,900
the circuit, the situation is not that bad in there.

860
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:34,460
It's not like they're so cramped together.

861
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:35,860
I mean, they're not getting paid either.

862
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:38,700
I'm just saying, like, like in terms of like personal space,

863
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,580
that's not the worst factory I've ever seen.

864
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:44,060
Right. There's worse human rights violations happening in factories

865
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:47,980
across the world right now, and especially with Covid-19.

866
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:51,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's probably as bad as it could be.

867
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:54,020
And Ivan is very humane.

868
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:57,260
He's like if he was going to raise a bunch of chickens, he was he'd kill them,

869
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:59,580
but he'd give them like space to be able to turn around.

870
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:01,980
He's not a monster. He's not. He's not a monster.

871
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:04,700
He they should really we should add that.

872
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:07,340
Can we add that to his fandom?

873
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:11,820
Monster gives ample space to his mind controlled factory workers.

874
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:13,300
Let's see how do is fandom.

875
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:15,380
Can I add to it or I have to get it approved?

876
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:18,340
You probably just have to make an account, but

877
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:20,820
too much work, too much work.

878
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:24,780
Power Rangers, the Power Rangers fandom site is either

879
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:29,180
either that hasn't been touched in six years or you will run a foul of some

880
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:33,220
little, you know, a little mini Ivan ooze.

881
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,820
Making that page is personal domain.

882
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,500
It will be furious that you meddled with his empire.

883
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:42,780
Some guy who's like has had his face surgically altered to look like Ivan ooze.

884
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,740
I think it died his skin purple.

885
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:50,380
Man, how much would you love?

886
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:53,580
You know, I don't think there's a show like that on right now, but, you know,

887
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:57,780
when there's like shows called Obsessed or something and somebody

888
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:01,140
takes their thing too far, if you watch an episode of a guy who became a

889
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:03,940
a permanent Ivan ooze.

890
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:06,460
Oh, my God. How cool that.

891
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:09,580
How awesome.

892
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:13,180
Would you settle for a tattoo?

893
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:15,660
Because I've got I found one.

894
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,980
Oh, I thought you were about to say you had it.

895
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:21,420
I know. I wish I wish known you for all this time.

896
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:23,260
I've known you for a decade and I've never seen it.

897
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:27,660
The giant back tattoo of Ivan ooze.

898
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:32,980
Yes. But before we start recording, Mike mentioned is allergies might be acting up.

899
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:34,940
And I was like, oh, I really didn't know you had allergies.

900
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:39,180
Meanwhile, I reveal I have an eye of very detailed Ivan ooze tattoo.

901
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:43,540
Says it's ooze and time.

902
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:46,060
It's really big on your back.

903
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:47,740
I am looking. Look.

904
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:50,220
Whoa. Deal in 1995.

905
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:55,780
OK, I've been who shows up any fucks up Rita Repulsa and Lord Zed and Goldar

906
00:46:55,820 --> 00:47:00,780
makes Goldar bend the knee and Goldar Goldar, the wolf guy, the werewolf guy.

907
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:03,660
Yeah. Goldar is the one in all gold. Yes.

908
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,740
I love Goldar.

909
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:09,300
The pig man exclusive to the movie, I believe.

910
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:10,300
And you have the pig man's name.

911
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:13,100
I know his name. More. OK. Mordent.

912
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:18,980
Mordent, the tattoo is amazing.

913
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:20,260
Not to not to breeze past this.

914
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:22,940
Yeah, it's very good. Why not purple?

915
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:24,980
Yeah, that's a good question.

916
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:28,940
Maybe this was just the first like first run at it and they were going to

917
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:30,940
keep their pass. Yeah. First pass.

918
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:33,460
And it's on it's kind of on his his cav.

919
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:37,260
It's sort of a muscly cav and it's got a big your calf.

920
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:38,500
I couldn't.

921
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:43,420
I like Mordent, who is a pig man, because he also

922
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:46,620
Mordent, the pig man, who is original into the

923
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:50,780
or is unique to this movie as well, I believe, is funny.

924
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:53,900
And I like his voice a lot.

925
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:57,500
When like Lord Lord said it, when I have a news is saying like, you know,

926
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:01,460
he's he makes some big proclamation and Mordent's like, how can I forget?

927
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:05,140
I never knew he's got like that kind of like squealy guys,

928
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:07,340
squirrely guys voice that I really like.

929
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:12,780
But I'm surprised there's other great characters from

930
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:18,100
like Zed and Rita's base that I really like, that I wish they had included

931
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:20,340
like Finster. Jason, do you know Finster?

932
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:23,460
I know Finster. I can't picture him.

933
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,300
All right. I'm going to send everyone a photo of Finster right now.

934
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:29,820
And I'm upset that Finster was not in the movie.

935
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:32,540
Here he is. He kind of makes he makes the villains.

936
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:35,500
He like makes them out of clay.

937
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,900
Oh, yeah. And he's he was always one of my favorites.

938
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,300
He's like a big babu frick.

939
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:43,340
Yes. Thank you. Yeah.

940
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:45,340
Fin. This guy's cool.

941
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:49,740
Yeah. He was. So while I don't want to take anything away from Mordent,

942
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:52,540
I would have preferred Finster to Mordent.

943
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:57,100
I am, you know, all of this makeup is pretty amazing.

944
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,140
Mordent is great.

945
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:01,300
And the the Tengu warriors, all of the crows

946
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:04,980
are really cool who fly in a practical way.

947
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:09,460
They actually like swing them down on wires way from way in the sky

948
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:10,660
down in this construction site.

949
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:13,060
It's really freaky and genuinely scary.

950
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:17,820
And this movie was being filmed in Australia and potentially at the exact same time.

951
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:21,100
I don't know the time, but around this time, they're making a movie

952
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:24,740
with similar costumes, and that's the island of Dr.

953
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:27,380
Moreau over in New Zealand.

954
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:30,820
And like, I just I don't know what I'm getting at.

955
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:35,100
I just like me. I wish maybe they'd all like met or switched or that like,

956
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:40,940
you know, Mordent could have gone and been in a scene of Mureaux

957
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:44,900
and like a dog man could have switched out to be in Power Rangers.

958
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:47,060
It should have just they should have comboed these.

959
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:49,100
They were all in the same part of the globe.

960
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:53,100
And I would say equally well done makeup in both films.

961
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:56,940
I and you are equally great villain performances

962
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:59,780
between Paul Freeman and Marlon Brando.

963
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:04,580
Have you read there's an article about making of Dr.

964
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:08,700
Moreau, how it's basically like everyone is cursed from the movie.

965
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,340
I watched the documentary the other night.

966
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:14,060
I rewatched it's Lost Soul. It's unbelievable.

967
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,740
Yeah, it's just reading about all of it.

968
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:19,580
And like what did the director like just disappears for a while?

969
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:20,820
Is that right?

970
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:25,020
It would be Richard Stanley, that the first director.

971
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:27,460
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

972
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:30,220
Who is like, you know, who's a crazy art weirdo

973
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:33,380
and was replaced by a much more functional John Frankenheimer.

974
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:37,220
And and then he just like left,

975
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:41,380
but stayed on the island and just like smoked massive joints every day.

976
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:44,860
And then the animal creatures went to find him

977
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:48,780
and him like told him of what had the chaos that had been occurring

978
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:51,900
since he left because he never directed Marlon Brando even for a day.

979
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:55,700
So he's hearing all the stories of mayhem and then was like, can I come?

980
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:57,740
Can I visit? Yes. But how do we get you in?

981
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:00,140
What if I was a dog man?

982
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:04,420
He snuck back onto the set of the film he was formerly directing,

983
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:10,140
but as a human dog and he's in the he's in frames of the movie.

984
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:13,260
Like he he like fought really hard with Val Kilmer,

985
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:15,260
which is partially why he's out of the movie.

986
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:18,020
And then there's seen this frames where here's Val Kilmer in the foreground

987
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:21,140
and here's the former director secretly.

988
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:25,060
I don't want to just say all the stories from this movie, but lost soul.

989
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:26,220
Everybody, it's on iTunes.

990
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:28,340
Everybody look, it's the greatest documentary.

991
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:31,220
OK, not to make this episode go really long.

992
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:36,020
I guess this is the part where I need to tell a story of my past.

993
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:41,820
One of those, you know, paint by number middle school plays.

994
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:44,380
Oh, my God. Island of Dr.

995
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:47,340
Murrow. Oh, my God. How did I not know this?

996
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,700
Your plays are crazy.

997
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:52,100
What a crazy list you got to do.

998
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:54,620
And I was a dog man.

999
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:55,580
Whoa.

1000
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:01,580
Oh, man. The best part of the Richard Stanley part.

1001
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:03,020
Whoa.

1002
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:05,780
It was called the Coney Island of Dr.

1003
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:10,340
Murrow and I guess it had entered the public domain.

1004
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:12,500
I guess that's how they got away with it.

1005
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:16,260
Wow. Does this was it about hot dogs or something?

1006
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:19,020
I know it was about a guy who wanted to make

1007
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:23,260
who had made an island of like goblin people of like dog people.

1008
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:26,460
What? Coney for some reason.

1009
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:30,540
In fact, Mike, that what was the name of my character?

1010
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:33,460
What? Yeah.

1011
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:35,260
What was the name of your character?

1012
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:37,900
A dog made a dog man named what?

1013
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:41,460
Because I really couldn't say many other words than what was it like a who's

1014
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:42,780
Jason, quit messing around.

1015
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:44,460
What was the tell me the name of the character?

1016
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:49,660
What?

1017
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:51,700
Yeah, no, don't ask a question.

1018
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:53,660
I asked already. Tell me the name of the character.

1019
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:55,100
Now, hold on a second.

1020
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:57,340
I've told you the name countless times now.

1021
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:59,860
So listen, listen up close.

1022
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:02,060
Listen up close. What is the name?

1023
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:04,740
I'm asking you. That's right.

1024
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:07,260
That's right. Third base.

1025
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:11,060
Did it was that those lines in the show?

1026
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:15,460
Jason, I feel like there had to be.

1027
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:17,380
Why would you do that?

1028
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:20,020
Right. Yeah. Why else would you do that?

1029
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:21,900
Is there a video? Is there a video?

1030
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:25,500
There is probably a bit.

1031
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,620
Yes, I believe there is a video.

1032
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:31,660
Oh, my God. I will try to find it when you got to dig all this up.

1033
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:32,820
You have to.

1034
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:35,980
I was so happy that I had to like

1035
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:41,220
reconstruct a broken VHS to get the footage of my dad on the news.

1036
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:42,980
And yeah, I think I got ripped off.

1037
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:47,580
I had to like compare a broken tape to what a functioning tape looked like.

1038
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:50,860
And like, OK, so this screw would go here and so on.

1039
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:52,740
So I'm just saying it can be done.

1040
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:55,060
Like we can overcome big disasters.

1041
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,380
Wow. Yeah.

1042
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:57,500
Get more content out there.

1043
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:01,300
We got I mean, I wanted to watch the play the first play, the play

1044
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:03,340
where the Nazi saboteur.

1045
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,820
I tried to watch.

1046
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:08,780
I have a digital copy of it and I've tried combing through it.

1047
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:11,220
And I really got to.

1048
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:14,140
What happened was I was trying to do it with headphones on.

1049
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:18,140
And unfortunately, they set up microphones on the stage,

1050
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:21,140
which was mostly plywood.

1051
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:24,500
So you can just hear children in ill fitting dress shoes

1052
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:27,940
clomping, overriding a lot of the lines.

1053
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:31,420
So we got to we got to figure out something to do with this.

1054
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:33,300
That really rings a bell.

1055
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:36,980
That is so I've never heard that said out loud about why it's

1056
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:38,860
impossible to watch school plays.

1057
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:40,900
It's entirely clomping.

1058
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:42,580
Yeah, it's entirely comping.

1059
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:43,620
They would extend.

1060
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:47,300
It wasn't like the full there was a regular stage and they would extend it

1061
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:49,260
with these plywood extensions.

1062
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:53,740
And then a couple people may have had lavaliers, but not a lot.

1063
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:56,660
But they had these floor mics that would pick you up.

1064
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:59,220
But they would also pick up the clomping

1065
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:02,820
because everyone's like when they would tell people like, no,

1066
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:06,180
for what walk confidently, like walk like you're an adult.

1067
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:09,820
And so like every which is default to clomping, I guess.

1068
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:15,660
So just to be clear, and we can't build this up too much because footage

1069
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:18,620
might not be available, but just to reiterate the fact that you,

1070
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:25,220
Jason Sheridan, played what the dog man in the Coney Island of Dr.

1071
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:26,660
Moreau. Yes, that's right.

1072
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:30,940
In a sea of dog, like there was, I mean, it actually became an issue

1073
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:34,860
because for like ensemble numbers, a lot of times they would have people

1074
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:38,900
like change outfits just if they would be like, oh, you're just a guy in the city.

1075
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:42,180
We don't want this character like,

1076
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:45,020
you know, they would need to fill out the ensemble.

1077
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:48,540
And it's like, oh, that's harder to do in this because we need to put

1078
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:51,020
make these children look like dog men.

1079
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:54,340
So I guess the ensemble is always the dog men.

1080
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:58,420
Yeah, this is insane.

1081
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:02,780
If it can be found again, well, a running theme through this is releasing things,

1082
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:06,780
release. So what is this release? Release the dog men.

1083
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:09,020
Yeah, release the dog man.

1084
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:11,940
Who let the dog try to let the dog man out?

1085
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:18,580
Yeah. Or let what the dog man out?

1086
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:23,540
Yes. Let's take man.

1087
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:26,420
Let what the dog out?

1088
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:29,140
It's very clear.

1089
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:31,460
People know what they're seeing when they see it on Twitter.

1090
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:35,900
They'll know this is not this was not a direction I pictured this show.

1091
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:37,300
I don't have any notes on that.

1092
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:41,140
I was not prepared, but since this is probably more interesting

1093
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:44,540
than talking about the not great movie Color Out of Space

1094
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:47,460
that Richard Stanley directed last year.

1095
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:51,020
Oh, no. Which is which is very purple.

1096
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:54,940
And everyone everyone seems to be doing an I've a news impression

1097
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:56,660
because everyone goes insane.

1098
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:58,540
Hey, wait a minute. I'm back on board.

1099
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:01,820
Yeah, well, everyone in the movie, everyone goes insane.

1100
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:06,020
And it's it feels like they gave the direction of like, well, you're going insane.

1101
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:10,260
And every everyone got to decide how to do that on their own.

1102
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:14,580
How Jason, how many more school plays have you not revealed to us?

1103
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:17,420
Or there's a few.

1104
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:18,900
There's a couple more.

1105
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:21,380
And you will have to see when they come up.

1106
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:26,580
How many total were you in in your whole like junior high and high school career?

1107
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:30,220
Well, that lasted eight years.

1108
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:32,900
So I was in a play every year.

1109
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,460
Eight year junior high.

1110
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:36,820
You had four years of junior high.

1111
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,420
Well, we did fifth through eighth.

1112
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:40,300
Oh, OK, because we did.

1113
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:42,380
We did seven and eight.

1114
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:44,220
Oh, OK. I did six.

1115
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:45,340
We're all different.

1116
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:46,860
But that's I'm glad it's expanded.

1117
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:49,980
That means there's potentially eight plays worth of material.

1118
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:52,820
Oh, man. Well, the high school plays were like Broadway plays,

1119
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:55,500
and they don't usually come with a license to record them.

1120
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:58,100
Although now everyone just shoots it on their iPhone.

1121
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:01,260
So they were a little more hesitant for recording that.

1122
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:03,460
So I don't know how much footage there is of those. Right.

1123
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:05,580
But the middle school plays were weirder.

1124
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:08,420
So it kind of worked out.

1125
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:11,020
That's wow. Wow.

1126
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:13,580
I can't back on track, so we aren't so crazy.

1127
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:15,020
Going forever.

1128
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:19,580
The because and also because we have to talk about sort of really the meat.

1129
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:22,660
And I think why this guy came up before it must this must have been

1130
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:27,060
light magic unless I'm crazy because, you know, that's all, you know,

1131
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:29,140
they're they're they're fairies.

1132
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:30,660
They're in weird, flowy costumes.

1133
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:34,500
And that must have led into the comparison of Ivan news,

1134
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:38,420
not just as regular Ivan news, but Ivan news dressed as a wizard.

1135
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:40,900
Yes. Yes, I think you're right.

1136
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:43,620
I think that's that's got to be what it is.

1137
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:45,620
I think so.

1138
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:48,220
So it's it's it's a wonderful reveal.

1139
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:51,100
One of the one of the great scenes in cinema.

1140
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:57,180
It's a scene that starts on a close up of two purple containers of ooze

1141
00:58:57,460 --> 00:58:59,220
that just say ooze.

1142
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:02,700
And I think like fun for kids keep away from parents.

1143
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:05,460
And then he sort of like parts them.

1144
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:10,860
And it it zooms out to reveal that he is a wizard.

1145
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:14,860
And that he, you know, because he can't just walk around

1146
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:17,140
and be a purple devil guy.

1147
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:19,740
He's going to get caught or people are going to be suspicious.

1148
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,780
He has to be something that people trust like a wizard.

1149
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:25,180
And he can't be a purple guy.

1150
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:27,460
He's got to have a more regular skin tone.

1151
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:31,540
So what he does is he takes pure white face

1152
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:34,500
paint and puts it on top of the purple,

1153
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:38,180
landing his skin tone in a in a nice lavender.

1154
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:40,620
Yeah, very normal.

1155
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:42,540
Very normal looking.

1156
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:44,220
Not suspicious.

1157
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:45,620
Yes, definitely.

1158
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:49,660
He looks like a human being very much so.

1159
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:55,740
I guess maybe the wizard was chosen because he's got that thorn beard

1160
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:59,620
I described and as a wizard, he can take a big,

1161
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:04,060
fluffy Merlin beard and put that on top of the thorn beard.

1162
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:05,740
Right. And no one will be the wiser.

1163
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:06,700
Yes, that makes sense.

1164
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:08,060
I mean, that that part.

1165
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:10,340
Yes. Cover your thorns.

1166
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:12,260
I think that's a wise decision.

1167
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:14,620
If you're trying to pass off as a human.

1168
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:15,860
Yeah. So you got to be thinking.

1169
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:19,100
So his options are what, you know, Abraham Lincoln,

1170
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:24,620
he could be like, you know, the very the cartoon Christian idea of God

1171
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:25,980
with the big beard.

1172
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:28,100
But that's weird. Why is God walking around?

1173
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:29,420
That's even more suspicious.

1174
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:31,820
And he hates God. God being Zordon. Right.

1175
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:35,060
So I think he got to the right place with wizard.

1176
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:37,540
He could be like a lion man.

1177
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:39,700
With a big, big man.

1178
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:41,060
The Zubali zoo.

1179
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:44,860
Yeah. Zubali zoo guy, which is still that patron is still coming.

1180
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:47,820
We yeah, yeah, we got to do that.

1181
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:49,100
I'll be terrified of that one.

1182
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:49,740
That's for sure.

1183
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:50,420
Speaking of Dr.

1184
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:53,820
Moreau and Dogman and he looks so fun.

1185
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:56,860
I love a costume on top of a costume.

1186
01:00:57,100 --> 01:01:02,260
This this reminded me of one of my favorite human giant sketches.

1187
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:05,260
Shout out to Paul Scheer and Jason Waller.

1188
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:06,460
There's this one sketch.

1189
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:08,940
I don't know if you guys have seen it where

1190
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:13,540
Scheer is a Star Trek wharf type actor

1191
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:16,660
who has to put on crazy prosthetics every day.

1192
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:17,460
And it's a big pain in the ass.

1193
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:19,860
So he gets them permanently welded to his face.

1194
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:23,620
And that cuts down on he then he gets fired.

1195
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:26,700
Like the show ends and he has no reason to have these things on his face.

1196
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:28,300
So now he can't get other work.

1197
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:32,220
So it ends up with him having to put on lots of prosthetics

1198
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:33,980
to be a regular human being.

1199
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:37,220
And there's a scene where his clearly alien

1200
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:40,140
perma makeup has been painted over with skin tone.

1201
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:42,300
And I think he has a weird like Van Die Heela.

1202
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:45,980
Scheer looks so much like I have a news as a wizard in this mode.

1203
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:50,940
It's so the multi costumes just what a what a delight.

1204
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:54,420
I mean, it is with people, you say hat on a hat is a bad thing.

1205
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:56,020
Not in this case.

1206
01:01:56,020 --> 01:01:58,980
You can logically construct a hat on a hat.

1207
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:01,500
It's maybe the best thing.

1208
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:03,940
Sometimes when people say hat on the hat, I go, hey, good.

1209
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:06,380
More hats. I love hats.

1210
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:08,260
A lot of things have no hats. Right.

1211
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:11,620
Like, at least I'd rather have two hats than no.

1212
01:02:11,620 --> 01:02:15,300
I would also rather have two, three, four hats more than no hats.

1213
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:17,340
Yeah. Come on.

1214
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:22,220
Um, so no, no, hold on.

1215
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:26,420
Listen, you don't think the game night getting out of control

1216
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:28,220
isn't enough hats.

1217
01:02:28,220 --> 01:02:32,540
That's like it sounds like it's to stay to two hours.

1218
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:36,100
It's a hat. It's it's a type of hat, I guess.

1219
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:43,260
If a comedian is telling you the story of when his standup career

1220
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:46,780
wasn't going so good, how many hats do you consider that to be?

1221
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:48,860
Is that is that a hat?

1222
01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:50,900
Is it more of a visor?

1223
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:53,820
They won't have you insulting visor.

1224
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:56,460
Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, I'm sorry.

1225
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:58,820
You are one of the biggest visor advocates on the planet.

1226
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:02,500
I am. And you know, when I saw I wondered if anyone would notice this.

1227
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:05,980
And I did see some comment in the wake of me having a child.

1228
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:08,220
The visor is no longer ironic.

1229
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:11,340
And I would say to that it never was.

1230
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:15,380
I have always worn visors because it reminds me of my dad

1231
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:16,980
and going to the beach with my dad.

1232
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:20,220
So that when I started wearing them, it was a nod to my dad.

1233
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:23,100
Now that I am a dad, the visor use will only increase.

1234
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:27,500
I've seen a big push, especially in some from some pro wrestlers to

1235
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:31,580
re sort of like renormalize the fanny pack as well.

1236
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:36,140
Oh, no. Is that how our visors viewed?

1237
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:39,260
Why next to are they equal to fanny packs and culture?

1238
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:41,020
In my mind, they are.

1239
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:42,140
Oh, man.

1240
01:03:42,140 --> 01:03:44,780
Zoomers are into fanny packs, too.

1241
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:46,220
That's true. Yeah.

1242
01:03:46,220 --> 01:03:49,620
Yeah. We're wearing them diagonally, like wearing them across the chest.

1243
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:51,180
Like those are big. That's true.

1244
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:56,220
I've never felt insecure about my visor visor use until realizing that they're

1245
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:59,740
if they're viewed part and parcel with fanny packs.

1246
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:00,780
That's a bummer to me.

1247
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:01,940
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

1248
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:02,900
I didn't mean to bring it down.

1249
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:05,060
I thought I was doing a good thing there by bringing that up.

1250
01:04:05,660 --> 01:04:09,220
Well, but then again, you know, I mean, I bet I will learn soon

1251
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:13,260
why a fanny pack is a good functional thing to have. Right.

1252
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:14,220
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1253
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:16,620
You got to have stuff on you was as a father.

1254
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:18,300
I think I will.

1255
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:19,180
I just.

1256
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:21,180
Extra masks, you know.

1257
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:25,060
Yes. Well, in the being a COVID dad, you

1258
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:27,100
it's extremely necessary.

1259
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:27,900
Mm hmm.

1260
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:32,060
Uh, I just maybe it's that phrase I have to get over.

1261
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:33,660
You know, I got you got to macho it out.

1262
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:35,740
I'm going to start calling the manny packs.

1263
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:37,380
Oh, good. Yeah.

1264
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:39,140
That fixes it.

1265
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:41,260
You're worried about your masculinity.

1266
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:43,860
You do a theme park podcast.

1267
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:48,300
Me, those of the theme park podcast, who loves to wear visors

1268
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:53,580
and worried that my masculinity is viewed as less than traditional masculinity is dead.

1269
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:56,500
I'm declaring it here.

1270
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:58,340
We're all we're all masculine.

1271
01:04:58,340 --> 01:05:00,860
We're all feminine. It doesn't matter.

1272
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:01,620
I'm wow.

1273
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:03,540
I'm tearing down the barriers right now.

1274
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:07,140
Yes, I am now on this Patreon episode about even news.

1275
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:10,740
Yes, on the Ivan Ooze episode of a pay walled podcast.

1276
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:14,460
Let the word go forth.

1277
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:19,900
We should all be able to liquefy, liquefy and reform and whatever form we want.

1278
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:22,100
Toxic masculinity is dead.

1279
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:27,300
Get rid of your old impressions of what it means to be a man.

1280
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:30,540
Why am I a man can be cool?

1281
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:32,140
Why can't a man be cool?

1282
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:35,460
A fanny pack is all right for anyone to wear.

1283
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:42,580
Let me say the other thing that I like about this

1284
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:46,340
who's selling sequence that he had a logo made.

1285
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:50,380
He went to a he went to a graphic designer and he had to like,

1286
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:54,340
I mean, he has some magic abilities, but not all.

1287
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:58,740
I don't know that he can just point at nothing and then a hundred jars are there.

1288
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:01,420
I think he had to like deal with some outside contractors.

1289
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:04,860
Yeah, he he definitely hired someone.

1290
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:08,540
He definitely had to like put an ad out,

1291
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:10,900
which at the time would have been in the newspaper, I guess.

1292
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:14,100
Unless that's like, let me go back to his fandom.

1293
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:16,540
Maybe it says he is a graphic designer. I'm not sure.

1294
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:17,420
I don't know.

1295
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:17,940
That's true.

1296
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:19,820
He does. But how does he?

1297
01:06:19,820 --> 01:06:21,540
Oh, wait, you see that.

1298
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:23,340
But then I just don't know where the jars come from,

1299
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:26,540
because eventually his employees are the brainwashed parents.

1300
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:30,300
But the first time that you see the jars, the parents have not been brainwashed yet.

1301
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:33,260
Oh, that's a good point. Right.

1302
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:39,580
Maybe Goldar is a graphic designer or Mordant.

1303
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:40,380
I don't know.

1304
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:41,140
I don't know.

1305
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:41,660
I don't know.

1306
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:42,140
I don't know.

1307
01:06:42,140 --> 01:06:42,740
I don't know.

1308
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:43,300
I don't know.

1309
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:43,860
I don't know.

1310
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:44,380
I don't know.

1311
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:44,860
I don't know.

1312
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:45,340
I don't know.

1313
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:45,740
I don't know.

1314
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:49,540
Or Mordant is a graphic designer, Mordant the pig man.

1315
01:06:51,740 --> 01:06:53,980
I threw it all around in my stir-torn.

1316
01:06:54,580 --> 01:06:56,780
What do you want the art style to look like?

1317
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:00,100
Who should I look to for inspiration?

1318
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:03,860
Well, it should be dripping.

1319
01:07:03,860 --> 01:07:07,900
The font should be dripping like it's made of ooze, you see.

1320
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:09,180
Isn't that clever?

1321
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:13,820
Is there any typeface that looks like it's doing a little drip drip?

1322
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:15,540
I get what you're saying.

1323
01:07:15,540 --> 01:07:18,860
I got to finish up this poster for an ice cream social first.

1324
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:23,420
And then I'll get right to work.

1325
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:26,020
I want six mockups by the end of the day.

1326
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:29,980
I'll turn you into chicken wings, she or in your case,

1327
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:33,100
bacon, I suppose.

1328
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:34,220
Yeah, that's right.

1329
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:37,140
All right. Get off my back.

1330
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:40,820
I'll eat your back when it's made of bacon, she.

1331
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:43,940
Don't don't don't do it.

1332
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:47,220
But just get to work.

1333
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:50,380
I will admit it during that last improv, I got distracted

1334
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:52,220
because Edwin came into the room.

1335
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:57,820
There's a big piece of like like packing paper and he just lied down in it

1336
01:07:57,820 --> 01:08:00,020
like it was his bed.

1337
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:02,020
Making a loud noise.

1338
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:04,820
I've taken a photo of it

1339
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:08,020
and it distracted me so much.

1340
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:10,260
It's worse behavior than what the dog man.

1341
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:11,180
Yeah.

1342
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:13,780
Uh, anyway.

1343
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:16,220
So then he was I mean, this scene is great.

1344
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:19,540
And he so he puts on this show again.

1345
01:08:19,540 --> 01:08:22,740
He's a he's a being who's at least 6000 years old.

1346
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:28,940
And his scheme is is like, you know, what a shuckster would have done in 1905.

1347
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:30,700
He has a weird tonic.

1348
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:34,420
He's peddling and he is at the seemingly the beginning of his pitch.

1349
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:40,340
He is already a master group of 70 children who require no cell.

1350
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:43,380
They're immediately convinced that the ooze is great.

1351
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:45,900
They ask, like, what do you do with it?

1352
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:47,940
He says, show it to your parents.

1353
01:08:49,860 --> 01:08:50,700
That's true.

1354
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:52,900
Kids love to show stuff to adults.

1355
01:08:53,940 --> 01:08:54,540
Check it out.

1356
01:08:54,540 --> 01:08:56,420
This guy's wizard gave me ooze.

1357
01:08:56,420 --> 01:08:59,300
OK. And then they all just without thinking

1358
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:02,340
kind of, I don't know, sniff it, eat it.

1359
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:05,820
And then quickly, there's an army of parents.

1360
01:09:05,820 --> 01:09:09,340
And the spread happens without a lot of scenes,

1361
01:09:09,340 --> 01:09:11,500
and which is a bummer, because this is all that I want to see.

1362
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:14,380
I want to see the logistics of making the labels.

1363
01:09:14,380 --> 01:09:17,380
I want to see him pricing it out and talking to specialists.

1364
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:19,900
And I also want to see him getting the permit to open

1365
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:23,420
what seems to be a brick and mortar location of Ooz City.

1366
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:29,940
I mean, you don't really see a sign of is a science is free ooze,

1367
01:09:29,940 --> 01:09:32,700
but in his very local TV Larry H.

1368
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:37,900
Parker kind of ad, it certainly implies he says, come on down to Ooz City.

1369
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:41,100
Let's get sticky.

1370
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:44,020
Is this, you know, we

1371
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:47,900
Scott say tomorrow you get a call and they say, look, we want an I've news

1372
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:50,540
origin story prequel show.

1373
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:53,260
Are you on board as long as finally

1374
01:09:54,740 --> 01:09:56,740
as long as it can be

1375
01:09:56,740 --> 01:09:58,820
mostly boring?

1376
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:01,300
They say, look, it's what it's mostly whatever it's whatever you want.

1377
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:05,660
If it's anything that I want, yes.

1378
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:09,100
And then it's going to be him like going to talk to the city council

1379
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:15,500
just disguising himself as an old man, putting on putting on a disguise

1380
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:18,020
like I'm a pillar of the community.

1381
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:21,180
See, and then you got to give me Ooz City.

1382
01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:23,580
It's been my dream since I was a boy.

1383
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:27,860
And then they're like hearing him out and like, well, decide in six weeks.

1384
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:29,300
And then he hypnotizes them.

1385
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:31,420
He doesn't have time to wait.

1386
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:35,620
It's time

1387
01:10:35,780 --> 01:10:41,020
to go to City Hall and file to open up a business.

1388
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:43,820
They should you should.

1389
01:10:43,820 --> 01:10:47,060
You should get for Paul, free Paul Freeman at 70.

1390
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:49,940
He's 77 years old now, as long as he can still play the character.

1391
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:55,060
Yeah, I wouldn't settle for for anybody else except for me.

1392
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:56,180
Maybe I just do it.

1393
01:10:56,180 --> 01:10:57,980
Oh, wait, that's that's tempting.

1394
01:10:57,980 --> 01:11:00,460
But I'd rather I'd rather have Paul.

1395
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:03,820
But, you know, Paul Freeman has addressed this already.

1396
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:05,900
I found an interview with him in a newspaper

1397
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:09,420
where the interviewer said, with a new generation of Power Rangers

1398
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:11,620
having launched this year and the recently released reboot,

1399
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:14,140
would you ever consider making a big return to the franchise

1400
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:16,100
to show these new kids whose boss?

1401
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:19,700
And his response was only for an enormous amount of money.

1402
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:22,980
Yes. Hell, yes. So great.

1403
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:31,420
I mean, it seems like this guy had a good time making the movie, but not

1404
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:35,100
he's in good spirits talking about it now,

1405
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:38,940
although implying that you'd have to back up the bricks truck to get him to do it.

1406
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:43,060
But also there was a lot of bullshit going on for Paul Freeman.

1407
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:45,940
Did you guys stumble on any of this?

1408
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:47,340
And I don't know exactly what you're talking about.

1409
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:51,460
I know he was saying like the first makeup process was like seven hours.

1410
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:53,140
But I think you're talking about something different.

1411
01:11:53,140 --> 01:11:54,580
Oh, I saw that. Yes.

1412
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:58,220
They got it down to three to four hours a day, you know, just three to four hours.

1413
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:00,260
But the first time they tried, it was seven.

1414
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:02,780
And he just had to go into a trance state like, how do you

1415
01:12:03,140 --> 01:12:05,860
how do you manage that every day?

1416
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:10,140
But he the they did get the makeup better,

1417
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:16,020
but it was still really bad for his skin, so bad that he got horrible rashes

1418
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:19,660
and eventually just had to like take him off work for a couple of weeks

1419
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:22,980
to help him recover because it was just destroying him.

1420
01:12:24,220 --> 01:12:26,780
And then at some point during shooting

1421
01:12:26,780 --> 01:12:29,740
and this is him telling this story and laughing about it now.

1422
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:35,580
But he fell down some stairs in a scene on camera and sprained his ankle.

1423
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:41,140
So they had to get him to the hospital and to an ankle specialist specifically,

1424
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:45,780
which is, you know, it was a little bit out of town away from where they were shooting.

1425
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:47,940
So like, OK, let's get him out there.

1426
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:52,300
Wait, he is in makeup that takes 90 minutes to get out of.

1427
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:54,740
So they settled on getting him out of costume,

1428
01:12:54,860 --> 01:12:58,540
but not the makeup because it would slow down fixing his ankle.

1429
01:12:58,660 --> 01:13:03,020
So in Ivan, whose makeup he was rushed to suburban

1430
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:07,860
Sydney to like a little like cottage hospital where he checked in,

1431
01:13:08,020 --> 01:13:10,700
was given a wheelchair,

1432
01:13:11,180 --> 01:13:15,500
was shot dirty looks by everybody else in the waiting room and then told,

1433
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:17,740
oh, actually, the ankle guys up the street.

1434
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:21,820
So he had to be wheeled through the streets of suburban

1435
01:13:21,820 --> 01:13:27,300
Sydney in a wheelchair in full Ivan, whose makeup to fix this issue.

1436
01:13:27,460 --> 01:13:29,220
That's that.

1437
01:13:29,220 --> 01:13:31,140
That's just par for the course.

1438
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:33,660
That's the show. That's the show.

1439
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:37,260
That's it. Yes.

1440
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:38,900
Now we got. Yes.

1441
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:40,860
That's at least one hat.

1442
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:42,820
It's the if I could make.

1443
01:13:42,820 --> 01:13:44,700
Yeah, because they're going to give me a lot more control of that.

1444
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:49,820
If I could tell the story of Paul Freeman shooting Power Rangers,

1445
01:13:49,820 --> 01:13:55,140
the movie as a miniseries, I, you know, in.

1446
01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:57,380
I'm an eternal fan of the late shift.

1447
01:13:57,380 --> 01:13:59,860
This would be my entry into that genre.

1448
01:14:00,260 --> 01:14:02,500
Cheap movies about the making of movies.

1449
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:06,980
Would you make a seven season television show based on the late shift?

1450
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:10,140
Oh, if I could expand the late shift.

1451
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:12,780
Oh, my God. Oh, now we're talking.

1452
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:17,460
If we could get I want the original guide, want Daniel Roebuck to play J.

1453
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:18,900
Leno, of course.

1454
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:20,580
And that'll be prosthetic city.

1455
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:23,020
John Michael Higgins might have grown out of it, though, obviously,

1456
01:14:23,060 --> 01:14:25,540
incredible to have him back as Letterman.

1457
01:14:25,780 --> 01:14:31,580
But imagine like a prosthetic Conan, like getting like a like a

1458
01:14:31,820 --> 01:14:33,860
maybe Paul Freeman is Conan.

1459
01:14:33,860 --> 01:14:36,900
But to teach him, oh, yeah, I know he's great in prosthetics.

1460
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:39,100
You know, he can dive into any part.

1461
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:40,260
Yeah, I'm Conan.

1462
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:42,300
She I'm getting screwed.

1463
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:48,020
See, I'm just trying to do my string dance and they're kicking me off the air.

1464
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:51,820
Rich Little would be back as Johnny Carson.

1465
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:54,780
Is he still around? Oh, yeah, he still does.

1466
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:56,940
They he does Vegas shows.

1467
01:14:56,940 --> 01:15:00,300
Jesus is it did Fred travel, Lina, that other one die.

1468
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:02,340
I think he died. Maybe I don't.

1469
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:04,340
I let me check, Fred.

1470
01:15:04,340 --> 01:15:07,140
I would like if it was all

1471
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:11,900
impersonators, as many impersonators as it could be.

1472
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:16,100
I don't think there's some just like broad Conan impersonator out there,

1473
01:15:16,100 --> 01:15:19,060
but obviously you'd want to have him.

1474
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:22,980
I I mean, yeah, stack it to stack it up with them.

1475
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:26,580
But imagine like getting to see people in prosthetics

1476
01:15:26,580 --> 01:15:30,820
who look like the Duracell battery people doing the scenes of,

1477
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:34,980
you know, you bump and cone

1478
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:38,100
in of like even just just getting Jay Leno's garage started.

1479
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:41,420
I would just do an hour on the tree.

1480
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:44,820
I don't know. I had this idea.

1481
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:47,780
I was driving around and it'll just be fun and little.

1482
01:15:47,780 --> 01:15:51,900
And I that then I can't know how much it would grow.

1483
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:54,900
And now we got the president on it. Got George W. Bush.

1484
01:15:55,900 --> 01:16:01,540
I honestly, I really, really would like to see you do multiple seasons of this.

1485
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:05,220
Oh, man. Yeah. Well, they hand me the reins.

1486
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:07,540
But like you doesn't it doesn't even really matter.

1487
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:11,100
I mean, you could you would want it to be called like late shift the series, I guess.

1488
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:13,940
But like also, you could just do it.

1489
01:16:13,940 --> 01:16:16,300
It doesn't like because they're public figures.

1490
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:17,620
Can I do that? Maybe? Yeah.

1491
01:16:17,620 --> 01:16:19,620
I mean, I can do this as a podcast or something.

1492
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:20,820
Maybe that's the idea.

1493
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:23,900
Oh, man. Just to dramaticize every single

1494
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:26,180
because you'd have to do like the Hugh Grant thing.

1495
01:16:26,180 --> 01:16:27,420
What the hell are you thinking?

1496
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:29,900
That's an entire episode.

1497
01:16:30,540 --> 01:16:32,140
Not Bradford.

1498
01:16:32,820 --> 01:16:34,460
Kevin Eubanks. Well, no, certainly.

1499
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:34,820
Yeah. Yeah.

1500
01:16:34,820 --> 01:16:38,220
And you're replacing Bradford, Ricky Miner replacing Kevin.

1501
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:40,660
These are all that each everything I'm listing is a full hour.

1502
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:45,060
Yeah. The rumor that Max Weinberg offered Jay to be his bandleader

1503
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:47,900
after Conan lost the Tonight Show.

1504
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:48,380
Oh, no.

1505
01:16:48,380 --> 01:16:51,140
We thought he would just be grandfathered into the Tonight Show.

1506
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:54,100
And I've never heard that confirmed, but I'd like to believe it's true.

1507
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:57,020
Sounds right.

1508
01:16:57,020 --> 01:16:58,700
Oh, man.

1509
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:01,100
I'm just we have to end this someday.

1510
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:06,380
I'm so like I'm going to be lost in imagining the 10 the 10 part

1511
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:10,380
dramatic. Honestly, you're saying many seven seasons, I think.

1512
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:12,980
Yeah. Honestly, entire life story of Lena.

1513
01:17:12,980 --> 01:17:15,980
We should probably just do it as like an eight episode podcast

1514
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:17,820
and then try to sell it.

1515
01:17:17,820 --> 01:17:20,540
Yeah. Yeah.

1516
01:17:20,540 --> 01:17:22,140
Yeah. You lay out the plot.

1517
01:17:22,140 --> 01:17:23,740
You kind of prove it on its feet.

1518
01:17:23,740 --> 01:17:26,500
And then we, you know, because prosthetics cost money.

1519
01:17:26,820 --> 01:17:29,420
And this is going to need a lot of them.

1520
01:17:29,420 --> 01:17:31,780
Yeah. Well, you could have a different person play

1521
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:35,060
Leno every episode like that Bob Dylan biography.

1522
01:17:36,660 --> 01:17:38,420
That's good, too.

1523
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:42,060
And in this one, it's Tilda Swinton.

1524
01:17:42,460 --> 01:17:44,900
I honestly. Yeah, exactly.

1525
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:46,940
And this one, it's an eight year old boy.

1526
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:49,900
You know, maybe this comes out of this episode and we don't we just do this.

1527
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:53,020
Yeah. Yeah. We don't want to give these ideas away for free.

1528
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:54,060
Yeah. All right.

1529
01:17:54,060 --> 01:17:55,780
This really I really like the idea of this.

1530
01:17:55,780 --> 01:17:58,260
Yeah, I know. More late shift. Holy shit.

1531
01:17:58,420 --> 01:18:00,940
Late guys, I guess late shift the podcast.

1532
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:03,540
Late shift the podcast.

1533
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:09,780
I have one more like big Ivan Use thing that he shows up in.

1534
01:18:09,780 --> 01:18:13,500
And this is just probably I'm

1535
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:16,420
I'm very curious to see if other people remember this.

1536
01:18:17,140 --> 01:18:22,940
In the Power Rangers movie, there is a song called Trouble by a band called Shampoo.

1537
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:30,060
And this song just glued into my brain as a young child.

1538
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:33,420
And it just for whatever reason,

1539
01:18:33,420 --> 01:18:38,860
1995 stuff, songs associated with movies stuck in my brain, like very weird ones.

1540
01:18:38,860 --> 01:18:45,460
It was this and the song by the band Elastica, the song Connection.

1541
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:48,540
Is a connection or connected?

1542
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:53,540
It shows up in the movie Hackers and Hackers.

1543
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:56,020
I just remember being advertised so much

1544
01:18:56,340 --> 01:19:01,500
and they always played this song because it's about connection, you know.

1545
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:06,180
Anyway, when we started talking about doing this episode,

1546
01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:10,460
I went and found the music video for this.

1547
01:19:10,460 --> 01:19:17,060
And it's it's that aesthetic that I just love that late mid to late 90s.

1548
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:19,340
Millennial optimism, aesthetic.

1549
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:22,020
We got oval sunglasses on heads.

1550
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:26,980
We got a lot of CGI, but there's some dance in Ivan Use.

1551
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:29,660
There's some dancing Usemen in this video.

1552
01:19:29,780 --> 01:19:32,780
What is it filmed for the video or is it for clips from the movie?

1553
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:35,820
There's clips from the movie in the music video.

1554
01:19:35,820 --> 01:19:38,460
The music video is made in conjunction with the movie.

1555
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:40,180
The song was a year old.

1556
01:19:40,180 --> 01:19:42,300
Like they re-released the song for the movie.

1557
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:46,500
The song had already charted in Europe and then they put it in the soundtrack.

1558
01:19:46,820 --> 01:19:49,020
But here I'll send it to you guys.

1559
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:51,860
I mean, the very first shot in the music video is Lord Zed.

1560
01:19:51,860 --> 01:19:53,820
And then the singers show up.

1561
01:19:53,820 --> 01:19:57,540
Oh, in front of this like sort of too busy

1562
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:01,580
screensaver kind of background. Oh, this is killer. Yeah.

1563
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:05,660
And they're like kind of a they're like a blonde ship.

1564
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:08,380
More chipper version of tattoo.

1565
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:11,340
Yeah, yeah, that is true.

1566
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:16,540
Kind of they do this song on top of the pops like it was it charted.

1567
01:20:17,660 --> 01:20:21,060
I I'm not sure how many albums, whatever happened to shampoo.

1568
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:27,860
Elastica only had two albums, but yeah, this was a great video is great.

1569
01:20:28,060 --> 01:20:31,500
We've talked about this soundtrack on the show before, even before I have a news,

1570
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:34,260
because I had this on a cassette and I loved it.

1571
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:38,660
And it's where I was introduced to the Van Halen, Sammy Hagar, Van Hagar song

1572
01:20:38,660 --> 01:20:42,940
dreams and higher and higher.

1573
01:20:42,980 --> 01:20:44,620
Yes. Yes.

1574
01:20:44,620 --> 01:20:46,780
That ends the film with fireworks.

1575
01:20:46,780 --> 01:20:49,500
It's it's very triumphant.

1576
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:54,140
You get all the feels in the on the soundtrack.

1577
01:20:54,220 --> 01:20:56,220
The Power Rangers theme.

1578
01:20:56,220 --> 01:20:58,820
You know, that was kind of like a dopey studio musician,

1579
01:20:58,820 --> 01:21:01,620
kind of whoever did the music for the show.

1580
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:05,940
And they they had to get some pros to do it for the movie.

1581
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:09,500
I know who dubbed themselves as the Power Rangers Orchestra,

1582
01:21:09,820 --> 01:21:14,540
which is comprised of Matt Sorem, the drummer of Guns N' Roses,

1583
01:21:14,940 --> 01:21:19,780
the singer of Mr. Big, the bass player of Pablo Cruz,

1584
01:21:19,780 --> 01:21:23,620
the famous Discovery Island lovers, Pablo Cruz and

1585
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:28,580
perhaps uncredited rumored guitar appearance by Buckethead.

1586
01:21:28,580 --> 01:21:31,380
Yes. And for the solo on the track,

1587
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:33,700
Firebird is supposedly Buckethead.

1588
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:37,780
So what is this song?

1589
01:21:37,780 --> 01:21:40,100
What is the song they they skydive to?

1590
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:42,540
It was another hit song, I feel like.

1591
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:45,380
Oh, it's also theme park lore.

1592
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:49,020
It is the Red Hot Chili Peppers cover of Higher Ground.

1593
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:50,620
Yeah. Yes.

1594
01:21:50,620 --> 01:21:51,940
Uh, that's on there.

1595
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:54,860
Which you're from, by the way, which was used in Disneyland.

1596
01:21:54,860 --> 01:21:58,740
If you didn't hear our episode way back when they put rock songs,

1597
01:21:58,740 --> 01:22:03,940
chili pepper songs into Disney rides, Space Mountain had a higher ground.

1598
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:06,060
Higher ground. Yeah. OK.

1599
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:08,820
There's a funny Devo song called Are You Ready?

1600
01:22:09,780 --> 01:22:11,980
I have it queued up, actually.

1601
01:22:11,980 --> 01:22:16,580
I found this so I found the song so bizarre and then it dawning on me

1602
01:22:16,580 --> 01:22:19,660
that it was Devo.

1603
01:22:19,660 --> 01:22:22,100
It's so strange. Here's here's a quick hit.

1604
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:25,700
Welcome to my nightmare.

1605
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:27,780
Action boy.

1606
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:30,180
Now, it's a.

1607
01:22:31,340 --> 01:22:32,460
Have another.

1608
01:22:35,860 --> 01:22:38,100
That's pretty much that action bar.

1609
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:40,940
Now it really sticks out.

1610
01:22:40,940 --> 01:22:43,260
And then you go, wait a minute, I know that voice.

1611
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:44,660
Oh, my God, it's Devo.

1612
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:47,500
And by the way, that's a scene where they're fighting.

1613
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:53,820
Ivan Ooze has kind of made a bunch of offspring and they resemble.

1614
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:58,540
I would say they look a lot like grown versions of the the Muppet Clifford,

1615
01:22:59,060 --> 01:23:01,420
the host of Muppets tonight, because they have dreadlocks.

1616
01:23:01,420 --> 01:23:03,020
I don't have dreadlocks. Yes, exactly.

1617
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:05,100
Yeah, I didn't think about that.

1618
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:07,180
We were talking about the Ooze men.

1619
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:09,340
They dance in the music video.

1620
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:11,460
At least one of them dances in the music video.

1621
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:15,100
It's great. It's so the music video is just so fun.

1622
01:23:16,340 --> 01:23:20,660
Yeah, there's a whole world of culture around this movie.

1623
01:23:21,140 --> 01:23:23,620
Clearly, I think I was sleeping on it.

1624
01:23:23,740 --> 01:23:25,060
Maybe my parents were wrong.

1625
01:23:25,060 --> 01:23:28,620
Maybe they led me astray because I could have had the joy of all this great music

1626
01:23:28,620 --> 01:23:30,900
and I have a news in my life this whole time.

1627
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:35,140
Yeah, I think I think for sure you would have liked all these monsters.

1628
01:23:35,140 --> 01:23:36,900
You would have been a Finster fan.

1629
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:39,780
You would have been a Goldar fan.

1630
01:23:39,780 --> 01:23:41,740
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

1631
01:23:42,980 --> 01:23:46,100
Have we missed anything about.

1632
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:49,140
Ivan himself, I well, you know, you know what maybe

1633
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:53,220
bears mentioning is the I mean, first of all,

1634
01:23:53,220 --> 01:23:57,820
I like that his plan is to he gets all his parents, these parents to work in his factory.

1635
01:23:58,260 --> 01:24:01,340
And then once there's enough

1636
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:05,780
booze, when they get a supply, he's just like, all right, we'll go kill yourself.

1637
01:24:05,860 --> 01:24:11,380
Yeah. He commands them to go back to the construction site and quote, leap to your doom,

1638
01:24:11,940 --> 01:24:15,340
which they do. And then it's a pretty heady scene watching many

1639
01:24:15,860 --> 01:24:21,780
mind controlled parents try to jump in a pit while their own children push them back.

1640
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:24,020
Yeah, that is a little intense.

1641
01:24:25,580 --> 01:24:28,020
It's a it's a metaphor for the

1642
01:24:29,660 --> 01:24:33,700
the right wing mind control that many parents are under.

1643
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:36,500
No, we're trying to save you. Don't you see?

1644
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:39,060
No, Tucker Carlson said so.

1645
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:42,100
He said jump in the pit.

1646
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:43,100
I love bits.

1647
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:44,780
He said we should.

1648
01:24:44,780 --> 01:24:47,580
He said he said we should kill ourselves.

1649
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:52,220
He said he said Nick Kroll is freeing the rioters

1650
01:24:53,340 --> 01:24:56,580
looting won't be over until we get Nick Kroll.

1651
01:24:57,180 --> 01:24:58,580
And he said, we are fine.

1652
01:24:58,580 --> 01:25:01,020
We don't have to think about anything in a different way.

1653
01:25:01,540 --> 01:25:04,300
We shouldn't get different perspectives on any issues.

1654
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:08,180
Our world comes out later.

1655
01:25:08,180 --> 01:25:10,540
We're at a bad point that we're recording it.

1656
01:25:10,540 --> 01:25:12,660
That's our world view is correct.

1657
01:25:12,860 --> 01:25:15,700
And then just like the, you know,

1658
01:25:15,700 --> 01:25:19,980
there's there's not a lot to say about it in this audio format,

1659
01:25:19,980 --> 01:25:21,580
but the CGI. Oh, my God.

1660
01:25:21,580 --> 01:25:24,780
Because when you essentially end up with this big robot creature

1661
01:25:24,780 --> 01:25:28,060
with the sort of face of Ivanu's and it is such

1662
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:33,060
the rock scorpion king, early CGI, not even early CGI.

1663
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:39,060
Like CGI was good and then got really atrocious as if he was trying to do it en masse.

1664
01:25:39,620 --> 01:25:42,780
This is the same summer that saw the release of another movie

1665
01:25:42,780 --> 01:25:45,860
that really imprinted on me, which was the live action Casper.

1666
01:25:46,660 --> 01:25:49,980
And I feel like that's at least I feel like that probably holds up

1667
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:52,460
a little better CGI wise. I'm sure.

1668
01:25:52,460 --> 01:25:55,460
Probably not amazing, but I have to think a little better than this.

1669
01:25:55,460 --> 01:26:00,060
This CGI looks like they took like character models from reboot

1670
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:01,780
and put it in live action.

1671
01:26:01,780 --> 01:26:05,260
Yes. And without changing their shading.

1672
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:07,260
Yes.

1673
01:26:07,260 --> 01:26:12,060
Without changing their shading, without making them like lighter or darker,

1674
01:26:12,060 --> 01:26:13,980
whatever they had to do to fit the environment.

1675
01:26:13,980 --> 01:26:15,660
Yeah, none of that.

1676
01:26:15,660 --> 01:26:17,940
They were just like, get us the reboot effects.

1677
01:26:19,140 --> 01:26:20,460
And they did.

1678
01:26:20,460 --> 01:26:25,060
That'll be fine, which is so jarring, considering that, like this,

1679
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:27,580
the CGI is pretty roundly awful.

1680
01:26:27,780 --> 01:26:30,460
And then some of the acting is kind of weird and wooden.

1681
01:26:31,940 --> 01:26:34,620
And then there's other aspects that are pretty fantastic.

1682
01:26:34,620 --> 01:26:36,860
Like we said, like the costumes and the makeup.

1683
01:26:36,860 --> 01:26:39,980
And I would say that the production design is very good.

1684
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:44,100
And I watched a behind the scenes where the director spoke really highly

1685
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:48,220
of the of the art director who said he had no budget to make Ivan

1686
01:26:48,220 --> 01:26:50,300
Who's his factory and what a great job he did.

1687
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:53,820
And he was one of the great art directors working in Australia

1688
01:26:53,980 --> 01:26:55,060
at that time.

1689
01:26:55,060 --> 01:26:59,100
And not long after this movie, he hooked up with George Miller

1690
01:26:59,220 --> 01:27:02,300
and stuck around in Australia where he had a robust career,

1691
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:06,220
making many great looking films, including Mad Max Fury Road.

1692
01:27:06,420 --> 01:27:08,380
This film has the same.

1693
01:27:08,380 --> 01:27:11,740
The art director became the head of production design on Mad Max

1694
01:27:11,740 --> 01:27:14,100
Fury Road, which won him an Oscar.

1695
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:18,580
You know, he all he did on that movie were the cars, you know.

1696
01:27:18,820 --> 01:27:23,380
No big deal. The fucking cars were like, yeah, well, it's incredible.

1697
01:27:23,420 --> 01:27:27,180
This is one of the great talents of the of the century.

1698
01:27:27,580 --> 01:27:31,180
So, yeah, they found amazing crew in Australia.

1699
01:27:31,540 --> 01:27:33,340
Yeah, that's crazy.

1700
01:27:33,340 --> 01:27:36,780
And it does because we're watching the movie, honestly, like everything looks

1701
01:27:36,780 --> 01:27:40,180
except for the CGI, everything looks a lot better than my memory is.

1702
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:41,700
Like remembering it.

1703
01:27:41,700 --> 01:27:44,140
I was like, oh, some of this is all right looking.

1704
01:27:44,140 --> 01:27:45,860
It really is. Yeah.

1705
01:27:45,860 --> 01:27:49,620
This is like this is where you want kind of a retro,

1706
01:27:50,620 --> 01:27:53,780
you know, snark watch to sit where there's things you can make fun of,

1707
01:27:53,780 --> 01:27:57,820
but there's enough just watchability and good performances

1708
01:27:57,820 --> 01:28:00,380
to keep you strung along. And there's definitely that.

1709
01:28:00,700 --> 01:28:04,260
Well, and did you guys see director Brian Spicer

1710
01:28:04,700 --> 01:28:09,260
had a busy time a couple of years later, two movies in one year?

1711
01:28:10,180 --> 01:28:11,620
Did you catch this?

1712
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:16,900
No, only for Richard or poor and Mikhail's Navy.

1713
01:28:17,620 --> 01:28:19,140
Oh, yikes.

1714
01:28:19,140 --> 01:28:21,900
The Mary Kayden Ashley for Richard Purport.

1715
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:25,860
Oh, no, you're thinking of no, this is Tim Allen.

1716
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:27,780
Tim Allen and Kirsty Alley, right?

1717
01:28:27,780 --> 01:28:29,980
Yeah, where they hide out with the Amish.

1718
01:28:30,660 --> 01:28:34,020
Oh, man, I was thinking the Olsen Twins, Kirsty Alley movie.

1719
01:28:34,020 --> 01:28:36,180
I knew Christie. Oh, my gosh.

1720
01:28:36,180 --> 01:28:40,140
Oh, those are oh, those are some barfie movies. Oh, my God.

1721
01:28:41,260 --> 01:28:45,260
Since then, he is the major director

1722
01:28:45,260 --> 01:28:48,900
and EP on the new Magnum P.I. and Hawaii Five.

1723
01:28:50,140 --> 01:28:53,060
Thus making him a trillionaire.

1724
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:56,140
I was very, very wealthy.

1725
01:28:57,460 --> 01:28:59,940
Just if I had to ballpark it.

1726
01:28:59,940 --> 01:29:04,060
I think I'm going to go ahead and say my mom watches both of those shows.

1727
01:29:04,060 --> 01:29:06,060
Just a guess. Just has to get guess.

1728
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:08,460
I mean, these are the shows people actually watch.

1729
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:12,140
Good for him for being part of the things that are viewed. Yeah. Yeah.

1730
01:29:13,980 --> 01:29:16,260
Yeah. So some major talent.

1731
01:29:16,300 --> 01:29:17,220
They did great.

1732
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:22,860
And they all came together to make a movie that culminates in taking the villain,

1733
01:29:22,860 --> 01:29:27,100
who is a best himself into a robot, into space where their robot

1734
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:29,580
slow dances with his robot.

1735
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:33,420
Essentially, they like lock arms and drip through space together

1736
01:29:34,140 --> 01:29:36,540
until they hit an emergency button,

1737
01:29:36,740 --> 01:29:40,660
which causes their robot to knee his robot in the groin,

1738
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:45,620
which releases him and makes him fly at a comet,

1739
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:48,820
which blows him up. And that's the end of Ibanez.

1740
01:29:49,140 --> 01:29:51,620
Yeah. A groin hit is the end.

1741
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:56,220
You know what? That feels like that's a common thing.

1742
01:29:56,220 --> 01:30:01,740
Am I wrong? Like movie groin hits being like the final the final.

1743
01:30:03,380 --> 01:30:04,940
Hmm. I could be wrong.

1744
01:30:04,940 --> 01:30:09,740
Maybe I'm I'm just maybe the 90s felt like it was a groin hit decade.

1745
01:30:11,060 --> 01:30:13,220
I know I don't doubt that you're wrong.

1746
01:30:13,220 --> 01:30:15,300
I'm trying to think of climactic. Yeah.

1747
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:17,260
Groin hits. That's very specific.

1748
01:30:17,260 --> 01:30:18,340
And there's got to be more.

1749
01:30:18,340 --> 01:30:20,900
There definitely have to be. I'll do some research on this topic.

1750
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:24,860
I think today we have done a groin hit

1751
01:30:25,780 --> 01:30:27,940
to toxic masculinity.

1752
01:30:28,780 --> 01:30:30,900
That's true. Yes. You're right. Yes.

1753
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:34,620
That's right. And in this case, literally toxic.

1754
01:30:34,620 --> 01:30:40,500
I have a news is is genuinely toxic, but it's not so simple in the real world.

1755
01:30:40,780 --> 01:30:43,540
The toxic men aren't out there making ooze.

1756
01:30:43,900 --> 01:30:48,220
They're just oozing, disgusting backwards thoughts.

1757
01:30:48,220 --> 01:30:50,820
That's right. You really tied that together.

1758
01:30:51,540 --> 01:30:54,180
Yeah, I think I think this is beautiful.

1759
01:30:55,020 --> 01:30:57,700
I also I have a news.

1760
01:30:57,700 --> 01:31:02,780
The robot picks up the CN tower type observation building

1761
01:31:02,780 --> 01:31:05,180
and uses it like a sword. And I like that a lot.

1762
01:31:05,180 --> 01:31:07,420
That is. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's very good.

1763
01:31:07,980 --> 01:31:11,820
So well, with that, you survived.

1764
01:31:12,220 --> 01:31:14,420
You survived. But guess the ride.

1765
01:31:14,420 --> 01:31:18,340
I just you know, I feel so I had so much fun talking about him.

1766
01:31:18,340 --> 01:31:21,180
I want to I wish I could celebrate with you guys

1767
01:31:21,540 --> 01:31:23,540
the way they celebrate at the end of the movie,

1768
01:31:23,620 --> 01:31:26,100
which is watching fireworks and eating lobster.

1769
01:31:28,860 --> 01:31:30,820
There's a really funny thing at the end when the kids

1770
01:31:30,820 --> 01:31:34,660
like says there's a kid there and he's the one who like helped save the parents.

1771
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:38,620
And he's like, they're like, you know, we heard like you're going to be a Power Ranger.

1772
01:31:38,620 --> 01:31:41,060
And he's like, yeah, the Silver Ranger.

1773
01:31:41,060 --> 01:31:43,100
And they're like, oh, yeah, that's great or whatever.

1774
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:45,260
And then he goes, so Gold Ranger.

1775
01:31:45,260 --> 01:31:48,340
And they all go, oh, yeah.

1776
01:31:48,340 --> 01:31:50,820
Like they all go like nuts and like high five.

1777
01:31:51,140 --> 01:31:54,740
And I confused was was that anything in the movie?

1778
01:31:55,300 --> 01:31:56,700
That's something that happened.

1779
01:31:56,700 --> 01:31:58,580
I don't I don't know. Yeah.

1780
01:31:58,580 --> 01:32:02,380
Was it a setup for something that didn't ever I was sequel?

1781
01:32:02,380 --> 01:32:06,220
Maybe. Or yeah, they do eventually have a Gold Ranger. Yeah.

1782
01:32:06,780 --> 01:32:11,500
Right. But is there anything worth watching in turbo a Power Rangers movie?

1783
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:13,140
I have never seen it.

1784
01:32:13,140 --> 01:32:15,300
We've kind of done with it by that point.

1785
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:18,980
Yeah, I guess I think the no, not the world was because it's still going.

1786
01:32:18,980 --> 01:32:24,300
But our generation was that's where I felt like we'd we'd all moved along like my parents wanted.

1787
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:30,460
Yes. I think that I think, yeah, maybe as far as Power Rangers,

1788
01:32:30,460 --> 01:32:33,500
I'm sure there's other worthwhile characters to talk about.

1789
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:37,180
But I think probably in the Sabanah verse, it's going to have to be Flapper

1790
01:32:37,180 --> 01:32:39,180
from the Beatle Borgs that we get to next.

1791
01:32:41,220 --> 01:32:45,380
Who, if I recall, I'll look them up as we wrap up here.

1792
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:48,220
But isn't he because we've talked about him before.

1793
01:32:48,220 --> 01:32:50,820
And he's a little Lennos, right? A little.

1794
01:32:52,380 --> 01:32:54,460
Extreme. Oh, yes, indeed.

1795
01:32:54,460 --> 01:32:55,460
Yes, indeed.

1796
01:32:55,460 --> 01:32:57,900
Wait, he's wait. Flabber is what I said.

1797
01:32:57,900 --> 01:32:59,700
I said they call him flap. Yeah, yeah. Flabber.

1798
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:01,900
You're right. Sorry. OK.

1799
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:05,620
My in the seven season expanded late shift

1800
01:33:06,660 --> 01:33:10,620
the in the shift diverse, the makeup will be much.

1801
01:33:10,620 --> 01:33:12,700
He will look exactly like Flapper.

1802
01:33:14,580 --> 01:33:17,420
We'll get the genuine the actual prosthetics.

1803
01:33:17,460 --> 01:33:19,820
And this is how Jay will be portrayed.

1804
01:33:22,340 --> 01:33:25,540
Man, I can't wait. I'm excited to do that.

1805
01:33:25,580 --> 01:33:28,580
Here's a picture. I sent a bunch of pictures, but here's here's one with Flapper

1806
01:33:28,580 --> 01:33:31,180
where he has a mic like a stand up.

1807
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:34,100
Oh, man. But a little more of like a way.

1808
01:33:34,100 --> 01:33:38,180
We're really wearing like a James Brown kind of sparkle jacket.

1809
01:33:38,380 --> 01:33:41,700
All right. Somebody's compared him to Liberace as well. I see.

1810
01:33:42,940 --> 01:33:46,180
Oh, man. This is a great look for him, too.

1811
01:33:46,180 --> 01:33:50,060
Well, this will be the this will definitely be the spiritual air.

1812
01:33:50,900 --> 01:33:52,420
Oh, my gosh.

1813
01:33:52,420 --> 01:33:53,660
Here. Wait, describe this look.

1814
01:33:53,660 --> 01:33:56,860
He's wearing like he's wearing a toupee on top of his regular flabber hair.

1815
01:33:56,860 --> 01:33:58,940
He's right. Yeah. So he flabber looks like Jay Leno.

1816
01:33:58,940 --> 01:34:03,340
He has blue skin and he usually is wearing like a very purpley Liberace coat.

1817
01:34:03,340 --> 01:34:06,980
But in this one, he's wearing like a vest and beads

1818
01:34:06,980 --> 01:34:10,260
and a yellow dress shirt and like a giant belt buckle.

1819
01:34:13,060 --> 01:34:15,340
Joey, Jason, you've just sent that is a very low.

1820
01:34:15,340 --> 01:34:17,260
That's Liberace, I think.

1821
01:34:17,260 --> 01:34:20,020
That's a trading card flabber, I believe. Yeah.

1822
01:34:21,100 --> 01:34:24,020
I'm just distracted now because this I'm realizing this.

1823
01:34:24,020 --> 01:34:28,140
We're in such a similar area, both in his name and his appearance

1824
01:34:28,380 --> 01:34:31,940
to the sworn enemy of Bible man, the Fibler.

1825
01:34:31,980 --> 01:34:34,540
Oh, man. Who I will send you.

1826
01:34:34,540 --> 01:34:37,380
And we've definitely we got to hit Bible man at some point, too.

1827
01:34:37,380 --> 01:34:38,620
We're over doing that.

1828
01:34:38,620 --> 01:34:43,380
But oh, my God, flabber and the Fibler are in the exact same neck of the woods.

1829
01:34:43,740 --> 01:34:45,780
Oh, yeah. The Fibler.

1830
01:34:45,780 --> 01:34:50,540
We we these are all such this is because this is I feel like sort of grows

1831
01:34:50,540 --> 01:34:51,580
out of Green Goblin.

1832
01:34:51,580 --> 01:34:55,260
We got Green Goblin, Ivan, who is the the flabber and the Fibler.

1833
01:34:56,420 --> 01:34:58,820
Anything else like this, please make us aware.

1834
01:34:58,820 --> 01:35:00,860
I don't know what you call these guys.

1835
01:35:01,140 --> 01:35:06,260
If there's one uniform term, not just kids show villains, but like they're all

1836
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:09,420
they all look like plastic or clay.

1837
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:11,340
They're all such abominations.

1838
01:35:11,340 --> 01:35:12,940
They're all so broad.

1839
01:35:12,940 --> 01:35:16,780
Well, they're kind of like in theme park terminology, the big item,

1840
01:35:16,780 --> 01:35:20,580
the big castle or whatever kind of colloquially called a weenie.

1841
01:35:21,180 --> 01:35:26,420
These are kind of the weenies of the shows, you know, these are landmarks.

1842
01:35:26,740 --> 01:35:27,220
They're all there.

1843
01:35:27,220 --> 01:35:29,340
What draw you to it? Yeah. Yeah.

1844
01:35:29,420 --> 01:35:33,460
I could be I'm sure there's another thing before this, but they all do feel like

1845
01:35:33,460 --> 01:35:36,660
they've come out of the tradition of the 60s Batman.

1846
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:40,380
That and that might be why we like it so much.

1847
01:35:40,380 --> 01:35:41,420
It's keeping that alive.

1848
01:35:41,420 --> 01:35:43,500
It's just for kids. It's for it's goofy.

1849
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:47,340
We don't there's a time and a place for serious Batman, but there's a time

1850
01:35:47,340 --> 01:35:50,460
and a place for this shit to like what I'm looking at, which is

1851
01:35:52,060 --> 01:35:57,020
flabber with an angel and devil flabber on either side of his shoulders.

1852
01:35:57,780 --> 01:36:00,060
Oh, man. Oh, all right.

1853
01:36:00,060 --> 01:36:02,860
Well, a bunch more of this shit to come, we promise.

1854
01:36:04,020 --> 01:36:07,660
Assuming you enjoyed it and I hope you enjoyed it as you know, keep it tuned here

1855
01:36:07,660 --> 01:36:10,900
at the second gate, patreon.com slash podcast, right.

1856
01:36:10,900 --> 01:36:16,260
And more crap always at Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

1857
01:36:16,540 --> 01:36:18,660
And there is something else.

1858
01:36:18,660 --> 01:36:19,860
Oh, you know what?

1859
01:36:19,860 --> 01:36:22,100
And let's just remember to put it in the show notes.

1860
01:36:22,100 --> 01:36:24,780
We should have said this very conveniently.

1861
01:36:24,780 --> 01:36:28,820
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, the movie is up for free on YouTube,

1862
01:36:28,820 --> 01:36:30,260
at least as of this recording.

1863
01:36:30,260 --> 01:36:34,260
It's a pretty decent quality copy that has not been yanked for some reason.

1864
01:36:34,420 --> 01:36:38,500
So if you're wondering which of the many streaming services can I find it on,

1865
01:36:39,140 --> 01:36:40,140
need not worry.

1866
01:36:40,140 --> 01:36:44,180
It's it's it's free on YouTube thanks to some kind soul.

1867
01:36:44,980 --> 01:36:49,900
And yeah, I don't for whatever reason, somebody's not concerned

1868
01:36:49,900 --> 01:36:52,180
about this movie up there for free.

1869
01:36:53,620 --> 01:36:54,940
I don't know why.

1870
01:36:54,940 --> 01:36:58,340
Not a crown jewel, I guess, but it should be this.

1871
01:36:58,420 --> 01:36:59,780
This this should be protected.

1872
01:36:59,780 --> 01:37:01,060
It belongs in a museum.

1873
01:37:01,060 --> 01:37:04,260
I agree. HBO Max should have paid big money for this or something like.

1874
01:37:05,140 --> 01:37:07,460
It looks from the copy like this was on each.

1875
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:10,020
I think this may be the pulled HBO copy.

1876
01:37:10,060 --> 01:37:12,380
Oh, yes, it is the HBO rating at the top.

1877
01:37:12,380 --> 01:37:13,980
Yeah, right, right.

1878
01:37:13,980 --> 01:37:17,620
And I do remember watching it on HBO a couple of years after it had come out.

1879
01:37:17,660 --> 01:37:20,660
So it probably had a long life on HBO.

1880
01:37:21,460 --> 01:37:23,220
Yeah, yeah, as it should.

1881
01:37:23,220 --> 01:37:26,220
And well, let's give it a long life in our hearts.

1882
01:37:26,780 --> 01:37:30,420
This this might be cued up badly, but let's just here.

1883
01:37:30,420 --> 01:37:34,900
I'm just going to try to end this as the as the film ends.

1884
01:37:34,900 --> 01:37:37,980
Take us out, Van Hagar.
