00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Warning

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In each of us, two natures

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
are at war. One normal,

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
the other mad.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Consumed by obsession with hyper

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
specific minutiae that's

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
only ever addressed by this one podcast

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
inscrutable to significant

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
others. Today

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
unleash your madness

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
with discussion of clackety sphinxes

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
fraudulent purchases

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
in Nantucket and the defunct

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
New York theme restaurant

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Jekyll and Hyde Club

18

James the third on podcast

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The Ride

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Welcome to podcast The Ride

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
where we know the Greenwich Village

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
folk scene paled in comparison

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
to the Greenwich Village broken

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
robot scene. I'm Scott

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Gardner, joined by my Carlson. Hi.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Hi, yes, here. It's

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
so much more like

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
needing a documentary, really,

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
when you talk about the broken robot scene

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
in Greenwich Village. Yeah, absolutely.

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Needing, you know,

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
let's, we can fictionalize

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
it. There's the documentary version.

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Let's like, let's, you know, let's follow

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I think like 10 part documentaries

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
about every performer, every

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
animatronic, the clackety

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
old sphinx. That's definitely

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
you know, you could show that

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
through the years, the evolution through the

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
decade. Yes, Jimmy Buffett's best friend

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Frank Marshall is doing a lot of

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
rock and roll type documentaries lately, and I

45
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
think he might be the guy to do. That was fast.

46
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Within first two minutes.

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Just in case this is your first episode and you didn't know who Frank Marshall

48
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
was. In case, yeah, you need to be acquainted with

49
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Frank Marshall. He's a movie producer, Indiana Jones, blah, blah, blah.

50
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
But most importantly, he was Jimmy Buffett's

51
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
best friend. And he makes a lot of rock and roll docs.

52
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Jason Sheridan is a perfect reason to

53
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
stop talking about that. Jason Sheridan, hi.

54
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Hi, yeah. I was just

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
thinking, I was thinking about the

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Village folk scene.

57
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I wish there had been an episode

58
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
in the early seasons of Mad Men

59
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
where, cause Don Draper

60
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
ends up at like a coffee shop

61
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
performance venue at some point.

62
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But he was just

63
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
surrounded by malfunctioning robots.

64
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That would have been a great

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
juxtaposition.

66
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
We don't know what he got up to

67
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
after the series ended. He might have been one of

68
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
the people who funded the animatronic

69
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
movement. He might have given

70
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Nolan Bushnull his money

71
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
to start the checky cheese chain.

72
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You've been a hero to me.

73
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Well, we're going to start

74
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
digging in here because what we are

75
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
doing today is a

76
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
deep dive into

77
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
a theme restaurant. Technically a theme

78
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
restaurant chain. There were

79
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
a number of them, though seemingly

80
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
briefly. I feel like most of the run

81
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
there was one.

82
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It is called Jekyll and Hyde Club.

83
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
This was a haunted

84
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
explorers club.

85
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
If that tells you anything. If that

86
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
phrase means anything to you. It was

87
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
a weird horror themed restaurant

88
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
with a ton of animatronics, a ton of

89
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
performers, and just like a generally

90
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
creepy, spooky sort of vibe,

91
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
correct? Yeah, it's like Rainforest

92
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Cafe if instead of a rainforest it was

93
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
a haunted house. And if

94
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
the storm went off like way

95
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
more often. It was kind of always

96
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
the storm. The storm was pummeling you with

97
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
the storminess of whatever the type

98
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
of storm it was. Many, many

99
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
storms within the bigger storm.

100
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We talked about this place a little bit on stage

101
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
in New York, having come literally

102
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
from there to do the live show we did a couple years

103
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
ago. But that was not the exhaustive

104
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
conversation. I think this can

105
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
be that. We need more conversation

106
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
about this restaurant.

107
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That's what the listeners demand.

108
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But especially because I'm so

109
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
excited that we could do a deep dive here

110
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
with somebody who was

111
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
on the inside. Who worked there.

112
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And that's why this has come about.

113
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
A former employee,

114
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
a former performer

115
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
and I made a point

116
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
of not asking too many questions so

117
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
we could find out together.

118
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Also a

119
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
writer on the out very soon, Fairly Odd

120
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Parents and New Wish from

121
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Astronomy Club. He's got a kickstarter

122
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
for a comic book he's writing called Junior.

123
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's James the Third. Hello.

124
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yes.

125
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Excited to do it. The way you were just a

126
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
deep dive. I was like, oh my god, am I

127
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
the whistleblower of the

128
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Oh gosh, it depends.

129
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Only you can tell us. Only you

130
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
are on the other side of those walls.

131
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
James, so

132
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
excited to have you here.

133
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And we were emailing back

134
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
and forth about stuff to talk about a little bit.

135
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And you had some

136
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
theme parks you were fond of that you grew up with

137
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
and some memories. But it was kind of a

138
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
like, do I have stories about this

139
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
place or do I not?

140
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Are we trying to find the one?

141
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
My memory is, I don't

142
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
have it. It's gone now. It's fully

143
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
gone. Everything is like thin,

144
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
vague, like

145
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
blurry photographs is sort of my

146
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
entire memory of my

147
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
childhood. Okay. So this is

148
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
going to be like a psychological horror

149
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
movie where we are helping you

150
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
uncover. But

151
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
landing on this

152
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
was simply because I spent so many

153
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
days of my life there that

154
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
there has to be some

155
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
chunks of things that I can talk about.

156
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You have to imagine. Well that was, you know, so we're

157
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
like, we got some theme parks and I was like, well you know when we

158
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
do other stuff, we do this and that, we talk about

159
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
theme restaurants sometimes. And then

160
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
you did like a full backup. Like, wait,

161
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
did you say theme restaurant?

162
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Do you happen to know what Jekyll

163
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
and Hyde Club is? Oh, do

164
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
we? We absolutely do.

165
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And yet never fully, fully did it.

166
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So let's

167
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
dive in. What was the,

168
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
what are the details of your

169
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
employment at this place? When and what did you

170
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
do? So I was there

171
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
shortly after college

172
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
for me. So it would have been something like

173
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
2009,

174
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
2010, somewhere around there.

175
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And so at the time

176
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
there were a couple locations.

177
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
One was

178
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
at

179
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
57th Street and Seventh Avenue.

180
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
That was the main location.

181
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
That's where I was. Okay. And then there was

182
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
That is a, like, they expanded

183
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
to that maybe like later in the 90s.

184
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
That is like a four story, like

185
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
kind of the most nuts one. Although I don't know

186
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
the others fully to compare it to.

187
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yes. And then the other one

188
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
which I think was the first one

189
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
was in, was, yeah,

190
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
was on 14th Street

191
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
or something like that.

192
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The pub, the Jock and Hyde pub.

193
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Oh, I didn't know that designation. Okay.

194
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yeah. And there's

195
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
one actor there. There's several actors

196
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
at the club. There's one actor at the

197
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
pub.

198
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And you know,

199
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
that was something that like you looked forward

200
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
to having that opportunity of like

201
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I just gotta chill at the pub for a little bit.

202
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
There's like a handful of

203
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
customers maybe. You know, like

204
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
it's like a, it's a lighter day there.

205
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I mean, less

206
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
like less animatronics and stuff there too.

207
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Okay. Which it's, and it's funny you say that

208
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
because that's the one that we got to go to. Right.

209
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Kind of on its last legs.

210
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And it's funny that that is the less

211
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
animatronics because it did

212
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
look, I mean, we were there to do

213
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
that, do the stuff. Yeah.

214
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
But we were also like chatting with

215
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
friends. Our mutual friend Griffin was with us.

216
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And like it, boy is it

217
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
a place where like you start to get on to some

218
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
point and then like, hold, stop!

219
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Arrrr! Like just

220
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
every, boy is it the loudest.

221
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Right. And so when I say less animatronics,

222
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I think I mean more mean

223
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
were they interactive? Could you talk to those

224
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
robots or were they just robots talking

225
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
at you? Mostly talking at us.

226
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yeah, yeah. And so what I meant

227
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
there's less responsibility for the actor to

228
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
to

229
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
puppet up a puppet and talk

230
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
to people. Okay.

231
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Which is something that we're doing a lot at the club.

232
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
This is a full dimension of the place then

233
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
that I do not really, not only are you maybe

234
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
like out in a, laying a mad doctor

235
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
uniform, but you're also

236
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
behind a wall. Yes.

237
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Being a, I don't know, a werewolf?

238
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I feel like I saw those.

239
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Yeah, there was a lot of different

240
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
people. There's a gargoyle,

241
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
there's a werewolf,

242
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
there's a head, there's like a two

243
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
headed doctor, there's

244
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
just a head in

245
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
a corner, I'm trying to remember

246
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
who else, but there was a bunch, every floor

247
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
had at least one, and the

248
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
main room had one that performed

249
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
to all the floors, like the gargoyle performed

250
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
to all the floors. Okay.

251
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And stuff like that. Okay, okay.

252
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So then you, so you're hired

253
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
as a

254
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
performer who can take

255
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
on any number

256
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
of these things? Yes. Okay.

257
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So the thing that, the perk was

258
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
you got your equity card for

259
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
doing the job. Wow.

260
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And so there was a lot of,

261
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
you know, there's a lot of, as an

262
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
hacker at the time, you're sort of going like, do I

263
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
want to get my equity card right now, and do I want

264
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
to get it for this? You know, cause you're not

265
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
sure what the prestige

266
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
of that is going to be. Sure.

267
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Once you become a union actor, your price

268
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
point goes up in a way.

269
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So it's like, you can't do the

270
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
non-union jobs, you can't do this,

271
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
that, or whatever. Oh, so you're like, am I ready

272
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
to get pulled out of things that are potential

273
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
work? Right. And that could be

274
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
good work for me, as somebody

275
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
developing as an actor.

276
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Sure, yes. To be some guy in an eye

277
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
patch or whatever it is.

278
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
While serving pizza.

279
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I was like excited about, like,

280
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I was excited about doing voices, I was excited

281
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
about improv, like I was like, I was,

282
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I, and, oh, and I should also

283
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
say, I went as a kid,

284
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
we did, I'm from Ohio, and we did

285
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
a couple trips to New York in fourth and

286
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
fifth grade, and I went as a kid and, like,

287
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
had a, it was,

288
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I loved this place.

289
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So then when I learned, like, I could work

290
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
here? I could,

291
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I could, I could get in, you know, and so, yeah,

292
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
and so you're, you're essentially hired to, like,

293
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
play characters and to, like,

294
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
and to do the voices of the guys.

295
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Gotcha, gotcha. That is the sense that I

296
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
get, is that if you were in New York,

297
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
as, yeah, like, you're

298
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
10 or 11 or 12 or something,

299
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
and you could do a birthday party

300
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
here is something that this place was

301
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
pretty ace, the seat, like,

302
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
that's, that's definitely the sense I got.

303
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You know, I don't think we're there, I think,

304
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I think we knew we were not there in the peak

305
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
of the existence of

306
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
the place. No.

307
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
We were the only table there

308
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
full of people, perhaps? I believe so.

309
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I mean, it was an odd, it was like, it was a

310
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Sunday at 3 o'clock, it was

311
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
perfectly not a meal time, so

312
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I will give them that. But I'll also say

313
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
especially at the pie, and

314
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
and depending on when you went,

315
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
they might not have had any,

316
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
there was a Times Square location that popped up at one

317
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
point, and I don't know if 57th Street

318
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
was still going, but like, the

319
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
pub, even when I was there,

320
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
and at a time that we were sort of

321
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
there was bustling, you know,

322
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
it was always, like, quiet there. Gotcha.

323
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
The late night shifts were always, it was like

324
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
no one was there. If you actually, if you went

325
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
back to, like,

326
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
you went back to Ohio,

327
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I, hey, I went to New York, I

328
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
did this thing. How did you describe it?

329
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I want to make sure

330
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
we capture the, like, what this

331
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
was at its peak.

332
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Like, what is the shorthand

333
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
that made you excited then, and that made

334
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
you excited to work there later? Yeah, I mean

335
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
what made me excited then was

336
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
like

337
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I fully remember there's a

338
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
there's like an animatronic

339
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
of an explorer

340
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
who, like, it's like

341
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
something's coming to

342
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
to get me!

343
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And, like, I remembered that

344
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I remembered that moment.

345
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I remember that moment being fun for me

346
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
as a kid. Growing up, I just

347
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
once I was, like, there and actually working, I just

348
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
called it, like, I called it, like,

349
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Chuck E. Cheese with Explorer.

350
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's Chuck E. Cheese, but there's

351
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
but it's mad scientists. It's Chuck E. Cheese

352
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
but explorers. Sure, sure.

353
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Which is so insane that that's, like

354
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
cause it's not an idea, that's not an idea that, like

355
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
this is not, like, a natural

356
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
idea to make happen, you know what I mean?

357
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Like, it's not, like, of course

358
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
million dollar idea, but it's

359
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
also really neat.

360
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It is just, like, you know, it's kind of

361
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
a cousin, like, there's shades of

362
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I mean, it predates Trader Sam's

363
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
the enchanted

364
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Tiki bar at Disneyland, or

365
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
the Adventures Club was before that

366
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
down in Disney World. It's like

367
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
a cousin of those things, but doing this in

368
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
New York definitely

369
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
and that it was working for it.

370
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It does feel tourist trappy.

371
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Obviously it doesn't feel like authentic

372
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
New Yorkers are gonna go here every day.

373
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It wasn't. It was

374
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
always, it was tourists, it was

375
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
it was, drunk people

376
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
any level, you know,

377
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
from all walks of life, drunk people

378
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
would come also. So it was like kids

379
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
and, you know,

380
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
someone who was, like, drunk at 4

381
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
p.m. or whatever.

382
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Sure, sure. I kind of didn't

383
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
know it was real. I think I first became

384
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
aware of the concept

385
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
when

386
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt started

387
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
airing and Titus

388
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Burgess works at

389
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
a Jekyll and Hyde stand-in

390
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
kind of restaurant. Yes.

391
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
There's a specific line he says in that

392
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
that, like, I felt like we were

393
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
being read for filth where he goes

394
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
he goes, I'm

395
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
auditioning for the doctor role and I get to

396
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
have a monologue. That was exactly what it was.

397
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It was like the premier role

398
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
you got to play was the doctor and the

399
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
doctor had the three minute

400
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
show every

401
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
it would happen every hour or

402
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
every 30 minutes or something

403
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
and, like, and once

404
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
you got to be, and we, like,

405
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
admired to the people that were, like, good at the

406
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
doctor and, like, the people that could, like, do

407
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
that well, you know.

408
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Because you're carrying it

409
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
in a big, but aren't you in any

410
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
because any role that you have

411
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
has improv

412
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You're on the whole time.

413
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Yeah, every role you had to be on

414
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
the whole time, and we were, like, scrutinized

415
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
if it, like, seemed like we weren't.

416
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Like, if it ever seemed like

417
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
you were, like, laxed or whatever.

418
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You know. But the

419
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
doctor specifically would

420
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
have to, it would

421
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
it was like you were commanding

422
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I had a friend

423
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
who did it, Stephen

424
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
LaFerriere is his name. He

425
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
said if I were, if I, and this

426
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
sort of answers a question that you had, he was, like,

427
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
if I were to tell my younger self, he'd

428
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
be, like, you know, I

429
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I do eight shows

430
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
a week at a fancy

431
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
midtown Manhattan

432
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
location, you know, like, for

433
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
for several crowds of people,

434
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
you know. People from all over the world.

435
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
That's how he would describe it to his

436
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
to his younger self. Because, like, that is

437
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
there were

438
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
times where it really felt like

439
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
the quiet of

440
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
the four floors was like

441
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
was like, wow,

442
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
like, everyone's listening to the doctor.

443
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
You know. Oh, you're commanding

444
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
the entire restaurant. Yeah, you're

445
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
even if they don't have eyes on you. Wow, wow.

446
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
And was it a speech, like a completely written

447
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
speech that you'd have to do verbatim?

448
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
And you could

449
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
you could improvise around it.

450
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
But

451
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
there was, like, a speech that you had to

452
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
that you had to do. Do you remember any of it? I'm not telling you

453
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
you have to do it. So I don't remember any

454
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
of it. I remember a lot of Stevens

455
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
actually, because I watched a lot

456
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
of his. I don't remember what I what

457
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I said, but I remember that my doctor

458
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
character. Yeah, you can tell me

459
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
if this sounds like anyone you're familiar with.

460
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
But he kind of talked like this.

461
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Oh, okay.

462
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Okay. Got it.

463
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
What does that sound so familiar?

464
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Like a little bit like

465
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
and is

466
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
this a doctor? I don't know, an affinity for

467
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
jello pudding pops.

468
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Every now and again, he would have the jello.

469
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And

470
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
and you would and you were essentially

471
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
bringing a Frankenstein's monster

472
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
to life. So there was a lot of like life, give

473
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
it life. And

474
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
and I remember Steven doing

475
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
a line of Shakespeare. He would he would

476
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
go,

477
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
blow winds come rack. At least I'll die

478
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
with harness on my back. Shakespeare, I thank you.

479
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Give it life.

480
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
This freaking this guy's a rock star.

481
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Like

482
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
it truly felt like, wow,

483
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
you know, you know, young kid, fresh out of

484
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
college looking at him like, wow,

485
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I can't believe it. You go to

486
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
the, you know, like you're starting out

487
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
at an improv theater or whatever. And like who are

488
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
the stars there at the

489
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
time? Remain stars to you

490
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
forever. So yeah,

491
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
like the, you know, the big dog doctor.

492
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Of course.

493
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Even if you graduate. Okay, so congrats on

494
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
graduating to doctor.

495
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Those are in order.

496
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Thank you. I wait a minute.

497
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
So so that's like, okay, the centerpiece

498
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
of the evening. Like there's there's all these

499
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
little shows going on, but where everybody were

500
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
the doctor that gets everybody's attention

501
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
and it's to bring a

502
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
this isn't

503
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
it's not Dr. Jekyll.

504
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
No. And so Dr. Jekyll

505
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
is there.

506
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I think Dr. Jekyll is

507
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
who like grabbed

508
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
that explorer that I remember.

509
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
But but no one's

510
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
ever no one's playing Dr. Jekyll.

511
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Okay. This is a big question.

512
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Yes. Like that's the

513
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
namesake. But it all seems like

514
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
like people

515
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
he knew or associates

516
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
or people who like tell his legend.

517
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It's an explorers

518
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
club, you know, who

519
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
and you could like you could know Dr. Jekyll

520
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
if you if your character chose to

521
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
my first character

522
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I never knew Dr. Jekyll.

523
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
That was never something that my first character was an explorer.

524
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
He had snakes

525
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
around his neck.

526
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
His name was Colonel Plunder.

527
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And then

528
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
you there were explorers you could play.

529
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
There were scientists

530
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
you could play. And then there were butler butler

531
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
house staff that you could play.

532
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
So I was a butler, an explorer

533
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
and a doctor. Okay. Okay.

534
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Gotcha.

535
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And in that way, does Colonel Plunder

536
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
come to you

537
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
or is that an existing character?

538
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Yeah. And so

539
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
he was an existing

540
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
character. I didn't have like

541
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
an example of somebody playing

542
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
it. And he just sort of had like a

543
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
is Colonel Plunder

544
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
was his deal.

545
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And yeah. And you and you just

546
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
had he was like he

547
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
liked adventure and was suave

548
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
and stuff like that. Okay. Sure.

549
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I feel a little good. I was just

550
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
going to say so like Colonel Plunder

551
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
was an existing character. Yes.

552
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Plunder was not a name I came up with.

553
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I remember that being given to me. But you would have

554
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
maybe like guidelines or no?

555
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Yeah. I mean the essential things were

556
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
like

557
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
you could essentially do whatever you

558
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
wanted.

559
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I knew that he was like adventurous.

560
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Right. You know.

561
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Club members

562
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
so like doctors and

563
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
explorers had to carry around a drink.

564
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And

565
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
and then that was it. You could just you just had

566
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
to go around and you had to

567
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
go up and talk to everyone at all of the

568
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
tables. And I don't remember

569
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
any of his like

570
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
log line except for that he was

571
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
his name was Plunder. Okay.

572
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
So yeah. You really could go nuts

573
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
with whatever a backstory

574
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
you wanted. Be like my wife

575
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
passed away today. Like you could really

576
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
bump people out if you wanted. You could

577
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
make them happy. Like who knows.

578
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Yes. And some people were really good

579
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
at that also. Like I didn't

580
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
have a my guy was just

581
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
always just like trying to have

582
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Plunder was always trying to have

583
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
fun. My butler was always like

584
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
he was kind of sniveling and

585
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
and you know like kind of you didn't

586
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
really like him. And

587
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
but like yeah

588
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
you could you could you

589
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
your story could be influenced by the

590
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
people you're talking to or the day you're having

591
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
or whatever. How would

592
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
you get evaluated

593
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
for your performance by like the owner.

594
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Okay. Yeah. So

595
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
the there was a head

596
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
of entertainment who

597
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
was the person who like you auditioned

598
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
for and who would would

599
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
rate you. And

600
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
it

601
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
mostly had to do with like

602
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
how well your because the because the

603
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
animatronics had had prerecorded

604
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
voices. Right. So like how well are you

605
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
are you matching those and like they

606
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
shouldn't sound different once

607
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
a person you know but there's also like

608
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
there's a variety of different

609
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
people all day playing all of the different

610
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
characters they're going to sound like how they're going to sound.

611
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
And then I think I think

612
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
it really was just like guest satisfaction

613
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
like right. If

614
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
if they're what they're there they're

615
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
watching you know they're the whoever

616
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
if it's not the entertainment head of entertainment

617
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
it's whoever is like the shift captain

618
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
for that day. And they're watching the monitors

619
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
there's cameras everywhere.

620
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
So that you can like talk to

621
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
you can like actually talk to the people

622
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
you know that's what the cameras are for. But like also

623
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
it's like well you haven't seen you at

624
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
this table. You haven't done this

625
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
you haven't done that. I see.

626
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I was just picturing like is there ever like an

627
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
undercover boss situation where somebody goes in there

628
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
and they're like Colonel Plunder do you like

629
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
exploring. And then you're

630
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
like no I don't. I don't like it.

631
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
There were

632
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
because the

633
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
the actual owner

634
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
and like people that knew the owner

635
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
were people that would also come all the time.

636
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
And you didn't know

637
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
you just didn't know.

638
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I don't even I can't tell you what the owner's

639
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
name was or what he even looked like.

640
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
But they would be there all the

641
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
like at any point that could be some

642
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
of the people that are there. So if you were like having

643
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
a slow day and you just didn't feel like going over

644
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
to the corner but you're like I was on that floor

645
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
you're screwed

646
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
if you didn't go and talk to specifically

647
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
them you know.

648
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
How often

649
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
are you encountering

650
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
people like

651
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
how often are people into it

652
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
doing it with you and how often have people

653
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
been dragged there or you're trying

654
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
to like poke holes in you

655
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
and the story. It happened too

656
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
many times that people didn't want to.

657
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I would say I would say

658
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
seventy five percent of the time people

659
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
are like jazzed.

660
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
People are like just

661
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
like I'm now

662
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
remembering to

663
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
the point of like getting a voice right. I

664
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
now remembering being the gargoyle

665
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
and talking to the entire crowd

666
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
and like some woman on like the

667
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
third floor being like is that Colonel Plunder?

668
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Screaming at me

669
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
and I'm trying to like

670
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
yeah like I was I didn't mask it enough

671
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
to like

672
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
so like most of the times

673
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
people were like that. But

674
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
whenever people were there and like

675
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
hating their lives it was like why did you come?

676
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Like don't come here.

677
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
We're in New York City.

678
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
It's infinite. You could go

679
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
be in a corner. You could be in a

680
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
like unpopulated.

681
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
You could sit at the corner of a sad bar

682
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
two feet away. Infinite places where

683
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
people will be rude to you as far as

684
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
wait staff is concerned. They will leave you alone

685
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
essentially. You don't have to do

686
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
improv with them. You could go across the street

687
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
to Outback Steakhouse or down

688
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
the street to lay Mrs. Rob

689
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
and just you know

690
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
just occupy yourself otherwise.

691
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Absolutely.

692
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I will feel that forever

693
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
about anything. Like

694
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
don't make

695
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I have to talk to you.

696
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
If I don't talk

697
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
to you I'm going to get they're going to say that

698
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
you were such and such as best friend and I'm going to

699
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
get fired or whatever. But you didn't have

700
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
to be here. You could have gotten

701
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
you know

702
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
jalapeno poppers from any number of other

703
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
popper establishments.

704
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Did you ever get hit with somebody who

705
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
was like too excited in the sense you were

706
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
like I'm Colonel Plunder or whatever and they're like

707
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
hello there. You're like whoa

708
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
no no no no too much. Yeah

709
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
plenty of people would come in and want to play

710
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
characters too.

711
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
We

712
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
we we also had

713
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
like people that like wanted to do it

714
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
but like didn't like you know like

715
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
didn't book or whatever and they would they would like

716
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
come in and be like

717
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
you know. Really? Yeah.

718
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Hangers hangers hang around

719
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
and kind of like yeah stuff like

720
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
that happened. I don't remember any. I wish I had

721
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
like a specific story of a time like somebody

722
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
was like playing to the third floor for an hour

723
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
before we realized he brought

724
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
his own car. He brought his own like cleaver in the

725
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
head from a Halloween

726
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
store. There was a guy there was a guy when I worked

727
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
retail at the container's door when

728
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I was like 21 or something. There's a guy

729
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
in the parking lot that bought an old cop car

730
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
and would come in and kind of show it around

731
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
and like he wanted you to get the

732
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
idea that he was a cop. Yeah. But he wasn't a cop.

733
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
So it's like

734
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
there were like Jekyll and Hyde people going

735
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
in there like doing voices and they kind of wanted people

736
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
to think maybe they were part of

737
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
it. Yeah I mean I don't I I

738
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
just recall people being like

739
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
excited about it on that level

740
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
but but never like

741
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
but never to that degree of like you

742
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
shouldn't be you have to go. Like get out.

743
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Not full like stolen valor.

744
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Where they were taking like orders or something.

745
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Yeah.

746
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
And to that point

747
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
it had to you had

748
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
to be separate. The

749
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
waitstaff could have fun

750
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
but we were the characters

751
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
and they were you know and like that

752
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
was always a weird strange like

753
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
they're having I do recall in terms

754
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
of the like scrutinizing like they're having

755
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
more fun with the waitstaff than they're having

756
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
with you guys.

757
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
You have to blah blah blah. That's something you're not

758
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
keeping up with. They're they're just like talking

759
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
to a friendly person who is regular.

760
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Did you ever get

761
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
approached by

762
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
did a customer ever go like

763
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
this fettuccine Alfredo is

764
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
cold. Can you send it back?

765
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Would you just have the flag down the waiter?

766
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
And and and that was

767
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
always weird and strange

768
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
because we're

769
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
supposed to be we're supposed

770
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
to be not employees. Yeah.

771
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
And like you'd have to like act

772
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
like whatever do you mean?

773
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I'm enjoying my drink.

774
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Talk to whatever you know.

775
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
You don't want to but then you want their satisfaction

776
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
to be right. Like they're at the point where

777
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
they're like if you don't do this for me

778
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I'm going to whatever raise hell

779
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
they can do. But they're like I haven't been

780
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
paying attention to any of this

781
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
as far as I know you are

782
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
the server. I didn't look anyone in

783
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
the eye in any part of this. So

784
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
it would be funnier if they were yelling

785
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
all this at the gargoyle though. Yeah.

786
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Right. Yeah.

787
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Can I just put it in your mouth and you'll take it somewhere?

788
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Yeah. Can you ingest this and

789
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
do your pipes go back to the kitchen

790
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
somehow? This burger is supposed to

791
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
have bacon on it and it doesn't.

792
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Yeah. This

793
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
is very funny to hear like how

794
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
intense this was because

795
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
the TripAdvisor

796
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
reviews from like

797
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
2021 and

798
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
2022 are all about

799
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
COVID protocols and

800
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
coupon errors. Yeah.

801
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
And like that is such

802
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
that's such a bummer that that is

803
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
how like it eventually fold

804
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
it is like they didn't honor a

805
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
coupon right.

806
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I mean I feel like that was

807
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I can I can I can understand

808
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
why people were probably

809
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
upset about COVID protocols given how it

810
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
was when I was there.

811
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I mean I don't I it was a we

812
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
had the vibe that it felt like corners

813
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
were trying to be cut as much as

814
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
possible. But but I can't

815
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
speak I can't speak that wasn't there then but like

816
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I can I can understand you know

817
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
and I can imagine like

818
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
people were mad about like Groupon's not being

819
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
honored the whole

820
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
time like the entirety of them.

821
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Part of the if you're if you're involved

822
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
in getting Groupon's like

823
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
chances are you're kind of excited

824
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
to maybe go write some reviews about

825
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
them not being that's part of the Groupon

826
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
experience. Yeah. Disatisfaction

827
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
with the Groupon experience. I also

828
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
remember the vibe of stuff like that being like

829
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
being like you would go to a

830
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
higher up if someone did come to you about

831
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
a problem you'd be like they're worried about this and

832
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
they'd be like I don't know what that is

833
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
would be that would be would be the top

834
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
person I can talk to his reaction to that

835
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
thing.

836
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
There's no way to handle it or

837
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
or or deal with it at that point

838
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
when they're just like what even is that

839
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
you know and then walking away. Yeah.

840
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Especially if you're dressed as a knight

841
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
in that scenario.

842
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Okay.

843
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
The characters

844
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
and all this this

845
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
was one of the things that was like

846
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
really fogging my

847
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
brain as I was getting ready for this

848
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
because okay

849
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
it's called Jekyll and Hyde Club

850
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
and it's kind of you know if all right if you read the

851
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
description of the place it is like Dr.

852
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Jekyll assembled many unusual friends

853
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
souvenirs and artifacts in his quest to

854
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
rid himself of Mr. Hyde.

855
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
So that's what okay these are all

856
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
it's all things he did to try to go

857
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
cold turkey on being Mr. Hyde.

858
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Now I'm even more confused

859
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
actually but we brought them all together.

860
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
So it's like a place for his his wares and

861
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
what he's collecting. So okay so we're not going to meet

862
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Jekyll while doing

863
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
this. We are going to meet a doctor and there

864
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
will be like like bringing a thing to life

865
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
but the like

866
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
is that between their own website

867
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
and reviews of the

868
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
place it went on

869
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
and on and on the amount of characters

870
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
and mythology usually

871
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
in ways where I could

872
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
not tell which one is an animatronic

873
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
and which one would have been

874
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
you or one of your friends.

875
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Nowhere is there

876
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
delineation to where I was

877
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
reading you know I'm reading about like Tobias

878
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Bloodworth okay and then

879
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
it took me like a couple days to

880
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
realize Tobias Bloodworth is a is a

881
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
werewolf head. That's not a guy

882
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
walking around because nothing in that

883
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
name tells me Tobias Bloodworth could

884
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
be a guy. Don't know.

885
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
We I believe met Tobias

886
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Bloodworth. I went through

887
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
our videos. We were there so we were there in April

888
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
2022.

889
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
The place I believe closed one month

890
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
later. We were right there

891
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
and the whole vibe Mike was it was it not

892
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
very like you

893
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
couldn't tell if the it was

894
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
like wow it's themed to being a

895
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
place that is very like full of

896
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
decay. Oh it's falling apart.

897
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Oh what a maculately

898
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
created old

899
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
restaurant that's been lived in

900
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
for centuries. Such accurate

901
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
cobwebs and dust

902
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
and that stench whatever could be

903
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
and it's empty to give you that

904
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
eerie feeling of who's around the corner

905
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
wow what have they done this magical

906
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
place. The floorboard

907
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
is loose. So well I'm

908
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
glad to know that because I was

909
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
there a good 10-15

910
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
years prior that they maintained

911
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
their

912
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
like the blurred

913
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
lines between is this thing messed

914
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
up or is it.

915
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
And I say that having never

916
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
been to the Times Square location which

917
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
from the outside looked like it was like

918
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
nice in there. Do you know what I mean

919
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
like that they like it was

920
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
you know newly it was newly built so it had

921
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
to be like things were like fresh and

922
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
working well and

923
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
every every animatronic like

924
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
moved with a glide

925
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
instead of like a you know creak.

926
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Yeah yeah yeah yes like it's

927
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
dying as it's turning on

928
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
yes jittering.

929
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
But anyway I brought up to say that

930
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Tobias Bloodworth or whatever

931
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
the wolf the werewolf I was looking at

932
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
that I'm filming doing a line of dialogue

933
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
red eyes glowing

934
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
and just mouth not opening

935
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
or closing in anyway

936
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
just firmly on there. And then let me

937
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
like I'm just going to say some names

938
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
tell me if you have any associations with these names

939
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
even if it's just. I recalled Bloodworth but

940
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
could not remember that it was a werewolf head I'll say

941
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
that. Okay okay sure. That'll give you my

942
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
frame of reference. Oh do you remember the name the

943
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
last name of the doctor unless this

944
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
is a different doctor character is that somewhere

945
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
in there. There were various doctor characters

946
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
so okay so

947
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
because we weren't all the same

948
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
doctor and even sometimes

949
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
this was always a thing like if someone predominantly

950
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
played a doctor character

951
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
when you when you arrived

952
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
you were like told like you're this

953
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
role you're that role you're the you're the you're the other

954
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
you know but like there couldn't be two

955
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
doctors at the same time

956
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
you know and that would always be confusing

957
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
and so and so sometimes that would happen

958
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
just for someone being like

959
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
this costume's clean or whatever like

960
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
the other one.

961
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
But so they were all different

962
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
you know. If you get you had to be like technically

963
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
be a dentist or something.

964
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I know I'm in a lab coat but

965
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
what I saw a lot

966
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
was a doctor named

967
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Dr. Hackenoff. Okay.

968
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Saw that a lot. A maid

969
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
named Tippi Toppingsworth. Yes.

970
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
You remember Tippi Toppingsworth.

971
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
What was the name

972
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
of the actor

973
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
who played I think

974
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Sarah I can't remember her

975
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
last name but I remember a Tippi I remember a Tippi

976
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
like being present like

977
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
and she

978
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
she had a you

979
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
every time she like entered or exited

980
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
a room.

981
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
It was always fun when Tippi showed up.

982
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
That's a character I get a sense of the character

983
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
crowd pleaser. Uh huh. Uh huh.

984
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Dr. Sawyer Bones.

985
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I like that.

986
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
What you could tell me was the full name

987
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
of the lead character on the show Bones.

988
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
As far as I know. Sure.

989
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Dr. Sawyer Bones. David Boreanus was Dr. Sawyer

990
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Bones. It might have been.

991
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I'll never know or not know.

992
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Aloysius

993
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Gould the wacky chief

994
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
mortician. Yes.

995
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
You got Jervis.

996
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Were you Jervis maybe?

997
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Maybe that was a butler. Yeah Jervis might have been

998
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
the name of my of my butler

999
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
character.

1000
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Sort of

1001
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
butler.

1002
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
That's good. That's where he was.

1003
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
So that feels like a

1004
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Jervis to me. I wonder if you're gonna like keep talking

1005
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I'll be like no that was the I feel like

1006
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I remember Plunder the most because

1007
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
that was my first guy.

1008
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
And then you know over time you're doing

1009
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
like 12 hour

1010
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
you know 16 hour

1011
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
it's like I don't remember. Did you do that many?

1012
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I don't think 16 hours was how long

1013
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
but I would do you would do double 12 hour

1014
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
14 hour

1015
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
doubles. Did you lose your mind

1016
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
being in that space?

1017
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Absolutely. I mean it's probably why I can't

1018
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
remember any of it but like yeah you would

1019
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
and you would and I think

1020
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
in the event of a double you would be

1021
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
the same character all day. You

1022
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
wouldn't like you wouldn't like switch I don't

1023
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
know yeah because that could be potentially confusing

1024
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
for anyone that was.

1025
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Who was there all who was also there for 12 hours

1026
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
as a customer. Why are they still here?

1027
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Would you get stuck like Austin

1028
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Butler playing Elvis?

1029
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Would you come home and be like

1030
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
hello there? Yeah yeah I mean

1031
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
that would that would happen to a to

1032
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
a degree like after afterwards

1033
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I just

1034
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
remember like

1035
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I just

1036
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
remember like leaving and sort of still

1037
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
talking to people like in my t-shirt as

1038
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
like you know like

1039
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
you know

1040
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
but never like

1041
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I'm so method. Not too long.

1042
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
But a little like maybe

1043
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
you stop somewhere in Times Square like stop

1044
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
at the Gap or something and you're like

1045
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
just a quick interaction with the employee

1046
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
and you still have a little bit of a voice going.

1047
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Why'd you say the word prithee?

1048
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Why'd you say pray tell?

1049
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
While ordering tacos.

1050
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I'll just rip through

1051
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Gertrude K. Boom

1052
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Dr. Brain

1053
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Major Michael Magoo

1054
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Philip Andrew Edward Carrington

1055
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
the fourth. Now we're into somewhere there's no

1056
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
like pun

1057
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
or anything. I don't know what this is. I don't know

1058
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
what kind of monster you are. Priscilla

1059
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Plank. Ariel Boatsman.

1060
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
That's just almost a plain name.

1061
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
That's what I'm saying. And then you're

1062
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
throwing out plunder. You're throwing out ones I've never

1063
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
seen. And then it still keeps going.

1064
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Sydney Feamer and Marty Patella

1065
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
and Sydney Feamer

1066
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Okay. Okay.

1067
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I also never know if any of these were in the pub as opposed

1068
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
to the club. There's some confusion

1069
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
there. Yeah. I mean there were some

1070
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I think

1071
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I don't think there was anything that was

1072
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
pub exclusive

1073
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
because club

1074
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
where I spent most of my time was the offshoot

1075
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
of that. So I think that they like

1076
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
had the handful of things that were there

1077
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I think. And then

1078
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
and then expanded on that. Sure. Sure.

1079
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I

1080
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Mike any other memories of our time

1081
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
at pub since that's the biggest

1082
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
overlap. I mean

1083
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
it was it was memorable

1084
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
and yet when we were talking about it

1085
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
on stage two hours later

1086
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I just I just I felt like I've been

1087
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
like I feel like I've been hit

1088
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
by like a bunch of soft bats or something

1089
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
like nothing that hurt me

1090
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
but it was confusing. It just

1091
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
left me in like I felt like

1092
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I've been soft pummeled you know

1093
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
to where I recall nothing too

1094
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
specific. I could not make some big

1095
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
judgment about the place. Yeah

1096
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I didn't have anything like so

1097
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
profound to say about it nor do I have

1098
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
anything to say about it in that way now

1099
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
but it felt like yeah like you went into that

1100
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Halloween section of the Home Depot

1101
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
and it was really squeaky

1102
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
like all the all the robots were extra

1103
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
squeaky and then the one perform human

1104
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
performer was

1105
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
really good I felt. Yes.

1106
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
But it was one of those things where

1107
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
the pressure now because you're like the only

1108
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
table in there is that you need to be

1109
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
the audience for this guy. Yeah. And I get

1110
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
very anxious when it comes to that.

1111
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
I get very anxious when there's like a person doing like

1112
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
close up magic right on top of me

1113
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
because I really want to perform

1114
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
for these people. I want to be like yes

1115
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
or yes so funny or whatever but then I

1116
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
start to get like oh my god I'm going to have to like put

1117
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
it on but it's maybe it's going to sound fake if I'm not impressed

1118
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
or I don't think what he's saying is funny.

1119
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
So I felt the pressure of that where it was like

1120
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
if he kind of just did a quick glancing

1121
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
blow of a joke at us

1122
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
great but I felt like oh he's here he's

1123
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
still here he's still here. Yeah.

1124
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
And I'll say the quick

1125
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
glancing

1126
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
blurting out a joke is

1127
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
how I preferred to be

1128
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
because I'm I'm that way

1129
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
in both scenarios. I'm like I'm

1130
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
feeling uncomfortable being directly

1131
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
in front like having to perform directly

1132
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
in someone's face and I'm also feeling

1133
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
uncomfortable if I'm the if I'm the audience

1134
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
member as well. But

1135
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
you had to stay. Yeah. You could

1136
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
not you couldn't if you did if

1137
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
you did that they someone would

1138
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
know and and and that was the other

1139
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
thing about but that was the other thing about the pub

1140
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
that was nice was you that you didn't

1141
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
have that as much oversight as you did

1142
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
at the club. So if

1143
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
you wanted to kind of be a little bit more casual

1144
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
you could but it would somehow

1145
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
get back like somehow they knew like someone

1146
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
would find Dr. Jekyll would find out.

1147
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Yeah. Yeah. And we

1148
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
were also we had been up to like 6 a.m.

1149
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
the night before. Yes.

1150
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
He slept about three hours.

1151
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Jason didn't make it. Jason wasn't quite there.

1152
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I didn't make it. I guess I

1153
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
went to the CVS clinic that morning too. All right. It's been two years.

1154
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I'll say now I drank too much

1155
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
rye whiskey at an SNL after

1156
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
party and I woke up with

1157
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
like a froggy voice. You sure did.

1158
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
So then I yeah

1159
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
and that's why the last

1160
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
time I really drank whiskey.

1161
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Oh wow. Oh geez.

1162
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
A lesson learned. We had a boil

1163
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I had a Boilermaker when we were celebrating

1164
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
the city the end of the City Walk

1165
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Saga. Okay. And that was

1166
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
the first time in years.

1167
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
It was a whiskey on retirement. Yeah.

1168
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
So but we had a show

1169
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
to do that night

1170
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
and you guys were like we're going to

1171
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Jekyll and Hyde. I was like I need

1172
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
to stay at the hotel. I'm alternating

1173
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
cold water and hot tea

1174
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
to heal my voice

1175
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
and I'm sure they have

1176
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
both of those things.

1177
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
How many doctors are there

1178
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
at any given night. They could have fixed it in no

1179
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
problem. Oh yes. Perhaps leeches

1180
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
for you.

1181
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I had also fallen.

1182
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Jaynes the

1183
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
intensity of management kind

1184
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
of makes sense because when we were planning

1185
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
this trip to New York I

1186
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
looked at the website

1187
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
and I was like oh my god it's like

1188
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
50 or 60 bucks

1189
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
a head and you got to buy dinner

1190
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
and there's a show and like. This is

1191
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
where Jaynes you made the

1192
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
decision back at Holland.

1193
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
That had nothing to do with the whiskey.

1194
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
There was timed

1195
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
entries. There was timed

1196
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
stuff and I was like guys I don't know if we'll be able

1197
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
to do that and then Griffin's like no

1198
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
it's just a bar you just walk in and

1199
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
it's empty. And it's like oh okay.

1200
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Especially at that time.

1201
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
But of course I want to follow the rules

1202
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
so I maybe at the time might have still been like

1203
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
okay but you know our timed entry

1204
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
it says 320 not 310

1205
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
is that okay? And then walking in and like oh no one

1206
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
is here. There is no human being in this.

1207
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
There are more robots. It's a shame

1208
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
that they implemented

1209
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
stuff like that when

1210
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
no one was there

1211
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
because we would have

1212
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
there's like a thing that happened I don't know

1213
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
about at the pub but at the club there's

1214
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
like a show that happens to

1215
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
even bring you in.

1216
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
So we would have to like sometimes

1217
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
in the winter be like you have to wait

1218
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
while the show happens for

1219
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
whoever's walking you know in.

1220
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
It's some little like it's an equivalent

1221
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
sorry of the like

1222
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
you know like the haunted mansion

1223
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
like you're in an elevator

1224
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
or the stretching room before you go into the

1225
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
ride. They like hold you in a place

1226
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
to like kind of set the scene. Exactly.

1227
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Exactly like that. That like ends with

1228
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
like I think there's like

1229
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
we're all gonna die!

1230
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Enjoy your meal. You know like

1231
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
is what the Bible that was. But I think it

1232
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
takes like a couple minutes. And

1233
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
and yeah we would always I feel like

1234
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
it was it probably is better to be

1235
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
like yeah you set a time and you come

1236
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
at this time and then everyone comes in you know.

1237
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Did you have to hold people out

1238
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
in the cold while people got through?

1239
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
There are

1240
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
a number of views of like

1241
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
we had to stand outside despite it

1242
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
being 30 degrees.

1243
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
We were not allowed to use the bathrooms

1244
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
if we were.

1245
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Can we just pop in? No, no, no.

1246
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
The bookcase swings.

1247
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
You had to go

1248
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
through that experience. You had to hear

1249
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
I believe it was a

1250
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
a butler up front or a

1251
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
butler or maid or whatever house

1252
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
worker would

1253
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
do whatever their spiel was. And you had

1254
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
to have that experience in order to go in.

1255
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
There was no other way to get in.

1256
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Yeah literally there's no side entrance.

1257
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
There's an exit.

1258
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
So there's an exit

1259
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
right next to it. So sometimes you would

1260
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
come out like you'd be done with your shift and someone would try

1261
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
to get in and you'd have to like

1262
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
you'd have to make sure they didn't get in.

1263
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Still at work for like 30

1264
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
seconds.

1265
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Technically you could go through

1266
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
the kitchen but you don't want to do that.

1267
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
You don't want to let customers in that way.

1268
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Wow.

1269
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
So much funny procedure.

1270
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Can I ask how long

1271
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
did you work there for?

1272
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I was there for about a year and a half.

1273
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Which is not enough time.

1274
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
That's enough time to like you did it.

1275
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Maybe you didn't get too sick of it.

1276
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Or did you? How do you feel?

1277
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
From the beginning of the experience to the end.

1278
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
I think it's that thing where

1279
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I like really

1280
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
was excited about the job.

1281
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
And it had a variety of different

1282
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
things that would like reinvent

1283
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
it. Like oh now you're playing this character.

1284
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Now you're playing that character. Now you get to go to the

1285
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
pub. I think the owner also like had like

1286
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
he also had like

1287
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
a couple

1288
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
amusement parks. I remember like doing a day

1289
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
somewhere like somewhere else you know.

1290
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Oh in his little sister.

1291
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Yeah in Long Island.

1292
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Yeah okay. Yes. That must

1293
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
be it. I forget the name of it.

1294
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Bayville Adventure Park. Yes.

1295
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
I think that's exactly it. And you could go

1296
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
as

1297
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I went as an explorer

1298
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
because I guess teamed into

1299
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
like tied into

1300
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
adventure. But like so there were things

1301
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
that like would

1302
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
reinvent it. But I was ultimately

1303
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
like it was

1304
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
it was like a job. There was a point where it became

1305
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
a job and not like as fun as

1306
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
it was. Yeah. Yeah. Which a funny

1307
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
thing for that to become

1308
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
rote is turning out like you

1309
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
listlessly doing

1310
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
welcome fellow travelers.

1311
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
No I was just like

1312
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
today's special is jalapeno

1313
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
poppers.

1314
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
It really is. That's also funny that it's like

1315
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
it's an assembly of the

1316
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
creepiest kooks and the most

1317
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
you know odd ducks from all

1318
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
over. And you're in like vaguely the

1319
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
late 1800s.

1320
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Maybe seemingly you know it's hard

1321
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
to like you don't end up in the area of like

1322
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
what is that strange device.

1323
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Right. But bacon

1324
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
on top of macaroni and

1325
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
cheese.

1326
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Now I have seen everything.

1327
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
The

1328
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
food is very for it being

1329
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
like you know that you're going to

1330
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
like old foggy London town

1331
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
and then the food is like spinach

1332
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
and cheese dip nacho chili supreme

1333
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
margarita chicken

1334
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
quesadilla.

1335
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I saw the New York

1336
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Times did a review of this

1337
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
place where they called the pasta

1338
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
there they called the pasta sauce

1339
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
red tinged

1340
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
water. Sure. Sure.

1341
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
And granted then the guy

1342
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
even he wasn't even being that harsh

1343
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
he's like I was there with my nephew

1344
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
and niece. And what do you want

1345
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
at that age for red tinged water.

1346
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
I serve this at home to my

1347
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
four year old. That's exactly what he wants.

1348
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
You got they're vaguely

1349
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
themed with the

1350
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
you got a mummy burger you got a baddie burger.

1351
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
That was something I couldn't remember was if the

1352
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
if the food was was themed

1353
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
or not. A little. But then baddie

1354
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
burger is like cheddar cheese

1355
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
lettuce tomato onion and

1356
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
a pickle.

1357
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
What does the baddie come in. Well the

1358
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
mummy burger should be wrapped in something.

1359
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Right. Which it certainly wasn't.

1360
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Sauteed mushrooms

1361
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
swiss cheese that almost with the

1362
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
holes it almost looks like the

1363
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
you could wrap it. The netting around

1364
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
the cut up bandages all over your hand.

1365
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I guess you could wrap it in bacon.

1366
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Oh.

1367
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
So it would be a ton of bacon but still it would be wrapped

1368
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
in you. It kind of looks like decaying

1369
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
skin. You could put it in like one of those paper

1370
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
little wrappers like in and out comes.

1371
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
So that might work. Yeah.

1372
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Yeah. That would have been cool.

1373
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I don't think we did it. They did anything like that.

1374
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I think it was all like it's this by name

1375
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
solely. You know

1376
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
but like yeah. That's such a

1377
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
that's like problem number one for any

1378
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
themed restaurant is that the food

1379
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
sucks or

1380
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
is unimaginative and then it

1381
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
starts out that way generally

1382
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
and then just quickly goes very very

1383
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
far downhill. Yeah. Yeah.

1384
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
You know there's at least at some point there was

1385
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
a conversation with this with some

1386
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
like you know

1387
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
like edible

1388
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
to like concocted a

1389
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
strange array of like you know

1390
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
that like budgetarily they started by talking

1391
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
to a guy who invented 70 things

1392
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
that look like you're like and it's like you're pulling

1393
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
the top off and it's brains but the brains is

1394
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
really a steak and it's just painted and then at

1395
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
some point it becomes it's

1396
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
look it's gotta be potato skins. There's no other way

1397
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
we're gonna make money. There's a place where there's a

1398
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
truck that will come here and bring us potato skins

1399
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
and we heat them up and that is the end of this operation.

1400
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
It's the same thing we've talked about forever

1401
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
is that it's like dad is gonna get

1402
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
confused. He looks at the menu

1403
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
we can't have dad be

1404
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
confused. We were at Disneyland

1405
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
yesterday I suggested my dad eat shawarma

1406
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
what is shawarma

1407
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
that turned into a whole other thing. Like it's the food

1408
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
that you it's the same food you have

1409
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
everywhere else rearranged

1410
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
slightly. It's chicken and it's out

1411
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
chicken and bread basically.

1412
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I remember the food. I remember

1413
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
the idea of the food

1414
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
was that it was pretty bad

1415
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
but you got a shift meal depending on how long

1416
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
what time you arrived or how long

1417
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
your shift was and I just remember like

1418
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
needing it. I was also like

1419
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
you know very poor at the time even though

1420
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
I have this job and blah blah blah

1421
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
but like being like there is

1422
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
a you know

1423
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
a vat of

1424
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
a casserole

1425
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
I'm gonna eat this whatever and it is like

1426
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
it's watery it's a

1427
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
soup it's a casserole but it's a soup you know

1428
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
but I'm like I'm eating this I need it.

1429
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
It's here it's the yeah yeah yeah yes

1430
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
I had the I got

1431
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
the blandest pizza of my entire

1432
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
life but it was before

1433
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
like before shows

1434
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
not to get too processed I'm just like

1435
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I'm usually not hungry but I'm like but I

1436
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
have to eat so I don't faint

1437
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
so I essentially want a paste

1438
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I want paste on top of

1439
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
mush and that is kind of

1440
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
what I got out of this and it was honestly

1441
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
absurd I'll always be

1442
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
fond of any food that helped me not faint

1443
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
somewhere so

1444
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I give it up to the pizza. Do you have any

1445
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
mush that will be good for my blood sugar

1446
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
levels? Blood sugar mush

1447
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
is really what I'm looking for

1448
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
oh fries just get the fries got it

1449
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
thank you. But fries sometimes taste

1450
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
like something well these no no no don't

1451
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
worry about that. There

1452
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
are like if you get bad steak

1453
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
fries right those are the sort of the thicker

1454
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
fries yeah if you get bad

1455
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
steak fries those are still good usually as long

1456
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
as like as long as they're not like rotten

1457
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
yeah no the sort of

1458
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
soggier the

1459
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
the sort of like lack

1460
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
of being done the better

1461
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
with the steak fries. Yeah yeah yeah

1462
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
that's true. Did I have I'm going back

1463
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
just existing yeah yeah do you you know what

1464
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
I have I have one video that might be worth

1465
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
playing yeah this is this is a

1466
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Sphinx head this is my main memory of it

1467
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
because this was the Sphinx

1468
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
okay I'm glad I brought up the Sphinx then okay

1469
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
this is a big part of it this I mean it's

1470
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
my main memory before I

1471
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
started diving in this week

1472
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
and here is

1473
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
the audio

1474
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
it's just like the lower jaw

1475
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
is going and this is right above our heads

1476
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
could not be closer to us and I think the audio

1477
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
will paint a real picture of it

1478
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
it's like it's a telegraph machine

1479
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
yeah

1480
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
yeah so I forgot that

1481
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
looking at that that that image

1482
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
because that's at the that's the pub

1483
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Sphinx yeah the pub Sphinx

1484
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
is has color

1485
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
to the face

1486
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
right to the to the design

1487
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
blue and then the eyes blue

1488
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
oh you had a much better view that

1489
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
looks great from where you are the Sphinx at

1490
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
but it sounds exactly the same

1491
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
the course of the future

1492
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
yeah we had to like

1493
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
ooh we're the Sphinx

1494
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
I can't remember what the voice reference was but like

1495
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
this is where he lived

1496
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
the drive time DJ guy

1497
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
the party man

1498
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
the cool horizon

1499
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
he was a fun one

1500
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
but I think we were told

1501
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
him and Fang who

1502
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
this is not going to sound like Peter

1503
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Laurie but this was how the

1504
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Sphinx the Fang was supposed to sound

1505
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Fang was the gargoyle

1506
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
yeah and those are the two that were like

1507
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
fun to do but it was always

1508
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
like you had one that you liked

1509
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
to play so it was like you can't

1510
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
you gotta switch it up you can't

1511
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
just be the Sphinx although you can't just do

1512
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
okay okay which is good to make you a more

1513
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
well-rounded performer to find your

1514
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
in on characters who

1515
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
aren't exactly yours that's that's good

1516
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
training yeah but the thing

1517
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I was saying I just remember that the Sphinx

1518
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
in Minntown was he's just

1519
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
like brown

1520
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
he's just like you know like stone

1521
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
and yeah

1522
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
and so that's I guess one of the potential

1523
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
differences but same deal just his

1524
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
just his goatee

1525
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
moved you know you're puppeting

1526
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
it if you're doing it yeah and so it was just

1527
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
like it was like an arcade game

1528
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
was how you would puppet them there's like a joystick

1529
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
and like a couple buttons

1530
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
and yeah anyway and

1531
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I had I had like songs

1532
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
that I would like to sort of like every now and

1533
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
again like if I didn't if I didn't

1534
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
want to play a character at the moment I would like

1535
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
put a song on

1536
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
as as

1537
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
like like the

1538
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
there's a there's a doctor with a two-headed

1539
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
doctor on the third floor and

1540
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
and I would do Monster Mash for like

1541
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
whoever was sitting in that corner with a

1542
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
doctor got the biggest show but everyone

1543
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
would I would like turn on other puppets you know

1544
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
what I mean like so everyone's a part

1545
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
of the little multiple get your hands

1546
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
a couple

1547
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
it was fun

1548
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I remember another

1549
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
strong memory I know actually I forgot

1550
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
until looking at videos I'm so glad I remember now

1551
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
that the there is a

1552
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
like they do have a version of the like

1553
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
he's alive kind of like a Frankenstein

1554
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
that was the power show yeah okay

1555
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
okay I think this was entirely

1556
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
oh maybe the performer was in it but it's like

1557
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
a it like a kind of a metal

1558
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
bed descends from the ceiling and

1559
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
then the thing sits up and there's a lot

1560
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
there's narration pre-recorded narration

1561
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
about how like he's out of control

1562
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
get him with the tranquilizer

1563
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
but he's doing nothing

1564
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
there essentially so you just gotta

1565
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
take their word for it but then

1566
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
that video ends then I go to the next

1567
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
like oh what's happening in the next and it seems

1568
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
as though the creature coming

1569
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
to life then gave way to a full restaurant

1570
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
performance of I got

1571
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
the power

1572
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
and watching us all

1573
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
kind of like confusedly listlessly

1574
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
danced to I got the power

1575
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
over with some

1576
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
some house white wine at

1577
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
4pm at an empty restaurant

1578
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
it's a vibe it was something

1579
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
I'm glad I got to

1580
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
you know did I get a real New York

1581
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
experience could I have done something cooler

1582
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
with a more cultured thing yes

1583
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
but you know

1584
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
you gotta go with what's up your alley

1585
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
so alright

1586
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
let me just call out details before we

1587
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
wind it down here

1588
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
let's see I don't know there were skeletons

1589
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
who play the piano and their heads

1590
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
spin around any other just big

1591
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
images that you're like well that's a thing

1592
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
you can't bring it up with I mean the sphinx clearly one

1593
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
of them yeah the

1594
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
I'm remembering the skeletons now and they had

1595
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
like they had like set songs

1596
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
that they would that they would sing

1597
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
two headed

1598
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
doctor I'm trying to go through the floors

1599
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
what were the main

1600
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
puppets that you would

1601
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
do let me ask was

1602
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
there a magician

1603
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
I saw people mention a wandering

1604
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
magician yeah yeah

1605
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
I there were

1606
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
club members so like the club members

1607
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
were like adventurers and there were also magicians

1608
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
I don't recall anyone actually doing

1609
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
magic if that makes sense

1610
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
so like it would be like your character was a magician

1611
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
that could

1612
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
could do magic

1613
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
seemingly do magic

1614
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
but I don't recall there being any any actors at the time

1615
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
that I was there I could actually do it

1616
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
there there was one review that said

1617
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
the lovely

1618
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
they had been there once before and they

1619
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
said the lovely magician is

1620
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
gone and replaced by

1621
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
an annoying old man who comes around

1622
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
to the tables

1623
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
so just

1624
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
imagine just all these characters

1625
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
that it's like alright your father time

1626
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
go bother them

1627
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
like

1628
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
but it's like depending on the time

1629
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
that you come there's all these set

1630
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
things that happen but there will be different characters

1631
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
the lovely magician might be back another

1632
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
time right you know that was a thing for

1633
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
people needed to remember they could

1634
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
maybe just came at the wrong time

1635
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
your best bet is to just go

1636
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
if you're gonna go once go three times

1637
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
that week yeah different times of the day

1638
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
oh yeah and turnover was always

1639
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
was really high like I was there for

1640
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
for you know a year and change

1641
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
and that's long for

1642
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
like people that are just like trying to get their equity

1643
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
card in bounds

1644
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
that happened a lot you know

1645
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
generally solid run for you

1646
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
that sounded also like that person was maybe like

1647
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
was smitten with the magician

1648
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
the lovely magician

1649
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
would guests ever

1650
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
which episode was it

1651
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
we were talking about how there would be fans of specific

1652
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
people playing Disney Princesses it was the Amanda

1653
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Lund episode in Tokyo Disney

1654
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
specifically would people come in that were

1655
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
super fans of yours

1656
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
I didn't have anybody

1657
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
that like was a soccer

1658
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
of me in that

1659
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
in that way

1660
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
I do remember like

1661
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
I'm thinking back to that woman that was like

1662
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
is that Colonel Blunt you know I do

1663
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
remember there being times where people would be like

1664
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
you're my favorite of the day

1665
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
you know like oh I'm so glad

1666
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
you're here you know I don't like that

1667
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
that other you know but

1668
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
there weren't any like

1669
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
I fortunately

1670
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
didn't have anybody that was like following

1671
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
me home or like waiting outside

1672
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
when you get off the shift

1673
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
and could you stay in character when you're out

1674
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
let's get a drink but you

1675
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
have to have a vague British

1676
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
accent

1677
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
don't tell me you are not slightly

1678
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
British or this is over

1679
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
the Girls Next Door

1680
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
went to this

1681
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
they made Hef go here

1682
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
I went and watched the episode

1683
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
I've been missing out also on Girls Next

1684
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Door clearly a fine broadcast

1685
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
I used to watch it but I don't remember that

1686
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
episode

1687
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
season one they were there early on

1688
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Hef had to like kind of clap along

1689
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
while like the lady did

1690
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
some like blood curdling

1691
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
somebody mistook him for one of the skeletons on the wall

1692
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
how'd you come loose

1693
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
nail him back up

1694
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
wow really realistic

1695
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
though

1696
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
when the girl's touching pure ash comes out of his mouth

1697
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
who's puppeting this guy

1698
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
so there's that you know hey it's a hot spot

1699
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Hef is there things are working out great

1700
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
but I think the Times Square

1701
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
location stretched him

1702
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
kind of thin because that goes

1703
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
I think the other one that you worked at

1704
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
on 7th I think

1705
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
merges with Times Square but then Times Square

1706
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
goes down because that's a high pressure place

1707
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
to do something meanwhile they were

1708
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
trying to expand they did

1709
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Chicago and they did

1710
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Dallas they did

1711
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
it was at one of the mills

1712
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Grapevine mills

1713
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
okay thank you yes

1714
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
and neither of those

1715
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
made it very long Chicago is now

1716
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
in Italy that's what that is

1717
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
and then Dallas

1718
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
can't be mad at that

1719
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
it makes sense

1720
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
I love a good Italy

1721
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
that is a four story business

1722
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
establishment where the model

1723
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
makes sense

1724
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
so that they start going

1725
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
down the other ones I believe the mills one

1726
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
is a became

1727
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
an indoor skate park and now it's a

1728
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Legoland thing so people just

1729
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
across the country did not have it

1730
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
in their heart to accept these 1800s

1731
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
theatrics

1732
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
and then it's so then it's down to one

1733
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
it's down to the pub

1734
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
but it was not looking so great when

1735
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
we were there and I think even then they had already

1736
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
declared bankruptcy

1737
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
oh and the

1738
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
whole enterprise was not doing well

1739
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
in 2013 already

1740
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
because it was announced that they owed two million dollars

1741
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
to their landlord

1742
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
yeah I was going to say I thought that we were done

1743
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
that I was surprised when

1744
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
when Times Square happened

1745
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I was like how like on what

1746
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
yeah you're in there

1747
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
and part

1748
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
of the appeal was that we weren't

1749
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
you could have an experience like this

1750
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
and you're not like having to fight through

1751
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
everybody to get to like Madame Tussauds or whatever

1752
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
like it's like being

1753
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
not in Times Square was what was like

1754
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
good about it to a degree

1755
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
a little off the beaten path, yeah yeah

1756
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
it's around a corner

1757
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
you're not fighting crowds, sure sure sure

1758
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
but were you also in there going like

1759
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
even in success are you like

1760
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
this seems weird

1761
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
how does this place exist?

1762
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
I'll also say like I

1763
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
to it being off the beaten path

1764
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
I worked at New Year's Eve there

1765
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
once and it's like one of my

1766
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
most memorable New Year's

1767
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
because it was like afterwards you could

1768
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
just leave like I was there

1769
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
and you could go through to like

1770
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
12.30 maybe 1 a.m.

1771
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
but you could just leave there's no traffic

1772
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
there was no people there was no nothing

1773
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
because of how far away it was

1774
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
wow

1775
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
and everybody that was there was like

1776
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
like everyone wanted to be there

1777
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
you know like

1778
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
better than I've never understood

1779
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
being there in the Times Square when the ball drops

1780
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
that seems like an absolutely

1781
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
that is the

1782
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
last place I want to be

1783
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
has anybody ever done it for some

1784
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
like no I've never done it

1785
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
you have to stay there too right like for like 8 hours

1786
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
you can't yeah you're there and you can't

1787
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
go to the bathroom you can't do anything you're stuck

1788
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
you have to like pee in your pants

1789
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
but that's what I was saying

1790
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
take a diaper and then you do

1791
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
you have to pee in a diaper

1792
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
you are baby new year

1793
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
everyone in Times Square is baby new year that night

1794
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
and they pee and poop

1795
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
and it's cold it'll harden up it'll be like

1796
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
just like you're wearing like a second layer

1797
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
you're wearing an ice diaper

1798
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
it'll freeze the diaper to your balls

1799
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
your pee will freeze to your balls

1800
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
sucks

1801
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
the like odd structure of it

1802
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
this is where I'm like yeah like when did

1803
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
this ever seem like it was doing well because there's bankruptcy

1804
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
and then they owed 2 million dollars

1805
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
and the

1806
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
company that owned the plot of land

1807
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
was called

1808
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
a very normal name Africa Israel

1809
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
USA

1810
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
ultimately they owe all their money to Africa Israel USA

1811
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
an odd

1812
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
sounding group that apparently

1813
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
also was one of the main funders of Hard Rock

1814
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Park oh wow

1815
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Hard Rock theme park in South Carolina

1816
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
so this is a spend money to make money endeavor

1817
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
yeah maybe

1818
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
this somehow I guess this aligned

1819
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
with whatever they needed to do to burn cash

1820
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
and the company that owned

1821
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
the company that owns Jekyll and Hyde is Eerie World

1822
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Entertainment yeah

1823
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Eerie World Entertainment which also owns a lot of

1824
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
other things there's something called like the slaughtered

1825
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
lamb or something

1826
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
do I have the animal rights there was supposedly

1827
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
a restaurant like the theme is that it

1828
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
is owned by a family of werewolves

1829
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
because the

1830
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
slaughtered lamb had a wolf

1831
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
head logo I had never been

1832
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
but I remember thinking

1833
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
so to your question

1834
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
yes I thought it was weird but I also

1835
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
thought at least going into

1836
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
it I thought it was so cool

1837
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
I thought it was like

1838
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I remember seeing all the logos next

1839
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
to each other and I had from

1840
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
from the fourth grade kept

1841
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
one of the like pamphlets

1842
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
that like explained what Jekyll

1843
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
and Hyde was and I had that

1844
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
I remember I think I took it with me

1845
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
when I moved to New York as like a

1846
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
you're now here you know type deal

1847
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
yeah and

1848
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
I just remember thinking it was cool

1849
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
and then you know the longer I was there

1850
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
and the more it was just the more it just sort of felt

1851
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
like oh I don't know if we're how

1852
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
are we keeping afloat and like what's

1853
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
all of this and that and whatever feeling like

1854
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
oh man it's not as fun as like

1855
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
yeah isn't that that's been our

1856
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
arc doing this podcast we've taken all

1857
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
of these things that we felt the same way

1858
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
about when we were nine we've poked

1859
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
holes in their business plans and

1860
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
more become more than understanding

1861
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
of why they all went away

1862
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
yeah there's so many familiar

1863
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
patterns too yeah

1864
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
I feel like we've really

1865
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
you know we've talked about theme parks for a few years

1866
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
and that's been fine or whatever but really what we've been

1867
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
doing is figuring out how to perfectly run

1868
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
a weird chain restaurant

1869
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
and open and open franchises

1870
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
and know how slow to expand

1871
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
and know what markets like I know we've been

1872
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
giving ourselves an education about

1873
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
when we finally decide to go all in

1874
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
on a very fun stupid

1875
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
idea this whole thing has just been like a

1876
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
thesis level grad school for ourselves

1877
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
to ultimately get it more right

1878
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
than anyone ever has we've learned

1879
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
the most right way

1880
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
to do it is money

1881
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
laundering

1882
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
is sort of

1883
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
watching like okay you have

1884
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
the cash but you need to wash

1885
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
it quote unquote

1886
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
so it's not the same cash and make sure

1887
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
it's people who are good at it who've done

1888
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
it for who aren't new to the money laundering

1889
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
you need to be in there with pros

1890
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
you need to have like seven other businesses

1891
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
just like this professional

1892
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
money launderers and also we need

1893
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
a bunch of people fresh out of 401

1894
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
at the Upright City

1895
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
hey

1896
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
bright eyed bushy tailed

1897
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
improv kids

1898
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
hey speaking of expanded too fast

1899
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
oh boy

1900
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
oh no

1901
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
wow

1902
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
they needed to learn

1903
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
like we're learning it's what this is all about

1904
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
anyway honestly

1905
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
then covid hits

1906
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
and that's not good for anybody but it's

1907
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
especially not good you know this place

1908
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
just ends up on it's last legs like

1909
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
because of covid and covid protocols

1910
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
well not exactly because ultimately

1911
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
the thing becomes we get to

1912
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
this headline owner of

1913
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Jekyll and Hyde theme restaurant faces

up to 30 years in prison

1915
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
for using covid relief money to buy

1916
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000

01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Donald Finley is the guy

1922
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Mr. Eerie World Entertainment

1923
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
who is one of these figures who like

1924
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
like the weird rainforest cafe guy

1925
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
who built the rainforest cafe in his house

1926
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
before it opened who has this odd

1927
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
okay so his thing is

1928
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
horror and like pulpy

1929
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
novels and we're gonna I don't know

1930
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
it's cool he like he found a

1931
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
everything up until this

1932
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
seems fine but then he gets

1933
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
like 3 million dollars

1934
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
from the government and immediately

1935
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
buys a house we should have done this further

1936
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
podcast and bought houses

1937
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
we blew it

1938
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
all of us should have James I hope that you

1939
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
took out I hope you took a million dollars

1940
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
off for some business I'll tell you

1941
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
my accountant kept

1942
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
at the time kept

1943
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
asking me to do it

1944
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
he kept saying take out

1945
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
a PPP loan the money is there

1946
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
the money is there take it out and

1947
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
and for like

1948
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
my S corp which is my business

1949
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
that you know sure yeah but I was just

1950
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
like what are you talking about

1951
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
what am I gonna say

1952
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
I'm not gonna do this

1953
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
he's like you worked at Jekyll and I'd improvise

1954
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
just figured something if

1955
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
IRS calls you just weave him a tail

1956
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
I am not surprised

1957
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
that that is what happened

1958
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
though I'm not like I

1959
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
and I can't even remember what the lore

1960
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
was about him at the time but I think

1961
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
we all kind of generally felt

1962
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
like I don't know about this guy

1963
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
is he more Mr. Hyde

1964
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
than Dr. Jekyll

1965
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
I remember there was a day of the week

1966
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
where he would show up

1967
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
to get the

1968
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
it seemed like I don't know if this is what he was doing

1969
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
but to get the money do you know what I mean

1970
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
like he left with

1971
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
briefcases

1972
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
weekly it happened

1973
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
weekly

1974
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
went up to the werewolf's mouth

1975
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
tapped it and a bill came out every time

1976
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
you know what I mean it was like I would

1977
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
you would see him come and then you would see

1978
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
him leave with something and it was

1979
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
always like two sort of suitcases

1980
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
at his side with dollar signs

1981
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
yeah it was like yeah cartoon

1982
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
yeah yeah and in one case

1983
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
he had a bit like poke out of his jacket

1984
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
pocket was a bit like a clearly

1985
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
labeled deed Nantucket

1986
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
mom yeah he always

1987
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
talked about how it was important everyone

1988
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
was spooky but then he would go on and on

1989
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
about how beautiful parts

1990
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
of Nantucket were

1991
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
it's the

1992
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
anti-transylvania believe me

1993
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
we should have oh we would all be

1994
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
living in Nantucket if we took these peepee

1995
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
meals yeah oh my god

1996
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000

mansions next to each other we've just been very lucky

2001
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
the patreon's been very fruitful what can

2002
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
I say

2003
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
anyway that was like a year

2004
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
ago that got announced and then just a month

2005
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
ago it came down two years

2006
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
went from 30 to 2

2007
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
so things worked out for old

2008
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
maybe he hired one of your old improv

2009
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
buddies to be his lawyer

2010
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
were there any lawyer characters in the show

2011
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
there weren't any lawyer characters

2012
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
but I wouldn't be

2013
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
surprised if some of us

2014
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
are lawyers now

2015
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
mr scott free or

2016
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
mr loophole

2017
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
gotta be somebody

2018
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
mr

2019
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
scratch my back

2020
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
that's all run together

2021
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
it's a polish name

2022
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
judge look the other way

2023
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
anyway in the

2024
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
sentencing the judge

2025
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
tied his profession into it

2026
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
not so much Jekyll and Hyde he was like

2027
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
that'll be too obscure of a reference

2028
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
but he says today's sentencing

2029
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
means that no one was amused

2030
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
by this bayville adventure park

2031
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
owner's criminal acts and he will

2032
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
now face time in prison

2033
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
I mean they should have said amusement park

2034
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
maybe just to like super

2035
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
but he doesn't write for a

2036
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
little polished

2037
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
sentencings are not exactly what he does

2038
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
it always blows my

2039
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
mind even though I've seen it a million times and it shouldn't blow

2040
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
my mind but like I forgot to pay my

2041
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
target bill for my credit

2042
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
card one month I got the most aggressive

2043
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
phone call of like well here's

2044
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
how much you owe and here can we do that now

2045
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
let's pay it I see you have a thing on

2046
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
file now can we just put it through now and I'm like

2047
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
the most aggressive thing ever and then it's like two

2048
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
million dollars are owed from

2049
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
a restaurant in time square

2050
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
enough time the more we talk

2051
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
about these restaurants and figure out

2052
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
their failure we just become

2053
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
by the time you know when we're in what

2054
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
he's like 60 or so

2055
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
a great time to go to jail by the way

2056
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
but like that's what we're

2057
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
building towards you know

2058
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
we got like yeah in 20 years

2059
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
will be the pros

2060
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
yeah just why like why

2061
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
does the government though

2062
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
seem to care more

2063
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
about corporations and

2064
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
businesses than people

2065
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
you know what I'm saying

2066
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
I mean they are our betters

2067
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
oh Jason

2068
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
figured it out

2069
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
they were like he's gonna pay

2070
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
corporations

2071
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
corporations like a gigantic

2072
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
huge person

2073
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
bigger than the globe itself

2074
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
I don't have office space

2075
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
well that's true I don't know

2076
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
I don't own anything I don't think

2077
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
am I do I

2078
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
own myself even

2079
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
yeah I don't know

2080
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
yeah it's hard to say I don't yeah

2081
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
that's what's going away

2082
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
not just home ownership but just ownership

2083
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
ownership of the idea of owning

2084
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
you own nothing

2085
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
I bought my car but I still

2086
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
owe so much you know what I mean

2087
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
I still like I don't own it yet

2088
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
still you know

2089
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
will I ever like will I

2090
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
ever actually pay this off

2091
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
you have your foot in the door

2092
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
to own a thing at some point

2093
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
well so I don't know a weird

2094
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
tale of

2095
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
ancient horrors that

2096
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
ends in current

2097
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
modern horror you're not surprised

2098
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
seemingly but you'd like still

2099
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
fond memories glad this was like a formative

2100
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
interesting time truly going

2101
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
back to those days if this

2102
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
has been very nice for me in a way

2103
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
like I'm surprised at how fondly I

2104
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
remember that stuff because I

2105
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
I do remember towards the end being like

2106
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
I can't wait to get out of here you know kind of thing

2107
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
but also I need to work what else am I

2108
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
gonna

2109
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
so yeah I'm surprised at how much of it was like

2110
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
yeah I loved that I really

2111
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
wanted to do that job

2112
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
yeah a really specific

2113
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
dream came true and if you were ever

2114
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
called on in a pinch to

2115
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
push a bunch of buttons and operate a

2116
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
series of puppets I can do

2117
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
you know they have to be dated

2118
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
to that I can't do whatever they're

2119
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
doing now it's probably it's probably

2120
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
some crazy to advance

2121
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
as long as they haven't updated the system

2122
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
decades they look some of those stuff

2123
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
at Disney parks now look

2124
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
like the Pixar movie

2125
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
just alive have you seen those

2126
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
the stuff that they're doing like the new

2127
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Tiant the Tianti animatronics look

2128
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
it just looks like she's moving in

2129
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
the movie yeah

2130
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
like Roger Abbott style the cartoon

2131
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
just is in the world yeah but in the world

2132
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
right yeah yeah absolutely

2133
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
it is pretty wild so I don't know how they

2134
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
I don't know what kind of controls

2135
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
that have to do alive yeah but give me

2136
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000

2189
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
puppety that's very much

2190
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
I mean I didn't get to puppet

2191
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
those but yeah

2192
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
I don't because I had said

2193
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
out of and I've just said to a number of people

2194
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
anyone who will listen

2195
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
I thought good burger too was so

2196
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
great and it's like it's so glad

2197
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
I

2198
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
I hope you're super proud of it and I

2199
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
like and and it's

2200
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
a genre I think that's really fraught

2201
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
the like bringing characters

2202
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
back after

2203
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
the way way later sequel

2204
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
is a really rough area

2205
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
and I was just I was

2206
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
so pleasantly surprised by it

2207
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
as I was I didn't really grow

2208
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
up with the first one I only like threw it on with a

2209
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
bottle of wine like five years ago

2210
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
was like oh damn good burgers good

2211
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
will I feel the same way about too

2212
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
and I absolutely did my whatever I was so

2213
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
delighted I'm so glad you feel

2214
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
that way because I know it's a I've

2215
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
I've not read all of the reviews

2216
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
but I've seen how many people

2217
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
enjoyed it and also how many people

2218
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
like didn't feel like it captured the same

2219
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
thing I would say that my role

2220
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
as a writer and why they asked

2221
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
me I worked on the all that reboot

2222
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
and my role in that room was predominantly

2223
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
having an encyclopedic knowledge of the show

2224
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
oh wow

2225
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
well we did it like this and you didn't do it like this and blah blah or whatever

2226
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
and so I

2227
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
I feel like that's why they asked me

2228
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
to come in on on

2229
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Good Burger 2 Kenan and Kel

2230
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
like it was like a glove

2231
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
getting back into those characters

2232
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
like yeah so I mean

2233
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
yeah like we of course we know we see

2234
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Kenan so often that it's a given that

2235
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Kenan is going to be right Kel was so

2236
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
fucking just like

2237
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
so on it hadn't missed a beat

2238
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
and especially the and I don't know

2239
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
forgive me if I'm giving if this is not your

2240
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
compliment when Ed

2241
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
gives a speech the inspirational

2242
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
speech that is only one line

2243
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
and then the rest of it is just

2244
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
silence with the shots that would

2245
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
be there if there was a

2246
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
full speech to get that I

2247
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
that is honestly my funny

2248
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
my favorite like comedy set piece

2249
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
in anything in a while

2250
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Kevin and Heath the

2251
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
writers of the movie were there for

2252
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
the you know original and

2253
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
they will tell you that like

2254
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
they there's so much stuff

2255
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
on the cut room floor from that first movie

2256
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
that like they just they're

2257
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
just jokes and bits and jokes and like

2258
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
they're just they're machines in that way

2259
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
and and

2260
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
the script that I read

2261
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
before I was even brought on I was like you could just do

2262
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
this like you could it was so

2263
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
but that moment is one of those moments

2264
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
like from the like from the original

2265
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
where they were just like

2266
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
ready for it it's just like that

2267
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
could have been and I think and it's a scene

2268
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
I think we would have all if that had been in the first

2269
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
one we would have been like oh yeah good burger's great it has that

2270
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
part in it yeah that's okay

2271
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
