1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,240
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the second gate.

3
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,940
We're here today to answer all of your Star Wars galaxies

4
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:27,780
questions.

5
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,020
We have a poll on Twitter.

6
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:30,860
I don't know.

7
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,900
I, I, the bubbles, the LaCroix is still going.

8
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,980
I have a sigh will kick it off.

9
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:38,820
And then, uh,

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,180
I almost had it.

11
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,900
There was a little, there was a little hiccup.

12
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,340
And I was like, all right, he's going to pull this off.

13
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,180
And then there was like a,

14
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,000
And then I ate it.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,460
He was like starting to wobble.

16
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,020
And then, uh, then off the rails we went.

17
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:49,860
So great.

18
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,100
Uh, that was a lot of fun.

19
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,740
Yeah. No, we were like, you know,

20
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,860
I thought maybe we'll text some listener questions on at the

21
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,060
end of our galaxy's edge episode,

22
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,380
but we had so much to do.

23
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,780
Figured like, hey, let's move it over here.

24
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,020
Because there was like, we threw it out immediately.

25
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:02,860
Great questions.

26
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:03,700
A ton of them on Twitter.

27
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,460
So, uh, we haven't really looked at them.

28
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,580
Let's, let's respond live in the moment.

29
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,420
Let's be here.

30
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,260
Yeah.

31
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,900
So I'm going through here and we'll just get right to it.

32
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:13,740
Yeah.

33
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,060
So somebody just said, was it worth it?

34
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:16,900
Yes.

35
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:17,720
Yeah.

36
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,560
It was worth it.

37
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,400
Uh-huh.

38
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,020
Because there was a lot of extra hassle and I, um, I mean,

39
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,500
as I sort of said the, uh, um, I, I feel like I,

40
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,140
that's a special experience we will always have is that first

41
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,060
morning, the applause on the way in and being part of that first group.

42
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,460
But that by the way, that we were, we, as we were recording,

43
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,700
we were all kind of waiting around the submarine area and then we were all led

44
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,820
en masse through the entire park. Uh,

45
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,260
a parade of excited first morning, crazy people.

46
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,900
There was so much joy.

47
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,820
This was the opposite of a mob trampling, uh, uh,

48
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,940
into like piss and vinegar.

49
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:58,500
We, everybody was so excited and so happy and there's a detail we absolutely

50
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,220
forgot and I'm glad I remembered it. As we're doing that en masse March,

51
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,180
we passed by, we saw like the Dumbo elephants turn on,

52
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,020
like lift up.

53
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,500
Oh yes. I know what you're going to say.

54
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,620
And then we passed by Storybook land.

55
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,620
We passed by Monstro and there was a boat that had like one of the Storybook

56
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:23,820
land canal boats had been charted out and a man was holding what looked like a

57
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,860
giant, uh, Q-tip,

58
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:31,620
like a big old swab and he was cleaning between Monstro's teeth.

59
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,300
He was brushing Monstro's teeth.

60
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,940
What are those large extendable duster, uh, staff?

61
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,540
And I think I yelled something in him too. I was,

62
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,780
I said on the other episode, I was in a yelling mood. I think I yelled like,

63
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,620
yeah,

64
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,220
well we got people to cheer.

65
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,380
That's something that happens and you yelled and we all,

66
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,900
and then there was an en masse round of applause for the man brushing his teeth.

67
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,900
Brushing Monstro's teeth. What a delight. What a thing.

68
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,620
You never would have seen except that it's pre 8 a.m. Now we,

69
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,460
now we know.

70
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:06,060
In a boat brushing a whale's teeth is so fantastic.

71
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,460
And it is, yes, I totally forgot about it until just now.

72
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,300
It is truly a wonderful memory.

73
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:16,180
Nothing to do with Star Wars and yet part of the experience. What a blast.

74
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,860
So was it worth it? Oh yeah. We saw Monstro's teeth getting brushed.

75
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:19,780
That's true.

76
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,500
I'll throw out Neil Olstad's question. How impressive are the fake rucks?

77
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,900
Are they Final Four material? It could be, it takes forever to relitigate,

78
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:33,180
but I think we might, maybe we were too hasty, kicking them out,

79
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,780
but Final Four, that was tough because I got to Disney Sea and was like,

80
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,100
we fucked up.

81
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,940
Well we didn't see this. We didn't see it in person. We just saw it from a distance.

82
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:48,020
I still, we walked through the other entrance of ornament Valley on Friday and I

83
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,700
was like, this is still the best. Aaron did the exact same thing.

84
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,460
We still feel good about our decision. But yeah, could these muscle into the fake,

85
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,220
the, the, the Figrock Final Four? Yes, but they're really good. Yeah.

86
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,540
The rocks themselves are no small part of the land.

87
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,100
I mean all the architecture is amazing, but the rocks are great. Yeah.

88
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,940
And I said on the other episode too, like the next time I'm in,

89
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,460
I will really notice like,

90
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:14,180
I'm going to try my best to see the best way, the best sight lines,

91
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:18,020
the best places and the best views to really enjoy the rocks,

92
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:21,140
the fake rocks and the buildings. Also, I guess somewhat the buildings,

93
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,180
mostly the fake rocks. So yeah, I think they, I think they're in it.

94
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,820
There's a good chance they'll be in the hunt if we ever do it again,

95
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,140
if we ever feel like we're up to that mental task of,

96
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,940
of naming what the best thing we need, like one more competitor,

97
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:39,020
like something else new has to be a more, we do it every year.

98
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,100
We don't change the topic.

99
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,940
Fake rock final four is an every year event.

100
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,060
And it's a whole nother set of fake rocks.

101
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,220
We tried to find a whole nother set.

102
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,460
Depends on how the season went, you know? Depends on who brought their egg in.

103
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:57,100
You know, weirdly Mount May Day Typhoon Lagoon, I think,

104
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:01,860
I think this is their year. Like 2019 they didn't have it, but 2020,

105
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,060
there's just something about them. Or worst fake rocks. I mean, yes,

106
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,420
that would be, yeah. Well, these would certainly not qualify as the worst.

107
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,620
I've got one here from Robert Miller.

108
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:16,820
Did you find it hard to discuss anything with the cast members? For instance,

109
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,580
bathrooms are refreshers. Hello is bright suns.

110
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,900
People were doing the Batu lingo, but they,

111
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,740
I feel like they were being pretty chill about it. Like when I asked for the bat,

112
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,220
they're like the bathrooms we call the refreshers around the court. Like they,

113
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,860
it's not like they're not trying to inconvenience you.

114
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:41,260
No, no, no, I don't think so. Though I got, I got fucked for like 15 bucks.

115
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:46,140
Cause I didn't know whatever the annual pass lingo was. Sure. Learn that one.

116
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:51,140
Don't let it happen to you. You know what I liked in general was when the crazy

117
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,900
rush Falcon line formed, which hopefully won't be every day.

118
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,740
I think that's going to get smaller and smaller,

119
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,780
but people wanted to be the first and it was confusing. Wait,

120
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,380
was that the Cantina line? Is that the Falcon line? It was,

121
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,140
it was tough to tell. And I liked people,

122
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,300
I liked somebody walking up and down the line saying,

123
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:10,660
so were you all here to help Honda with a mission? It was not,

124
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,060
this is the Falcon line. Right. Yeah. All in keeping.

125
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,820
But I don't think they have to stay in character as much as the people at

126
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:22,140
wizarding worlds, like Martin really supposed to break the reality.

127
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,980
Okay. Cause Disney still has their whole, you know, customer tears,

128
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,660
how you do customer friendly customer service sort of angle. Yeah.

129
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,900
So they'll drop it if they think it, you like, you're really confused,

130
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,380
but it's pretty easy.

131
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,860
Someone that wants to know where they can get a hat like yours, Jason. Sure.

132
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,500
That hat is just a Disney world hat.

133
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:47,500
And I bought it a few years ago at the store at the imagination pavilion.

134
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,900
But I think, I think they have a Disneyland version with the,

135
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,580
the Disneyland D that's the,

136
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:01,220
and the one I have is the Disney world logo. So I do, they still make it.

137
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:05,580
I am not sure, but yeah, it wasn't super hard to find. Oh, this is a dirty,

138
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:10,340
not dirty. This is a blue question and it might be literally a blue question.

139
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,580
Body question. What color does the blue milk make your stool?

140
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,020
Jason, anything, anything weird?

141
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:23,580
I can't speak. I noticed, I can't say I noticed a difference in color,

142
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,060
just that I noticed it was immediate.

143
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:31,580
Oh, very cool detail we didn't get on the other episode. No,

144
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,220
you did like multiple times that I had to go to the bathroom.

145
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,740
But you meant, Oh, no, no, no, no, I just had to, Oh, he very quickly.

146
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,260
That's exactly what that sounded like. Yes.

147
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:48,140
I'm sorry. Yeah. Do you not know what stool is? No, I know what stool is.

148
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,580
I don't know. I didn't notice. I didn't know what stool.

149
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,860
I was just eating a lot of, uh, you know,

150
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,460
theme park garbage for a day and a half. So I don't,

151
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,900
I don't think the blue milk affected in that way, but, uh, I mean,

152
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,820
we were up at four 30 in the morning and I had been pounding ice water and coffee

153
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:07,860
to begin with. So I was kind of at a disadvantage to start. Sure. Sure.

154
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:13,060
So the blue milk did not immediately go through digestive track. Yeah.

155
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:13,900
Yeah. It did.

156
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:19,100
Again, weird that there's a bar where the bathrooms are not in play.

157
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,380
I agree. Um, but hopefully like that.

158
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,580
Hopefully they'll have some sort of return tickets. Yeah. They need to do that.

159
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,340
I was going to say, I don't know if I've ever said on the show,

160
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:32,340
and this is again, another gross thing. I once had a like black, uh,

161
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:37,340
Slurpee from burger King like 10 years ago and it turned my shit neon blue.

162
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:43,380
Nice. I was shocked. I was black Slurpee.

163
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:47,460
Why did I have it? Yeah. Or why would, what was, why do they have a black one?

164
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,380
I think it was Halloween. Uh huh. But they have black ice cream now and stuff,

165
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,900
but I don't think it turns your shit like neon blue. Um, but anyway,

166
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:59,340
so it can happen. So I, it's a valid question. I appreciate the question. Um,

167
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:02,900
but it sounds like they have figured out a way to keep your shit a normal color.

168
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,100
All right. Kudos to Disney. Uh, let's see here.

169
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,900
Uh, favorite element of the land. It's not food merchandise or smugglers run.

170
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:16,260
That's from Amanda wood. Um, hmm. That narrow, that narrows it down.

171
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,780
And that's a good question. I mean, we talked about, we talked about sounds,

172
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,300
you know, what's the thing I'd like to shout out? Um,

173
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,580
I heard about this detail in some preview events and I was like, what,

174
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,260
who cares? And as soon as I saw it, I thought it was so neat.

175
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:35,260
The are two tracks in the, oh yeah. Like super cool.

176
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:40,260
This whole thing, um, like blew my cynicism away into there.

177
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,660
There was like a number of things like that. I was like, I guess,

178
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:47,540
that's what you're touting. And then you see it and it's so great. It's,

179
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,900
it's part of the magic and all those little sensory things really add up.

180
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:54,700
There's a little docking, like a truck, like, uh,

181
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,460
there's like a docking Bay and like somebody pointed out that there's like

182
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:01,300
marks on the wall where like the truck would have backed in and made like

183
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:05,340
scratch scratches and stuff on it. Oh, you know what? Uh,

184
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:09,820
blaster hole right next to Rex's performance area.

185
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:14,260
Like somebody shot, I, how dare you try to shoot at my boy,

186
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:18,420
but somebody, some bastard tried and hopefully he was removed.

187
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,660
I'd also like to shout out the frog.

188
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,940
I think the frog is going to be up there in terms of a Disney theme park lore.

189
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,180
Soon enough, there is a frog in a jar who, uh,

190
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:34,340
craps eggs into drinks into the wine, into the wine, frog egg juice,

191
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:39,660
frog egg juice component in the wine. Very strange. Um,

192
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:44,020
yeah, not a, not a varietal I was aware of previously, but,

193
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:48,940
do I detect hints of frog juice? Uh, but I,

194
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,820
and I did and they're great. Um, I'm looking through here.

195
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,660
Is there any protection for the beer flights that after you purchase it,

196
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,820
we didn't purchase it. So we don't know. Um,

197
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:04,180
I mean I've purchased mugs at Sam's before and usually they give you a one in a

198
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,780
box that's kind of wrapped up. You don't,

199
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,660
you don't take the one you drank out of. They give you a clean one.

200
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:15,660
So I'm assuming they have something in place. Yeah, hopefully.

201
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,940
I guess we shouldn't have answered that. We didn't know the answer. Uh,

202
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:24,300
is a four hour window enough time in the land? Yeah, we got to ask that a lot.

203
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,860
No, no, but it's like a substantial amount of time.

204
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,860
As long as you have your priorities, I think.

205
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,700
This clearly is a thing to chip off in chunks.

206
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:39,060
This is a repeat visit requiring experience,

207
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,740
uh, which we were also asked, did you do the Disney play app stuff?

208
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,940
And we kind of said in the other episode, not really.

209
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:48,500
That's a big reason to go back and that's going to make it different every time.

210
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:49,740
Um,

211
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,340
I Falcon takes a lot of people per hour,

212
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,620
so I wouldn't worry about squeezing that in.

213
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,820
I think the decision to make is Cantina or lightsaber building.

214
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,860
Droid Depot we walked right in.

215
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:04,100
We got to just start at building droids immediately. Yeah, yes.

216
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,620
Um, I would say, um,

217
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:10,580
use the mobile ordering for the food places was working very well.

218
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,020
Yeah, that seems to, that seems to be necessary to like, it is,

219
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,900
it is every minute counts in that four hours and you're going to want to take

220
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,700
minutes to like stop and take a breather and just go, holy shit.

221
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:25,180
And look at that. And how cool was that? Let's talk about this for a second.

222
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:29,300
Yeah, you can't, no time, not a place to relax, except for the Cantina.

223
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:34,060
Should you make it in there? We really chilled out. We like splayed out in there.

224
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,420
Yeah. And I appreciate that we got to. Yeah, that was great.

225
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,140
I realize I've now been not reading the names of the people who asked me the

226
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,780
questions. I'm sure I, I don't know if that's important to people,

227
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,420
but I'm going to, I'm sorry.

228
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:49,540
I don't want to say I know here's kind of a related one at post credit show

229
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,980
asked when will the lines die down? So that is kind of,

230
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,580
there's no simple answer to that question for the next few weeks.

231
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:59,500
It's just the reservations, which are all booked up unless you get a hotel room.

232
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,140
And then, which case you can get a reservation. Um, after that,

233
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:07,060
it's like virtual queues that like you can join,

234
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,340
you have to get in the park. You have to scan your ticket.

235
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:14,220
And then within the park, then you can get a boarding pass.

236
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,020
I think they're calling it. But it ultimately seems like,

237
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:21,740
like it might be very similar to the weights now in the land.

238
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,300
It seems like it's just sort of a version of what they're doing now,

239
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,700
but you just have to be there early in the morning to get your time. Hmm.

240
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,980
Yeah. I mean that is that for years has been the way.

241
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,100
Do you want to go without a lot of lines? Yeah.

242
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,580
Get there really early because the locals don't like waking up early.

243
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:40,700
So that rule still applies. Yeah. So that's, I think honestly,

244
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,700
like they'll probably keep it so like you have a nice,

245
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,020
comfortable time in the land in general. Um, but yeah,

246
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:50,860
the early morning you gotta, I think you do, I can't imagine for a while.

247
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:55,460
It's, it's not going to be like an early morning war situation. Oh yeah.

248
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,260
For sure. People are going to be for sure getting there very early to get their

249
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,020
time. I would imagine. Yeah. It'll be,

250
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,300
it'll remains to be seen when those will run out.

251
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:08,660
Cause it's still like radiator Springs racers still like the fat hardest fast

252
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:12,140
pass maybe to get in the park. That's right. Worse than galaxy. Well,

253
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:16,100
I guess smaller kids can ride Raiders Springs racers versus. Yeah.

254
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,340
I mean, I don't know how bad it is, but for a couple of years there,

255
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,700
it was like that would run out by a little worse than guardians. I think. Yeah.

256
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,020
Yeah. It would run out by like 11 AM at a certain,

257
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,860
but this is back when there was still fake paper tickets and stuff.

258
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:31,580
So who knows when you won't be able to get a fast pass,

259
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,980
but the advice of course would be get there when the park opens. Yeah. Yeah.

260
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:40,020
And now all of this will shine and is a particularly bright light on California

261
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,020
adventure as the chill park. Yeah.

262
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:46,020
Usually because it's going to be a little more vacant, I think. Sure. Well,

263
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,820
well all this star Wars stuff is going on. Yeah.

264
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:52,180
So enjoy that wine terrace and that Carthay circle lounge.

265
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,900
Even chiller than usual.

266
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:59,140
This is a question from it's waggy time on Twitter.

267
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:03,220
If two small children were selected as the pilots of your smugglers run group,

268
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:07,260
how would you react? And I have a very fast answer for this.

269
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:12,220
I'll probably not make it that fast though. I would love it. It would be great.

270
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,980
The thing is on rails.

271
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,860
I complain a little bit about it in the other episode of like wanting a little

272
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,820
more freedom. That being said,

273
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:23,580
I think the ride is more fun when you're banging into crap. Yeah. Like,

274
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,860
the first Jason and I were terrible pilots. I blame him,

275
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,660
but it might not be fair.

276
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,580
There wasn't that many up and down obstacles. I felt like there were,

277
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,860
well, I guess quite a few. Well, I felt like I was,

278
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:39,740
there was something working against me and maybe it was my own problem.

279
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:43,660
The one time we did it with a single rider who joined our party,

280
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,900
he dodged the spire at the very end. Yes. And I did it.

281
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,100
We rammed right into the spire.

282
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:54,180
There's a few purposely startling things that like you're either supposed to

283
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:58,780
avoid or blast. Right. Avoid blast or ram into.

284
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:02,140
Kids are so quick to pick up on video game stuff. Like,

285
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,860
well I'm actually just saying that it would be fun to crash into literally

286
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,020
everything. I saw someone on Twitter did that. They said they like,

287
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:13,420
just wrecked the Falcon even worse than Jason and I did.

288
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,940
And it seems like it's fun.

289
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:19,420
There's like a lot of fun alarms going off in the hallway as you leave.

290
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:24,660
And it makes the ride more fun cause you're bumping up and down more.

291
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:28,380
Like you, like it's reacting to when you crash into something.

292
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:32,180
So like it's going to be a much more like crazy ride if you're constantly

293
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:35,580
smashing into things. Sure. And it's fun. There's kids piloting.

294
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:39,620
Wouldn't that be fun to have some kids to control a unit spaceship that are,

295
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,500
that don't have, can't react that fast to things.

296
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,140
You never seen that in the movies.

297
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:44,980
Yeah.

298
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,100
A lot of people have been in that cockpit, but no kids. No kids.

299
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,860
I hope broom boy from the end of last Jedi in Star Wars,

300
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:55,180
episode nine pilots, the Millennium Falcon, but there's no guarantee of that.

301
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,100
There's no scene out of that.

302
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,540
Scene one that's a, what do the hardcore fans want?

303
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:03,540
They want broom boy in the, in the chair of the franchise in general.

304
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:08,420
Right. We need like a similar to short round driving the car in temple of doom.

305
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,700
We need broom boy piloting the Millennium Falcon.

306
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:16,660
A couple of questions I'm just going to answer sort of together.

307
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,820
Some people asking, is it expensive? Are they price gouging?

308
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,540
That sort of, is it?

309
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:26,140
It's too tight. I mean, I think it's comparable. I mean,

310
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:31,700
Oga's Cantina prices are comparable to drinking at any

311
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,180
exhausting cocktail bar in Los Angeles. So that's kind of,

312
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:38,060
but none of the food seemed particularly jacked up.

313
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:42,140
The stuffed animals didn't seem that bad. I mean,

314
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,980
Rex is a hundred dollars. Is that right?

315
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:49,020
A hundred and fifty. Okay.

316
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:54,300
So comparable to buying one of those dumbass Amazon smart speakers.

317
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:58,020
And presumably Rex is not tracking you. So,

318
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,580
we're not that we know, not that we know.

319
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:05,260
So it is like a Bluetooth speaker and a toy in.

320
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:10,180
I'm going to get put on a list for hugging it too much. Well, I mean, you know,

321
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:15,180
that's my own problem. But I didn't think the lightsaber seem expensive,

322
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,940
but they've sold like super expensive custom light,

323
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,780
like display lightsabers for years.

324
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:25,180
Everything could be like five to 10% less. And I think we'd have been like, Oh,

325
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,860
that's still a kind of a marked up theme park price.

326
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:32,860
Maybe it's like a little bit more than normal, but I mean,

327
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,700
it's all going to be nothing was jaw dropping. Yeah.

328
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,660
Nothing was jaw dropping. Yeah. Every the meal again. Yeah.

329
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,300
The meals could they have been like we were talking about with tropical hideaway,

330
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,780
like a couple dollars cheaper and we would have maybe felt even better about it.

331
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,660
Sure. Of course.

332
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:51,700
The blue milk sir and green milks are about the same price as butter beer,

333
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:57,020
right? Which is like $8 now. I think it started at $5,

334
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:00,900
which is probably about what you should be paying, but I don't know.

335
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,220
It's not a huge, a huge thing.

336
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:07,580
So track these prices like the price of oil, like you've got them in a stock cap.

337
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,620
Outpacing inflation. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So,

338
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,060
but no, I didn't think, I mean, if you're gonna,

339
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:21,300
if you're gonna buy remote control robot or a custom lightsaber with custom

340
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,980
sling, yes, you will pay more,

341
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,460
but the t-shirts and sweatshirts, all that stuffed animals,

342
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,140
all that crap was the same as all the other crap.

343
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,740
I haven't talked to a ton about that Rex toy also. It fucking rocks. And it like,

344
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,780
you know, besides that, I, again, I,

345
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:43,100
am I slanted because he's my favorite character in fiction certainly,

346
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,740
but I think it's a cool,

347
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:48,100
if you knew nothing and your first exposure to Rex was, Oh,

348
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:53,100
who's that weird DJ robot in the Cantina or I can get one of those at home.

349
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:57,020
I think it's really neat independently of all that. And I, especially the,

350
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:00,260
like the land, like the aging details,

351
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:03,060
like all the scuffing on the helmet,

352
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:06,860
like just the actual like texture of the body is super cool. Yeah.

353
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,180
And it like, it's pretty responsive. I mean, you got,

354
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:14,100
there's like a little bit of lag, but it, it, the, the movement's great.

355
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,100
That's a lot of different ways it can move. Yeah. He's,

356
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,660
I was worried from some of the pictures that he was smaller.

357
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:23,700
I was thinking he might be like half the size, but he's a nice, he's a nice size.

358
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,980
I have him upstairs on a shelf. He's a real nice, significant looking toy.

359
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,820
He looks good.

360
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:33,180
He's kind of perfectly hilariously big and cumbersome,

361
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,660
but small enough to still move around.

362
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,820
Would we have bought him if he was times three to four size? Like, would it be?

363
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:44,820
Yes. Now we're talking like, probably if he was bigger and maybe if he was like

364
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,100
more metal and less plastic, he would be in the living room right now.

365
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:53,340
It's just like, well, this is like, there's, I have two pets, Edwin and Rex.

366
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,580
He's like, he's like a live in nephew or something. Yeah.

367
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:01,580
But yeah, he's great. It's great. And you know what? I was getting the question,

368
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:06,460
how's that speaker? I don't think it's a poor speaker. I think it's not,

369
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:10,460
look, you're going to, it's not going to replace a stereo system and you can't

370
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:13,580
recharge it. So you've, so batteries are going to drain. That is the one.

371
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,420
If only they had a little battery,

372
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:18,540
that would be my one gripe that you could like recharge on a Bluetooth.

373
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:21,380
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like a, whatever you call that cord.

374
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,220
It's eight double A's. Is that right? Crazy. Yeah.

375
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:27,940
I guess you could buy eight rechargeable double A's. Sure. That's true.

376
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:32,020
Those, but it is weird. It's not lithium ion nowadays. Cheaper.

377
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,260
That is harder to, yeah, it's cheaper. Also, well,

378
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,820
they'll card to recycle lithium ion batteries. Sure.

379
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,940
So they were doing it for sure because of the impact on the environment.

380
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,180
Absolutely. A lot of environmental consciousness.

381
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:49,420
I will say this was the first spot where I found like a water bottle

382
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:52,940
fill up station built into the water fountains. So that was good.

383
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,260
Cause we had Disneyland for like 18 hours.

384
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,660
I think the only way I got through that was staying high.

385
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,860
It was this like pounding water. Yeah.

386
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:04,820
I needed to have more water than I did more protein and more water.

387
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:08,700
There's a tip. Ice cream. Hydrate. When you're going,

388
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,860
they still drink water in Batuu. So you should too.

389
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,380
A couple of questions about whether they got rid of the sporks,

390
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:18,540
which I had also heard, but it seems like they're just kind of limiting.

391
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:22,900
There's these custom metal sporks for OGA for docking bay seven.

392
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,980
And it seems like the verdict is they're still there,

393
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:30,300
but you can't just take like a handful of them and accidentally drop one in your

394
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,900
bag anymore. I think you just get one with your tray.

395
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:36,380
What a perfect scene stealer that in all this,

396
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,620
it would be this weird utensil.

397
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:43,060
It's weird resellable utensil. I saw only two on eBay. I Google,

398
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,860
I or I go by eBay to on eBay. So yeah, I don't know.

399
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:50,020
I don't know if somebody just like open their bag and unloaded all of the

400
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:54,420
sporks in there. And they're like, okay, well, got to switch that. Um,

401
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,580
our friend Andrew Grissom, who was with us,

402
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:01,380
said that they were limiting like you'd only buy one of each like toy,

403
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:04,860
each. Yes. I saw a sign that said like one of each thing,

404
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:08,940
which is interesting. It seemed like they did have a big stock.

405
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:12,860
There was like a lot of every character in one part of the Droid Depot.

406
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,380
There was, there were only two Rex's left. And I said, do you have,

407
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,420
is this all the Rex's you have? And they're like, well,

408
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,620
there's more in the other room and they had more. So I'm not sure.

409
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,260
I was trying to figure out, I think we talked to Len about it.

410
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,900
I was wondering what's going to be after a week, like the hottest thing in there.

411
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:30,980
A lot of the salacious crumbs that can sit on your shoulder and look around.

412
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:31,340
Yeah.

413
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:35,700
This made me so happy to see on guests for the rest of the day throughout the

414
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,620
park. You're somewhere way different. You're, uh,

415
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:43,300
you're over by toast by Midway mania and you see a salacious crumb bobbing

416
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,140
around.

417
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:48,340
There's a really cute tiny group one that people get now. Yeah. Yeah.

418
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,180
Interactive, but it's, it's cute.

419
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,460
This feels very Tokyo-y like I don't know. I mean, I,

420
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,260
I'm still a recent visitor there,

421
00:23:55,260 --> 00:24:00,260
but it seems like displayed toys at all times has probably been part of the

422
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:03,020
Tokyo culture for a while. And I like that it's happening here.

423
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:06,100
I wonder what the first one is because they have those in an avatar and they

424
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,740
were big sellers and I, it's like,

425
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,820
it's sort of the banshees on your shoulder,

426
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,580
even though banshees are much bigger in the movie,

427
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,020
but it's a tiny banshee on your shoulder and you can work it.

428
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:18,540
She, uh, sperms. Yeah. That's what they look like before.

429
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:23,820
They're very formed if they're sperms. Uh, it's different, uh,

430
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:26,580
different genealogy. Um, that's their species.

431
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:30,500
And those I know sold out very quickly and they were like caught off guard by

432
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,620
how popular those were.

433
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,380
And then they came back and they were much more expensive.

434
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,500
Like $30 more or something.

435
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:41,260
Do you have a question at Mickey shy 12 is asking,

436
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,220
what are the character experiences like?

437
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,500
I think Len talked a little bit about this.

438
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:49,100
The idea is that the characters are going about their day.

439
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:52,420
So like there's not a meet and greet line for Chewbacca.

440
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:56,980
He's kind of wandering through the crowd with, I think with him,

441
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:00,900
there was a handler, but it was a rebel spy in character.

442
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:04,460
And Ray is just wandering around. Uh,

443
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:09,220
of course she can communicate a little more in galactic basic. Um,

444
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,620
but like, yeah, just wandering about their day,

445
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:15,180
trying to get the rebellion resistance built back up.

446
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:20,060
He's just getting his steps. He's got a headband, uh, you know,

447
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:23,020
checking. Oh my only 7,000.

448
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,980
This neighborhood has changed and I'm not a fan of that.

449
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:33,660
I really haven't thought about this until this very moment.

450
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:38,820
And I am not a new, well, some of the Disney's I think are okay.

451
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,940
Some of the Disney's I think are less okay. But I do, I,

452
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:46,860
I'm wondering if we're going to only have new Disney characters like Ray and

453
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:50,140
Kylo. Cause I was imagining like, man,

454
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:55,140
what if there was like a Han Solo character actor who ran up

455
00:25:55,140 --> 00:26:00,140
and down something or like if IG 88 is showing up or any of the classic

456
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:04,220
trilogy or honestly prequel characters, I wonder if,

457
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,300
I wonder what will happen because they know they're trying to keep in line.

458
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,300
Like there's a narrative and it's a certain point in star Wars history,

459
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:13,340
but I wonder if they ever relax that a little bit. It would be really great.

460
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,060
I know it wouldn't make so much sense,

461
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:20,020
but if we could get like yak face character from the original,

462
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:24,340
I think the droids and the aliens, uh, you're more likely to see.

463
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:27,700
I agree with that. I, yes, more than they've already said,

464
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,300
there will be more wandering droids down the line.

465
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,620
They just didn't want to overwhelm the land with them.

466
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:36,700
By that solo Darth Maul timeline, isn't he? Uh,

467
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:40,540
Oh yeah. Darth Maul is back in solo, which I don't believe we'll be getting any

468
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:45,020
sequels to kill him in the clone wars again in the cloak. Yes, they do.

469
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,180
He kills him again, but I don't know if that'll be,

470
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:51,060
but as Star Wars deaths ain't sticking lately. So that's true.

471
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,740
That's true. So they're all whenever really dies.

472
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:57,740
Luke Skywalker will be alive in the next movie. Seemingly.

473
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,500
The rise of Skywalker. No, we're not.

474
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,940
It's not quite clear if he died in the first movie. In last Jedi.

475
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:08,420
Last Jedi. I mean, it's not, well, according to Ryan, he died.

476
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:12,900
Yeah. But it's not quite clear. It's not quite clear to JJ.

477
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,540
Force can be, the tales can be rewritten.

478
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,980
Ryan was like, yeah, he's dead. And JJ was like, I don't know. I didn't really,

479
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,780
I'm not so sure if he's dead or not.

480
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,660
Was it in last Jedi or force awakens that it's just like Akbar dead, gone as

481
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:29,300
then Akbar by that is last Jedi. That's minus points.

482
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,220
That was harsh to me. Like fuck what? Yeah. Like kind of off screen. Jesus.

483
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,020
You might say a couple of characters got treated very cruelly.

484
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,620
Do you have a three hours worth of more thoughts on this?

485
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,900
My no, that's sort of, I've exhausted all my thoughts just now. So.

486
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:50,860
When we were driving down there the day before you, you, there's a,

487
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:55,020
what was the Lucas quote you said? Stories are like songs.

488
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,460
I believe it's the Phantom. I could be wrong about where it is,

489
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,860
but it's in one of those documentaries.

490
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:03,100
I think it's when he's making Phantom Menace and he's talking about,

491
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:06,300
he's talking about how the trilogy is rime. He's like, they rhyme.

492
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,780
The trilogy is a rhyme. And like,

493
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:11,540
like I don't remember what scenes he's talking about rhyme with other scenes.

494
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:16,380
Yeah. Stuff, stuff repeats, stuff comes back in all of these movies.

495
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:20,940
And I, I think that'll, will be satisfying to look back at all nine of them,

496
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:25,460
even those dreaded prequels when all is said and done and go like, it is interesting.

497
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:30,140
If you, if you make it important, that stuff repeats or stories repeat, because,

498
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,780
you know, all that Joseph Campbell shit is like,

499
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:36,100
just keeps getting reused again and again for thousands of years.

500
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,660
Well, we all tell ourselves the same stories over and over again.

501
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:42,900
We just recycle them in different ways. That's really all it is. Hmm. Really deep.

502
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,100
Yeah.

503
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,500
Speaking of the secular, the circular nature of stories,

504
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,260
have you guys caught, and I can't totally confirm this,

505
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:55,300
but I saw a video that implies that here's how the Rex loop plays out.

506
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:00,740
That at some point there is like a power surge and the power in the bar has to be

507
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:04,420
reset. And the bartender, I then, I haven't seen,

508
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:07,220
I just saw a video that implies that this happens. I haven't seen it in person,

509
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:11,300
but I think the bartender has to like reset the system.

510
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:16,540
Rex comes back on thus resetting his loop and refreshing his memory so that it is

511
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,940
always his first time DJ.

512
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,460
Just like it was always his first time piloting.

513
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:28,300
Wow. That's awesome. I think that's very clever. If that's true.

514
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:33,260
I saw this whole sequence in like press footage of like the bartender going,

515
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:37,700
ah, God, this again. And then he Rex dies essentially,

516
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,620
which he does. Have you, have you kept him on long enough? The toy.

517
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,380
Yes, I've kept him here.

518
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:45,420
To where he, oh, and then, but I think the, I think the same thing happens.

519
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:48,780
He powers back up and like, Hey, look, customers.

520
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,260
And then the set begins anew.

521
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,300
That's great.

522
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,780
It's actually weirdly unlike sunny eclipse or checky cheese or anything else

523
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:58,500
that loops. It's justified why all the same things happen again. Man,

524
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:02,060
that's great. That's such a fun way to work around that.

525
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:06,420
I love it. And I love that it keeps up that he is always a first timer,

526
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:09,180
but also you talk about stories rhyming and everything.

527
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:12,740
And I love this character so much. I love that he,

528
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:17,500
like he was a first timer who was having a bad time and it was,

529
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:21,780
as a job he was not suited for. And now he has a job he's fucking great at.

530
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,980
It is so delightful to me to see like who,

531
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:28,940
that's another, if you could have told me loving Star Tours so much as a kid,

532
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:33,940
this character will find his purpose in life many decades later and you'll be

533
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,580
there for it. Morning. Number one,

534
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:40,580
Dick Ward asked how much one on one time did Scott and Rex get.

535
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:44,940
You know what? A little bit. My timestamp at eight 20 on that first day,

536
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:49,940
I was filming him dead center and I couldn't believe that was the case.

537
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:54,140
And that you could just like walk up closer to that super cool robot than you

538
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:57,420
could have on Star Tours. Yeah. And we were sitting next,

539
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:00,460
we'd have the best view of him, but we were sitting next to him, essentially.

540
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,860
We were in the booth next to him.

541
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:06,140
And I kept leaving you guys, my friends to get up and watch him.

542
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,980
And there's good bits. There's good material.

543
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,900
The toy has this bit about,

544
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:14,300
he says how he's available for life day celebrations.

545
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:19,380
That's an acknowledgement of the weirdo holiday from the holiday special.

546
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:22,020
There is nothing it's music. It's DJ. It's my,

547
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,780
nothing could be more made for me than all this new wreck shit.

548
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,340
Alcohol is part of it. Yeah. Fucking rules.

549
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:31,820
The life day thing is so great. I mean, that's like a shortcut and improv too.

550
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:35,700
Like there's no mist. If you make stuff count, if you treat stuff like important,

551
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:39,660
there's no like mistakes and like, sure. Yeah.

552
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:44,580
Even the sillier stuff in Star Wars, if you treat it like it's important,

553
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:49,140
you end up with a Dexter Jekster action figure looking at you as you record a

554
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:52,100
podcast. Yeah. Huh? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And how much?

555
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,620
Like now that everybody's relaxed about all that prequels,

556
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,420
but there's not the fury that there used to be.

557
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:59,660
We can enjoy the silliness of something like that. There's no fear.

558
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,940
But anything in Star Wars, no, no, no.

559
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,980
I'm so just moved like every prequels, I think.

560
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:09,540
It does help me. Nobody's mad about those now, but it's all shifted over.

561
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:13,380
Yes. But are you guys, I'm not seeing it about galaxy's edge yet.

562
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:17,340
I'm not seeing other than a certain podcast or friend of ours deciding he hates

563
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:21,060
it before he's done it. But like, yeah, you know, uh,

564
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,860
I don't think there's like the, there's, there's,

565
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,900
there's not the uprising of actually it sucks,

566
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:30,780
which I'm not used to seeing in Star Wars, anything. Right.

567
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:35,220
There's a certain thing of building themed entertainment attractions.

568
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:39,740
There's a lot longer lead time than movies and you have to account for,

569
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:44,220
I feel like a lot more what is that in movies you can fix with like,

570
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,460
we'll just change this in the script or like, Oh,

571
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,860
we'll have to figure that out in editing. Like with this, it's like, well,

572
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,980
people are going to thousands and thousands of people are going to come to this

573
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:55,820
for years and years and years. And we can't, if it goes bad,

574
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:59,380
we can't destroy it because we spent a billion dollars on it. Right. Right.

575
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,460
So we have to make it count.

576
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:05,940
Joe roadie said the star wars team started working on this when the avatar team

577
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:11,060
started working on the section. What? And that was forever ago.

578
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:16,140
Shocking. Like, I don't think they had sold Lucasfilm to

579
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:19,980
Disney then had they? Uh, I think maybe.

580
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,820
No, it's later. Uh, Disney buys Lucasfilm,

581
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:31,180
which I think is two years or three years before force awakens, which is 2015.

582
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:34,340
Well, now this could also be counting the,

583
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:37,500
when they were just going to redo tomorrow. Yeah. But I think, Oh yeah.

584
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:41,380
So October 30th, 2012 is when they announced about it.

585
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:45,900
But avatar land announced is, let me see this.

586
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:50,580
I think there was like 10 years between it being announced and opening. Jeez.

587
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,420
I could be wrong. So maybe.

588
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:57,380
So some new star wars theme park iteration has been

589
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,740
worked on forever and ever. Uh,

590
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:04,540
September 17th, 2011 entered into an exclusive

591
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:08,460
long-term agreement with Cameron's light storm. So before the sale,

592
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:12,380
if that indeed is the case, like, I mean, I,

593
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:16,020
I could imagine they wanted to expand the star wars presence in general.

594
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:20,300
And Lucas had been talking cause Lucas initially was going to make seven.

595
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:25,380
He was going to make seven himself and then sell it and then have somebody

596
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:28,180
else complete eight and nine. Oh, I see. So maybe,

597
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,340
maybe back then,

598
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:33,300
cause he was the one who hired Kathleen Kennedy to run Lucasfilm before did the

599
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:33,900
Disney thing.

600
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:37,900
So perhaps they had already sort of been talking about more stuff and just

601
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:40,820
initially planning things or going through ideas.

602
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:45,780
It'll be another decade before we get any books and stuff about before we have

603
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:49,100
an actual accounting of like, Oh, maybe everything has come.

604
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,940
Here's how everything played out. Really. We were,

605
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:55,580
who knows exactly because we, we had seen this already in the theater,

606
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:59,300
but we were watching saving Mr. Banks again last night. And man,

607
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:02,820
that is crazy that they did that to her at the end of the movie where they

608
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:06,740
pretended that she liked the movie. Yeah. Really? I mean,

609
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:09,220
we thought it was crazy at the time, but I was like, man, that is,

610
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:12,460
that is pretty fucking ugly. That's my bullshitty. Yeah.

611
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:16,140
And there's some, did she hate it or was she fine with it? Like, okay,

612
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:20,780
cried and anger and it was so mad at the premiere and then pretending at the end

613
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:23,740
of the movie that PL Trevor's liked Mary Poppins, which is a great movie.

614
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:27,820
And I think you can make a point like people can adapt things and make, see,

615
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:30,900
well, they can show you what they see in it and make something just as good.

616
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:34,300
It doesn't have to be exactly the same as the source material.

617
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:38,660
That being said to literally change history into like,

618
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:43,540
she loved it. Really evil, really evil. Anyway. Yeah. So, well,

619
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:47,700
I'm saying we'll get it like a real clean version of whatever. Sure. Yes.

620
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:51,180
But we should, by the way, acknowledge the, that George Lucas,

621
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:55,020
we should just do like a commentary or like a review of the opening ceremony,

622
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:58,820
but what a crazy, I kind of liked it. The George Lucas is like,

623
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:03,260
it could have gone very badly, but it, but it didn't,

624
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:07,260
that's as good of praise as Lucas can give. I think,

625
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:12,060
but I, it felt sincere in that it was so not polished and not

626
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:12,900
sound bitey.

627
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:15,700
Yeah, that's the best compliment I think he can get.

628
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:19,740
That's the most emotion he can muster at this point. I think, uh, he's,

629
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,900
he's a very closed off man from what I see.

630
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:26,100
I would be very fascinated to read an autobiography from him. Yeah, sure.

631
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,260
I wonder if he doesn't want it. I wouldn't think he wants to do that.

632
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:33,700
Every time he served a meal at a restaurant and was everything to your liking.

633
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:37,340
Um, it could have gone very badly, but it didn't, I guess it didn't.

634
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:41,100
What about that museum? Wasn't he funding a museum in Chicago,

635
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,020
but not in Chicago. Oh, I forget.

636
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:47,700
He's buying that too. They're taking it. They're giving it to JJ.

637
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:51,460
Like JJ is going to build it. He, uh, I think George, uh,

638
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:55,780
regrets selling every day of his life. I think he regrets it. My baby.

639
00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:00,220
I think he would not have done it the way he did it now. That's all I will say.

640
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:05,660
So I think he might be still angry at Disney in general. So that's,

641
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,460
maybe that's also where some of his weirdness is coming from.

642
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:12,980
So him showing up at that thing was like, uh, you know, like Google,

643
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,860
going to your daughter's wedding and you don't really approve the room,

644
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,300
but you're not going to make a stink.

645
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,540
Right. Cause it's your daughter and you have to be there. Not going to ruin it.

646
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,180
They got Harrison though. I'm so curious.

647
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:28,620
What contract says Harrison has to show up to the opening of a theme park ride?

648
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,740
Well, but that's what I said when we were talking about that.

649
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:35,380
Like it's not hard to put someone in the back of a town car or an

650
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:39,980
Escalade, drive them from Venice to Anaheim,

651
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:43,980
send them in a back door, make sure they had a blunt on the way down,

652
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:47,900
wear a glass of wine on the way down, get them out, shake some hands,

653
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:51,660
take some pictures. Hi Mark. How's it going? Hi George. You know,

654
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:55,900
and then back in the, that wasn't part of the deal. I will not say hello.

655
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:59,860
Fine. Fine. I don't want to say hi to Mark.

656
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:03,300
I'm on the way home. I know you like it when I give you updates.

657
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,340
He's got an earpiece in. I don't know why you became Bernie.

658
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:08,100
I don't have to go out again until Halloween.

659
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:13,900
For those fun couples costumes. We have to get those. My only joy.

660
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:18,340
So when I'm dressed as a peapod and you're dressed as a stock of corn,

661
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:22,260
Pickle the box of Joe Joe's and a bottle of wine to take to this.

662
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:26,340
Whose party is it? This one's for the Sultan of Berni.

663
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:31,700
This one's for who? Which producer's kid? Who's Peter? Peter Mayhew.

664
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:35,140
The B played too. Oh yeah. Okay. He died. Yeah.

665
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:39,620
Okay. Yeah, that was nice.

666
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:44,740
Very, I have to go soon. So the very, very important question,

667
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,380
uh, the you spotted Mike from Mike Olson.

668
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,420
Did Jason's bag contain any boiled peanuts?

669
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:54,540
I don't understand that question. But it's also, of course your bag.

670
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,860
It is funny. Yes, it did. But why would you ask that?

671
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:01,220
No, I wish I had packed more snacks because we were there for so long.

672
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:04,900
I had to keep, you know, buying that Disney food.

673
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,020
Boiled peanuts would keep that stool regular.

674
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:11,660
Someone, yeah, that's maybe someone. Yeah. Someone pointed out,

675
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:15,100
I didn't notice that someone said in the line for smugglers round, it's like,

676
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:18,820
you know, the one voiceover guy sounds like you. And I did not notice that.

677
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:22,300
Yes. Yes. Did you notice that? Yes. I was pointing that out to somebody. Yeah.

678
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:27,500
Some, I don't, is it one of the like PA announcements in smugglers, right?

679
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:31,420
Anybody going on at like, keep your ears peeled, peeled,

680
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:34,380
like boiled peanuts for a voiceover.

681
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,780
It sounds a lot like our own Jason Sheridan. Yeah. I did.

682
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,540
Yep. I did not get that one hour buyout gig.

683
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:47,420
You missed out on that 600 bucks. Yeah. Well, somebody said, what were your first,

684
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:50,780
it was, let's see, let me look at this profile here.

685
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:55,380
From Ash to Cash says, or asks,

686
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:58,620
what was your first thought walking into the gates?

687
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,140
I got a feeling, I don't know if that I had a thought,

688
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:07,140
but I did get like a surge of like excitement. Like it course through my body.

689
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,020
I didn't have a thought, but I just went, Whoa.

690
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,820
I thought, Oh, it's good. It's good. I was like seeing it from a distance.

691
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:17,700
I'm still going through that like beautiful cave wall that they built.

692
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,540
I just like, I saw one little glimmer of a building. Like, it's good.

693
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,020
There's no question. I was wondering,

694
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,780
like is this whole thing going to be over hyped or overrated? One little,

695
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:27,620
like I saw some flag and like, absolutely not. It's great.

696
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:31,060
But someone we, we posted, we posted a bunch of photos and videos,

697
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:35,180
including in that big crowd, which again, opening day, opening slot,

698
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:40,020
opening like 8 a.m. pre 8 a.m. And someone quote tweeted that who,

699
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,660
someone who doesn't follow us. So I don't give a shit.

700
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:42,220
I noticed this.

701
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:46,580
Someone quote tweeted that and, and I think you wrote back, it's great. Yeah.

702
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:51,180
And I wrote back and deleted, uh, we posted seven other update. Like,

703
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,620
someone was like, well, people are very different than I,

704
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:57,780
I shan't be going here for a long time. And it's like,

705
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:02,300
did you not see the seven or eight other posts of us leisurely enjoying the

706
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,140
land?

707
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:08,180
It was a guy using the crowd video in which I show it's the smugglers of the

708
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:12,580
world. Like he used that to point out, oh my God, it's a fucking shit show.

709
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:17,420
This place is a nightmare. Nobody ever go there. And, uh, what he didn't know,

710
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:21,940
he didn't have the context to know that was the first group that ever went in.

711
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:25,660
That was not just like going from one store to another store.

712
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:29,140
Yeah. Your context. We live in a fake news time.

713
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:33,020
People are making Pelosi look drunk. You can't be doing this stuff.

714
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:35,980
Don't take videos out of context. Uh,

715
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:39,500
because most of it was very comfortable and I liked writing back and saying, uh,

716
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:40,820
yeah, what are you talking about?

717
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:43,580
And that opening crowd was one of the most exciting things ever.

718
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:47,580
What he didn't know is we saw a monstrous teeth getting brushed and we were all

719
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:50,100
on such a high from that. It fucking rules.

720
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:53,300
And I think that's my thing in general. Like I'm, because I was,

721
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:57,620
I totally was a person thinking this is going to be a shit show. Uh, and even,

722
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:00,620
but even if it is a shit show, give it a shot. So they, they've pulled,

723
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:04,140
they clearly are pulling off something so extraordinary there and, uh, don't,

724
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:07,060
uh, don't, don't hate until you, until you try it.

725
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:10,380
Yeah. I mean, we'll see how stuff goes when they switch to the virtual boarding

726
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:10,900
pass,

727
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:15,620
but it seems like they are regulating how many people are led into the land at

728
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:20,780
any given time so that people don't have a bad, like what a rip off this sucks

729
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,220
sort of experience.

730
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:28,980
Also, like when you, like anybody's searching for like,

731
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:31,260
yeah, see it does really work. And actually this thing isn't that good.

732
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,740
And people are saying the Falcons actually not that great.

733
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:36,620
At one point an entire theme park opened and one of the main things was superstar

734
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:41,620
limo. Like we are so far away from that gross era of like cheap shit out,

735
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:49,180
new bad journey into imagination. We're in like such a golden era.

736
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:50,780
And if you, you know, yeah,

737
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:55,780
you thought the pod engine could have been different or whatever, like all told,

738
00:42:56,260 --> 00:43:01,260
it's we're in such a golden age of theme parks and it's even little nitpicks.

739
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:05,180
Don't belied that that's genuinely very true.

740
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:08,220
I mean, everyone obviously wants the confirmation bias.

741
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:12,860
Everyone wants their assumption to be proven correct.

742
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:14,780
So I get that.

743
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,500
And I, and it's either that,

744
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:22,220
or it's also people sometimes just have too high of expectations. Like for instance,

745
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:26,380
like the Falcon or something like where it's not a hundred percent perfect.

746
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:28,700
And it's like, okay, well that means it's a let down.

747
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:31,660
It is modular and it presumably they can change stuff.

748
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:33,500
They can fix stuff a little more.

749
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:36,780
That's what somebody asks. Hidden peanuts asks the question. What did you,

750
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:39,380
what did you see that you think is most likely to change?

751
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,780
What seems likely to get pulled because it's too logistically difficult or hard

752
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,620
on cast members. I didn't see a ton of that,

753
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:47,020
but it feels like there's a lot of, there could be a lot of tweaking on that.

754
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:48,900
Falcon. I think they're going to do it too.

755
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:52,340
I don't think it's going to go unheard that there's a little bit of weirdness

756
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:53,420
and I, I, and,

757
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:57,940
and that maybe people want at least like a zone of the experience where you

758
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:02,580
don't, you aren't missing things because you're so busy. And, uh, I,

759
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:03,420
I don't know.

760
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:05,740
I think they're going to get the fee and it's the feedback and they're going to

761
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:09,980
want it. And I think we'll end up having a different feeling about that Falcon.

762
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,500
Supposedly I saw someone post about this.

763
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:17,780
There was like five or six different systems they tested of getting people

764
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:24,220
credentialed and into the land and they ran virtual models and real life tests

765
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:28,260
just to figure out, okay, the smoothest one was,

766
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:32,860
here's a QR code, go to launch pay, wait over here.

767
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:35,940
Now we'll let everyone in in these four hour increments.

768
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:39,820
Like they were testing that with like virtual models, analytics,

769
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:40,660
that sort of thing.

770
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:43,860
Wow. So, you know, uh, there,

771
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:48,580
there is thought going into this. Yeah. It's not just like, well,

772
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:52,460
let's open the gates and see what happens. Um, yeah. Disney test things.

773
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:56,540
They also tried four different models of how to clean monsterous teeth. Sure.

774
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:59,300
They tried mouthwash. There was more of a,

775
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:02,820
more of a jet brush kind of situation.

776
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:05,540
Old fashioned way worked.

777
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,020
And then loss. Look, there's a number of options.

778
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:12,060
Giant white strips. Big greenies.

779
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:16,180
Um, I probably do need to wrap it up. Sure.

780
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:20,980
Zach rider wants to know why Len tested won't tweeted him. Len is busy.

781
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:26,140
He's very busy. He had a busy man. He was working when we saw him.

782
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:30,580
So you're telling Zach get in line. Yeah.

783
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:32,420
Seriously.

784
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:34,900
Aren't you all so busy?

785
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:38,780
You would think he's like four cities a week.

786
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:44,340
I guess, you know, let's, let's end with this question. Uh,

787
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:47,740
it's Gabe Smith at SCT, uh,

788
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:52,940
underscore CAO can Honda Anacca get it? Okay.

789
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:57,220
Let me think about this. I don't know that I'm so attracted to, if I,

790
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:00,780
I'm a heterosexual, if we're talking Kinsey scale,

791
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:04,820
certainly closer to heterosexual. I don't know what number I am.

792
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:10,620
But would I be attracted to Honda Anacca? I don't think so.

793
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:15,780
I don't think so. That's not the question. Well, can he get it?

794
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:19,420
Well, how would you define the Kenny get it? Well, I think he's charming.

795
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:24,100
I think he's a little bit of a bad boy. You know, I don't know that you put a ring on that.

796
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:29,540
Cause he probably can't trust him. I think you can get it. I mean, I said,

797
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:31,260
like I said with Len, it's like they,

798
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:35,180
they did a good job of acquainting you with his character that unless you've

799
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:39,620
watched a bunch of the cartoons or read some comics, you might not know.

800
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:44,220
And they made him like, uh, interesting and simple and charming,

801
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:47,820
like pretty quickly. But Kylo Ren can get it. I will,

802
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:52,900
can I equivocally say that Kylo Ren can get it. Uh, Han Solo can get it.

803
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:57,420
I think certain versions of Luke Skywalker can get it. Uh,

804
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:58,260
Lando.

805
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:05,540
I would say, uh, Boba Fett even with his mysterious ways can get it.

806
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:10,700
I would say, uh, throw, throw some more out here. Uh, IGA.

807
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:13,940
I know I would not say boss can get it.

808
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:16,820
Dexter Jetser.

809
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:20,980
I would say that I lovable guy a lot much like a Hondo, but I don't,

810
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:25,140
he can't get it maybe from me, particularly me. We're talking.

811
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:28,460
He's a working man. Diners have to keep long hours.

812
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:32,420
I don't know if he would have the mental and emotional space for you.

813
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:33,420
Qui-Gon.

814
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:36,620
Yeah, the diner is who he gets it with.

815
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:43,060
Qui-Gon. Qui-Gon 100% can get it. Uh, what about me master?

816
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:44,180
Can I get it?

817
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:46,900
Here's the thing it's, uh, Anakin,

818
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:51,540
that version of Anakin can get it if you're maybe going through something and

819
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:54,820
you kind of want to just like be in a quick relationship, obviously,

820
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:56,740
but he certainly can get it.

821
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:02,340
Oh, that was one of the crazy. Give me a chance. Let me get it.

822
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:05,820
Jenny Nicholson posted on Twitter, uh, cast members said kids.

823
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:08,900
And she said, don't you mean younglings? And they're like, we actually, uh,

824
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:12,260
they decided not to use younglings because the main context in the movie it's

825
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:16,020
used is when a bunch of them are killed. Oh, yikes.

826
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:18,860
Younglings is out. Yeah. So that's, again,

827
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:22,580
that's that attention to detail that comes with a long lead time of preparing

828
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:27,580
for every possible thing in a theme park atmosphere as opposed to, all right,

829
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:29,220
we have a two months to shoot this movie.

830
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:34,580
I bet, um, I bet Honda could get it. I think like 20 year old,

831
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:39,300
I think young Honda was made. He's like a little, he's a little bulgier.

832
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:42,300
He's a little crag year. I bet there was a time when he was, yeah,

833
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:43,780
he was a handsome dude.

834
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:48,740
So young Honda comes out on Disney plus I will then finally see that yes,

835
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:52,900
indeed. Honda Anacca can get it. Disney plus,

836
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:54,740
maybe that's the name of the show.

837
00:48:55,260 --> 00:49:00,020
Young Honda can get it. Young Honda Anacca can get it. Like Parker Lewis can't lose.

838
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:04,100
Same thing. Yeah. I like a good tie. I like a good sentence title.

839
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:08,140
That's fantastic. All right. Looking forward to it. Um, I need to go out the door.

840
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:11,260
Sure. So, uh, you survived podcast for the second gate.

841
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:13,180
Thank you for all of your questions and for, uh,

842
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:16,700
letting us talk about this thing more. We put, look,

843
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:19,060
we're going to keep stretching this into a lot.

844
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:23,940
So just tell us if it's too much or anything, but we'll, you know,

845
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:27,700
we'll do 20 episodes, but Galaxy's Edge all told,

846
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:30,980
I think we need to go do the Falcon more to really like,

847
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:35,420
maybe do an episode all about the Falcon, but we need like more flight time under

848
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:35,900
our belt.

849
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:38,660
You guys have some return expeditions coming up.

850
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:41,980
Very soon we will be back on Batuu.

851
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:44,780
Yeah. So, and you should upgrade to,

852
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:49,020
I might become a FlexPass boy. Yeah. Try that out.

853
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:52,740
Think. And if you, if you're doing FlexPass, tweet at Jason and let him know.

854
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:57,380
If you have any FlexPass experience, if you bought it or converted to it,

855
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:58,980
let me know how it's going.

856
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:02,860
All right. Bright suns, clear eyes.

857
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:05,700
Can't lose. Can't lose. Good tips for Jason.
