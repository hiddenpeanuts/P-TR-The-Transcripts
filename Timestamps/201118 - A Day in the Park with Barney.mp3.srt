00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate,

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
with my good friends, Michael, Scott,

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and my favorite student, Jason.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Favorite student, what the hell?

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What Barney?

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Why not me?

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Oh, he's just such a good student is all I'm saying.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Student, when do you judge academic abilities?

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm a teacher now.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Like kind of a second career.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yeah.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The show's not going.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
My show was canceled.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I thought we were just friends.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Friends, why did this power dynamic suddenly shift?

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
No, I'm in charge now.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The whole show is going to be this play.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Barney's the fourth Mike now.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Yeah.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Podcast The Ride, Second Gate, here we are today.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm busting out an old impression.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Probably my earliest impression ever, I believe.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Did you like do that around the house?

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yes.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Oh, interesting.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
My sister was like three years younger than me.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So she was watching Barney.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It was right for her age, but I was fascinated by it.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
She had a Barney doll, and I used to do the Barney voice

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
with the doll constantly.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
That was like, I love, that was so much fun for me to do.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So it's back.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
My voice, my Barney voice is back.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm a little hoarse.

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I think we might be in a similar area.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I also have a younger sister and I felt, yeah,

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
she watched it a lot and I felt like I had to not like it.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And I was aware that there was a lot of Barney hate,

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
but maybe I did some like hate watching.

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I definitely would like sit and watch Barney,

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
even if I like snarked it and made fun of it.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Maybe it was maybe for a lot of kids,

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
it occupies that slot of like the first thing you were too old for.

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Or like sort of felt that way or felt pressured to feel that way to grow up.

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I think that's right. Yeah.

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yeah. I had a little brother and he loved it.

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And I wanted to hit Barney with a car.

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Like I agree.

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You were the cynical kid who hated Barney.

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I hated it. I hated it.

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I knew I was supposed to hate it.

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Why do you want to hit me with a car, Jason?

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I just did it like,

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and it didn't have the refined sensibility of Eureka's Castle or a David the Gnome,

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
you know, that stuff that I liked when I was in like preschool.

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Well, yeah, it is.

58
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Or the like Sesame Street with its genre parodies and genuinely funny sketch style writing.

59
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Barney certainly is a little more soft in a lot of ways.

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It is an uninteresting show.

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yeah. Not sophisticated at all.

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yeah. Not subversive at all.

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
But there is a dividing line.

64
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I think it's the line between old millennial and young millennial is like old millennials hate Barney.

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Younger millennials loved Barney.

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And it's such a fine, you can really just cut the generation in half, I think, at that moment.

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yeah.

68
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yeah. I mean, I have a lot of affection for him now because of like just goofing around with the doll.

69
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yeah.

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You know, you did everything like kids would do, like I would go in my sister's Fisher Price fridge

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
and I'd be like, Barney's drinking alcohol.

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Like that was like, I'd have like a little plastic cup and he'd be like drinking it fast.

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And who knows what that means to a kid?

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
But I would be like, now Barney's drunk.

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Barney has a gun.

76
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Barney would fight with, yeah, I would have him fight with like characters too.

77
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And I'm trying to think of who would be to the same scale because this was a Barney doll that was like

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
sort of similar to the Barney that's in the show that comes to life.

79
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
In case you don't know where we're going with this, there is a Universal Studios Barney show and play area

80
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
that we are actually going to talk about if you're wondering.

81
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
In Florida since 1995.

82
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Since 1995.

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Going even recently and maybe its days are numbered or they're limiting it for now.

84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The show has been going during COVID.

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Okay.

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yes.

87
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
This show has been going for 25 years.

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
This show has outlasted Jaws, it's outlasted Confrontation, it's outlasted Back to the Future the Ride

89
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
and that's so fucked up.

90
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Tower of Terror at DCA.

91
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Tower of Terror at DCA.

92
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It feels like, this show does not feel like a linchpin and yet it's just like, it is a real like

93
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
titan when you say the timeline like that.

94
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yes.

95
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It kept its head down, stayed out of the way, just chugged along, has outlasted the Barney TV show

96
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:25,000
which stopped making new content on the regular in 2009, although the reruns still air.

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Currently on something, a channel called Universal Kids.

98
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Did anyone know about the television channel Universal Kids?

99
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
No.

100
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
No.

101
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So that's where...

102
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
That's one of those like deep cable like if you still have cable and there's the weird 2000 channels.

103
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Yes.

104
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I believe it used to be Sprout.

105
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I kind of remember Sprout.

106
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I do know Sprout.

107
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm familiar with Sprout.

108
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So wait a minute.

109
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Sprout became Universal Kids.

110
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Universal Kids.

111
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Or it was a segment on something like, I don't know.

112
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
PBS might also use that branding.

113
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
But yeah, Barney is still going strong.

114
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And to give him the benefit of the doubt, I was trying to figure out, oh, is it because it's popular with international

115
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
guests because there was a Barney World Tour that World used lately.

116
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I think it was around 2015 that mostly hit the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.

117
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So there may be still...

118
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
But no theme park presence besides this, correct?

119
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I am not sure about that.

120
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
If there's other Barneys.

121
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I think this is the only one.

122
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
They touted it as the only place on Earth where you can see Barney every day.

123
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Oh, that's crazy.

124
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I will say I didn't even know this was there.

125
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I didn't know this was here.

126
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
If I've been to Universal a few times, I didn't know you could get your picture taken with Barney.

127
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I don't have that photo and I'm a little upset.

128
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You genuinely didn't know until we talked about doing this?

129
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I don't think so.

130
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Maybe I saw it on the map, but I didn't realize what it was.

131
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I don't think I ever wandered back into the plaza with the fountain and the statue, which I like the statue.

132
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It looks like Barney is using his dump truck seat to hover in the air.

133
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Wait, did you just call Barney's seat his dump truck seat?

134
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Yeah, he's got a big seat.

135
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
He's got a big dump truck seat.

136
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Barney's dump truck seat?

137
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Dump truck seat.

138
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
People online talk about everyone, the moms in Pixar movies have dump truck asses.

139
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So we say seat on this show.

140
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Who says that?

141
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Dump truck?

142
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
People, this is a thing.

143
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
What websites are you on?

144
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
This is a joke on Twitter.

145
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Because Mrs. Incredible.

146
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I've seen Mrs. Incredible be referred to as thick, but I have never ever seen dump truck ass in reference.

147
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Yeah, but we say seat here.

148
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So Barney got a dump truck seat.

149
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
He's using it to hover off the ground.

150
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
What other mom has a dump truck seat?

151
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
By the way, we're getting into dangerous territory.

152
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
We're getting into dangerous territory.

153
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
He can't even talk to animals.

154
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Jason is trying to open it up for his perverted ways.

155
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Barney's an animal.

156
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
That's true.

157
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm just saying you brought in the mothers of the Pixar movies.

158
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Well, I just didn't want it to make it seem like I just came up with the phrase dump truck ass out there.

159
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I learned about it.

160
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Wow.

161
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Got a big dump truck seat.

162
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I guess that's true.

163
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
The Barney statue.

164
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
One of the few statues that we don't have to pull down with shades.

165
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
This statue can stand.

166
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
A southern monument that can stay.

167
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
The Barney statue at Universal Studios Florida.

168
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That is south of the board.

169
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Yeah, that's south of the Mason Dixon.

170
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Although I've seen older millennial kids try to go in there and tear it down because they hate them so much.

171
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm surprised, Jason, you didn't try to drive your car through there and knock the statue down with your car.

172
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You hated Barney.

173
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I hated Barney, but I have to say reading about this did endear him to me, especially because there's like weird sections of the Barney Wikipedia where it's like some thought.

174
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You know, some people think Barney led to a sense of entitlement among millennials and didn't teach enough about how to deal with difficult situations and unpleasant realities.

175
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And I was like, Oh, that's shut up.

176
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
That sucks.

177
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
That's stupid.

178
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Also, if anyone is complaining about millennial entitlement in 2020, get your fucking head examined.

179
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Like freaks.

180
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Still, that's still a talk.

181
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Still a talk.

182
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Just inherit.

183
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
We were left an awful world that just gets shittier and shittier.

184
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Why do we want anything?

185
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Why do we want things?

186
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You know, why does a joy, a bright purple dinosaur?

187
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
For God's sake.

188
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Yeah.

189
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I think that Barney himself is a good design and is a character.

190
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Like, ultimately, the show is nothing.

191
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:20,000
The show is just Barney praising, like, kids for like doing art projects, which is this is a bit I've done.

192
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I've done with Lindsay around.

193
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'll just be like, that's a great macaroni painting.

194
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Like, like, that's like most of the mostly what the show is.

195
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And then like a kid is like a very minor problem.

196
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And then they sing like, if you're happy and you know it, clap your hands.

197
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And I don't even there's like there's not a ton going on, but the design of Barney is good.

198
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yeah.

199
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And that's all you need, I think.

200
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I mean, it's well, I'm a bigger fan, I have to say, of original Barney.

201
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Well, go back like the first couple of videos where he's darker purple and boxier like this one, this side view where he's just got like,

202
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
a full rectangle mouth.

203
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
This is my Barney.

204
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I think I don't think they should have softened these.

205
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I like I like sharp face Barney.

206
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I am a big fan of sharp face Barney as well.

207
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I like there was him with a little beanie with a propeller on it in there that you showed.

208
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Now that's good.

209
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Yeah, Scott.

210
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Now you bring it up.

211
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I would like to play a clip from the original Barney, which was called Barney and the Backyard Gang.

212
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
These were the videos before the TV show.

213
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yeah.

214
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Right.

215
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So this was this was the the pointy pointy Barney.

216
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Before they partnered with PBS.

217
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yeah, it's just individual.

218
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Right.

219
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And I did not watch this like first run.

220
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
This is just something I came upon today as I was researching.

221
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You can see that Barney is I'll say this a little unnerving.

222
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So here we go.

223
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
He's not quite as bubbly.

224
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Starting in a kiddie pool.

225
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
This is when Barney appears.

226
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
The kids are all in a pool, which, yes, that's a little weird as well.

227
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
One more.

228
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Well, I'm only one.

229
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm only one.

230
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And I'm only one.

231
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And I'm four.

232
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
My kid sister.

233
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
She follows me everywhere.

234
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Well, that's just because she is.

235
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's like also a sitcom, which is bizarre.

236
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You're welcome to stay.

237
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So are the rest of you.

238
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You know what I always say.

239
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yes, mama, we know.

240
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
All right.

241
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
All right.

242
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I have queued this in the wrong place.

243
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Well, but you reminded me of this is another reason I like.

244
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Well, I do like darker purple sharp face Barney.

245
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I don't like that they originally the tapes originally included this mom

246
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
character played by Sandy Duncan.

247
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I've spoken against Sandy Duncan in the past because she's one of those

248
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
perennial.

249
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I don't know.

250
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I don't know.

251
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I don't know.

252
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I don't know.

253
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I don't know.

254
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I don't know.

255
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I don't know either.

256
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I don't know.

257
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I don't know.

258
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I don't know.

259
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm not sure.

260
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I've not seen Sandy Duncan before.

261
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm sure.

262
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I've not seen her before.

263
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm not sure.

264
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I think Sandy Duncan is a very good actress.

265
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I'm not sure.

266
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I don't know.

267
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I don't know.

268
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I think Sandy Duncan is a very good actress because she's one of those

269
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
perennial Peter pans, which may be factored into my negative pan feelings.

270
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Just she just like epitomizes the kind of like frighteningly friendly

271
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
entertainment that was that I believe my mom was reared entirely on

272
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
She is Sandy Duncan is to Barney.

273
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
What Haley Mills is to say by the bell slash.

274
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Good morning, Miss Bliss.

275
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Right when she was dismissed, we don't want this lady.

276
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
We just want to.

277
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
We just want to see what the kids are doing.

278
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I think yes.

279
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Sandy Duncan went away and the show sword.

280
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
This I believe is the correct area of the place I want to play.

281
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
But just that did give you a little hint of like there was this weird mom character

282
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
and it felt more like a sitcom more than just like Barney hanging out bad.

283
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I like khaki mom shorts that are kind of what my tour guide uniform was.

284
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Universal Studios.

285
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Not a fan of the shorts.

286
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
All right.

287
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Here we go.

288
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
That will go next weekend.

289
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Okay.

290
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Okay.

291
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Okay.

292
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Okay.

293
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
So Sandy Duncan laughs.

294
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Boy, that's good news.

295
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
We can make believe we're at the beach.

296
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
What do you mean?

297
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Well, we can close our eyes and make believe real hard.

298
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Close your eyes in a pool.

299
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Never.

300
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
That's not how it's done.

301
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I did.

302
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
No.

303
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Over here.

304
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Over here.

305
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Are you?

306
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Wow.

307
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
What?

308
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,000
That's just by wind.

309
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
A powder guns.

310
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Oh, I'll get swimsuits.

311
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Why is he just laughing?

312
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
That's saying he's not saying anything.

313
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Terrifying.

314
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
He's very friendly.

315
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
This hug has been going this entire time for the whisper.

316
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Jason, since you were the chime and was her.

317
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
He is a dinosaur.

318
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
So like, he doesn't say it.

319
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
He just like laughs like a main, like a little like creep, like a little pervert.

320
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:19,000
He's like, I don't get a good vibe from this Barney is what I'm saying.

321
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
No, this Barney's definitely scarier.

322
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Yeah.

323
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Like he's less good for kids.

324
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I realize, but I just like him more.

325
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And look, he was later on.

326
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
He's wearing a sailor suit.

327
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Yeah.

328
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Young Mike Carlson.

329
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
He was.

330
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And young Scott Jertner, as I determined.

331
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Yeah.

332
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
They go into like a fantasy where he's like a sailor in the air.

333
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
The effects on this special too, or this tape are pretty great.

334
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,000
They're flying a tub around.

335
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Yeah.

336
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
So anyway, I mean, that's, that's his old department.

337
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
This is backyard gang and his voice is also a little bit lazier.

338
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It's like, it's like Homer first season or something.

339
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Yeah.

340
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Oh, hey.

341
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Hi.

342
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm Barney.

343
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Get some frosty chocolate shakes.

344
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
So yeah.

345
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It was also, yeah.

346
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Barney was kind of Walter Mathi at the start.

347
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Right.

348
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
So that was not my bar.

349
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
If you look at the VHS cover, they're really pushing like, actually I'll just share the

350
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
screen.

351
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Like, look how they present it.

352
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
So much is Sandy Duncan, the point that like, she's way bigger than Barney.

353
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Barney's like almost cropped out of this photo.

354
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
This is a picture of Barney.

355
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I couldn't even tell you the name because there's so many names Barney and it's in the

356
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
three wishes.

357
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Is it called three wishes or Barney and the backyard gang, which is way smaller or starring

358
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Sandy Duncan, which is the biggest text or sing along with us.

359
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Like there, this is all over the map.

360
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
This, this is some very poor, like this could be shown in a graphic design class.

361
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Make sure your title is clear.

362
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And then you have the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,

363
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
the title is clear.

364
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I mean, I guess they thought Sandy Duncan, we're like trying to under, yeah, underplay

365
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Barney.

366
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Yeah.

367
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Cause Sandy Duncan, I guess they thought was the draw at that point for people who loved

368
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
wholesome entertainment and should never be the draw for people who loved wholesome entertainment

369
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
and never be the drug.

370
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
She was the rubber stamp of approval to me.

371
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Hmm.

372
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Well, I, we should be happy.

373
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
If anything's making millennials feel entitled or whatever, or presented too much of a fantasy

374
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's smiling.

375
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Sandy Duncan showing you there's no problems.

376
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
You just to be chipper and dance your life away.

377
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
We should find out what the darkest thing Sandy Duncan was in.

378
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Like what piece of entertainment?

379
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Cause it seems like, yeah, she was only in happy, smiling, family friendly fair.

380
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I assume you're looking it up now.

381
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I think so.

382
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Was she in like, was she ever.

383
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
And like leprechaun three or something.

384
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
She was leprechaun's mom or something.

385
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Leprechaun three.

386
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I don't know.

387
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm not sure.

388
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It seems like pretty just Disney.

389
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It seems like million dollar duck and such.

390
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And thank God Sandy Duncan was not brought into the, the universal attraction.

391
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I have a point about the, the universal stuff, which is that.

392
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I mean, some of Mike, you not knowing that this was there, it is this very tucked away

393
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:26,000
corner of the park that might be easy to miss that might like a lot of guests, especially if you're just in pursuit of

394
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Diagon Alley or stuff that's more recent, you might just like overlook this whole area in general.

395
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It is a little tucked away.

396
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:43,000
And in fact, this, I might declare this the weirdest name of a land, quote unquote, anywhere in major theme parks in

397
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Disney or universal is mostly they follow.

398
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Mostly like, all right, I see what this land did.

399
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I see why it's called this.

400
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,000
But this whole area being called that Barney, of course, lives in Woody Woodpecker's Kids Zone.

401
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Right. Yes.

402
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Yes.

403
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:04,000
And the attractions in Woody Woodpecker's Kids Zone are.

404
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Wait, I'm actually boy, this one surprised me.

405
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Animal Actors on location.

406
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
So the Animal Actors show is part of Woody Woodpecker's Kids Zone.

407
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Even though I was fairly certain that was part of World Expo, the other weird named area of that part.

408
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Yeah, I know the western boundaries of Woody Woodpecker's Kids Zone is the Animal Actors.

409
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Yes, that's correct.

410
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
A little dog from that show got out the other day was wandering around.

411
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
They were chasing him down by the movie makeup.

412
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Pretty fun. Pretty fun little clip.

413
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
They got the dog, though.

414
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
They got the dog. Yeah, it's fine.

415
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
OK, that's good.

416
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Back in your cage.

417
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Back in your cage.

418
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Yeah.

419
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
The elsewhere in Woody Woodpecker's Kids Zone.

420
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
OK, day in the park with Barney.

421
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Curious George goes to town, which is another playground thing.

422
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Woody Woodpecker's Nuthouse Coaster, Fievel's Playland and ET Adventure.

423
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
All of these.

424
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,000
This really underlines the schizophrenic nature of the universal kids properties.

425
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
We're like, what child?

426
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Who are your favorite characters?

427
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Well, I'd have to say Barney, Curious George, Woody Woodpecker, Fievel, ET.

428
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Oh, and there's a SpongeBob gift shop.

429
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
What? There's a SpongeBob gift shop.

430
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
And currently there is.

431
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'll show you guys.

432
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Currently, there's this.

433
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:32,000
What are I believe they're calling character moments because they are not doing some shows and meet and greets right now.

434
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:40,000
So Barney and BJ and Baby Bop just stand on a little stage and sing a song and wave to the crowd.

435
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
OK, that's all right.

436
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
There's a Fievel banner behind them.

437
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Yeah, that's a cowboy hat.

438
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Fievel brand. Yeah, Fievel's.

439
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Yeah, I didn't even know this much land existed back there either.

440
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
This is like because this is what they were talking about.

441
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Maybe putting Nintendo in for a while before it was going to go in Epic Universe.

442
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
And then who knows? Maybe it goes back here.

443
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Yeah, they don't build that third park.

444
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's a huge plot of land.

445
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And I remember going to Universal for the first time and being so excited despite the fact that I was so easily scared.

446
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
My family loved Alfred Hitchcock.

447
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:29,000
So to stand in front of the Bates House, the Psycho House, which was the set from Psycho 4 that they put in the park.

448
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
And you could get your picture at the bottom of the stairs.

449
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:42,000
And then next door was the original Universal Hard Rock Cafe that it was a big deal that you could enter from outside the park or inside the park.

450
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Right.

451
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
That's an area I have intense nostalgia for.

452
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Yes.

453
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
For whatever reason, being around that old Hard Rock, I don't know what it is and the weird.

454
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I remember looking up at the scary Psycho House and it's so weird.

455
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:02,000
They just kind of arbitrarily also built one here that is not or in Florida that is not the original one.

456
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
So strange.

457
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Yeah, this was all like a weird vacant trail until they put really disparate kids playgrounds throughout it.

458
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:23,000
It does feel like Poltergeist where they tore down a famous horror house and built like a very supposedly friendly, family friendly like house with Barney in it.

459
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
So like it does feel like this space might be haunted.

460
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Mm hmm.

461
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:37,000
But I remember that observation being made that like they turned they tore down the Psycho House and put Barney up and that if you didn't like Barney, that was kind of a way to like damn it.

462
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
But I also don't think that's entirely accurate.

463
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I don't think the show literally sits where the Psycho House was.

464
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Right. No.

465
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
But it's it is it is interesting.

466
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Like what I did not go to Universal when this Bates Motel was set up.

467
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Like I was not there then.

468
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
So it's like was animal was animal actors open day one in Hollywood.

469
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I keep saying Hollywood, Florida.

470
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I believe so.

471
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Yeah.

472
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Yeah.

473
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
That was there.

474
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Bates Motel animal actors.

475
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Well, no, there wouldn't you wouldn't have had a view of one from the other like yet around a corner.

476
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Yeah.

477
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,000
And then ET is weirdly there that doesn't really fit into this like calling it a kid ride isn't exactly right.

478
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I mean, there's kids who couldn't go on that ride or would find that ride scary.

479
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Yeah.

480
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
But I love the Fievel slide.

481
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I love the Fievel slide.

482
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I love the animal actor show.

483
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I still do if I've ever at either of the Universal parks.

484
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It's like, oh, what do we do?

485
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
We have some time to go.

486
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Like we can go to animal actors.

487
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I will always opt for animal actor show.

488
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
We got to do that one.

489
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
You talk about things that haven't changed.

490
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
And it's like that's you feel I mean, they're they're doing it right now, obviously.

491
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,000
But hopefully they are back at some point and you'll go like, oh, my God, still Mick Jagger monkey lips.

492
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Still like embarrassed monkey who had their towel stole.

493
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Oh, yeah.

494
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
He was covering up their groin because they got pulled out of the shower.

495
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Like there's something real nice about.

496
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Wow.

497
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Some things never change.

498
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I mean, I kind of like the fact that kids know it is barely.

499
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
It's just so odd.

500
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:23,000
It's such an expensive piece of real estate to still be stuck in like nineteen ninety five.

501
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
It's so funny.

502
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
And I am surprised.

503
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I have not.

504
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I have found myself bored wandering around Universal Orlando before, and I'm amazed I have not gone back here.

505
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Like I I have never even been in like the Barney.

506
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I have no memory of the Barney Plaza.

507
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Like I guess when it opened, maybe my brother, I think he would have been too old for even he would have been too old for Barney by the time this show opened.

508
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Hmm.

509
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
When was the last time you went on the Fival slide?

510
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I don't know.

511
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Is that one of the ones where you like have to be under a certain?

512
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I feel like my parents did it with me.

513
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I don't know that they actually say specifically how big you have to be on some of this, because like there's a Barney Playland here or it's called.

514
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
What is it called?

515
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Barney's backyard.

516
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Barney's backyard.

517
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,000
But like, for instance, the Grizzly Challenge Trail at Disney's California Adventure, that's, you know, anybody can walk and climb that.

518
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
But there are little tunnels on the ground floor that are mostly for the kids.

519
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
That are mostly for children.

520
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
But you and I, I could fit those.

521
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
You and I went in this tunnel about five years ago, I think.

522
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Oh, yeah.

523
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I can squeeze in.

524
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:43,000
And I believe right before we did, like a young teen ran up to the tunnel, looked at it as if he was in a cartoon and went YOLO and jumped in the tunnel.

525
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I do remember this.

526
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Yeah.

527
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
And then you went in and I was like, well, I got to try it, right?

528
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Yeah.

529
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
So, yeah, it's, it's, I don't know.

530
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
We probably, you probably could go on the 5-0 slide now.

531
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
It's just, it's, look, people would maybe look, look down on you a little bit because that's for children.

532
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
It's possible.

533
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
It's not as big as the Challenge Trail.

534
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,000
The Challenge Trail still, I think you can get away with it because like it's got big enough stuff for adults to.

535
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Well, my white whale is the Pterodon flyers, I think it's called, or the Pterodactyl flyers.

536
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
The one over at the Jurassic Park at Islands of Adventure.

537
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
You have to be under a certain height.

538
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:33,000
And when I was like 12 or 13, whenever it opened, it was brand new.

539
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
So there was like a two hour wait for this rink eating thing, but it goes above the whole land.

540
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:46,000
And you know, I like to be high up, but I still, I never got around to riding it because it doesn't eat up a lot of people per hour.

541
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
So it always has a long wait.

542
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
And now I'm too tall.

543
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
While we're on the topic real quick, and I know we've touched on this a little bit.

544
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I mean, we all, three of us, I assume as kids were into what you'd call a play McDonald's play place.

545
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Chuck E. Cheese ball.

546
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Like, right.

547
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
We're all in that zone.

548
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I think most kids are.

549
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
It's not that unusual.

550
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
There was a place called Leaps and Bounds.

551
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I remember Leaps and Bounds.

552
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Yeah.

553
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
By my house.

554
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:20,000
That was like a three story tubes ball pit thing that I just was my favorite place.

555
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
It was maybe open for a year.

556
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Maybe lasted a year.

557
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
And I think we went there when I was a little too old too.

558
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
We had like somebody's birthday party in like fifth grade.

559
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Yeah.

560
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
And like we're a little too big to be going through those tubes.

561
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,000
But I would love an adult tube business.

562
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
A business where adults could crawl through tubes.

563
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:51,000
And I know we have like, what I've brought this up before, tough mudders and you get shocked and you're muddy.

564
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
And like this is temporary.

565
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
And I don't want that.

566
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I want fun, colorful tubes in a big building, but big enough for adults to go in.

567
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
And look, the way I feel about it is YOLO.

568
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
You know, you only live once.

569
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
And let's have some adult tube fun.

570
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
But even, I mean, not like now though.

571
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Not in a few years.

572
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
In a few years.

573
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Let's celebrate the end of the disease.

574
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
But by, let's all like, all right, it's over.

575
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Let's all just go touch everything we can all the time.

576
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Let's, yes.

577
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Let's all go crawl on our hands and knees through a dirty tube together.

578
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Get like, get like a log jam of humans in the tube.

579
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
All breathing in.

580
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,000
And we'll say, and we'll all be taking deep breaths of each other's exhale and going, oh, isn't this nice?

581
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Do you remember when we couldn't do this?

582
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
This is fantastic.

583
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Big cuddle puddle in the tube, everyone.

584
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:57,000
We'll have a cuddle puddle in the tube and enjoy all the germs from each other's mouths.

585
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
It's going to be great.

586
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
So you're describing a non-sexual orgy.

587
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
This has nothing to do with sex.

588
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Nothing.

589
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
This is all about fun and wholesome.

590
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
This is what Sandy Duncan would approve of.

591
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Just tube fun.

592
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
This is just tube fun for adults.

593
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
For adults.

594
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
It's fine.

595
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
It's fine.

596
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
And it sounds better than those like drink a beer, throw an axe.

597
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Of course it does.

598
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Look, I'm not against throwing an axe.

599
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I'll throw an axe if somebody invites me to do it.

600
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Sure.

601
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
But what would you rather do?

602
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Crawl through a bunch of tubes and go in an adult ball pit or throw an axe?

603
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
It sounds way better than like, oh, come to the Instagram museum.

604
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Oh, it's the Museum of Ice.

605
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Like, fuck you.

606
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
That's not a museum.

607
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
You build a shitty set.

608
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Fuck off.

609
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I agree.

610
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Yeah, that's a weird area.

611
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Like sometimes I'll think about doing them for the show.

612
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Like there's a Britney Spears Instagram and then like, wait, why is it $150?

613
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
And like, none of this is the sets from the video.

614
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
This was like a, this is a closed Kmart a month ago.

615
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
There's nothing historic here.

616
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I don't need to do this.

617
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I get that this business I'm proposing, there's going to have to be a lot of waivers.

618
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
There's going to be a lot of waivers signed.

619
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
There's going to be a lot of people hurting their knees.

620
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
There's going to be a lot of like debilitating cramps happening.

621
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Yeah, that's the issue.

622
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Just the, your body maybe can't handle it as well.

623
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I think though, and I'm, I'm a little feeling a little run down as I think a lot of us are at this moment, but I feel like I can still go if it comes to high octane tube fun.

624
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Well, it's hard to know until you're, I have not had my tube fun tested recently.

625
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I just think, I know this, you know, people, you know, they go like I was on the high school basketball team.

626
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I could still play, you know, if push comes to shove, I think I can, I can still go.

627
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I'm talking about give me an hour, hour and a half in a play place.

628
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I think I can still do it.

629
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I don't think I'm going to be passing out or anything.

630
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I think I can still hold up is what I'm getting at.

631
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I can still go on lots of slides.

632
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I can go on lots of slides.

633
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I can do like a flip into ball, a ball pit.

634
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I can skate like kind of scale a little wall.

635
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I'm trying to think of how to describe how they would have it.

636
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
You know, those are like little like, it's like a fake rock climbing.

637
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Yeah.

638
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
For kids, it's not a little inclined.

639
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Yeah. Yeah, I can, I can still do it.

640
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I can, I can do a tiny one.

641
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I'm not going to a climbing gym.

642
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
That's another thing where I was like, I don't, I don't see the appeal.

643
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I don't. This is not for me.

644
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Yeah. I mean, I trampoline parks, I think are getting close, which I actually have not been.

645
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Yeah. And I've still been wanting to have like a birthday at one of these,

646
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
which I assume will end in like half of my friends getting a broken ankle,

647
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
more like landing on their neck and like we have to go to the hospital like 25 minutes in.

648
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Everyone's like, what are we doing here?

649
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
And I'm like, it's fun.

650
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
We're all in our mid to late thirties.

651
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Well, I hope Gio enjoyed walking.

652
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Well, he could.

653
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
He had a good run.

654
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Yeah.

655
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Yeah.

656
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Decades worth of walking.

657
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
He'll be fine.

658
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
He'll be fine.

659
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Whatever shape he's in after that.

660
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
So anyway, I, I, I love the place.

661
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Clearly.

662
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I'm itching to play.

663
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I think the most iconic piece of Play Place, I don't know, iconography is the office at Officer Big Mac,

664
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
a play place where you can climb up and go in his mouth.

665
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I think that's the thing I'd most like to have, certainly, if I could own one of those and put it in a backyard.

666
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Right. Which I guess now that I'm thinking about it as some sort of jail.

667
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Yeah, that's a jail.

668
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,000
That's that's like getting kids accustomed to what it would be like to be held in a detention center.

669
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:11,000
So but yeah, that's that I was both excited to be in that and scared also because my memory of that Play Place thing was like it was it was on an incline.

670
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:17,000
You would climb up and then you'd like try to kind of fight to not slide back down to where the ladder was.

671
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
And there'd be a bunch of kids in there and it was just like, you know, mad.

672
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
There was Thunderdome in there.

673
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Yeah, I feel like it's one of my only childhood, man, like like all of age three.

674
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I remember one time being in that burger cage and that's that's it.

675
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
It really takes the pressure off me as a parent.

676
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Like if he gets upset, I'm like, you won't remember this.

677
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I mean, you like you, you'll remember like one thing per year, maybe.

678
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
And not this year.

679
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
No way.

680
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Yeah.

681
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
My memory is off.

682
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
My memory of it, too, is that it was about 10 feet tall.

683
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Of course, I will show you the reality of what it is.

684
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
It is, you know, maybe four feet off the ground, three feet off.

685
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Is that it?

686
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Is it your memory of it?

687
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Like it was like a towering, like two story.

688
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

689
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Here it is.

690
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Wow.

691
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
That's shocking.

692
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Yeah, I didn't.

693
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Yeah, like a very small girl is exactly the height of the pole in this picture you're showing.

694
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
But it felt like you felt you were climbing Mount Everest.

695
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Yeah.

696
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Was there like an observation deck because there's holes in his hat and his constant hat.

697
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Oh, maybe.

698
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Oh, yeah.

699
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Could you climb up and see in there or is that just like so kids don't suffocate?

700
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
It's a good question.

701
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
It is.

702
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I don't.

703
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
It is open air.

704
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Oh, the tube, the tube.

705
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Yeah, I guess you needed some holes in there just to be safe.

706
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Yeah.

707
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I wonder just out of curiosity.

708
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I'll look this up while we're talking how much this would cost because it looks like

709
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
people have bought them and put them in their backyard.

710
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Well, I've looked into expensive McDonald's items before and the thing that I found is

711
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,000
that a lot of them, while relatively affordable, cost like $800 to ship if you aren't in the

712
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
area where it's being sold.

713
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
And at least in one point, at one point in time, these were being sold very heavily in

714
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
the Chicago area.

715
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
So perhaps you could use your family connection.

716
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,000
And if somebody has a car that can move one of these things, you could get that discount

717
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
and truck it back to Los Angeles and put it in your apartment.

718
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
You know, this is the stuff our parents didn't think of.

719
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
This is what we were denied.

720
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
The thought of like, you know what we could do?

721
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:29,000
We could buy some old fast food restaurant play equipment and give it to our children.

722
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
They weren't creative at all.

723
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
No, they didn't think to do something that I did recently, which is watch a trade show

724
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:41,000
video from the 70s shot on a millimeter film encouraging McDonald's franchises to buy

725
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:48,000
these things and showing you product by products like the apple pie tree will delight children

726
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
of all ages.

727
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
This is really like dingy red tinted film.

728
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I mean, I love this is like the definition of the kind of thing I want to watch.

729
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
But I would like show my if I told my parents, hey, remember how we would play at the McDonald's

730
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Playland?

731
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Well, recently I found a trade show film.

732
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
They'd go like, what did we do?

733
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Why didn't we?

734
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,000
How'd you end up locked in your childhood and only getting more and more boring by the year?

735
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:20,000
You spent your 30s in the 1970s having key parties and putting meat into jello molds.

736
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
We spent it watching old trade show videos on YouTube.

737
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
We are not the same.

738
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:33,000
We spent it on eBay trying to find the vintage McDonald's playground ride fillet of fish

739
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
play play spring toy that sold for $500.

740
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Was that like one that you'd sit?

741
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Is that like a sort of a bucking bronco pony kind of little?

742
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Yeah.

743
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Okay.

744
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Five hundred bucks, hundred dollars shipping.

745
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Where where's it shipping from?

746
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Oh, let me I got to look it up.

747
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
It's already sold.

748
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
It's already sold.

749
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Oh, this was from Wisconsin.

750
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Midwest.

751
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Yeah.

752
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I bet that officer Big Mac thing sells fast.

753
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I don't see any of them on here.

754
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I bet that one's that.

755
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Yeah, that's tough.

756
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Maybe we should do a this.

757
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
This could be a we could take a little time.

758
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
But if we eBay Barney and see what the most expensive item is.

759
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Oh, that's good.

760
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
We never plan these anymore, but we could do a little, you know.

761
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Oh, sure. Yeah.

762
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Yeah.

763
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Souvenir Smackdown as we go.

764
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I like when they just come up mid episode.

765
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Sure.

766
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Let's get it back to Barney.

767
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Yeah, I have to give universal credit.

768
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
It does seem like in nineteen ninety five money, like they spent a good

769
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,000
amount of money on this area and this show like Barney was huge at night in the mid

770
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:42,000
nineties like and I I watched the video.

771
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I watched the video of one of the last ones before it was put on ice for covid

772
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
scale backs like this show was running where peak.

773
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Boo comes out and goes like remember to social distance and keep your masks on.

774
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
And yeah, that was a lot.

775
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
That was a lot to handle.

776
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
But watching the pre show, I was like, well, this is a pretty nice theater.

777
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
They built like a goofy house.

778
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I was like, oh, this is a whole different room.

779
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:16,000
And then there was like a cloud sequence like the rain clouds were raining and

780
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
then the rain stopped and there were doors behind it.

781
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I was like, oh, this is actually pretty good.

782
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
And then the whole show is a theater in the round, which I think that's interesting.

783
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
You don't see that often in like theme park shows.

784
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
It's like Dane Cook at Madison Square Garden.

785
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
That's right.

786
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
That's like exactly the same vibe when Barney comes out with Baby Bob and BJ.

787
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,000
And if you look, if you look from at the Barney stage from above, it's got the big

788
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Sufi, it's got the big Sufi logo on it.

789
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
The super figure, the Sufi.

790
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Barney and Dane Cook, both a lot less in the public eye since 2009.

791
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
That's a good point.

792
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I am.

793
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Yeah, we should talk about what the what the show is.

794
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Yeah, there's a theater in the round that you build to, but you get there and it's a

795
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
little like outdoor.

796
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Here's where we gather everybody up in a little house and a waterfall looking thing,

797
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
like Jason said.

798
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:20,000
And you you're you're you're waiting and then you start seeing little doors open and

799
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
that is the appearance of peekaboo.

800
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
The character's name is peekaboo.

801
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Do either of you I didn't write it down.

802
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
What's the his full his or her full name?

803
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
They make it so that man or woman could do it.

804
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Yes.

805
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Patricia Aloysius Bartholomew or Patrick Aloysius Bartholomew.

806
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I see.

807
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Condensed to peekaboo, which is his name because it is his favorite game.

808
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Right.

809
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Yes.

810
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
And he is what a professor who knows Barney.

811
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Yeah, that's sort of the vibe of it.

812
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
A professor.

813
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
It's very similar to the Eminem.

814
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
It's not that similar to the Eminem professor, but it's the same.

815
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
It's a narrative functionally.

816
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Mm hmm.

817
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Mm hmm.

818
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Yeah, he's Barney's friend.

819
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
He's your hookup.

820
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Like, no, no, I totally know him.

821
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Just stick with me.

822
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I'll take you.

823
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I'll take you.

824
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,000
You've also got a is it an animatronic or is it a puppet?

825
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
And how do they time it to speak at the right time?

826
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Because there's a big parrot named Bartholomew.

827
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Oh, I couldn't tell.

828
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
What is it?

829
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Like, is it live operated?

830
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
But there's nobody behind it.

831
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I'm not sure what you're looking at.

832
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I think it's a puppet.

833
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Yeah, I think it's they might be able to cue just the lines like on a like we always just called them carts.

834
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Like the in the student radio station cause they still some old like equipment where like it was a big box.

835
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
You would like plug a cartridge in and it would play as soon as you hit the button.

836
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
There was no lag like on a cassette.

837
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:58,000
So I think stunt shows have some of those set up where like as soon as you hit the button, the sound plays.

838
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I feel like any character that's not the human, it's all recorded.

839
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
They're not doing any like the puppets and the costume.

840
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
People are not doing any crowd work.

841
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
They can't.

842
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
That's correct.

843
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Yeah.

844
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
And eventually, yeah, Barney, Baby Bop and DJ are are pre-recorded.

845
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Yes.

846
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
And doing clear.

847
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I was like, let me look up earlier choreography.

848
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Can I see a video of this from 1996 and then like recently mid pandemic and it is the same.

849
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:35,000
They all like go to the center and the I love you song and play like and it's the same little carts with inflatable animals.

850
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
This is like the exact same show.

851
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,000
They've been doing the greatest hits on tour forever here.

852
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
No new albums.

853
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:53,000
And I have to say the like 2020 audience, while a little small, the kids were into it.

854
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
They were digging this show.

855
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
They were clapping along, playing along.

856
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Like I, I, I do think this is good for kids.

857
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Like repetition, kids like simple songs, like, you know, I get the appeal.

858
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:16,000
And when you design a theme park, I think it's left out of the discussion a lot of like, well, you need to appeal to ages two to eight.

859
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:22,000
If you're going to be a family theme park, you have to distract very, very little kids.

860
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
You have to entertain them a little.

861
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Sure.

862
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I mean, my only plus up for this would be like a turtle talk situation with Barney where he could actually respond to the kids.

863
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
That would be all I would, I would want from it.

864
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
He can, they can do the same songs.

865
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Yeah.

866
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
They can do, they can do kookaburra sits in the old oak tree.

867
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
They can do that classic.

868
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,000
But I just want, I want Barney to do a little crowd work like Dane would maybe.

869
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,000
But just a little, you know, be able to react live to some, some change in the audience.

870
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
He doesn't have to go Rickles.

871
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,000
He doesn't have to, you know, let's put our purses in the circle.

872
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Let's put our purses and dance around.

873
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I just want to dance.

874
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Oh, are you a German guy?

875
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Oh, a Nazi?

876
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Not Rick, not Rickles Barney, but like a little, a little loose, a little loose crowd work.

877
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
This guy looks like he's got an itchy asshole.

878
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Yeah.

879
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Yeah.

880
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
For going Dane.

881
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
If you're going Dane.

882
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Yeah.

883
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
It's hard to say.

884
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Let's go hit up the BK Lounge.

885
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I, yeah, I mean, it's, it's cute.

886
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
It's well done.

887
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
It's like the lighting cues are nice.

888
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
It seems like a good high tech theater.

889
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
That water effect is good.

890
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Yeah.

891
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I mean, it's hard to like, you know, you can hate on Barney, but I don't, I don't hate on this show.

892
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:55,000
This seems like just well done and entertaining if sort of oddly perhaps irrelevant.

893
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
I mean, maybe a three year old doesn't care.

894
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
They'll like look at whatever.

895
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:08,000
But when you're dealing with like the micro generations that like, you know, when you're dealing with preschool age, I feel like this show hasn't been on since 2009.

896
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:14,000
That's like three generations at least who don't really, I bet don't really know Barney.

897
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Yeah.

898
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I would unless, yeah, I guess that they're showing reruns and I guess it probably is all up to the parents.

899
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:25,000
If the parents have some affection for it, then they'll show their child Barney the reruns or whatever.

900
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I don't know if you can stream Barney.

901
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I don't know if there's a Kimberly Clark diaper streaming service that exists.

902
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
There might, it might exist.

903
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I think if you are a theme park is probably the best place because like you could introduce like a two or three year old to Barney, the pre show, the show.

904
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
And then there's a gift shop where you can get the dolls at the end.

905
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
And like that's an entirely self-contained bubble.

906
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
So you could get a kid to know nothing about Barney.

907
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,000
And within the span of an hour, they could be like, all right, I'm all in on Barney.

908
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
This is my new favorite thing.

909
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Right.

910
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Oh yeah.

911
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Little stations that teach them.

912
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Yeah.

913
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
It's just my only credit as an adult.

914
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,000
My only criticism of the show is it's not, it's fine that it's for kids.

915
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I don't need, I don't need body humor, of course, but like versus the peanuts show at nots, the peanuts shows at nots, which are certainly not sophisticated oftentimes, but they do a little, you get a little something.

916
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:32,000
You get your thriller parody, which spooky nights, you know, you go, you get a little, there's a little something for the parents.

917
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
There's a little like interest.

918
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Like this feels like, you know, put a costume on Barney once in a while.

919
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Let's change up a song.

920
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Let's do a parody song.

921
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Like, you know, like Chuck E.

922
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Cheese does.

923
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Like, let's do a little, let's play with the Barney IP a little bit.

924
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
He can get loose.

925
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Barney can get loose.

926
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
But that doesn't have to be so uptight.

927
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
That's by design though, isn't it?

928
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Like Barney made just for the kids, like Sesame Street and other things like that.

929
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Kids for the kids and for the parents get a little too.

930
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Well, sure.

931
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I just think I think it's more of a, I think it's more of the whoever's controlling Barney as a very specific idea.

932
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Yeah.

933
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Barney is.

934
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:19,000
And then also it costs money to do any changes and they would prefer to just keep this thing the same for 25 years because who gives a shit?

935
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
It's for little, little kids.

936
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I came across this, that this show was written by Jason Sorrell, who wrote the the haunted house.

937
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:36,000
He wrote the the Haunted Mansion of Pirates of the Caribbean books, longtime Universal and Disney creative person.

938
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Wow.

939
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
And his first run at Universal.

940
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Every year I found this on like a wiki and then I looked on, I found his LinkedIn page and he does listed under his credits from his first few years at Universal.

941
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Wow.

942
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Oh, that's cool.

943
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Yeah.

944
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
I like that.

945
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,000
You know, you know what you got to give him credit for and kids must love this.

946
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:08,000
This is like a good like magic trick illusion and maybe the first that they get to see is the transformation of little doll Barney into big Barney.

947
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Yes.

948
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
That's got to be huge when you're a kid.

949
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:17,000
They do live the thing that they did in very poor special effects on a VHS in 1989.

950
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Yeah, it's the the I am a big fan of the doll Barney.

951
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
From the second version of the series, that's like very round.

952
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Yeah.

953
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I won't call him like a dump truck doll.

954
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I won't say something like that that Jason would say, but I his you know what I'm talking about how he is very rounded, very pleasingly round.

955
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
He's pleasingly round.

956
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I mean, that's right.

957
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I'm not going to deny that's right.

958
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
But it's sexualization of Barney.

959
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
No, it's just you know, just you love a perfect sphere.

960
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:56,000
You guys like those ice cube spheres, you know, we do like that.

961
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Yes.

962
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
You see this?

963
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

964
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Yeah.

965
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Cute toy.

966
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Definitely a cute toy.

967
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Yes.

968
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
But but the dolls were not like the dolls were actually not as pleasing.

969
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
No, no, but the perfect camera ready one.

970
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Yeah.

971
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
More so.

972
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:20,000
I also one thing I think my feelings about Barney as a kid were mixed, but I can certainly say I did not like baby bop.

973
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Baby bop really.

974
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Yeah, baby bop is is yeah, there's not a lot.

975
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
The baby unfortunately has kind of a grating voice.

976
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Yeah.

977
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Yeah.

978
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
It's like really crazy.

979
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:39,000
I can't do it, but yeah, me like and then BJ.

980
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,000
I have not as upset about, but I feel that BJ is a real poochy.

981
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Like, oh yeah, it is like cool in a generic way, but otherwise does not really bring a new dynamic to the table, does not influence the dyad.

982
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:08,000
If you will, if you're going to introduce a third character, they should really bring more to the table than just being like also a dinosaur, but who like is on a scooter sometimes.

983
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Yeah, he's I mean, he's got the cool gym shoes and base in like sideways baseball hat.

984
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
And then he's baby bops older brother.

985
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Okay.

986
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Was this their attempts to reach out to you or me, Mike?

987
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:30,000
I think because did they sense that there are a lot of older brothers who we need to pull into the fold.

988
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I think you might be onto something because I do think when they introduced BJ, I, it certainly piqued my interest.

989
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:44,000
I was certainly like, well, who is this new cool dinosaur?

990
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Now I, they didn't stick the landing because I wasn't like all in on BJ, but I certainly was like, who wouldn't mind getting to one of these BJ dolls?

991
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:00,000
I didn't, I didn't have one, but I'm just saying I think, I think that was probably part of it.

992
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Barney was a very paternal figure.

993
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
He was, he was in charge.

994
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
So baby bop was a character the kids could relate to.

995
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
But then they figured, okay, well, they have to have a girl character and a boy character.

996
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:18,000
And they definitely like BJ is like Bart, their version of Bart Simpson.

997
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Yeah, BJ shooting cans.

998
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Shooting cans with a BB gun in the backyard, setting off sparklers and fireworks.

999
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Did they think they would trick us by having a he's yellow and has spiky hair?

1000
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
They kind of tricked me though.

1001
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
They tricked me for a little bit.

1002
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
So it's kind of worked.

1003
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:44,000
I just think they needed to make him a little bit more engaged, like his personality better.

1004
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I was too into cable at that point, cable from the X-Men.

1005
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:55,000
So they've, they had given BJ a giant gun and a lot of pouches, maybe, but the yellow, yellow wasn't enough for me.

1006
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:04,000
If somebody could, and look, I, if we call for fan art, if someone could in the audience draw a Rob Liefeld BJ.

1007
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
I would lose my mind.

1008
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
I just, God.

1009
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Scott, Scott, I got to tell you.

1010
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:14,000
So, so Rob Liefeld, Scott in the nineties would draw these like crazy.

1011
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
You've probably seen the pictures of it.

1012
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Crazy muscle men characters that like doesn't make sense proportionally.

1013
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
And I'll show you this real quick.

1014
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:28,000
He is the co-creator of Deadpool amongst other like extreme like this Captain America.

1015
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
This is Captain America image comes up a lot.

1016
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Oh, I recognize the incredibly detailed, incredibly detailed anatomically all over the map.

1017
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:42,000
But like now has kind of come back around to being like outsider art.

1018
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Like it's just so garish.

1019
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Somebody also made, somebody also made this.

1020
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Yeah, like this is what he would look like shirtless.

1021
00:51:52,000 --> 00:52:00,000
And somebody's done what real life Chris Evans playing Captain America would look like with the proportions of.

1022
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Right.

1023
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Like this is what he would look like.

1024
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
A mammoth rib cage.

1025
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,000
These characters all have dump truck packs.

1026
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Exactly.

1027
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Yes. Yes.

1028
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
So round.

1029
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
So if somebody could draw like a jacked up BJ.

1030
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Beats Rob Liefeld BJ.

1031
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Yeah.

1032
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
That would be great.

1033
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:34,000
But we also know I don't think I was we were maybe way off of the show by the time they introduced who I guess is BJ and baby bops cousin Riff.

1034
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Yes.

1035
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
You guys know about Riff.

1036
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I know about Riff.

1037
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
I hate Riff.

1038
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Orange.

1039
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
I really hate.

1040
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Now this is interesting because now he reminds me I think Riff is kind of in the family of an Aladar.

1041
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Well.

1042
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
I think he bothers me the same way Aladar bothers me.

1043
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
I thought I can't get on board with that.

1044
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
I can't caught into that.

1045
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
No.

1046
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
So Mike you don't like Riff.

1047
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,000
I don't know a lot of I'll be honest I don't know a lot about Riff.

1048
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I don't love the look.

1049
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,000
He's kind of he's got kind of like he's like half asleep.

1050
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Yeah those eyelids are very unsettling.

1051
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:21,000
I'm not against him but I don't think I think of the four designs he's the least interesting design purely from an aesthetic point of view.

1052
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
The other three are I think pretty well designed.

1053
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Riff I don't know what's going on with him.

1054
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
He's got like no he's got like like.

1055
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Come on Riff.

1056
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Kicking.

1057
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
I don't like I don't like Riff at all.

1058
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
I like it when he's kicking more.

1059
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Maybe Riff might be the funniest character now that I'm looking at but I'm not sure.

1060
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
I'm kind of warming up to Riff.

1061
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Riff is clearly the gazoo of the great gazoo of this show.

1062
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I mean I'm looking at a clip on YouTube now I've not watched it.

1063
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Learn to dance with Riff and maybe we'll use this clip to determine if we like Riff once and for all.

1064
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Sure.

1065
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
I don't know Riff's voice at all so we'd all be experiencing this together.

1066
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Let's experience Riff for the first time and really give Riff a fair shot.

1067
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
All right.

1068
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
No judgment Riff.

1069
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
No.

1070
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Okay Riff.

1071
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Bring me over.

1072
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
This is your American Idol audition.

1073
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Okay.

1074
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Let's see what you got.

1075
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,000
And you'll be happy to know he's got a little ukulele so that's also another strike in his favor.

1076
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
All right so here we go.

1077
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Just can't get enough.

1078
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Just can't get enough.

1079
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Wait a minute.

1080
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Just can't get enough.

1081
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Yeah.

1082
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Just can't get enough.

1083
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
So we're watching okay so right now we're watching some sort of music video.

1084
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:38,000
He's not Riff is not speaking but he's dancing a lot to Just Can't Get Enough.

1085
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Is that Riff's voice?

1086
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
That sounds like Barney to me.

1087
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
All right I gotta find Riff talking here.

1088
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Barney on YouTube has 1.4 million subscribers so.

1089
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Guess it is working.

1090
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Yeah it might still be.

1091
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Popular.

1092
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I'm Riff is the name of this video.

1093
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Yeah and there's pictures of him with like he's fishing now and I kind of like that.

1094
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
No I'm out on Riff.

1095
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
No.

1096
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Oh Scott he's playing the sax.

1097
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
He's playing the sax Scott.

1098
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Unmute.

1099
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Unmute.

1100
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Okay hold on hold on.

1101
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
You're right you're right you're right.

1102
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
That's sax though.

1103
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Okay so here we go.

1104
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
This is I'm Riff.

1105
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Hi I'm Riff.

1106
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Oh Scott you like this music.

1107
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Oh Scott.

1108
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I like the kind of music I like yes.

1109
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Hi I'm Riff.

1110
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Let's go have some fun with Barney.

1111
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
No.

1112
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Okay Riff has.

1113
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
No raspy voice no.

1114
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Riff has a lot of vocal fry going on.

1115
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Yeah not into it.

1116
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Riff also smokes.

1117
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Like Riff smokes parliament longs.

1118
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Riff is a poor man's Tommy Pickles from Rugrats.

1119
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Alright one more clip here to see if we can save Riff's reputation with Scott.

1120
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Hi to hell you everyone.

1121
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,000
No Heidi Ho get out of here.

1122
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,000
He's playing the sax Scott.

1123
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Only one character left to say Heidi Ho and that's Mitch.

1124
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
What are you guys up to?

1125
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
We just planted these yellow flowers.

1126
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Cool-a-rama.

1127
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Oh they look great.

1128
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Cool-a-rama.

1129
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Thanks.

1130
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
It was a project for our scouting club.

1131
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
No no.

1132
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Out on Riff.

1133
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
It's a scouting club.

1134
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
A club is a group of friends who plan things.

1135
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
What the fuck is Barney's voice?

1136
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Alright so this is another thing we haven't gotten to.

1137
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
They changed Barney's voice and it's really weird.

1138
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Like it's much different.

1139
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
It's like ill.

1140
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Yeah he sounds weird in the last so many.

1141
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
So points for the Universal show.

1142
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,000
It's the original voice Bob West of Barney.

1143
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:50,000
And he also was the voice of Pasquale and Jasper of Chuck E Cheese.

1144
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Wow.

1145
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Oh my god.

1146
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Did not realize that.

1147
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
That's great.

1148
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
That really.

1149
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
I mean that's three icons right there.

1150
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
What a great VO guy.

1151
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Yeah.

1152
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Yeah.

1153
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Who like worked at the company.

1154
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I think in all these cases or he got his start at Chuck E Cheese.

1155
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:13,000
He like wrote the shows or was part of the creative and then did voices and that.

1156
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:20,000
He was like the king of Texas children's entertainment because Chuck E Cheese and Barney all came from the.

1157
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Was Dallas or I don't know.

1158
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
I mean somewhere in Texas.

1159
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Yeah.

1160
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Another person with a connection to the Barney show at Universal.

1161
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:36,000
There was a woman named Lauren Mayhew who's worked in the parks a lot.

1162
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:46,000
She went from playing baby bop in the show in the park to then getting word that they needed a new baby bop like costume performer on the TV show.

1163
00:57:46,000 --> 00:58:02,000
So then auditioned and then got the part and took over the role like wow for the TV show and then eventually also went on to do the world like audition for the like one of the national or international tours they did too.

1164
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
So she played baby bop and then I believe he had a little bit of a career in the show.

1165
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Baby bop and then I believe after the show ended went back to Universal and has worked in the park and done the character again.

1166
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Wow.

1167
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Oh geez.

1168
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Wow.

1169
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
It led to a job.

1170
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Yeah.

1171
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Wow.

1172
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
A different job.

1173
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Yeah.

1174
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:28,000
It's kind of in the same neck of the woods job but I thought that was cool and there's interviews with her out there about she's worked a lot of jobs in the parks.

1175
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Does anyone know anything about the guy who was in the Barney suit on the show.

1176
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I've heard.

1177
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Yeah.

1178
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
You go ahead.

1179
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
I think I know you're I know what you're talking about here.

1180
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Well if you were if you're pre if your preschool age stop listening to the episode because the guy's name is David Joyner and he was always Barney and all live shows and on the movie and all the all the things.

1181
00:58:54,000 --> 00:59:23,000
And today he is known as a tantric massage therapist and the well he you know he explains how his the being in the suit in you know that's a very physical act and he considers that like having to be in this costume all day that got up to 120 degrees and was so you know physically taxing he calls that tantra.

1182
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Like tantra isn't necessarily a sex thing it's just being able to like have the stamina to do something forever and he says how the energy I brought while in the costume is based on the foundation of tantra which is love everything stems grows and evolves from love love heals and allows you to grow.

1183
00:59:39,000 --> 01:00:07,000
So he's you know he's this very spiritual person as I said tantra isn't necessarily a sex thing in this case it certainly is because his practice is sex you could get you go to tantra harmony dot com and you know tell him your issues and he will have sex with you and part of it is that in order for all the spirits to get through and for it to be more as blissful as possible it has to be unprotected.

1184
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:13,000
So no condoms involved if you're going to have sex with the guy who played Barney.

1185
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Yes.

1186
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Sandy Duncan would not approve of this.

1187
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:24,000
They're kind of at opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of people involved in the franchise.

1188
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:31,000
She might Sandy Duncan would have maybe problems with phraseology like here's a quote from him.

1189
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:37,000
When you go down on a woman it should be just like you're saying grace like blessing the food you're about to receive.

1190
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
No food in the world.

1191
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Oh wait I should do it as no food in the world.

1192
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:48,000
When you go down on a woman it should be like you're saying grace like you're blessing the food you're about to receive.

1193
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:59,000
No food in the world can compare to goddess nectar because spirit is involved before you taste the goddess nectar give thanks.

1194
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
My kids win.

1195
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:14,000
This metaphor doesn't track for me because I always found grace to be very like perfunctory and fast and that doesn't that doesn't.

1196
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Oh you're right.

1197
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Yeah right.

1198
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
A thousand percent.

1199
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Yes.

1200
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:27,000
If that's what you're doing if you're if you're going down on someone with the speed of grace like I know my family is great.

1201
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
And then the father son.

1202
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Bless his food.

1203
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Yeah.

1204
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Food.

1205
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,000
That's a nice is not satisfying to your god.

1206
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Yeah I feel like that's a way to build resentment not connection if that's your approach to the act.

1207
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
All right.

1208
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
The name of the father.

1209
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
All right here we go.

1210
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Look click click.

1211
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Okay.

1212
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
All right.

1213
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Very good.

1214
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,000
I don't think this I don't think this performer knows how to treat his goddess.

1215
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
That's my.

1216
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:59,000
This thing is pretty uniform across David joiners discussions.

1217
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:04,000
There's a lot of reviews of his services which are glowing.

1218
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
People are pretty excited about all this.

1219
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Is he any help.

1220
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:12,000
I'm not sure if it's yelp but he I mean so he controls the reviews.

1221
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
I see all people.

1222
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
I mean it sounds like people had a wonderful time.

1223
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:22,000
There is a vice article about all this and there's people who seem kind of well there's people who just straight up say.

1224
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
This is prostitution.

1225
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
What he is doing.

1226
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Yeah.

1227
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Money is being exchanged and you have unprotected sex.

1228
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Then this is sort of a shady thing.

1229
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
I don't I don't want it.

1230
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
I don't know either way.

1231
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:40,000
I don't want to cast judgment condoms block the energy is a pretty iffy phrase.

1232
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Condoms block the energy.

1233
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Condoms block the energy.

1234
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Oh my god.

1235
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
I do.

1236
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Everyone does sign a consent form though.

1237
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
So that's good.

1238
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Oh my god.

1239
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Everything's on the open up.

1240
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
That is really that is really dark.

1241
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
It's pretty crazy.

1242
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,000
He also apparently was like pretty vocal about all this.

1243
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
He was not running this practice while doing the Barney show.

1244
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:12,000
But I think if you met this man and talked to him he would start talking about tantric stuff.

1245
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,000
So they didn't they let him do the show.

1246
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:23,000
But attorneys said that he was not allowed to teach practice or talk about tantra while under contract playing the character because that is a lawsuit waiting to happen.

1247
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Oh yeah.

1248
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Yeah.

1249
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Hmm.

1250
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
So he had to bid this bid this to do.

1251
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:34,000
It was not like Sting where he could make it part of his persona while still doing his art.

1252
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Right.

1253
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Well he didn't bid it a do.

1254
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
He just kind of edged.

1255
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:44,000
He just kind of built up over years and then the tantric energy.

1256
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
He stored up the tantric.

1257
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Stored up the tantric.

1258
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
I'm sorry.

1259
01:03:49,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Too much of my tantric energy being blown off card because the 1994 Northridge earthquake.

1260
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:07,000
That was just Barney shooting.

1261
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:12,000
An extinction event.

1262
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Oh man.

1263
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:26,000
I am I also I'm pretty sure that I was once around this man because you know I like doing things at hotel bars as we all do.

1264
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
And there's a really good one.

1265
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,000
There's a good like bar at the top of a hotel in Glendale.

1266
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Yes.

1267
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:37,000
And we had a birthday party there with the with the thinking that like oh because it'll kind of just be us.

1268
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:42,000
There won't be like some other massive group of 200 people who are competing for space with.

1269
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,000
And one time for Aaron's birthday we went up to this place and it was packed.

1270
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
It was 200 people and we didn't know what it was all about.

1271
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
It was like the most raucous incredible birthday party we'd ever seen.

1272
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:57,000
And I think it may have been if it wasn't I think it was a woman who the party was for.

1273
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,000
But I remember we sort of intermingled and somebody was like see that guy over there.

1274
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:05,000
He was in the Barney suit and people were he was like holding court.

1275
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,000
People loved this guy.

1276
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Everybody's talking to him.

1277
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
He's king of the party pointing at everyone.

1278
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Wow.

1279
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,000
So I guess the guy's popular.

1280
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:21,000
I'm not sure if he was popular with these people because of his work.

1281
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
That's hard to say.

1282
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:29,000
But well we know there's another rooftop bar that's local that has a swingers night once a month.

1283
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Yes.

1284
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
That's right.

1285
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:36,000
So it's only parties of 12 nerds and raucous.

1286
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Yeah.

1287
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Sexually liberated groups.

1288
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
There'll be times in massive numbers.

1289
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Times when we've tried to go.

1290
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
We are definitely not.

1291
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Time to go to the bar and it's like no no no this is swingers night.

1292
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
You have to be a swinger to go up there.

1293
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
That's right.

1294
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
That's happened several times.

1295
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Oh yeah.

1296
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Yeah.

1297
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Oh man.

1298
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,000
That's what happens at the rooftop bars.

1299
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:03,000
So if you're interested in a session with David Joyner go to Tantra Harmony.

1300
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
It's not an official ad obviously.

1301
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
No he didn't pay us.

1302
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
This is just what Scott is doing.

1303
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
This is out of the kindness of his heart.

1304
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Yeah.

1305
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Yeah.

1306
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Just just to spread the word.

1307
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
What do we miss?

1308
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Barney.

1309
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Barneyville station.

1310
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Barneyville station.

1311
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,000
The play area.

1312
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
I did miss this.

1313
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,000
All right.

1314
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Let's let's yes.

1315
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Mike has pulled out the Barney's backyard page on the Universal website.

1316
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Now let's get away from all that salacious material and let's start with the train which

1317
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:32,000
I'm squinting and says BJ's Express.

1318
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
All right.

1319
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
OK.

1320
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Great.

1321
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:44,000
A Barney as a yeah Barney as a train station and a train of some kind here.

1322
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:49,000
I'm not sure if that's in actual like Canon on the newer show.

1323
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
I don't know.

1324
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Go to go down to the copy a little bit.

1325
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Hmm.

1326
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Hop on BJ's pop on BJ's Express train and plan a pretend to get away.

1327
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Hmm.

1328
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Oh.

1329
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
It's not like.

1330
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Oh yes.

1331
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:08,000
But then on this plan getaway there's an actual murder.

1332
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,000
No one is leaving BJ's Express train until we crack this case.

1333
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
No need.

1334
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
It was riff.

1335
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Oh I know it was riff.

1336
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,000
I've had a bad feeling about riff since day one.

1337
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
I like riff now.

1338
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
No riffs a murderer.

1339
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Even if riff murdered someone on this train I'm liking him.

1340
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
That might improve my opinion.

1341
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
I suppose.

1342
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Riff was a murderer.

1343
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Riff is a saxophone playing dinosaur train murderer.

1344
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Riff is male.

1345
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Yes.

1346
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
I think so.

1347
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
I think so.

1348
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,000
That voice is like a French.

1349
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
See she.

1350
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Riff sounds like an Orange County divorcee.

1351
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Riff is like a rock and roller.

1352
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Like riff can play instruments.

1353
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Yeah I'm looking up Riff's personality is all about music.

1354
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
He hears music everywhere he goes.

1355
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Which ties directly into his theme song.

1356
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
I hear music everywhere.

1357
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
The music.

1358
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
I guess we got to do this cute poll for riff.

1359
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
The music tells me to do things.

1360
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:17,000
I think it's important that people see riff playing the sax though.

1361
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:22,000
To be, to give a full determination of if riff is cute.

1362
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,000
That's the most likable riff that I saw yes.

1363
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,000
But I can't give him points just because of sax.

1364
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Just because riff is associated with easy listening music.

1365
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
It's typically a way into my heart.

1366
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:37,000
I'm going to find riff playing more easy listening music to convince you.

1367
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:43,000
I mean this makes me want to like take riff and take riff footage.

1368
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,000
And put some of the stuff I like under it.

1369
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Your David Sanborn or your Tom Scott.

1370
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,000
If you have an hour during this week that might happen.

1371
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Yeah sure.

1372
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
I'll give it a go.

1373
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Well what have we missed?

1374
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:10,000
I do have some Barney eBay results if we want to do a little.

1375
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
I have some yes.

1376
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
We might have found the same thing.

1377
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Maybe we're looking at the same.

1378
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Are you doing like by highest price?

1379
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
That's usually how I do it.

1380
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
So we're probably in the same zone.

1381
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
I didn't look too hard.

1382
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
So if you have anything good I'll keep it blind.

1383
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
No I don't have anything particularly good.

1384
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Well we don't have to do it.

1385
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
If nothing's that good.

1386
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Well I will say nothing is that good with Barney.

1387
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:35,000
But I do think I found the mother lode when it comes to McDonald's.

1388
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Geez.

1389
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
A full play land.

1390
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
20 train.

1391
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Twenty one thousand dollars.

1392
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Twenty one thousand.

1393
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
It's everything.

1394
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
It's the little it's the little boppers.

1395
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000
The filet of fish.

1396
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Yep.

1397
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
A little Bench tree sitting next to grimace.

1398
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
This is the ultimate.

1399
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Geez.

1400
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:57,000
So twenty one thousand is how much they're asking for it.

1401
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
I don't know.

1402
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,000
It doesn't say where they're located though.

1403
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,000
You know.

1404
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
You know.

1405
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Free local pick up.

1406
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Should I make an offer.

1407
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Should I make offer like a hundred.

1408
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
They're not going to get twenty one thousand.

1409
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
What do you think they're aiming for.

1410
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Fourteen fifteen grand.

1411
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Yeah probably.

1412
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,000
I bet they would take fourteen thousand.

1413
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Yeah.

1414
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
I don't have a home.

1415
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Go ahead and pay.

1416
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Go ahead and offer.

1417
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,000
All right.

1418
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,000
All right.

1419
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Here I go.

1420
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Fourteen thousand dollars.

1421
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
He did it.

1422
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
He's typing it in.

1423
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:32,000
I don't have a house with a yard or a house in general.

1424
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Yeah.

1425
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:37,000
But I do want to buy fourteen thousand dollars worth of McDonald Playland equipment.

1426
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Of course.

1427
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,000
I know we all do.

1428
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
That bench with Ronald.

1429
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,000
It's the bench where Ronald's sitting in the middle.

1430
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Can you imagine like like putting that in a whole house like I guess I could I guess

1431
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
there would be no problem with it.

1432
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,000
People would actually be the envy of the neighborhood.

1433
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Yeah.

1434
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
I guess some of the neighborhood.

1435
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
All right.

1436
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Fine.

1437
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
So people put up fun Halloween decorations giant things.

1438
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Now I think people are slowly more comfortable with.

1439
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Yeah.

1440
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
You could do a front yard display of McDonald's.

1441
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Yeah.

1442
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Absolutely.

1443
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:19,000
If you could get the bench with Ronald on it flanked by the two by like two Home Depot

1444
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:23,000
12 foot skeletons like that would be just so great.

1445
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Mm hmm.

1446
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Well there's something to shoot for.

1447
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Maybe the Patreon will go up and give us each an extra twenty one thousand dollars next

1448
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,000
month.

1449
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
And well we could you could.

1450
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Well you can come.

1451
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,000
How about you could come be in the Playland if we buy this.

1452
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
That's a good idea.

1453
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Yeah.

1454
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Yeah.

1455
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,000
And then we'll sell tickets to it like Homer.

1456
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Yes.

1457
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Well that's our theme park.

1458
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Right.

1459
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,000
That's where this has to go is that we actually build good boy land.

1460
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Well sure.

1461
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,000
And with Ambassador Sandy Duncan.

1462
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
No never.

1463
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Statue of Sandy Duncan.

1464
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Not allowed in good boy land.

1465
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,000
But I and I will be performing down on Grandpa's farm.

1466
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Imagine a place.

1467
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:09,000
All the songs from Day in the Park with Barney.

1468
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
I like down on Grandpa's farm.

1469
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
I like down on Grandpa's farm too.

1470
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
I had to say.

1471
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Barney song.

1472
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
I thought all the songs were solid in this.

1473
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Imagine a place I liked.

1474
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:28,000
I really liked in that one song when they all they had their laughing simultaneously down pat like for sinking the mouth movements all together.

1475
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
I thought that was pretty impressive.

1476
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Technically the people in the costumes doing a good job.

1477
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,000
I like when they push the carts around with the inflatable barnyard animals.

1478
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Oh yeah.

1479
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Skunk.

1480
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
And that's fun.

1481
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Yeah.

1482
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
I had to know another note though.

1483
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
You know where's Riff?

1484
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,000
No.

1485
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Where is he?

1486
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
It shouldn't be in this.

1487
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Everyone's going to pretend.

1488
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:58,000
A bunch of people on Twitter are going to pretend to like Riff.

1489
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,000
An unknown Barney character for good reason.

1490
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,000
As soon as they see a GIF.

1491
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Because I said I did not like it.

1492
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:07,000
As soon as they see a GIF of him playing saxophone they're going to fall in love.

1493
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Seems inevitable right?

1494
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Yes.

1495
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,000
We love Riff now.

1496
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:18,000
I wasn't pro you know you can't judge a book by its cover because I was anti Riff initially.

1497
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,000
But the saxophone put it over the edge.

1498
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,000
So yeah.

1499
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
I guess.

1500
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
All right.

1501
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Only with a saxophone and only if Riff doesn't talk.

1502
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,000
I don't want to hear that horrible voice.

1503
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:35,000
So if you block that with a saxophone then fine.

1504
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:39,000
I mean we'll put it we'll put Riff against that baby Aladar and see.

1505
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Even like what if people like one or more than the other.

1506
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:48,000
So I mean I think people with saxophone will really like Riff.

1507
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
The only time I've been way wrong is Mr. Six.

1508
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:54,000
People love friggin Mr. Six.

1509
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Yeah that ratio was yeah higher than you might expect.

1510
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Yes I thought Mr. Six was more divisive but people love a dancing old man.

1511
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Yeah.

1512
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Six Flags should have looked at that data and brought him back immediately.

1513
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Well they fucked up big time and it's you know I'm just glad that the people responsible for firing Mr. Six only went on to do many many more extremely lucrative jobs.

1514
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
That's the way.

1515
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Wait I have one more thing.

1516
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,000
I saw YouTube comment and I found no proof of this but in speaking you know.

1517
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Oh I know exactly where you're going to continue.

1518
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Yeah okay okay.

1519
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Yeah yeah yeah.

1520
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000
I found it.

1521
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:42,000
This is from Lord Vader 0727 who has a little Ewan McGregor avatar.

1522
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Me and my friends were at Universal the other day and during the show Barney started whipping and nae naeing and it was hilarious.

1523
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Yes I saw this a few months ago right.

1524
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Yes when did this happen.

1525
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
How can we find footage.

1526
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Yeah I was looking for it too.

1527
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:04,000
I also saw that comment and it's the Beetlejuice show at least that happened when that was popular.

1528
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Yeah.

1529
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Yeah.

1530
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Yeah why whipping and nae naeing today.

1531
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Yeah.

1532
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Well I mean I don't I would be thrilled if it said Barney did the Gangnam Style dance.

1533
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Oh could you imagine.

1534
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
But this is what I was talking about before.

1535
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,000
I want that in this show.

1536
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Yeah.

1537
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,000
So I want him to floss.

1538
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
I want him to throw up a dab.

1539
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:29,000
I want him to do all of that and the crowd's going to go wild for it.

1540
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:34,000
And then I want Riff to do the dab and I want Riff to floss.

1541
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,000
I guess that would also make me.

1542
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Imagine Riff flossing.

1543
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Everyone.

1544
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Okay everyone calm down right now who's listening and close your eyes and imagine.

1545
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
I want you to do this thought exercise.

1546
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Imagine Riff imagine he sets down his saxophone and then Riff starts flossing.

1547
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
How can you be mad at that.

1548
01:15:52,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Oh and a theater in the round where he has to rotate to make sure every section of the audience gets to see him head on flossing the beautiful park set.

1549
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,000
I like the set.

1550
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,000
I like the set in the theater.

1551
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
I think it's good.

1552
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
I think they did a good job on the sets on these.

1553
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
But yeah Riff.

1554
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Riff.

1555
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Riff.

1556
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Riff.

1557
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Is there Riff.

1558
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Is there a Riff too.

1559
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,000
No Riff flossing would be great.

1560
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Yeah.

1561
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Riff flossing is a blessing.

1562
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:27,000
No food in the world can compare to Riff flossing because spirit is involved.

1563
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
So give thanks.

1564
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:34,000
You survived I guess the ride.

1565
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:38,000
By second gate with a bunch of Barney stuff.

1566
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:43,000
And yeah I don't know.

1567
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Do we all sing I love you you love me.

1568
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,000
We could say just remember I love you.

1569
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Just remember.

1570
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Just remember.

1571
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
The hosts love you.

1572
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,000
I don't know.

1573
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Just remember I love you.

1574
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
You know what I mean.

1575
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
And I love you.

1576
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
