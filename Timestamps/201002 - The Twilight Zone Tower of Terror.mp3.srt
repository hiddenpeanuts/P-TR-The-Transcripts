1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Warning.

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,920
Today's podcast episode is somewhat unique and calls for a different kind of introduction.

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:16,440
This, as you may recognize, is the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror, opened in 1994 at Disney

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,200
MGM Studios.

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,160
Still in operation, waiting for you.

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,000
We invite you, if you dare, to learn how each host was scared of the ride during childhood,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,280
and in some cases, adulthood.

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:35,000
And discover how 21 kinds of tobacco make for 20 wonderful Chesterfield smokes.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:55,040
Today on the return of Hauntcast the Fright.

12
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,680
Welcome to Hauntcast the Frights, the Scream Park podcast hosted by three headless men

13
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,480
and their ghoulies.

14
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,020
I'm Scott Gravedigger, joined by...

15
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,200
Take it.

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,520
My name is I kill girl stone.

17
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,240
Girl, like girl, not girls, not girl stone, like grrrr stone.

18
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,240
Sorry, sorry.

19
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,240
You kill girls specifically.

20
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,080
You kill girls specifically.

21
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,000
I just said girl instead of grr.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,760
That really screwed everyone up.

23
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,840
I'm so sorry.

24
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,840
That was confusing.

25
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,920
Anyway.

26
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,680
He almost got away with it until his confession was laid bare in a funny Halloween name.

27
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,960
Then 25 girls have been recovered.

28
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,080
All the listeners of his podcast suspected, but they never knew for sure until that fateful

29
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:51,120
Tower of Terror episode.

30
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,600
People suppressed so much until in one episode it all came out.

31
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,000
But hey, let's also bring in...

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Jack-o-lantern slime-a-din.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,960
Oh, great.

34
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,720
I'm glad we refreshed the spooky name banks.

35
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,760
It's a pleasure to talk to you both, I kill and Jack-o-lantern.

36
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,000
And it's a pleasure to be here in Hauntcast the Fright once more.

37
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,080
I'm excited.

38
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,040
Due to various other things like our tour last year, our mini tour, there were other

39
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,040
things going on in October.

40
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,000
We didn't get to do the full month, but we've got it cleared out.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,120
This is an October full of frights and delights.

42
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,120
Yes.

43
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,120
The first...

44
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,960
Well, technically we did miss one Friday, but it's going to be plenty of Fridays.

45
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,960
Five Fridays.

46
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,960
Five Fridays in October this year.

47
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,960
Yeah.

48
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,960
Four.

49
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,960
You don't want to do too many frights.

50
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,960
Oh, yeah.

51
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,960
People get rattled.

52
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,160
Five main feed frights.

53
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,080
Too many.

54
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,880
Just seeing the scary logo that we have and hearing the scarier music and hearing our

55
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:02,360
scarier names is putting all the listeners at severe risk of shrieks and diarrhea.

56
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,880
If we did it five times all month, it would just be too sustained and you couldn't eat.

57
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:13,760
How often during Hauntcast the Fright do the listeners have just horrible diarrhea?

58
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,400
I don't know.

59
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:21,240
I mean, at least when a new one pops up in their feed or when they see a tweet.

60
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:27,280
You get into the meat of the episode and maybe you're only diarrhea-ing seven times or so,

61
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,240
but you know there's a lot loaded up at the beginning.

62
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,240
It's like somebody...

63
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:35,320
Or even seeing the name Tower of Terror or Snow White's Scary Adventures.

64
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,920
That's a little diarrhea pang every time.

65
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,920
Right.

66
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,960
Or they hear like, oh, Jason likes 100 grand bars better than Milky Way.

67
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,960
Ah!

68
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,800
Have a horrible diarrhea because they heard that scary thing about Jason and Halloween

69
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,800
candy.

70
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,960
He'll never find zero bars in this day and age.

71
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,960
Oh!

72
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,960
Yeah.

73
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:59,320
So it's a fright around every corner on this podcast in October.

74
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,080
There's a lot to talk about with this topic.

75
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,360
We're doing a big one.

76
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,240
It's a big, big one and we're being big brave boys to do it.

77
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,280
That does make me think with the candy discussion.

78
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,600
There's no treats trail this year, obviously.

79
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,800
All this stuff's happening and we don't have to go over it.

80
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:29,600
I guess Jason, do you end up buying extra candy just to have around?

81
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,080
How do you handle a quarantine Halloween?

82
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,920
Well, look, as long as the aisles of your local supermarket and drugstore seasonal sections

83
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,880
are well stocked, I'll be fine.

84
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:47,160
Are you, Jason, are you going to wait for discounts or are you going to buy during the month?

85
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,360
I will probably buy a couple of times during the month.

86
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,880
I think CVS discounts a lot.

87
00:04:52,880 --> 00:05:00,800
We got lunch once in between recordings and I came back with bags of CVS Reese's Eggs.

88
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,800
Easter Eggs.

89
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,480
Scott, are you a Reese's or a correct pronunciation Reese's man?

90
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,000
Well, I was going to say, yeah, I think I'm a Reese's.

91
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,760
OK, got it.

92
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,760
OK.

93
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:19,080
But you, though I'm not even sure your answer, Mike, because you did say correct, but also

94
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,000
it makes me think you like saying Reese's better.

95
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,040
I think it's funny saying Reese's, but I Reese's.

96
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:31,520
Now look, I look, I'm not I'm not I'm not not guilty for mispronouncing.

97
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:37,040
I called a what did I call a guava, a guava, a guava, a guava.

98
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,040
Yes.

99
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,040
Multiple.

100
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,880
So look, I already so I'm screwing up, too, here.

101
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,400
So I'm not I'm not out of the woods.

102
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,400
Yeah, yeah.

103
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,700
I well, I'm going to try it on for size.

104
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,480
Maybe I'll shift to becoming a Reese's person.

105
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,760
It didn't feel right.

106
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,560
I think I'm not like having the joy and abandon that you need to have to say Reese's.

107
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,920
You need to be a much more of a free spirit to say Reese's.

108
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,800
Yeah.

109
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,000
So too uptight.

110
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,200
Well, I'll work on it.

111
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:10,000
I'll try to drop that word in to our conversations all month as much as I can.

112
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,760
But for now, let's tackle where you guys we're opening with a with a bang.

113
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,920
We're doing a big old major, major attraction.

114
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,760
This is exciting. Twilight Zone Tower of Terror.

115
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,360
Been looking forward to this conversation a lot.

116
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,680
And I think as usual, we'll put a little bit of a put it in a little bit of a box here.

117
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,280
We're going to mostly just talk about Florida and the California version,

118
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,160
not Mission Breakout Guardians of the Galaxy, not Tokyo version.

119
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,040
We haven't done Paris, but Scott, you've been there and this is that is pretty similar.

120
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:48,520
So it just is exactly the same, I believe, as as California

121
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,160
only with worse theming on the way in.

122
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,120
That's the I can get that out of the way right now that you just sort of like

123
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,200
even they managed to do a little like some lead up.

124
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,600
It's kind of weird in the corner over there in California Adventure.

125
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,080
It is like it's odd.

126
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,680
It's certainly not the grand buildup of Sunset Boulevard in Florida.

127
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,800
Still better than France, though, or you just kind of like round a corner

128
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,640
and pass by like a poster for signs or something.

129
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,600
It's an out of date movie and then just, oh, Tower of Terror is here.

130
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,120
And the other thing that makes me crazy is that you can see the back,

131
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,960
which is unthemed.

132
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,120
Like if you're on Harbor Boulevard,

133
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,080
if you're at Harbor and Cotella, the former location of Nixon's

134
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,640
hamburgers, of course, you could, you know, you could see the back of that building

135
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,640
and it's sort of unthemed.

136
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,760
But you let that slide with Disney.

137
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,200
You know, they they don't really theme the back of the Cars Land rocks.

138
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,000
You know, that's not, you know, they dress the side that you're where you're in the park.

139
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,320
Paris, you're just in there and it's just like a like a blank facade.

140
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,440
It's terrible.

141
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,120
So I'm sorry to start on a on a sour,

142
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,120
you know, but that does clear out every everything that there is to say about the France one.

143
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,720
I there's I was going to say there's one other thing they have extra little like

144
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,160
they have like different scenarios they put in the elevator

145
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,640
shafts on special like weekends as well.

146
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,600
They have like a little bit extra magic with like some more dropping

147
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,920
that I just they announced.

148
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:22,200
I don't know if they've actually put it into put it into use yet,

149
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,320
but they announced it at a certain point.

150
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,080
So they're trying different things.

151
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,920
And they also kind of do a similar thing in Tokyo with like they have.

152
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,240
Yeah, there's some scarier iteration.

153
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,240
Yeah, that they they advertise specially.

154
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,480
I mean, that's sort of true of all of these in a way

155
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:44,240
that they've like found ways to to randomize it and increase the scares.

156
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,440
I mean, that's when I when you think of Tower of Terror,

157
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,440
you definitely think of of the ads and that not only there are the ads when it open,

158
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,040
but then there's this other wave of I'm trying to remember.

159
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,800
Oh, like, you know,

160
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,720
that they are every drop and like double was it double trouble?

161
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,520
Like they had so many promotions.

162
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,360
I know what you mean.

163
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,160
Like the one the one I wrote down was T4.

164
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,200
So it's like the fourth iterations, they're calling it T4,

165
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,120
and which maybe implies that there's up to four drops or maybe more like big drops,

166
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,200
which also had the phrase the tower is in control.

167
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,480
Yes. OK, so the very first iteration was one big drop.

168
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,840
Yes. Two years later.

169
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,240
Really? Yeah. Yeah.

170
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,720
And and you have to imagine maybe a little anticlimactic

171
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,320
because there you waited so long those first few years.

172
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,680
It was the the star of the the the park at that point.

173
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,120
Do you remember, Jason, going on this because I went on this pretty quickly.

174
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,800
Like when it was open, we just happened to be going that year.

175
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,280
That's or it was the year after it was Rock and Rollercoaster

176
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,320
and Tower of Terror were both open.

177
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,920
And I was in this open in ninety four, right?

178
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,600
Yeah, not before, but didn't Rock and Rollercoaster open in ninety nine.

179
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,040
That was a while there. Right.

180
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,200
All right. Then I'm confusing my own trips.

181
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,840
I went on this pretty quickly after it was open.

182
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,440
So maybe I'm confusing my two trips with Rock and Rollercoaster.

183
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,920
But I remember not being like let down by the drop is really what I'm getting at.

184
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,760
Yeah. I mean, the buildup is so satisfying.

185
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:21,200
As for me, I think I think it opened in between like trips my family took.

186
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,800
So I think I would have gone on in ninety six.

187
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,520
So it may have been two drops at that point, but it was still brand new.

188
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,920
Still like our two 90 minute wait, at least.

189
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,400
I just remember the first time getting the full extended queue

190
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,280
and the gardens were so cool.

191
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,680
Like it was so it's supposed to be dilapidated.

192
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,640
But Disney is so good at landscape architecture.

193
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,920
Like the dilapidated gardens are beautiful.

194
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,320
And the other thing is there were misters hidden everywhere.

195
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,600
So it was a little spooky and also much needed

196
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,960
because it would have been like the middle of summer.

197
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,200
Oh, sure. Yes. Yeah.

198
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,200
That's a cool way to do it.

199
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,120
It kind of seems like fog or something.

200
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,480
I also remember when this ride showed up on the scene.

201
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:11,480
Obviously, I didn't I didn't actually go on it until with you guys in last October.

202
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,640
I it opened, I think, because I went in 92 and 94.

203
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,600
So the second time I went to Disney World, it was there.

204
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,320
And I remember feeling more unnerved

205
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:26,960
everywhere at the resort because of the mere existence of the tower.

206
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,880
Wow, really?

207
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:32,040
Is that you would see it from Epcot or you'd see it from a hotel

208
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,000
or you'd see the ad with the like shaking elevator, the billboard on the way in,

209
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,080
or you'd see it on the in-room TV.

210
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,120
It like loomed over the whole trip.

211
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,960
It like just just the notion of it made my second time there so much scarier

212
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,240
because you knew you were going to do it press.

213
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,960
Yeah, no, because I knew I wasn't going to do it.

214
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,840
I didn't do it then. Oh, I see.

215
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,560
OK, you when I was not.

216
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,800
No. And I and maybe the maybe the inner shame of knowing

217
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,600
there wasn't even a chance that I was going to give it a shot.

218
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:06,400
Yeah, I felt similar with Alien Encounter because that was also new. Yes.

219
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,600
Maybe maybe that whole trip was just shame in the back of my.

220
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,120
Yeah, shame that I wasn't going to do it.

221
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,440
And also like what happened to this place?

222
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,360
This was a magical place for little kids full of castles and fairies.

223
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,880
And now there's so much horror around every turn.

224
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,800
Why did they add things young people might enjoy and be thrilled by?

225
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,560
Disgusting. Didn't make any sense to me.

226
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,640
There's more looks behind the scenes of my favorite films.

227
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,240
And that is all they should ever add.

228
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,440
I felt anxiety because of Alien Encounter,

229
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,720
because I was like thought it was awesome when I was reading about it.

230
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,400
And then we got there.

231
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,800
I famously, of course, if you listen to the old episodes, chickened out.

232
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:48,240
And I was it definitely like it like stuck with me the whole trip of like

233
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,360
your dad and your little sister went on it.

234
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,880
And you didn't, you loser.

235
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,760
But I wasn't like. Yeah.

236
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,560
I was once it was like this side, we had gone to Magic Kingdom

237
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,120
and I wasn't going to go on it.

238
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,080
I guess I kind of put it out of my mind.

239
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,680
Yeah, yeah. I mean, I didn't I didn't build up the bravery until last year.

240
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,720
And I'm so glad.

241
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,960
I mean, as I've said before, really, Tokyo was what did it.

242
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,480
Because Aaron, when we were there, my wife was like,

243
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,480
you're not going to come all this way and not go on this tower of terror.

244
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,400
And thank God, because that thing is incredible.

245
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,520
And then it like, you know, it made me have to go do all the other ones

246
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,720
and guardians and everything.

247
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,240
And Aaron was very that was maybe her biggest trip disappointment

248
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,200
because we were she was newly pregnant at the time

249
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,080
and that she was really looking forward to doing

250
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,440
the Florida Tower of Terror.

251
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,240
So apologies to Aaron if you're listening to this.

252
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,240
We'll we'll get there one day.

253
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:50,280
Yeah, I I do remember since you both mentioned being scared as children

254
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:55,840
going when this was open, I was so excited to ride it at the same time.

255
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,040
All of the marketing for it featured footage of people

256
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,920
standing in an elevator that drops.

257
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,760
And I was like, this is insane.

258
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:09,400
Disney just puts you in an elevator, standing up and you're going to drop.

259
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,440
And then as we're like, this is like driving me crazy as we're like in the line.

260
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,040
And I'm like, oh, there's Rod Serling, obviously, as a weird little child.

261
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,640
I love the Twilight Zone.

262
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,520
I'm so excited to see Rod Serling and the queue and everything.

263
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,480
And then the doors open and there's seats and seat belts.

264
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,840
And I'm like, oh, my thank God.

265
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,120
Just thank God.

266
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,280
But I feel like it was another one where, like, my memory as a child

267
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,320
and I'm probably just misremembering is I could not get a straight answer

268
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,240
from cast members like when I would ask, like, does the rock and roller coaster

269
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,000
go upside down or does the outer limits flight of fear?

270
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,560
Like, is it super scary?

271
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,440
Like and no one would tell me.

272
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,320
And I did that once.

273
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,240
And there was a there was a refresh of Space Mountain where I went and asked,

274
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,440
OK, when this was redone, was a launch added?

275
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,400
And maybe I didn't have the word launch at my disposal.

276
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,160
And I had to say, like, does it have the thing where it goes super fast

277
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,080
all of a sudden, which if you say that to a Space Mountain employee, they're like,

278
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:13,320
yeah, yeah, like, yeah, it's a fast ride.

279
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,880
What do you I could not get a straight answer.

280
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,040
And obviously they did not add a launch.

281
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,520
So I braved it anyway.

282
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,200
But that was my launch fear.

283
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:24,480
Even the like the idea that they might have put one in there was too much for me.

284
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,200
Launch that's interesting because, yeah, rock and roller coaster is my first launch.

285
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,320
But I don't know when it when it when is the first time you knew what a launch was?

286
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,200
Do you think how old do you think you were?

287
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,320
Well, when did they start putting them in there?

288
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,080
I mean, yeah, rock and roller coaster could have been the first one,

289
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,040
like around then and mummy. Yeah.

290
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,840
Yeah. I mean, I was a down by the time.

291
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,640
Oh, yeah, I was I was a teenager who was deathly afraid of the

292
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,480
mere notion of launches, just to clarify.

293
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,680
Not a child. Wow.

294
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,800
I think just because I wasn't even that familiar with launches

295
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,320
when I did rock and roller coaster, I realized that made me feel bad.

296
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,920
I've said this before, so I'm not going to get that far into it,

297
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,640
but it made me feel better because it would go quick.

298
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,120
It would be over quick.

299
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,840
I hate the suspense of roller coaster.

300
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,080
I hate the suspense.

301
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,360
I don't like the slow climb up.

302
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,480
Like, that's why when we did hang time, which is the thing that like

303
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,200
it's like just puts us like in a chair slowly going vertical.

304
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,440
That's the most anxiety inducing thing that I can do

305
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,320
because it's just all suspense.

306
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,000
And then the ride is fine.

307
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,760
Which so it's interesting, like this kind of ride,

308
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:39,400
it is the first Disney drop tower, and they've done less themed ones

309
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,280
like the Malibu, which that one just shot you straight up.

310
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,560
Like there was no buildup that wasn't like you climb up very slowly.

311
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,480
That was just like, yeah, similar to Dr.

312
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:54,360
Doom's Fearfall, that was like an off the shelf sort of thing with no theme.

313
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,800
At least Dr. Doom, they the queue is pretty good.

314
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:02,680
And I've I've never done a legs dangling drop ride.

315
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,760
Sure, sure. Really?

316
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,760
Never, ever. Wow.

317
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,880
I'm not saying I've never done.

318
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,760
You've never done Fearfall, never done Fearfall.

319
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,520
You've never been through the Latvarian embassy, never been to the Doom bot.

320
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,280
Well, Michael, this is I can't believe this. Yeah.

321
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,360
OK, look, next time we go to Orlando or I go to Orlando, I will.

322
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,760
I I don't even want to say it.

323
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,720
I will do Dr. Doom's Fearfall.

324
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:36,400
I I did it like four times because you just go out the exit

325
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,280
and like go around the corner and get back in line.

326
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,240
I don't because you're you're a brave boy.

327
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,640
You were you were a brave boy and still are.

328
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,520
And I got to see those views.

329
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,080
I got to see those views.

330
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,080
I try to cut I try to cut you down by making fun of your Reese's pronunciation.

331
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,440
But it's just because you're braver than I am.

332
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,840
Oh, thank you so much.

333
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,120
No, that's what it's all about.

334
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,320
All of the undercutting, because you've had so many more years

335
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,440
of Tower of Terror experience.

336
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,400
That is true.

337
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,440
But I had multiple times doing the research for this,

338
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,240
where I truly felt like an idiot, where I am like learning.

339
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,880
I did. I did not know that if you stare at the Morocco Pavilion,

340
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,600
I didn't either. The tower, it did not occur.

341
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,160
Yeah, you could. It did not occur that they were that close,

342
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:29,000
that they built like minarets almost on top to make it blend in.

343
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,360
Tie together. Right.

344
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,800
So if you're in Epcot Center and World Showcase

345
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:37,360
and you're from certain angles, you're staring across at the Morocco Pavilion.

346
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:42,400
They colored this Tower of Terror to fit with Epcot's Morocco.

347
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,400
I know I never noticed that. It still fits in the sightline.

348
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,800
Yeah, yeah, I never.

349
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,400
That's very cool.

350
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,160
I saw the photo they had on whatever site I was on and it was I was like, oh, wow.

351
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,360
I probably stared right at it.

352
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,080
You didn't realize it.

353
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,480
Kudos. Yeah, we will.

354
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,600
The thing I was going to get to is that, yeah, this is the first Disney

355
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:05,600
drop tower, and I think it came out of they knew they knew they wanted to do that.

356
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,560
Like Splash Mountain before it, like this is a genre of ride that's very common,

357
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,800
but we haven't done it ourselves.

358
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,960
It actually maybe wasn't that common.

359
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,240
And I think the way that it mainly existed before is sort of like maybe

360
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,360
the only one of these we've talked about on the show is the Tower of Terror

361
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,600
ripoff that we encountered at Movie Park, Italy.

362
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,960
Again, I never remember the name of the land, but that that was this.

363
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,400
If you didn't hear the episode, that was this ripoff Universal Studios

364
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,880
that has a ripoff Tower of Terror that says Hollywood Tower at the top.

365
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,760
But that is not where you're in this this room that fits several dozen people.

366
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:47,280
You're in this like very claustrophobic little cage, basically, that rises up.

367
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,800
That that is the slow climb.

368
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,560
That's the thing that you would be afraid of. Yes. Yes.

369
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:58,920
So I think that was the main way that drop rides existed.

370
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:03,000
And in Disney's pursuit of trying to do a ride like this,

371
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,440
that's what maybe they were originally thinking that they had to do.

372
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,880
And if you've ever been on one of these rides or you heard us

373
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,920
talk about that that ripoff one, often how it goes is it's the slow

374
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:18,320
climb up to the top and then you jolt forward to the other track.

375
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,400
And then you go down in such a way that it curves you

376
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,040
until you're on your back at the bottom,

377
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,600
which is so weird and like low rent and carnivally like a.

378
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,600
Yeah, it's like it's like almost like you're on a water slide kind of thing.

379
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,000
Yeah, which that's weird.

380
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,640
Why do you accept it on a water slide?

381
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,120
Like, of course, I'll be sort of like naked and unattached to anything

382
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,560
and end up on my back, but doing it on a ride with a physical piece

383
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,280
feels so shady. Yeah. Yeah.

384
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,040
And that one of those is often themed to Superman, the escape.

385
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,120
It's so crazy how some of the most recognizable characters in the world

386
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,760
translated into any number of languages have the most like

387
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:05,280
rickety six flags, ask a death trap named after.

388
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,160
Well, that's I mean, that's obviously six flags.

389
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,720
I mean, that's part of the appeal is part of the thrills, you know.

390
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,080
It's a different kind of thrills than the storytelling,

391
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,320
like playing on the senses that Disney Imagineering does. Yes.

392
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,360
They made a deal with the devil, the Looney Tunes and the DC characters.

393
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,120
Like they are so rarely a good ride or attraction

394
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,280
based on any of this beloved IP.

395
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,920
I saw someone saying someone was calling us out, and I can't remember who it was

396
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,080
because we were talking about the fact there's no good Looney Tunes ride.

397
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,520
But apparently I forget which park it is.

398
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:42,560
There's a there is a dark ride, Looney Tunes in the park with the Alf

399
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:46,280
Gremlins that had the Alphen Gremlins. Oh, is that right?

400
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,440
And I wasn't he wasn't even on my radar, but it is kind of an old school,

401
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,320
like 90s animatronic ride.

402
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,720
That looks pretty cool. OK.

403
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,040
Cool, because it's like 30 years old.

404
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,120
Oh, yeah. Oh, so it's a little rinky did.

405
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,480
But like it's like feels like what we would have closer to

406
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,240
yeah, to what we're looking for when we were talking about that.

407
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,680
So we got it. We got to look into that more.

408
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,080
But well, that's the episodes we've talked about doing are like,

409
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,680
let's track Batman and the parks and maybe Looney Tunes should be added

410
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,560
to that list, too. Oh, yeah.

411
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,160
What have they actually pulled off?

412
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,760
And is this to buy one the any good?

413
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,400
Like, does that do justice?

414
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,080
Do we? Yeah. Not that we'll go to Dubai, probably.

415
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,240
We get free tickets, though.

416
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,040
I emailed the PR guy and we can get free tickets,

417
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,640
but I don't think they're going to fly us to Dubai, unfortunately.

418
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,800
But maybe now that we've been around for a while,

419
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,000
maybe now that we're a juggernaut of podcast podcasting.

420
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,200
Yeah. They got to put us up in first class where it will be safer

421
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,800
for us to fly. And right. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

422
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:53,120
And I also want to set up where we can have Jason recreate Tom Cruise's

423
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,120
stunt and Mission Impossible four.

424
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,880
Where he's which one's for which one?

425
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,360
Oh, climb in the building because Jason wants to do that.

426
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,360
You love heights. Yeah, that one looks OK.

427
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,800
You're the height. The new the new stunt.

428
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,520
I would be where you ride some motorcycle into the air and then parachute.

429
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,520
Spoiler alert for the listener who doesn't want to know.

430
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,400
It was it was on every like newswire.

431
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,400
It was on the Associated Press.

432
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,400
They filmed it. That's true.

433
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,840
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

434
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,040
So you don't you won't do the new motorcycle stunt,

435
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:28,000
but you are willing to do the tallest building in the world running around it

436
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,320
on a wire. No, I said I would be interested.

437
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,880
Oh, you would. I'm more interested in the motorcycle.

438
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,600
You would you would rather ride a motorcycle off of an evil

439
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,600
Knievel ramp off the side of a mountain.

440
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:44,600
That yeah, because I I feel like the hardest part of that

441
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,600
would be learning how to ride a motorcycle.

442
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,160
Hmm. That seems like a lot of precision on a ramp.

443
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:56,640
I don't know. Did you guys know about this in Vegas at the formerly Strat

444
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,280
known as the Stratosphere?

445
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,280
You can go up to the top level and they'll put bunch of cords on you

446
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,880
and you can just jump off the building.

447
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,160
Yes. And you just slowly land.

448
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:10,320
Well, Lindsay and I watch about an hour's worth of videos of people doing it.

449
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,000
And I did too recently. Yeah.

450
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,400
And people just melt down.

451
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,520
They're standing at the top of this thing and they're like sobbing.

452
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,800
And the woman or the man who's working there, who's seen this a million times,

453
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,920
is just dead inside going, it's all right, it'll be OK.

454
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,840
And they'll be like, can you just push me?

455
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,360
Can you push me off?

456
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,520
And then they're like, they're like, we can't push you.

457
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,800
You have to jump.

458
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,960
Like you have to just know, but please just push me.

459
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,720
I just I'm so scared.

460
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,920
Like, it's going to be fine.

461
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,440
A lot of people have done this and they're just like they're not helping at all.

462
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,600
They're just like, go to go closer to the edge and jump.

463
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,520
And then finally, after like 20, some people like 15 minutes

464
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,920
finally just inch off the building and fall with a bungee cord.

465
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,800
It's like insane. I can't imagine.

466
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,440
I want to do it so badly. You want to do it?

467
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,760
Oh, yeah. Really?

468
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,080
Well, I want I've always wanted to.

469
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,560
OK, part of my love of terror terror as a kid, I was so excited

470
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,440
because it was so tall and I love being high up.

471
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,120
This is probably a short man complex.

472
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,280
But I was so excited for terror terror to go up that high.

473
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:24,640
And I think I've always wanted to safely safely jump off the top of a building.

474
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,120
Wow. I'm I'm kind of shocked because that seems so I would.

475
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,360
I would be the person melting down for 20 minutes, I think, at the top of the

476
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,520
of the hotel.

477
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:39,520
I am so I mean, it's like a hundred dollars or 150.

478
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,600
If you get a video, let's I was a little annoyed.

479
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,920
Let's take it out of the Patreon.

480
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,040
Let's take it out of the Patreon.

481
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,240
You're going to do that.

482
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,200
You know, you're going to jump off the top of a building.

483
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:54,000
Here's well, here's my one thing, though, is I think I would have to get contacts

484
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,720
because it would all just be a blur to me.

485
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,120
And I think I would want a crystal clear view of what I am seeing.

486
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,440
So I yeah, I am very impressed with this.

487
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,240
Like I just, you know, tentatively said that I would do Dr.

488
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,280
Doom's Fearful ride.

489
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,120
Now that the other thing isn't safe, but yeah, people melt down

490
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,200
on what you're talking about.

491
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,600
Yeah, like a big part of it is that you have to do the jumping.

492
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:19,920
Yeah.

493
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,400
Like that's my problem with skydiving, too.

494
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,360
And I know, like the first time you go, you're strapped to another person

495
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,680
that knows what they're doing.

496
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,240
Like I would have to be forced to do Dr.

497
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,600
Doom's Fearful.

498
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,520
I couldn't climb up a tower and then jump off of the tower.

499
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,480
A machine has to do the work for me.

500
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,160
So that's why the idea of actually stepping off of a building drives me insane.

501
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,120
So I am legitimately impressed with you saying you want to do this.

502
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,440
And we have to make this happen.

503
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,200
I think the one thing that worries me is just like, I don't know,

504
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,280
it feels like there's a lot of backup cables.

505
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,160
I watch them explain like all the fail saves.

506
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,040
But I think part of the appeal is that you just slow down

507
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,640
as you get close to the ground.

508
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,400
There's no snapback.

509
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,920
Like bungee jumping scares.

510
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,280
The snapback would scare me.

511
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,160
That does sound better.

512
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,480
You just, yeah, you just slowly land.

513
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,280
Yeah. Wow.

514
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,640
Man, this is going to be a great episode.

515
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,480
Yeah. Well, I don't think I was.

516
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:27,840
I wasn't planning on getting contacts anytime soon, so I'm also not planning on going.

517
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,600
You have a really boring logistic to do and then and the virus has to go away.

518
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:32,920
Yeah, the virus.

519
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:38,480
I mean, Vegas is a third open, but not not a ton of stuff to do.

520
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,240
So hashtags stratosphere in

521
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,400
it's getting wild in the event of 2024.

522
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,760
This is Tom Cruise of podcast the ride

523
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,520
and I'll go on the New York, New York roller coaster.

524
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,400
That's my pledge.

525
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,800
Well, I don't know if I feel comfortable with you going on.

526
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,200
OK, fine.

527
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,840
I've done it. I cannot recommend.

528
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,960
Yeah, I I will.

529
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,320
Gamble in the pleasure pit at the Planet Hollywood Casino

530
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,440
where the women wear like slightly more revealing clothes.

531
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,880
That's the danger I will face.

532
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,480
Oh, a lower cleavage. That's correct.

533
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,800
Yes, that's the danger.

534
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,240
I will put myself in in Vegas while Jason jumps off a building.

535
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,080
So I was starting to say just in terms of the history of the thing.

536
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,520
Yeah, the Disney, I think, was I forget where I got all this info,

537
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,000
but they were thinking about doing one of those where you end up on your back

538
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,520
to something a little more low renty.

539
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,880
And something has come up on the show before that sort of, you know,

540
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,480
pops in and out of the history of the Tower of Terror.

541
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,920
And that is this thing, Geyser Mountain.

542
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,840
I know, Mike, you love this.

543
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,840
Love this idea. Yes.

544
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,920
This was a Baxter thing.

545
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,720
Yeah, maybe it was. Yeah. At some point.

546
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,800
The main just being that it is like a I guess a launch and then a drop

547
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:08,040
ride where you are launching because a geyser is going off

548
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,280
and propelling your vehicle into the air.

549
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,320
There's a yeah, there's an episode of the season pass.

550
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,520
I believe it's a paywalled episode of the season pass podcast.

551
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,920
That's all Tony Baxter unmade rides.

552
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,040
Wow. Wow. This is in there.

553
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,440
And in addition, it would have gone back by where Star Wars Land is,

554
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:30,000
which also was a place that Ozland would have gone if the James Franco movie was a hit.

555
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,600
You know, walk around Franco.

556
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,840
Now it does. Which that'd be fine today, right?

557
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:42,360
Oh, yeah. Just replace him, replace him with the old guy from the original,

558
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,400
although they don't have the right.

559
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,440
They don't have the rights to that, though, but whatever.

560
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,720
Oh, yeah. I don't know what they do.

561
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,960
But just put another Johnny Depp.

562
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,920
Yeah, yeah. Johnny Depp is the mole.

563
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,600
Perfect. No problems. Johnny Depp as Oz.

564
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,800
Yeah. Yeah. So

565
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:02,440
but apparently the there was some proto iteration of Geyser Mountain.

566
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,680
That would have been the same idea, except it's one of those like, yeah,

567
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,520
you end up on your back a little more.

568
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,480
So they were like pursuing that is that a way we want to do a

569
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,920
drop ride and that that didn't end up working out.

570
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,640
But that was the first that Disney's may be thinking about doing it.

571
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:22,120
And it's enough in the air that it is one of the things originally proposed

572
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,760
in 1990 when they were doing starting to plan

573
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,040
the first big expansion of Disney MGM Studios,

574
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,920
because it was specifically a half day park at some point in time.

575
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:36,960
If you went it open, if you can picture it without that Sunset Boulevard area

576
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,840
and without Rock and Roller Coaster, there's very little going on.

577
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:44,160
And the expansion started and Muppet Vision was one of those things.

578
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,800
But they were talking about other stuff to do.

579
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,360
And I got some of this info, by the way, from Kevin Rafferty's book,

580
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,120
which I ended up buying and I highly recommend.

581
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:58,400
I think we've been overlooking Kevin Rafferty as a Baxter level person

582
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,000
right for a long time.

583
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,280
There's shows stuff in this book.

584
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,360
He shows up in a lot of like cool stuff.

585
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,800
I think he had his hands on a ton and more than you know,

586
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,920
because even five and really gotten to read the book yet.

587
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,440
I mainly read about Tower.

588
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:16,360
But like he wrote the lyrics of the Sunny Eclipse song.

589
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,680
Weird stuff like, you know, we don't really like this thing,

590
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:24,000
but the enchanted Tiki room, new management was this guy.

591
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:29,200
But then also, like he wrote all the songs for like, you know, the Maeder jamboree.

592
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,080
That's great. Like so many odds and ends and Radiator Springs Racers.

593
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,760
And one of my favorite things, Panglectic Pizza Port with Tony Solaroni,

594
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,560
which you get a big breakdown of in his book.

595
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:43,320
And apparently he also wrote some of, at least at one point in time,

596
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,840
Michael Eisner's intros for the show.

597
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,320
Wow. That's how much an all hands on deck writer this guy was.

598
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,040
He wrote the Sunny Eclipse songs and the hellos.

599
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,720
How that's kind of like how Marty Sklar would be writing like a lot of Disney's

600
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,160
like internal stuff for introductions on the show and that sort of thing that

601
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,800
that sort of connects to that.

602
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,680
Oh, that's right.

603
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:07,160
God, writing the copy on the TV shows and the attractions themselves.

604
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,240
That's cool. That's that's still the case.

605
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,760
But anyway, he and his book talks about the formation of this, right?

606
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,360
And how they're pitching a ton of stuff.

607
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,480
What can we do in this expansion area?

608
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,640
And somebody pitched a hotel drop ride.

609
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:26,760
And I think the idea was that there you find some there's some backstory

610
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:30,120
where there's a murder in a pool in the basement.

611
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:34,000
And then that starts making the elevator you're in act weird.

612
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,080
And that makes it go up and drop.

613
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:42,160
And and maybe Vincent Price was was pitched to be part of it.

614
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,600
The pitch it.

615
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,000
Yeah, the people pitched to be part of it are insane.

616
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,720
This cast of characters.

617
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,280
Oh, well, there's a there's a big one.

618
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,920
Or we'll get to that in a sec.

619
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:55,640
But the so it's some I don't know, Vincent Price, some weird story.

620
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,080
There's a murder in the put like the pitch was weird and everyone in the room,

621
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,000
Eisner included is like, but why does the so why is the elevator

622
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,680
react to a murder? It just wasn't really tied up.

623
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,680
He thought Vincent Price maybe wasn't relevant enough.

624
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,760
So it just kind of died on the vine.

625
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,920
Kevin Rafferty was not doing that pitch.

626
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:18,520
He was just in the room and he heard it and like something there, though,

627
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,720
like the idea of a haunted tower.

628
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,440
There's like that's pretty great.

629
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,320
And it stuck with him for a while.

630
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,640
And he even just brought it up one day to to another imagineer.

631
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,440
Maybe Kirk is his last name.

632
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,520
I forget exactly.

633
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,320
But they were talking about it and went like, well,

634
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,800
is there some way to revamp that idea and make it work in the studios better?

635
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,200
And they were talking about, well, is it about adding a property to it?

636
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,080
Like, is there some way to tie it into a TV show like the outer limits

637
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,560
they proposed, which we just talked about the outer limits right.

638
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,720
And at King's Dominion.

639
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,880
And then they got to Twilight Zone.

640
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,160
And, oh, that's kind of something.

641
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,440
Oh, what if you're kind of like in an episode of The Twilight Zone?

642
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,520
And then they were trading names back and forth.

643
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,920
Wasn't there a real thing called the Hollywood Tower off the 101?

644
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,960
Maybe it could be like that.

645
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,520
Oh, what if it's the Twilight Zone Tower Hotel?

646
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:14,000
And then Rafferty spits out, what if it's the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror

647
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:18,280
that just flew out of his mouth, improvised, and they both went, yeah.

648
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,960
And they got a new meeting on the books with Eisner.

649
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,040
Here's the pitch Twilight Zone Tower of Terror.

650
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,960
He's like, I love the name, but what is it?

651
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,080
They explain it more.

652
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:30,120
He says how this will be a elevator ride where it doesn't act like an elevator,

653
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,320
where it does things that an elevator wouldn't do.

654
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,480
He's like, that sounds cool.

655
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,000
Does is Twilight Zone relevant, though?

656
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,320
Frank Wells says absolutely.

657
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,480
They show the marathons all the time.

658
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,320
It's as relevant as ever.

659
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,560
Like, that's an institution.

660
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,280
It will always be. And Eisner said, it sounds good to me.

661
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,880
It'll just take money.

662
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,280
It'll take a ton of money.

663
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:55,200
And and suddenly this guy who's like done these weird robot shows in Japan

664
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,440
is in charge of a ticket attraction that he doesn't actually know how to pull off.

665
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,600
And a big important thing about the Twilight Zone,

666
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,920
the rights were available.

667
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:10,720
Oh, yes, was very happy to license it to them, you know,

668
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:15,560
and it fit perfectly within their movie and television studio production park.

669
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,120
Right, right. Absolutely.

670
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,600
But there was also I guess I skipped a step of that by saying all that,

671
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:27,720
because also in the air was this other hotel idea,

672
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,280
which I think is what you were alluding to, Jason, the hotel mill.

673
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,320
Yeah, the hotel mill.

674
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,080
Well, I the other name I heard, too, was Stephen King.

675
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,080
Yes, I also I found Stephen King was approached.

676
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,200
I found that, too, yeah.

677
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,840
Notable for taking meetings with both Disney and eventually Universal,

678
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:51,360
who at one point was pitching like a scary attraction based off some of his books

679
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,480
that would have included a fake loading where Pennywise,

680
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:58,800
the clown would have exploded out of the control room

681
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,160
and the ride would have continued.

682
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,800
Now, this didn't happen.

683
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,600
Of course, nothing goes away forever.

684
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,360
And that idea was worked into Revenge of the Mummy.

685
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,040
Oh, no kidding.

686
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,520
That's nuts.

687
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,200
A Stephen King coaster like all of Stephen King's IP

688
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,000
in one ride is what it seems like. Right, Jason?

689
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:23,360
Yeah, which kind of became the the idea for the TV show Castle Rock.

690
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:28,120
It like ties together a bunch of the characters in the town and everything.

691
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:32,440
Yeah. So it was either going to be Mel Brooks or Stephen King.

692
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,000
What I read about Mel Brooks is that they were trying to get him to shoot

693
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,280
movies at the MGM Studios,

694
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,080
Disney MGM Studios Park because they had a full production facilities

695
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:50,360
and they knew him and his son, Max, were fans of the park.

696
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:54,400
And on the Disney fandom for Tower of Terror,

697
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,840
it said Mel initially had to be sold on the idea of a theme park attraction.

698
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,480
After being explained that a theme park attraction has a lasting

699
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,400
effect of being in place and seen every day of the week

700
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:10,080
by 20,000 people for like 10 to 20 years.

701
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:13,960
And that, I think, is a big like keystone,

702
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:17,480
a big benchmark for like why these places resonate so much,

703
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,280
because they are so many people experience them.

704
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:24,040
It is a shared experience of like, oh, you can skip a movie.

705
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,560
You cannot see a movie.

706
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,640
But like so many people have ridden these things, you know?

707
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,600
Right, right.

708
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:34,640
So they end up with this idea that I what I figured out is that

709
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,080
I don't think the Hotel Mel was was a drop ride.

710
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,320
I think it was that you're going to be on a set

711
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:46,280
and you're taking around in a golf cart like that Hollywood Inside Baseball

712
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:50,040
that you're on a back lot going on a crazy golf cart ride.

713
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:55,000
But through the set of sort of a young Frankenstein ish Mel Brooks

714
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:59,080
comedy or and it was just yeah, it was it was gags.

715
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,680
Yeah, the village maybe would have been built.

716
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:07,000
The young Frankenstein Castle might have been there and like a village

717
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,640
and that you could walk down.

718
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,080
But who knows how far any of this stuff got, you know? Yeah.

719
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:15,840
Did he maybe take any of the ideas that were being formulated

720
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,680
and infuse them into Dracula dead and loving it?

721
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,640
I have not seen Dracula dead and loving it, even though I referenced it

722
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,080
not long ago.

723
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,720
So I won't.

724
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:33,560
We should probably I I feel like I might like you when the turn happened

725
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:37,440
and the Leslie Nielsen movies got kind of like less good every time.

726
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,960
I was disappointed then.

727
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,440
I bet now I would like watch the lesser Leslie's and go,

728
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,320
this is better than any.

729
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,840
Oh, yeah. Comedy film.

730
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,360
Yeah. Decade. Yeah.

731
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:52,720
I was watching some old Jackie Chan movies and I was like, this is so good.

732
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,320
These are so good.

733
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,720
These stunts are insane.

734
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,880
Yeah, like, yeah, it's just like a lot.

735
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,640
You're watching like a live stunt show. It's crazy. Yeah. Right.

736
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,560
We like old we like old things, I guess.

737
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,920
This is it.

738
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,480
No, I know I do kind of want to watch the lesser Leslie marathon

739
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,640
maybe coming for me. Oh, sure.

740
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:20,800
But I just think it's interesting that they were like piecing this together

741
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,680
so slowly. What about a drop right?

742
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,520
What about its Disney of James and there's a hotel?

743
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,960
Well, not quite.

744
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,200
Then we're and then it finally all crystallized in this in Tower of Terror.

745
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,200
And they started planning it and budgeting it and seeing if this was going to be

746
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:40,520
the thing. But it was as an expansion idea for Disney and James Studios.

747
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,000
It was up against a different Kevin Rafferty idea.

748
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,920
He was working on two things that were in contention to be the big centerpiece

749
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,240
of the expansion. And the other one.

750
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,680
And I don't want to spend too much time on this

751
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,000
because this for sure is its own episode, at least a second gate.

752
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:59,480
The other one that he was pushing along was the Creatures Choice Awards.

753
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:03,440
If you guys I don't know anything about the Creatures Choice.

754
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,800
I don't know that. Excuse me.

755
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,720
Oh, my God. This is why you have to get this this book,

756
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,960
Magic Journey, because there's photos of it.

757
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:16,160
I discovered some of this from some YouTube video that

758
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,960
that I didn't know where they were getting it from.

759
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,000
I'm watching the video going, excuse me.

760
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,520
And now I know it's from Kevin Rafferty's book, because this is without saying

761
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,000
too much because I'll have to save it for this episode.

762
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,200
I'm even I'm even like, do we just move this up and do it soon?

763
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,040
Maybe. But we'll figure it out.

764
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:35,960
But just to whet the appetite, the Creatures Choice Awards

765
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:41,080
involves a the host of the Creatures Choice Awards

766
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,560
is a character named Eddie Franken Murphy.

767
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,840
Wow. Yeah.

768
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,560
And there is art in this book of Eddie Franken Murphy.

769
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:59,200
Wow. Eddie himself heard the pitch like Eddie Murphy was aware

770
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,120
of the possibility of being Eddie Franken Murphy.

771
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,120
Whoa. I've never seen anything about this.

772
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,120
It's in some it's buried in some other YouTube video.

773
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,400
I don't remember the channel to go to British accent or something.

774
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,160
But I was watching it months ago, just jaw dropped.

775
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,320
Like, what are you telling me right now?

776
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:21,440
A monster award show with it's so it's so good,

777
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:25,840
mixed with the fact that Rafferty is working on Tower of Terror,

778
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:30,040
the great like, you know, now in every park attraction that is beloved.

779
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:34,960
Then this bizarre idea and Dick Tracy Crime Stoppers at the same time.

780
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,840
Like this and in the book, they detail conversations he had with Eisner

781
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,600
about like, wait, so it's a gun.

782
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,920
Yeah, it's a gun in the car, but it's like a fun go.

783
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,200
I don't know about a gun.

784
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:49,360
Like it's so that we've been, I think, underwriting Kevin Rafferty.

785
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,760
There's a lot in the Kevin Rafferty.

786
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:54,400
I think Crime Stoppers may be coming up too, we should say.

787
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,240
Oh, that's a good idea.

788
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,520
Yeah, I would love to.

789
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,880
Well, off Mike, about how soon you'll hear about Eddie Franken.

790
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,920
Wow. It's so crazy.

791
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,840
Yeah, we got to do that.

792
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,320
I heard that.

793
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:11,600
I'm seeing now that part of part of the reason is they couldn't get the rights

794
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,840
to Eddie Franken Murphy's famous characters.

795
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,400
Gumboo and Boogweed.

796
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:22,560
It's just too expensive to get those hilarious characters.

797
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,960
Oh, B.O.O. Yes. Yeah.

798
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,960
Boo. That's pretty good.

799
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,760
Sorry. I guess it's gumboo and booqueat.

800
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,360
Tis the season, you know.

801
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,440
I know. Yeah.

802
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:38,320
And he definitely referenced his work in Booverly Hills Cop.

803
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,560
And Boo Meringue.

804
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:45,480
And Boo Boofinger.

805
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,440
Oh, boofinger.

806
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,520
Wait, I might have been thinking of Boofinger.

807
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,880
Is he in Boomerang?

808
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,920
Don't doubt yourself. Yeah.

809
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:01,120
Wow. Do they all work?

810
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,960
Maybe. I guess.

811
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,680
My name is Boolemite.

812
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,040
Yeah, that's not quite as good.

813
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,000
Yeah. Shrek is just Shrek.

814
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:11,880
Yeah.

815
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:16,600
Anyway, we'll figure that one out.

816
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,640
This is just like this is where if I could just go

817
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:25,040
to Imagineering on a random day in 1990 and see concept art of all of this,

818
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,080
that these things are all being and that's just like a third of what they're

819
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:33,720
working on. I think that's why I can't abide by any by too much Eisner hate,

820
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:38,000
because sure, he messed up later, but he also enabled a world where like, OK,

821
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,600
what's my 315? The Creatures Choice Awards.

822
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:44,120
All right. Well, hurry it up because I got a I got a four o'clock

823
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:47,960
about Tower of Terror, about how to make an elevator move free standing down

824
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,680
a hallway. What a great time. Eisner did it.

825
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,400
He certainly did. Can I just ask one question?

826
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,080
What was the Creatures Choice?

827
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,680
What kind of a writer is that? Too big of a spoiler.

828
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,880
What kind of a thing was it? Like, what was it?

829
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,880
It is. And again, I'm glad I didn't learn more because this so I can't really spoil.

830
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:10,200
But he he claims in the book that it would have been an audio animatronic

831
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:14,440
theater show with the like scope

832
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,040
and amount of robots of the American adventure.

833
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,120
Wow. Oh, my gosh. Holy shit.

834
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,680
Yeah. My appetite is more wedded now. Good. I'm glad I asked.

835
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:26,320
Yeah. OK. Yeah. Unbelievable.

836
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:29,240
So to to come, we'll put it.

837
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,920
We'll put the pin in that. But there was he literally what a crazy time for this

838
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,640
guy. He has two projects in contention that one they realized logistically

839
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,560
maybe they couldn't do. And what Eisner was pushing and why this thing

840
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:43,760
really happened and why he was sold on it ultimately is what Jason said earlier.

841
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:49,480
We want teams. We want thrills for a park that at the time didn't have a ton of rides.

842
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,920
And I don't think a thrill ride initially.

843
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,520
This this one was it.

844
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,280
And it was incredibly expensive to do.

845
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:01,360
But Eisner kept pushing, I think, the benefit of a huge thrill ride.

846
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,600
I think it'll have a transformative effect on the entire property.

847
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:10,200
And it did. Well, I and I think a big impetus was that for a very short

848
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,120
amount of time, Disney eventually took the leap.

849
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:16,120
But in terms of Universal Studios, Florida versus MGM Studios,

850
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:20,560
Universal was had more guests for a while after they got their shit together.

851
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:26,400
After the first like year or so, it was beating MGM attendance wise.

852
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,320
So they're like, we've got to put some stuff in there.

853
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,320
And that's as you see, you know, Star Tours and Muppet.

854
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:35,480
And Tower of Terror down the line a little kind of helped it find its foot.

855
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:40,080
That it was always my family's favorite part to go to, like so.

856
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,560
We love the movies and we love TV so much.

857
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:46,080
And and it just everyone liked it.

858
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:50,760
And I feel like a lot of stuff that everyone in the family could do.

859
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,200
Yeah, yeah, definitely something for everybody.

860
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,360
And the fact that there is thrill rides and then like, here's this walking tour

861
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,880
that doesn't challenge anybody. Oh, yeah.

862
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:04,520
Mermaid show like it like it became such a big variety, especially after this open.

863
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,360
Yeah, yeah, I remember.

864
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:08,680
Yeah, we I don't know that we would have declared it our favorite,

865
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,560
but we were very into it, I mean, especially Twilight.

866
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,280
So which my mother is a huge fan of.

867
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:17,800
Like I think that it was it was checking so many boxes for us.

868
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:18,960
And then it's the other one.

869
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,320
Tower of Terror was put in.

870
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:25,000
It was like, yeah, next level, like finally had something.

871
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,440
I mean, great movie ride is very cool.

872
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:32,080
I guess I wouldn't call it like next level going on it, though, maybe.

873
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:36,840
Sure, maybe at the time, by the sheer amount of it, it's still not next level,

874
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:40,320
I guess, because there's already been a ton of animatronics.

875
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,760
So it's like it's really good and it's really fun.

876
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,880
But it's like Tower of Terror that felt like a next level thing.

877
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,240
Oh, yeah, yeah.

878
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:52,400
Great movie, I think, got a boost from the length to not just the many sets

879
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:54,880
of animatronics, but like besides

880
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:58,600
Universe of Energy, there weren't that many long rides at the time.

881
00:46:58,800 --> 00:46:59,760
Yeah.

882
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:04,360
Well, so to that next level point, part of it is one of the things that was

883
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:08,960
in Rafferty's pitch, which is that this elevator car is not just going to go up

884
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,760
and down, it is going to move forward.

885
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:16,560
And obviously so much of our audience is hardcore theme park fans.

886
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,400
But I think there probably are people

887
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:22,320
listening who only been to the California adventure version and actually don't

888
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:29,520
know that in Florida, the car moves, you get up to a floor and it lurches down

889
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:36,200
a hallway, which is some of the, you know, why we've been more OK with it changing

890
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,000
and not being Twilight Zone in California, because it feels like, well,

891
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:44,640
it never in California has been the ultimate version that was, you know,

892
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,400
had this effect that was even in the pitch.

893
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:50,560
Yeah, it's so it's like so much better.

894
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:51,640
We've said it a million times.

895
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:55,680
I'm sure it's annoying at this point of like how much more it adds to the ride

896
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:59,680
in Florida, and I wasn't even quite clear until I was doing some research about how

897
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,440
it worked.

898
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:02,640
Yeah.

899
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,920
Well, you want to talk about that?

900
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:08,360
Yes, real quick, though, I want to see if anyone came across this,

901
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:11,080
since you mentioned that push forward,

902
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,560
I found on one of the like fan Wikipedia,

903
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:18,560
Wikipedia, pages or fans sort of things, as it was describing the differences

904
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,040
between the East Coast, West Coast,

905
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:24,600
our terms, it was saying like, oh, and they took out the fifth dimension

906
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:29,320
sequence where you push forward in the Florida version, which the Imagineers

907
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:33,240
were never happy with, and I had never heard that before.

908
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,440
I don't believe it.

909
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:39,880
I I usually check stuff against multiple sources, but this just made me so angry.

910
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,560
I was like, what are you talking about?

911
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,440
They didn't like that's the whole that's the whole kit and caboodle.

912
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:46,800
That's the whole deal.

913
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:50,920
Like maybe what they were generalizing, it's not that they didn't like maybe

914
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:57,720
the more nuanced opinion might be, well, it's always problematic in terms of function.

915
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:03,080
That's the most likely part to break down or something, because it is interesting

916
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,960
they never reprised it, even the Tokyo one, which is really fantastic,

917
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,760
doesn't have that effect.

918
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:14,200
I mean, I've heard Tony shit talk, the California Tower of Terror, Tony Baxter,

919
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,040
because it doesn't have that secret.

920
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:18,480
He said, like, that's the big important

921
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:22,360
sequence in the ride, because it like that's when you finally like it breaks

922
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,760
your expectations of what an elevator does.

923
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,960
So that's why, like he says, that's so

924
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,120
important to the right, which makes sense, because that's really the moment when you

925
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,800
go, oh, I didn't know this could do this.

926
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,320
Which it's so funny that this got pitched

927
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:41,400
and sold to Eisner and Wells with no plan of how they were actually going to do that.

928
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,600
It's like, what a crazy that that tells

929
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,880
how much they were just in the money at the time.

930
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,320
Like, I don't know, figure it out.

931
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:51,000
And then Rafferty had to leave that meeting with Sklar.

932
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,520
And he was, I think, kind of freaking out.

933
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,960
Like, does that mean did he just say, like, do it?

934
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:55,760
Yeah, yeah.

935
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:00,120
You're in charge of an e-ticket now and you've got to go learn some stuff.

936
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:03,600
So I don't think they did have a plan.

937
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:08,440
And I guess so let's talk about what they they came up with.

938
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,320
Yeah.

939
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,800
What's the easy way to explain the technology?

940
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:13,520
Yeah, I don't know.

941
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,000
I'm going to sound like the biggest idiot in the world trying to do it.

942
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:22,120
I think it's basically there's a ride vehicle inside another mechanism that

943
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,160
makes you go up and down.

944
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,360
There's the shaft, but there's another you're

945
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:30,360
actually in a vehicle that crawls into the shaft.

946
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,760
And there's technically three parts.

947
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,640
There's the going up one.

948
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,920
There's the one that pushes forward and

949
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,400
there's the one that quickly goes up and down.

950
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:42,400
Those are three different mechanisms, three different.

951
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,360
So it's like a category.

952
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,080
OK, so there's like a big like, let's say that.

953
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,920
OK, like how can I say this the dumbest way?

954
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:49,400
It's a big cube.

955
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:55,560
There's a big cube with some ropes on it, cords, cables, another little box where

956
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,280
the people's chairs are go into that big cube.

957
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:04,000
That cube just lifts everybody up to the top.

958
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:08,600
Then the people leave their little vehicle out of that big cube.

959
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,240
They push forward.

960
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:15,360
They see all the fun stuff in the fifth dimension room and then they get loaded

961
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:21,520
into another big cube that's held by different ropes and cables.

962
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:22,320
Yeah.

963
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,880
And then it's mainly cubes.

964
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:25,480
That's what you do.

965
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,840
Cubes is what I'm talking about.

966
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,040
We love cubes on this podcast.

967
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:34,960
And then I think my impression was that it kind of freefall dropped you.

968
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,040
But that's not what it does.

969
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,920
There's like a mechanism that's basically

970
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,440
just shooting you up and down.

971
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,640
It's like pushing you up and down.

972
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:43,880
It's not just free.

973
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:45,600
It's not just sort of free falling you.

974
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,760
It's completely controlling your speed.

975
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:51,120
And you're going faster than you would if you'd free fall.

976
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:55,320
If they were just to drop like any like if they were just to drop the cable,

977
00:51:55,520 --> 00:52:01,080
you would be going slower and feel like less intense motion than you would the way

978
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,200
they do it now. You are being pulled down.

979
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,240
That's a better way to describe it.

980
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:14,280
And the fact I saw is if you hold a penny in your hand as you fall,

981
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:19,800
you will beat the penny will hover in the air a little because it's falling at

982
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:23,920
the speed of gravity and you are falling faster than that because you are strapped

983
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:26,880
into a vehicle being pulled down.

984
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:30,360
I would recommend not doing that on the ride, though.

985
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:34,520
I would recommend because you might miss out on some of the hilarious bits that

986
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:38,560
people do as they're falling, some of the very good jokes that people like to

987
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:41,320
scream. I would say what do you do?

988
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,440
What have you had? What jokes are you talking about?

989
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:45,640
I they're just so funny.

990
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:47,600
I can't remember. I'm just laughing too much.

991
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:48,920
I'm not sure, actually, though,

992
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:52,640
because I kind of mention we've talked about it and like, yeah,

993
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:57,120
I know people like to yell stuff in the room and scream and we're not fans of that.

994
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:58,520
You can call us old men.

995
00:52:58,720 --> 00:52:59,760
I don't care.

996
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:03,360
I like to sit and enjoy the atmosphere.

997
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,280
But Tower of Terror, I've never like I've never been like, oh, well,

998
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,640
there's that bit again.

999
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:13,240
I don't I think people just when you are at the top, when you're holding at the top

1000
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:17,640
for a second, someone will go like, I could see my car like I feel like I've heard.

1001
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:21,600
I have definitely heard I've never heard somebody do a joke like that at the top.

1002
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:26,680
I do like to hear genuine people like, oh, my God, oh, my God, like, Tom,

1003
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:31,240
you didn't tell me it was this like, you know, genuine anguish is very funny.

1004
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,480
I'm not I'm not trying to troll or anything.

1005
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:37,640
I just truly never like nothing sticks out to me when I'm at the top of any

1006
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,560
of these drop rides where I get annoyed.

1007
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:43,880
Scott, I guess you haven't been on many, but

1008
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:49,160
yes, not enough for there to be a recurring trope.

1009
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,200
Yeah, I can see my car.

1010
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,320
Would that bother me if I heard it?

1011
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:56,240
I don't know. It was my dad.

1012
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,440
Maybe I would give him some credit.

1013
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,920
It all depends on the delivery, quite frankly, you know.

1014
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,280
Yeah, yeah.

1015
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:02,840
So interesting.

1016
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,880
Also, just like the parking lot is not in that view.

1017
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,520
If you're being accurate, you cannot see anybody's car.

1018
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:11,040
Yeah. So I have a problem with it on a level.

1019
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,320
Well, I'm going to pay attention to this.

1020
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:17,400
Do you find that you have that happen on Guardians a lot or no?

1021
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,280
Guardians, like it's hard to tell.

1022
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:20,560
Just it's so much noise.

1023
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,720
There's so much the music is so loud.

1024
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,760
Sometimes you can't even hear a rocket like.

1025
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:29,360
I like his little jokes, you know, they're pretty polished.

1026
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,480
Leave it to the professionals like a rocket.

1027
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:35,040
Yeah, that's that's our stance.

1028
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:39,600
That that yanking faster than gravity situation.

1029
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:40,720
That's another thing I found in the

1030
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:45,600
Rafferty book that they went and talked to the Otis Elevator Company, who did end

1031
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:50,000
up putting in the elevator mechanism for this attraction.

1032
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:54,760
And they went to a recently opened 50 story

1033
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:59,120
elevator shaft that they had they had built for some high rise.

1034
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:01,560
And they kind of just like talked about logistics.

1035
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,880
And then they got went up to the top

1036
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:06,240
and said, take this thing down the fastest it can go.

1037
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,680
And there was reticence about that.

1038
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,600
You sure? OK, well, let's give it a shot.

1039
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,760
And then they did. And they didn't feel anything.

1040
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,000
They didn't even have like any heart drop.

1041
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,000
And they were like, that's really the fastest.

1042
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:17,880
So, yeah, pretty much is.

1043
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:23,120
And that's when they realized we can't just rely on what elevators already do.

1044
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,320
We have to pioneer new elevator technology

1045
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:29,560
if we actually want to be able to be weightless or really feel something.

1046
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:30,400
Right.

1047
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:34,560
But that is a funny thing that a real elevator company built this to do,

1048
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:39,280
as is said in the Imagineering story, the opposite of what elevators are supposed

1049
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:39,840
to do. Yes.

1050
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,320
I think in the Imagineering story, they're talking about like the people at the

1051
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:45,280
elevator company were like freaked out a little bit.

1052
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:47,960
Yeah. Like we have to do the wrong thing.

1053
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,080
We make this go the right way.

1054
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,040
We make it make it do the right thing.

1055
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,680
And now we have to make it do the wrong thing.

1056
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:55,760
Yeah. Yeah.

1057
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,520
Very strange.

1058
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:02,240
The other thing that the moving through, I mean, I guess in a way the spoiler,

1059
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:06,240
the end of Rise of the Resistance is sort of like a mini version of this and that

1060
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:11,640
you're in a vehicle that moves into another little cage that drops.

1061
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,280
It's sort of similar.

1062
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:18,800
But this sort of is, is it the first trackless ride vehicle, that little

1063
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,280
sequence, because it's you're moving along a wire that is guiding you.

1064
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:23,880
Right.

1065
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:24,960
That's a good question.

1066
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:28,600
One end of that fifth floor to the other, the fifth dimension.

1067
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:29,720
Maybe. I'm not sure.

1068
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,680
That's a good question.

1069
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,840
I don't think I ever realized those

1070
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:37,520
autonomous guided vehicles, like they have batteries.

1071
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:42,680
The batteries have to recharge in between like goes like as you are getting off or

1072
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:46,000
getting loaded, like they are charging the batteries.

1073
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:49,720
Yeah, it's the I don't I mean, I don't

1074
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:54,160
understand a lot of mechanics and technology, but I truly can't wrap your

1075
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:58,080
head around all the moving parts of something like this.

1076
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:01,040
Yeah, which so I mean, that like I don't

1077
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:05,640
have anything, you know, intelligent to say here about my experience finally

1078
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:11,040
going on this other than a holy shit, like like waiting so long and then not doing

1079
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:15,080
it till last year, I don't think I've ever seen a video of how the fifth dimension

1080
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:20,120
where I think I'd saved it to try to be brave and do in person.

1081
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:21,200
Yeah, it's jaw drop.

1082
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,160
And I feel like we were we got lucky.

1083
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:25,360
We were in a group last year that where I

1084
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:26,920
felt like a lot of them hadn't done it either.

1085
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:33,200
It was like getting applause and gasps the way that, you know, various rooms and

1086
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:38,400
rise the resistance do and certainly for me and that boy that like split of that

1087
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:43,920
neon light when you enter into that final, that is so haunting.

1088
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:49,680
That is like such a stirring moment that I feel like ended up in my actual dreams.

1089
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:52,280
That is so affecting and crazy.

1090
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,840
Yeah, it's yeah.

1091
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:57,360
That moment, I'm trying to think if that's that.

1092
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:00,080
Yeah, like that's the most stark problem.

1093
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:04,480
I mean, probably like it's such a I don't know why it's just like a simple.

1094
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:05,840
That's such a simple effect.

1095
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:09,880
And for whatever reason sticks out so strongly.

1096
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,280
Yeah, there's almost yeah, there's like nothing happening.

1097
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:17,080
Right. A door opens with a neon light that just sort of slowly appears.

1098
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:20,360
And yet it's so much like more minimalist

1099
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:24,520
and scary than a lot of what's in any other Disney attractions.

1100
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:25,800
Yeah.

1101
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,040
Yeah, I mean, I I did you guys watch any

1102
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,400
Twilight Zone episodes to get ready for this?

1103
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,000
No, not really.

1104
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,800
OK, I I was

1105
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:41,520
I watched the Nick of Time, which is one of the Shatner ones.

1106
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:44,280
Be because that's one of the Easter eggs.

1107
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:48,760
The four little devil fortune telling device is in the queue.

1108
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,160
And I was like, I don't think I've ever seen this one before.

1109
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:59,200
And as I'm watching it, I'm slowly dawning on me like, oh, this one is bad.

1110
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,840
This one is not good.

1111
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:05,240
It's just like I think William Shatter's character just is obsessive compulsive.

1112
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:10,600
Like there it is in the way that at 20 the terror of twenty thousand feet,

1113
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:11,840
he is right at the end.

1114
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:14,880
This one is just like, oh, this guy is just a worry wart.

1115
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:18,040
This I don't know the lesson.

1116
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:22,040
And I think they just put this in the queue because the prop is distinctive.

1117
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,280
But it's a good life.

1118
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:28,520
I watched the first few minutes of and that is unsettling immediately,

1119
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,640
which the kid with the powers.

1120
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:32,920
Yeah, that's that's the one with that.

1121
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:35,920
The Rod Serling intro in the ride is pulled.

1122
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:37,000
Right. Yes.

1123
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,440
Which is another thing that never dawned on me.

1124
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:44,960
And it so much of it is in that episode, in his introduction.

1125
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:49,000
Yeah, he says that like they cut it in the episode.

1126
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:53,920
He's in front of a map of the United States, not in front of an elevator bank.

1127
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:59,080
And the line I have tonight's story on the Twilight Zone is somewhat unique

1128
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:00,840
and calls for a different kind of introduction.

1129
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:06,280
This, as you may recognize, is then in the ride, they cut that off and they show you

1130
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:09,480
ride stuff and I don't think you ever see Serling again.

1131
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:12,440
But in the in the episode, it's a good life.

1132
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,680
Then he actually kind of convoluted.

1133
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:16,160
You're like, why are you showing America?

1134
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:18,280
And then they end up with a boy who has

1135
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:22,640
mind powers and can control people's thoughts as parodied on the Simpsons.

1136
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:26,080
It is one of the ones of the Simpsons parodied.

1137
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:26,840
Yes.

1138
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:30,080
And you know what's another weird thing about It's a Good Life?

1139
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:34,200
It was it's one of the four that is in Twilight Zone, the movie.

1140
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:37,360
And it's directed by Joe Dante,

1141
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:42,360
director of Gremlins, who directed the pre show video for Tower of Terror.

1142
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:43,800
Yes, that's the deal.

1143
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:44,560
And crazy.

1144
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:45,160
Yes.

1145
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:49,080
A lot of theme park movie credits to his name.

1146
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:51,840
I feel like he's done other ride stuff.

1147
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:52,040
Yeah.

1148
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:58,800
Well, he did that haunted lighthouse for D that I am like very much want to know

1149
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:01,960
more about the Christopher Lloyd thing that will play at Busch Gardens and Sea

1150
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:06,280
World. I feel like there was another ride thing he directed that's I'm blanking on

1151
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:09,760
right now, but like was was it God?

1152
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:14,280
Yeah. Did the Tower of Terror, probably the most notable one.

1153
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:14,960
That's a huge one.

1154
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:20,040
Another reference to It's a Good Life in the hotel lobby.

1155
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,640
There is a poster promoting the Anthony

1156
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:27,440
Fremont Orchestra, which is a pretty good joke because that is the little boy with

1157
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:31,920
the powers and in the episode he hates music.

1158
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,920
Oh, that's funny.

1159
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:34,760
Yeah.

1160
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,240
Oh, that's a good little dry thing.

1161
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:37,800
Yeah.

1162
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,440
He would have, you know, he would have really hated that

1163
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:46,080
that little intro to his episode was sampled.

1164
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:48,160
In fact, the same one that's used in the ride,

1165
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:52,280
the somewhat unique and calls for a different kind of introduction is sampled

1166
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:57,480
on a song called Threatened, which is a song by Michael Jackson,

1167
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:01,160
the final song on his final album, Invincible.

1168
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:04,600
It starts with a little Rod Serling sample.

1169
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:09,560
Another fun fact about the song Threatened, it sucks.

1170
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:10,560
Awful.

1171
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:15,440
That entire, you know, you can and there's things that are like,

1172
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:19,280
you know, with everything going on, you're like, oh, but I want to retain.

1173
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,000
I still want to listen to Billie Jean or whatever.

1174
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:25,640
No one is fighting for invincible garbage front to back.

1175
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:30,000
He rejected Rock Your Body, Timberlake's Rock Your Body.

1176
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:34,520
He said no, so that he could do 16 tracks of just like,

1177
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:37,840
oh, cha, ga, give it a try.

1178
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:40,440
Put it on Spotify and see if you disagree with me.

1179
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:43,000
I have a feeling I'm not going to disagree with this.

1180
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,840
Yeah, I'm not going to fight you on that one.

1181
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:47,400
That was a challenge to anyone.

1182
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,640
Anyway, if you like the song Threatened

1183
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:54,720
and you feel threatened by my dislike of Threatened, then I don't know the end

1184
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,680
of this sentence. I don't know what I don't know.

1185
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:57,960
Do we know?

1186
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:02,320
Do we know Michael Jackson Road Tower of Terror?

1187
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:03,440
Hmm.

1188
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:07,880
Did he do a Disney World trip when it was out?

1189
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:12,120
We know that he went to Fontasia land to go on the Michael Jackson, his own ride.

1190
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:13,520
Yes.

1191
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,400
Yeah, feels like he must.

1192
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,760
Yeah. Did he get the idea?

1193
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,320
Did he say, like, I want this to?

1194
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:19,360
Yeah, that's my question.

1195
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:20,560
To start like the Tower of Terror.

1196
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:21,800
Right.

1197
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:23,400
I don't see.

1198
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:26,480
I just searched his name in the ride and nothing popped up picture wise.

1199
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:27,360
So who knows?

1200
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:28,400
We'll have to dig deep.

1201
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:29,160
We can't.

1202
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:33,280
Though there are many photos of people on this attraction.

1203
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:35,680
Do you guys have good photos of you on this?

1204
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,880
Do you have childhood photos of you up at the top?

1205
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:38,680
That's a good question.

1206
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:43,360
I don't think we have any childhood photos of us doing this.

1207
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:44,760
I have from recent trips.

1208
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:48,760
I have some of the cool videos they've been doing recently.

1209
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:49,560
Yes.

1210
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:55,760
This was the first ride at Walt Disney World that had on ride videos offered to purchase.

1211
01:03:55,960 --> 01:04:00,200
They put you in a fully in an edited video

1212
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:04,280
of like with shots of like the whole tower and then the thing crashing.

1213
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:07,960
But then inside they cut to like

1214
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:12,440
an actual video of the whole cabin thing going up and down.

1215
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,080
And it's like kind of in slow motion.

1216
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:15,560
It's pretty cool.

1217
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:16,840
Well, do we do?

1218
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:18,080
We don't have the video of us.

1219
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:22,320
We don't have any of us because I did not have a premiere pass at the time,

1220
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:26,200
which allowed me to have full photo pass privileges.

1221
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,280
That came with because you at one point

1222
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:33,520
had the pass that works for both marks because you went to both with it.

1223
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,120
When I like the West Coast and East Coast.

1224
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:35,360
Right.

1225
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:38,800
When we were planning our first Florida trip, I crunched some numbers and I figured

1226
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,440
out that if I upgraded the annual pass to a premiere pass, I don't think it makes

1227
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:43,720
sense anymore money wise.

1228
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:46,120
But at the time it was actually the kind of reasonable.

1229
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:48,520
And I was like, actually, if you just put the money, we're going to spend on the

1230
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:54,160
tickets into the premiere pass, we can get the premiere pass and get more perks.

1231
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:55,400
And that was part of it.

1232
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,400
Geez, like your video.

1233
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:00,600
My family did that in when we were in the vacation club.

1234
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:03,840
We went like back like two years in a row.

1235
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:09,200
And I think we went in August and we knew we'd back the next year, maybe more likely

1236
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:14,320
June or July. And it was just like, oh, it's let's just get annual passes.

1237
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:16,600
Like this is cheaper than buying like,

1238
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:21,640
you know, multiple sets of five day passes or seven day passes or whatever.

1239
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:23,240
And you just feel like a king.

1240
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:26,000
You feel like you can go part of it.

1241
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,320
You know, having an annual pass to Florida, you're like, well,

1242
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:30,080
maybe we'll go next weekend.

1243
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:33,600
I mean, you don't, but you do feel like you have some freedom.

1244
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:36,240
There's a freedom in knowing you could do that.

1245
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:40,640
Well, also in the 90s, they had a lot more aggressive ticketing offers

1246
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:46,120
which came back after 9 11 and are somewhat back right now.

1247
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:50,720
Although we are not advising you to necessarily rush out and do it.

1248
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:55,920
But I believe Universal currently has a buy two days, get three days for free,

1249
01:05:56,120 --> 01:06:00,240
which is not usually how economics works.

1250
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:04,000
They're doing like six flats, like Six Flag offer where it's like,

1251
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:07,960
walk by the entrance and get a year free,

1252
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:13,440
wave at a Valencia teen and get a free year of admission.

1253
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:14,800
Yeah.

1254
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:21,280
Yeah. Within five miles of the park and it'll just automatically be on your driver's license.

1255
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:23,640
You just like scan it and then you get into Six Flags.

1256
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:24,480
That's right. Yeah.

1257
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:26,360
Yeah. So

1258
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:31,360
that might be coming back across the board after the pandemic is over.

1259
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:33,480
At all. Yeah. The theme parks.

1260
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:35,520
We've talked about the

1261
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:39,800
the Rod Serling intro and we're maybe jumping all around a little bit.

1262
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,640
But, you know, that's really fantastic.

1263
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,040
I also just want to give it the credit.

1264
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:49,200
I feel like I they're from the same year and I associate that video piece with

1265
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:54,960
Forrest Gump in that the idea of pulling somebody from old footage was the most

1266
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:57,480
difficult thing in the world to do.

1267
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,000
It was like such a magic trick at the time.

1268
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:02,640
And I think we take it for granted now.

1269
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:04,960
And of course, if you do visual effects or anything,

1270
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:07,600
you know, like rotoscoping is really difficult.

1271
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:11,440
They had to cut him out frame by frame, which he's standing still.

1272
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:12,440
So that helps you.

1273
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:15,080
But if you watch the that's what would surprise me when I watched the real

1274
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:18,800
footage that they pulled it from, that he was like in front of a totally different

1275
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:22,280
background and they married it seemed it's not like he was like in front of a

1276
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:24,680
green screen where they could just put something different behind him.

1277
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,880
Right. Really like work that.

1278
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:27,800
Yeah.

1279
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,760
And the impression is very good, too.

1280
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:30,480
That's very. Yes.

1281
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:34,120
That guy, which I have his name written down here somewhere, he does the he does

1282
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:37,080
a Rod Serling voice on the new Twilight Zone.

1283
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:39,000
Oh, yeah.

1284
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,880
When he like because he in the one that just came out.

1285
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:43,040
Yes.

1286
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:43,840
Oh, right.

1287
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:46,560
Yes, because there's like this weird appearance.

1288
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:47,440
And that's him.

1289
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:47,960
He's back.

1290
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:49,280
I shouldn't spoiler it.

1291
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:51,960
His name. God, I have his name somewhere here.

1292
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:54,720
It's bad. I think it's been something.

1293
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:56,240
He has a name.

1294
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:57,360
He has a person's name.

1295
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:59,480
I'm sorry if you're listening.

1296
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:01,000
You can look it up.

1297
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:05,920
Joe Dante, the man who the name of the man who directed the intro, the rest of the

1298
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:08,240
intro is great, too, that whole.

1299
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:11,080
So this whole story of, oh, this is here.

1300
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,480
This is something I wanted to talk about.

1301
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:14,880
Jason, you brought up like what is the lesson?

1302
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,120
You had a problem with like what's the

1303
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:19,080
Twilight Zone lesson of that with that one Shatner one.

1304
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:24,840
So with this five people get in an elevator, there's a movie star and her kind

1305
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:27,960
of also Hollywood bow.

1306
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:30,560
I don't know what he does exactly.

1307
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:33,240
There's a move like a little kid actress,

1308
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:37,560
actually Temple and her caretaker or nanny or something and a bellhop.

1309
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:43,840
And these five get into an elevator Halloween night, 1939.

1310
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:47,720
And he is struck by lightning and they end up in the fifth dimension.

1311
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,960
What's the lesson?

1312
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:52,440
What's the what's the Twilight Zone?

1313
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:55,640
But remember, well, don't do well.

1314
01:08:55,840 --> 01:09:00,960
Now, the lesson for us is next time you check into a deserted hotel on the dark

1315
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:03,800
side of Hollywood, make sure you know what kind of vacancy you're filling.

1316
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,240
But I don't know what lesson those people are supposed to get.

1317
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:10,840
Yeah, it seems like it's not their fault in any way.

1318
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:12,880
No, I don't think that was.

1319
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:14,440
Yeah, they were not at fault.

1320
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:20,120
I some I've been some Twilight Zone's supposedly don't really have a strong like

1321
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:21,400
lesson.

1322
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:25,200
Yeah, this one is I didn't do, but.

1323
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:32,080
Sometimes the adventure cookie supernatural, scary adventure, which I guess is what this

1324
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:36,640
is, but Rod Serling certainly presents it as if we're supposed to learn something

1325
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:39,480
by the end of this, it's got that judgy.

1326
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:43,000
Yes, exactly. He's judging five people

1327
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:46,280
dared to like a woman like normal.

1328
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:49,800
She wore a fancy fur coat and is like

1329
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:52,760
you're trying you like, I don't know, is that why?

1330
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:54,000
Is she an animal killer?

1331
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:55,040
Is it about fame?

1332
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:59,760
Is it like they came to Hollywood with big dreams and they sold out like they

1333
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:05,440
they only did commercials and they didn't do authentic film and make points about

1334
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:07,360
the medium forward, right?

1335
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:09,920
They just they were very basic.

1336
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:13,680
Their ideas about film and culture were basic.

1337
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:19,280
Did the bellhop steal from the customers of the hotel?

1338
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:21,040
Did he like take luggage?

1339
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:22,840
Did he pull schemes that way?

1340
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:25,080
Maybe it was he being punished?

1341
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:27,320
Perhaps. Yeah, it's unclear.

1342
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:30,360
I think it's kind of a choose your own adventure.

1343
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:34,640
Who's who you think is at fault and what they need to learn and what we

1344
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:36,480
why are we caught up in it?

1345
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:39,160
Why do we have to be punished?

1346
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,560
Yeah, I know for their non crimes.

1347
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:45,840
Yeah, these people got in an elevator and then it fell and now you're going to fall.

1348
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:48,440
I think is it about not doing your research?

1349
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:51,560
Maybe that's to tie together Jason's point.

1350
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,320
Is it like you got to do your travel?

1351
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:57,000
Ossity, you have to like read the reviews.

1352
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:01,080
So this is on you for not reading the reviews of the Hollywood Terror Hotel

1353
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,320
that say don't stay here.

1354
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,600
It hasn't been open since 1939.

1355
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:08,440
And maybe it's actually a larger point

1356
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:12,560
because I'm sure Disney gets a lot of people complaining about lines and when

1357
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,920
do they go and they don't know what the ticket situation is and what is a fast

1358
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:17,080
and where do you get it?

1359
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:20,000
And I'm sure Disney is so annoyed because it's just like, look it up, do your

1360
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:24,200
research, and they made the Tower of Terror to say, we're going to pull.

1361
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:27,440
This is what should happen to you who don't research.

1362
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:29,080
You should go and complain.

1363
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:30,440
You'll become ghosts.

1364
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:32,760
We could do that to you if we wanted.

1365
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:34,960
So learn your lesson.

1366
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:38,080
When did the Hayes regular elevators?

1367
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:41,800
You could have real elevator mishaps in the Swan or the Dolphin.

1368
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,680
But instead, we're going to teach you this right.

1369
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:46,840
When did the Hayes code take effect?

1370
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:50,920
Could these be decadent pre Hayes code Hollywood denizens?

1371
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:57,480
You know, the the the code that the government like manned the studios agreed

1372
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:03,600
to a bye bye to not have like a woman sitting on a bed with her foot off the

1373
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:09,680
ground to people smiling at each other like all this.

1374
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:11,680
I'm still against a woman sitting on a bed in a movie.

1375
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:17,360
Mike, you are a big proponent to bring back the Hayes code, bring up the Hayes code.

1376
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:18,560
Yeah.

1377
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:19,960
Separate beds.

1378
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:21,360
Why are you and I love Lucy fan?

1379
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:22,400
Yes. Yes.

1380
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:25,000
That is that is the main reason.

1381
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:25,680
Yeah.

1382
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:28,640
Maybe were they this would have been too early or they aren't communists.

1383
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:30,000
That's what I was just about to say.

1384
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:32,480
Is it is a chance that five of them were

1385
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:35,560
communists and they were being punished for it?

1386
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:38,400
I wonder, is there is there a secret lesson

1387
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:42,720
that the Imagineers know but we don't know and he's never said.

1388
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:43,560
Hmm.

1389
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:47,600
Where the end it was maybe even like shot in some regard.

1390
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:51,000
And then they decided like, well, you know, you're not going to be in that room for too long.

1391
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,920
So let's just kind of have it be a random horror event.

1392
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:58,280
Right. And we don't want to offend somebody who might actually fall into whatever

1393
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:01,600
these five people are doing.

1394
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:02,320
Yeah.

1395
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:06,880
They don't and they don't want to like if if the backstory is that it's the problem

1396
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:12,880
was with the movie star and the guy that like they are going up to a room to have

1397
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:16,520
sex before marriage and that is why everyone is punished.

1398
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:16,880
Right.

1399
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:23,280
And they decided, well, do we really want to like lay that guilt trip on anyone

1400
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:25,800
living in sin who might be going on this ride?

1401
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:28,880
We don't want anyone living in sin to go on the ride, but it might happen.

1402
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,800
Right. And they knew that the subtext would be there and you could you could kind

1403
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,880
of understand it maybe just without without having it as a conscious thought in your

1404
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:41,360
own head. So and there are consequences for the other hotel guests, the people who

1405
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:47,040
had to abandon their Mahjong game in the lobby, the guy who in the opening special,

1406
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:51,680
they're like, look, someone got here from a colder climate, but they're overcoat down,

1407
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:55,560
got their hotel key, got their newspaper and it's just left here.

1408
01:13:55,760 --> 01:14:00,560
So I'm assuming everyone evacuated when it was struck by lightning.

1409
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:02,680
And that's why they left all their stuff.

1410
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,720
I saw a lot about this Mahjong game.

1411
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:09,120
And of course, my first question, Jason, is, were you a Mahjong kid?

1412
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:12,640
No, I that is I don't know how to play Mahjong.

1413
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:15,320
I don't know how to play backgammon or bridge.

1414
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:17,720
And that's my heart.

1415
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,800
My heart broke each time you said each of those.

1416
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,960
I know, because I know I was like, come on,

1417
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:27,440
bridge, and then it was not you didn't play bridge.

1418
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:30,080
As someone who likes old timey bullshit,

1419
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:33,560
like it is shocking that I have not learned those things.

1420
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,480
We should learn how to play during quarantine.

1421
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:37,000
That's a perfect time to learn.

1422
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:40,360
Can we play like online bridge?

1423
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:41,800
You need four.

1424
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:46,280
We'll have to. Can we teach the sector keeper to play bridge?

1425
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,800
Yeah, I feel like I that is a fact.

1426
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,280
I know, but I could be wrong.

1427
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:53,320
Maybe you need minimum four, but you can play more with bridge.

1428
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:54,320
We got to figure this out.

1429
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:57,400
I'm not sure online bridge.

1430
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,800
I was a big Moncala kid.

1431
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:03,160
I liked Moncala, where you put the stones in the little divots.

1432
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:04,880
You played Moncala. The stones.

1433
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:05,960
Yeah, I played Moncala.

1434
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:07,760
We're all Moncala kids.

1435
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:09,280
Yeah. Wow.

1436
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:12,560
That means that the new tagline for the podcast.

1437
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:14,880
Three Moncala kids.

1438
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:16,840
Three grown Moncala kids.

1439
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:19,280
Right. Maybe.

1440
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:20,280
It's pretty reliable.

1441
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:21,960
We'll roll it around in our heads here.

1442
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:24,360
Whoa. Three grown Moncala kids.

1443
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:25,440
I'm in. Wow.

1444
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:27,720
Screw these other podcasts.

1445
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:29,920
I'm never listening to Comedy Bang Bang again.

1446
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:32,840
Yeah. I'm hanging out with these Moncala guys week after week.

1447
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:35,800
We truly become a juggernaut of podcasting.

1448
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,040
And Dubai flies us out after that, after we explode.

1449
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:40,440
Yeah.

1450
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:43,800
Maybe it's like Go, which I don't know how to play either.

1451
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:48,120
The Japanese, the white, the white black pebbles that you turn over.

1452
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:50,520
You're trying to get the whole board

1453
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:55,480
as apparently they say, maybe even more complex than chess.

1454
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:56,760
But interesting. Yeah.

1455
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:58,320
I'll have to learn all these games.

1456
01:15:58,520 --> 01:15:59,160
Yeah.

1457
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:02,760
Marks. Mark Silverman is Mark Silverman.

1458
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:03,840
Yes.

1459
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:07,320
You're like, I think it's Ben something.

1460
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:12,440
I think I was thinking Ben Silverman, the former NBC executive.

1461
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:14,200
Why do we all know that?

1462
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:16,000
Why do we all know that Ben Silverman?

1463
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:16,720
I don't know.

1464
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:17,840
Too mired.

1465
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:20,280
And we were warped by Disney MGM studios.

1466
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,720
Now we know who executives are.

1467
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:25,560
And Robert Evans, I think also.

1468
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:26,600
Yeah.

1469
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,320
You bet we do.

1470
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:32,520
In trying to conjure back stories.

1471
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:34,240
Well, OK, we haven't talked about this.

1472
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:36,680
That and when we certainly we're not going to, because if you're going to.

1473
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:39,680
I think this is a topic to cover in a

1474
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:42,240
to divide off in a separate

1475
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:44,320
haunt cast the fright down the road.

1476
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:45,800
There is the film.

1477
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,600
We haven't acknowledged the made for TV movie with Kirsten Dunst and Steve

1478
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:56,600
Gutenberg, which now those those two play characters who are not in the ride,

1479
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:02,440
but they are exploring as far as I know, the legend of these five who this mishap

1480
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:05,160
happens to. And I think because of the movie,

1481
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:09,160
there's enough information to cobble together, at least their names.

1482
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:12,280
Carolyn Crissan, that's the movie star

1483
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:16,120
played by Melora Hardin in

1484
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:17,840
in the film.

1485
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:19,840
Gilbert London is the movie star.

1486
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:22,720
Dewey Todd, Dewey Todd.

1487
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:25,440
Great name is the the bellhop.

1488
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:31,720
Sally Shine is the little kid actress and the nanny is Emmeline Partridge.

1489
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:37,680
Now, you might in the movie learn why they deserve to fall down in the elevator.

1490
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:43,800
Maybe you discover they're all the living in various kinds of sin and bad people.

1491
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,040
And it had to happen.

1492
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:47,160
But I don't know.

1493
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:48,880
We'll watch. We will get there.

1494
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:50,200
Yeah, we have to do that.

1495
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:51,160
Yeah.

1496
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:55,000
But the the I'm sorry, the the

1497
01:17:55,200 --> 01:18:00,280
Disney dot fandom dot com has a little breakdown of all of these characters,

1498
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:03,640
I think, based more on what happens in the movie.

1499
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:07,840
And that leads to this trivia section for all of the characters.

1500
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:10,160
And I clicked on this.

1501
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:12,520
And this is, I think, some really fun

1502
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:15,880
trivia that I learned about these characters.

1503
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:20,120
Sally is very clearly modeled after real life child actress Shirley Temple.

1504
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:24,480
This might be an indication that Sally's life as a child actress was particularly

1505
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:28,800
hellish, given the amount of atrocities directed at the real life temple during

1506
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,400
her time in the spotlight.

1507
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:32,520
What? What?

1508
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:35,280
Like, just because she's in like a dress

1509
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:38,160
and has curls, that means that her life was hellish.

1510
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:39,560
That's a kind of a leap.

1511
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:43,040
You mean the actual you actually mean Shirley Temple or this actress?

1512
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:45,400
Well, no, I know things happen to Shirley Temple.

1513
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:50,040
But why does it then follow that Sally Shine had a hellish life?

1514
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:52,320
I guess. And then, yeah,

1515
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:56,240
I was going to say that is the assumption that any especially back then, any child

1516
01:18:56,240 --> 01:19:01,040
actor probably had just an awful time of it, which I mean, probably.

1517
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:03,120
Yeah, you would have to assume.

1518
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:09,120
But I just like that that is pulled from one shot of a girl moving from a desk to

1519
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:11,840
an elevator. Well, her life must have been hellish.

1520
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:17,320
She must have been starved and made to work for 48 hours in a row and fed a diet

1521
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:21,840
of meth, sheep sperm and monkey gonads.

1522
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:26,880
Additionally, then on the other page for

1523
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:30,480
Emeline Partridge, the nanny, Sally Shine being made to resemble

1524
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:33,600
Shirley Temple could be an indication that Emeline was somewhat abusive

1525
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:37,240
regarding Sally's career and operations, given the tragedy.

1526
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:44,920
Like, so now we're judging the the nanny, like the nanny beat up Sally or like was

1527
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:47,840
going to throw her out of the out of the hotel window.

1528
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:50,440
Look, where is this one trivia coming from?

1529
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:51,360
I don't get it.

1530
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:55,240
It was still a few decades before the Eddie Munster law took effect, you know,

1531
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:59,760
before they got, you know, a little more protection for the child actors.

1532
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:02,160
Was it? Wait, it's not Eddie Munster, though.

1533
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:07,640
It's isn't it Jackie Coogan who was Fester?

1534
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:09,200
With Fester?

1535
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:15,200
I know there's the I know Jackie Coogan was a advocate for child set safety.

1536
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:19,000
The Jackie Coogan law ensures the financial well-being of child actors by

1537
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:23,760
mandating their employer set aside 15 percent of the child actors gross earnings

1538
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:26,560
in a Coogan trust account where it can be monitored.

1539
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:28,200
I got my spooky shows mixed up.

1540
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:31,080
I would love if there wasn't any monster law, though.

1541
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:33,880
Is there a different law you're thinking of that Eddie Munster,

1542
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:36,600
the character from the Munsters enacted?

1543
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:40,800
Maybe there was an episode where he went to like he went to the local government

1544
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:47,600
and he got something like more like dragons are now legal in everyone's house or something.

1545
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:48,600
Oh, sure.

1546
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,320
So there was a zoning issue.

1547
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:56,400
He made it illegal to discriminate in a workplace against people with the werewolf

1548
01:20:56,600 --> 01:21:03,000
widows. Yeah, you can't fire somebody just because they have a pointy haircut.

1549
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:07,440
By the way, Al Lewis has been coming up a lot who played Grandpa on the Munsters.

1550
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:11,800
Al Lewis was 42 years old on the Munsters.

1551
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:14,280
Yes, I looked it up.

1552
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:16,920
I was watching an interview with him and I was like,

1553
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,040
he's still in the 2000s.

1554
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:23,360
He's alive. Hey, he was in a grandpa age.

1555
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:28,200
And then I looked it up and it was 42 and I was like, oh, my God.

1556
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:32,600
As a kid, I thought he was like, oh, he's a 70 year old man.

1557
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:35,120
Anyway, and now he's

1558
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:40,880
now his memory lives on when Giuliani goes to a hairstylist.

1559
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:43,520
Make me look like this.

1560
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:45,640
Give me the Al Lewis.

1561
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:48,040
Give me a haircut.

1562
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:54,280
So we'll explore these characters when we watch the film.

1563
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:59,720
My condolences to Sally Shine for her hellish life, according to this unpaid

1564
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:02,400
fandom dot com writer.

1565
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:07,600
But the videos need and then, of course, you go up in the shaft and you see them

1566
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:11,560
all float away and disappear into the fifth dimension.

1567
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:13,480
That's a really if you watch that video,

1568
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:18,400
how the Tower of Terror works that breaks down kind of the schematic of where the

1569
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:23,480
mirrors are, where the Pepper's ghost happens.

1570
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:25,640
I don't think I realized that, you know,

1571
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:29,200
you're looking down this hallway and then it all disappears and becomes stars and

1572
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:34,640
just a floating door and that the full setup there is there are real walls.

1573
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:38,880
It's all actually there, but it's a scrim so that you can fade it down.

1574
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:41,360
And once there's no lighting, you can see right through it.

1575
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:47,080
The characters, your Sally Shines at all are all down below.

1576
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:52,000
Like there's a mirror bouncing from from below your point of view in the shaft.

1577
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:54,640
And then it's a rear projection making the door.

1578
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:59,560
It's like all of these, you know, classic theater tricks all working in tandem.

1579
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:03,600
Yeah, it's crazy how a lot of that stuff, even on newer rides, it's like, oh, yeah,

1580
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,880
these are the old tricks. These are just the old tricks.

1581
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:10,560
Like, and this may be it may be slightly upgraded, but like mostly just the same

1582
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:13,280
fun stuff that always works.

1583
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:16,920
The theory, yeah, the theory is always there.

1584
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:20,800
Scrim stuff, scrim stuff.

1585
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:26,240
I was just going to say the scrim on the not scary farm

1586
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:30,640
scrim at the end of one of the mazes where you'd be walking down like a normal

1587
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:35,080
like hospital hallway and then the lights would flicker and then the scrim would

1588
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:39,240
change and you'd be looking at hell, it would have like the walls you could see

1589
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:43,960
through and it was hell with a giant demon like, yeah, very cool.

1590
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:45,600
Cool as hell. Yeah.

1591
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:46,520
Yeah.

1592
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:48,560
I walked into that.

1593
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:52,760
What have we what are details we haven't talked about?

1594
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:56,080
I got a Sally Shine thing

1595
01:23:56,440 --> 01:24:00,560
because she came up, of course, one of the little Easter eggs in there

1596
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:03,640
kind of connects mentioned elsewhere in the ride.

1597
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:09,040
Sally Shine has a little stuffed Mickey Mouse and that is the like there's hidden

1598
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:12,640
like Easter out the ride. But the thing I I don't know.

1599
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:17,640
I must have seen this before, but not process the implications in the library

1600
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:19,680
where you can find a number of Easter eggs.

1601
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:27,560
There's a piece of sheet music and this was an actual song from the time period.

1602
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:29,800
But the and the full title of the song,

1603
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,360
I'm going to read it in how I think it's supposed to be said.

1604
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:35,360
The sheet music is called what?

1605
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:36,800
No Mickey Mouse.

1606
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,160
What kind of party is this?

1607
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:41,080
What?

1608
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:47,760
Which I mean, that people just used to call songs very long sentences or like

1609
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:51,000
my beloved, I my dearest, that sort of thing.

1610
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:57,040
But the presence of that sheet music of the Tower of Terror, just imagining

1611
01:24:57,240 --> 01:25:02,320
a Hollywood lush walking into this hotel after it had been struck by lightning

1612
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:04,400
going, what kind of party is this?

1613
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:07,960
Like it's such a dark joke.

1614
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:14,960
Is there a way to get our hands on the sheet music and try to do a cover of this

1615
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:17,880
without hearing any actual recorded? Oh, wow.

1616
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:21,680
That's a great idea. Oh, is that possible?

1617
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:23,640
I don't know.

1618
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:27,160
That might require like somebody needs to have photographed that really well.

1619
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:29,760
Yeah, the full lyrics do exist.

1620
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:33,840
I'm back on Disney dot fandom dot com, really the unofficial sponsor of this

1621
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:35,560
episode.

1622
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:39,680
When when Noah planned his famous

1623
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:44,320
I'll try to make up the melody when Noah planned his famous arc, he knew just what

1624
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:50,200
to do. He searched until he found a park and walked off with the zoo with lions,

1625
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:51,760
tigers, monkeys, donkeys.

1626
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:55,440
He sailed the ocean wide and when he lined them up on deck,

1627
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:58,960
was then some cuckoo cried.

1628
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:00,800
What? No Mickey Mouse.

1629
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,720
What kind of a party is this?

1630
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:05,960
Well, that's the official melody.

1631
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:07,800
I think that's the official melody now.

1632
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,000
That's probably it.

1633
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:13,920
Yeah, they call it then later vote for Mickey Mouse.

1634
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:17,040
Let's make him our next president

1635
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:18,400
to a Congress.

1636
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:21,080
He's sure to say meow, meow.

1637
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:24,600
OK, how dry I am.

1638
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:26,800
Have one on me.

1639
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,720
What the fuck is this song talking about?

1640
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:34,400
Mickey Mouse used to tie one off in the 30s a lot more.

1641
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:36,480
Say meow, meow.

1642
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:38,200
Tie one on me.

1643
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:39,960
Meow, meow.

1644
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:42,920
Well, you know, and then he'll cry.

1645
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:44,120
Give me the facts.

1646
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:45,320
Give me my axe.

1647
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:46,600
I'll cut your tax.

1648
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:50,840
He'll show us all what can be done when he's in Washington.

1649
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:55,160
So this is this starts as a song about Noah, the Ark and the Zoo.

1650
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:58,680
And what kind of a party is it without Mickey Mouse and then becomes about how we

1651
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:04,360
have to elect Mickey president, during which they call him Bolsheviki.

1652
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:05,160
I don't know.

1653
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:08,120
The strangest song in history.

1654
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:11,400
I mean, I'll look, I'll elect Mickey as president right now.

1655
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:14,960
It wasn't my first choice in the primary, but

1656
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:17,880
certainly better, certainly better than what we have.

1657
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:23,000
Look, look, Jack, look, me and me and Pluto and the boys

1658
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:25,880
and tune down, dogs.

1659
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:29,360
And that big old Pete was after me and

1660
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:31,520
Clarabel.

1661
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:33,440
I'm trying to think.

1662
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:37,240
There's got to be like a quirkier characters that I'm forgetting here

1663
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:40,360
that I could reference for this joke to be better.

1664
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:43,720
Mortimer, Mortimer,

1665
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:48,640
Fresh Boy Mortimer, M, M dog,

1666
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:50,560
Seabelle.

1667
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:55,240
We used to go down to the old swimming hole,

1668
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:56,560
play with the nickels.

1669
01:27:56,760 --> 01:28:01,840
Donald, Donald, if you don't vote for me, you ain't a duck man.

1670
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:02,960
There. That's it.

1671
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:04,400
That's it.

1672
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:08,160
Oh, God.

1673
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:09,840
Look, we're voting for him.

1674
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:12,840
Don't worry. Yeah, we're doing it just because we make fun of it.

1675
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:13,600
Doesn't mean we're not.

1676
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:15,120
You don't yell at us.

1677
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:16,640
We're voting for Mickey.

1678
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:19,640
We're voting for Mickey, of course.

1679
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:25,880
They also this song then was covered in 1970.

1680
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:31,280
They did a new version of it performed by Phil Harris, the voice of Baloo.

1681
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:36,240
And in that one, they updated it and they put in the line, let's give,

1682
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:41,120
let's give Nixon's house to Mickey Mouse.

1683
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:43,760
Phil Harris in a song

1684
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:49,600
proposes ousting Nixon and putting Mickey Mouse in there, which truly could anyone

1685
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:53,440
have any objection to that in 1970?

1686
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:55,920
How much like atrocity could have been avoided?

1687
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:57,320
What a national.

1688
01:28:57,520 --> 01:28:59,120
I mean, the whole fabric of the country

1689
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:01,280
could be different if we'd all listen to Phil Harris.

1690
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:02,960
Well, that's true.

1691
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:08,640
And also, if you look up Phil Harris's famous album, The South Will Rise Again.

1692
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:10,480
Oh, no.

1693
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:12,480
That's a real.

1694
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:13,520
Sorry.

1695
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:14,600
You told us that.

1696
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:16,280
Sorry to break that to everyone.

1697
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:17,480
Oh, no. All right.

1698
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:19,360
Don't always listen to fill.

1699
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:21,560
Just know we got it.

1700
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:24,520
You said always listen to Phil Harris.

1701
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:26,080
I have a sound bite.

1702
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:27,320
Don't you?

1703
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:33,160
Whatever Lincoln project within our show is

1704
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:37,360
well, they project to oust Scott Gardner from podcast.

1705
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:40,720
The right Mickey project.

1706
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:41,720
The animated.

1707
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:45,360
No, no, no. The animatronic Lincoln project.

1708
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:47,840
Oh, there it is.

1709
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:50,200
That's what it is.

1710
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:52,560
Well, they they spent 10 million

1711
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:55,440
rotoscoping footage of Phil Harris to dab.

1712
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:57,000
So

1713
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:02,120
well, we're all right.

1714
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:03,640
Cover of this song coming.

1715
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:05,000
Cover of this song.

1716
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:06,000
Oh, my God.

1717
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:07,280
What a sidetrack.

1718
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:12,040
There's funny little I mean, they're the most kind of the more infamous like little

1719
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:18,920
dark jokes, the pin board with the letters in the lobby for a long time.

1720
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:22,640
You know, the letters that you just like push in the black felt for a long time.

1721
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:26,320
That said at the very bottom, it said Evil Tower.

1722
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:32,040
And after 9-11, they took out Evil Tower and replaced it.

1723
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:33,080
Really?

1724
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:38,160
I think now it says you are doomed a little more, a little more generic.

1725
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:39,880
But that makes sense.

1726
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:41,640
Yeah. Probably a good call.

1727
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:42,960
Probably a good call.

1728
01:30:43,160 --> 01:30:47,000
Person who realized that the person who was like checking the ride and then went,

1729
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:50,040
oh, oh, oh, yeah.

1730
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:55,640
Well, while I'll this is less dark, I don't have much information about this fact.

1731
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:57,640
But Michael Eisner, maybe you guys do.

1732
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:01,560
Michael Eisner suggested maybe we could make it a real hotel.

1733
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:02,920
Yeah.

1734
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:06,360
Cool. Which I love the idea of that.

1735
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:11,280
But I think logistically, that was a big pain in the ass.

1736
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:12,920
He was right.

1737
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:14,520
That would come to pass.

1738
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:19,120
Hotel built in the theme, but California Adventure, Disneyland, Paris, Tokyo,

1739
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:21,840
Disney, like, well, it did happen.

1740
01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:22,440
Yeah.

1741
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:25,480
And we've talked about this before on the show.

1742
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:28,760
I don't like and Star Wars is doing this, of course.

1743
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:34,800
But the fully themed hotel seems like it's just a money printing machine.

1744
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:38,840
Like a full, like spooky Tower of Terror

1745
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:44,480
hotel would be like sold out before every other hotel if it was themed as well

1746
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:47,200
as like the lobby of Tower of Terror.

1747
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:48,280
Absolutely.

1748
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:50,160
Maybe now they can just do like a suite.

1749
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:54,200
They just put in like one room that's a like really lavish experience,

1750
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:58,040
because I don't think at this point you can fit rooms into that structure.

1751
01:31:58,240 --> 01:31:59,200
No, it'd be too late.

1752
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:00,920
No, it's too late.

1753
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:03,720
They, of course, at least rumor wise,

1754
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:07,840
we're talking about putting like a Tower of Terror bar lounge,

1755
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,560
which is, you know, a fantastic idea.

1756
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:15,840
And I'm shocked that they didn't do it because like, yeah,

1757
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:19,600
all all people, as we've said before, all people want to do is hang out and linger

1758
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:22,360
in these areas and environments longer.

1759
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:24,560
You just want to let you want to last a

1760
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:29,600
little bit longer being in this vibe, being in a vibe of a ride you like.

1761
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:31,960
Yeah, they could get it at the top somehow.

1762
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:35,360
Well, then you have to build a real that doesn't malfunction.

1763
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:37,280
Yes, there would have to be regular.

1764
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:41,440
I mean, the idea that you could stay in a hotel and if you if you stayed at like

1765
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:43,760
the top floor, you'd probably have to pay the most money.

1766
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:48,080
But then you could take the elevator down like you could take the ride down to

1767
01:32:48,280 --> 01:32:52,560
start your day every day would be the greatest thing.

1768
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:56,640
He I looked this up in Eisner's book

1769
01:32:56,840 --> 01:33:01,200
and he did want it to like not only to have a real hotel surrounding it,

1770
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:03,960
but that you the ride would drop into the lobby.

1771
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:06,160
So like where people actually checked in,

1772
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:08,280
people are like landing and screaming.

1773
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:10,840
This was definitely what he wanted.

1774
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:12,080
Great.

1775
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:15,600
He also I don't think we've talked about this on the show.

1776
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:17,360
There's something that he cites a lot.

1777
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:20,040
And in this case, he says, well, it's you know, it's kind of I always try to go

1778
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:23,200
for the craziest idea, kind of like the Mickey Mouse Hotel.

1779
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:27,600
There's a story that he tells as an example of this is the kind of out of the box

1780
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:31,960
thinking I wanted to bring to the Disney company, the area where the animation

1781
01:33:32,160 --> 01:33:35,360
building is now in Burbank, where there's a big sorcerer's hat

1782
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:37,040
that was undeveloped at the time.

1783
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:39,080
And when he got to Disney, he proposed

1784
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:46,840
building a huge hotel that is Mickey Mouse, like it's a giant 200 foot tall Mickey.

1785
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:52,240
And you could live in his arm in his foot.

1786
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:55,240
I mean, I guess in his crotch, probably.

1787
01:33:55,240 --> 01:33:56,360
I mean, it's all on the table.

1788
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:58,600
You could live in his seat.

1789
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:00,160
You can. Yeah.

1790
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:02,960
Can I do you have any seats rooms left?

1791
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:05,240
The seats, the seat room is the non

1792
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:09,560
smoking section or maybe it's the smoking section.

1793
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:10,680
Or it's the end.

1794
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:15,160
Do you want to be how desirable is the seat on what to the general?

1795
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:17,200
Was there windows in this proposal?

1796
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:20,920
Would there be like a window seat room where you could like.

1797
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:24,040
So then Mickey is just like full of that's what I'm getting.

1798
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:27,280
Yeah, it doesn't seem like it seemed like it would be like the Star Wars

1799
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:29,760
Hotel, where it's like there's not really windows.

1800
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:34,960
Maybe there was like screens inside to simulate like cartoon land outside.

1801
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:36,440
Right, right.

1802
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:40,040
Well, you black out the windows and any touches of black.

1803
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:47,200
So like his legs or like around his hand, you put the windows on the black colors.

1804
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:48,520
Huh?

1805
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:49,960
It's so insane.

1806
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:51,560
It's like how it's like Dr.

1807
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:55,640
Evil being in a big statue of Dr. Evil.

1808
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:57,040
Yes, it is.

1809
01:34:57,240 --> 01:34:57,920
Yes.

1810
01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:02,240
It feels like, yeah, it would come to life then it would get like cursed or like

1811
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:07,840
the Ghostbusters would get that plasma and use it to bring Mickey to life.

1812
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:11,720
Like in a Ghostbusters 2 with the Statue of Liberty.

1813
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:12,840
Like that would be.

1814
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:18,480
Well, that's you know, that was done, you know, to to like bring good vibes to New

1815
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:22,360
York and I think good vibes are needed everywhere right now.

1816
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:27,560
And if only if only a 200 foot tall Mickey Mouse could walk around and wave

1817
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:29,200
to everybody. Oh, my God. Yes.

1818
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:30,320
That would do a lot.

1819
01:35:30,520 --> 01:35:31,400
Well, don't fix it.

1820
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:32,200
Jackie Wilson.

1821
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:34,640
Jackie Wilson played.

1822
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:37,360
No, and he could

1823
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:40,000
lift me higher.

1824
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:41,800
He could pick up the old tail of the

1825
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:46,560
pup building, the old big hot dog and eat it.

1826
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:50,320
Yeah, take a big bite out of it.

1827
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:51,880
Oh, that would be great.

1828
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:56,560
That would be the moment that would bring America back together.

1829
01:35:57,360 --> 01:35:59,240
If Newsom's not going to open the parks,

1830
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:04,920
he needs to devote, I'd say, 60 percent of the state's budget to making a giant,

1831
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:07,600
really a Gundam. Yes, that Gundam that they signed.

1832
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:08,480
Yeah.

1833
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:10,560
Yeah, we've seen the tests of that.

1834
01:36:10,760 --> 01:36:12,160
Yes, we need to do that.

1835
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:14,280
But for Mickey. Yeah, I think that's right.

1836
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:17,400
And I want to pay for it with my taxes.

1837
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:20,680
Yeah, I insist.

1838
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:22,640
Yeah. So

1839
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:25,400
whereas I think I've lost my train of thought thinking,

1840
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:30,720
fantasizing about a Mickey, fantasizing about a giant Mickey and being able to

1841
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:33,640
wave at him and live in a seat,

1842
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:36,440
we could talk about

1843
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:38,400
the

1844
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:42,480
what changed in the in the DCA

1845
01:36:42,680 --> 01:36:45,280
or the opening of that.

1846
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:49,560
Not to we know we could circle back to any detail to the other one.

1847
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:53,000
But this is where when I was talking about Geyser Mountain forever ago,

1848
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:57,680
this sort of grew out of some proto Geyser Mountain pitch in the late 80s.

1849
01:36:57,880 --> 01:37:03,480
Apparently, they were Disneyland was getting close to doing Geyser Mountain

1850
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:07,240
rather than the Tower of Terror, like it was we were going to get a totally

1851
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:10,880
different version and it was going to be in that zone that is now Galaxy's Edge,

1852
01:37:11,080 --> 01:37:15,560
as Mike said, and they were maybe honing in on a plan to do that.

1853
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:19,760
And then California Adventure opened and it was a disaster and they needed to bail

1854
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:21,240
it out as quickly as possible.

1855
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:28,040
So this idea was vacated from Frontierland and they I remember how quick it felt.

1856
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:31,920
Like the DCA was only open for a little bit and I was like, all right, screw it.

1857
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:34,160
Tower of Terror. Like take that parking lot out.

1858
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:35,480
It's it's becoming a tower.

1859
01:37:35,680 --> 01:37:37,280
Yeah. Yeah.

1860
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:39,400
It's it's very reminiscent, I feel like,

1861
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:42,640
of the story they tell about pirates in Disney World, where it's like they're

1862
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:46,320
going to build a Western River expedition or whatever.

1863
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:48,320
And then it's like people are mad.

1864
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:51,640
Oh, wait, just throw pirates in and it's going to be less good.

1865
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:54,040
Yeah, it's like the same kind of panic,

1866
01:37:54,240 --> 01:37:59,680
panic move with us, like a less good version of the thing people like.

1867
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:05,240
I heard this other interesting point of view about what makes the the Disneyland

1868
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:11,560
and the Paris ones a little lesser, which is that by the show, the queue,

1869
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:15,520
basically, everything happens out in front of the tower.

1870
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:17,240
And then the tower is,

1871
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:18,880
wait, am I getting this wrong?

1872
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:25,240
Oh, I'm sorry. OK, the fact that the show scenes are in the back in Florida allows

1873
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:30,800
the tower to be the furthest, the closest thing to you, the guest looking up

1874
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,560
at the tower thinking, should I go on this ride or not?

1875
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:35,320
So it kind of seems taller.

1876
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:40,080
You can get closer to the big scary part and it really looms over you,

1877
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:45,160
whereas it's all set back in the California and Paris ones because the queue is up

1878
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:47,000
in the front. Right.

1879
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:50,800
That's all that seems a little obscure, like I don't know how much damage that

1880
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,680
really does, but I guess it's I guess it is true.

1881
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:55,960
It does make the building less imposing.

1882
01:38:56,160 --> 01:39:01,960
Yeah. I mean, the Florida Florida is being set back seemingly like feeling like it's

1883
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:07,600
on a hill, you got to walk up a little bit and immediately it immediately sets the

1884
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:12,840
mood in a much better way than the one did in California, because California just

1885
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:15,400
turned a corner and it's right there.

1886
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:19,840
And they did a better job when they revamped California Venture with the red

1887
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:23,000
car trolley to make it sort of feel period appropriate.

1888
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:25,600
But it's still just like sitting there

1889
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:31,280
and it just doesn't have the magic, especially like at night in Florida.

1890
01:39:31,480 --> 01:39:36,200
When you see it, it's it feels so set back in the way that like Frankenstein's

1891
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:41,760
castle feels or any sort of scary building in a movie or something like it's just so

1892
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:45,480
much better. It just it immediately starts the vibe.

1893
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:50,920
I feel like when you get the Sunset Boulevard ramp up, similar to Radiator

1894
01:39:51,120 --> 01:39:57,120
Springs being set at the end of that whole drag of exactly.

1895
01:39:57,320 --> 01:40:01,280
Yeah, it's like you have like a it's like a cue before the cue a little bit.

1896
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:02,720
So you're really ready to do it.

1897
01:40:02,720 --> 01:40:03,880
What's right, actually, in the right.

1898
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:05,480
I feel like when I was a kid and like,

1899
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:09,440
you don't know what it is at all other than, you know, you drop and it's scary,

1900
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:14,160
like walking up to something makes it feel, I don't know, for whatever reason,

1901
01:40:14,360 --> 01:40:19,960
it just makes it feel more intimidating just the way that that that it's set like

1902
01:40:20,160 --> 01:40:21,360
that.

1903
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:26,600
So, yeah, I mean, they obviously had not much of a choice to really they just were

1904
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:28,760
like, we've got to dump it somewhere.

1905
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:31,040
So let's yeah, I think so.

1906
01:40:31,240 --> 01:40:34,280
And that space made sense and they're tying it all together.

1907
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:37,720
And it's going to end up tying into Marvel, too, even though they've done this

1908
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:41,640
odd kind of out of place re theming of it for now.

1909
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:43,640
The

1910
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:48,120
I guess the was my other point about it.

1911
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:51,400
Oh, I think the other thing

1912
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:55,200
by dropping that fifth dimension thing, the capacity increases a lot.

1913
01:40:55,200 --> 01:40:56,200
Right. Yeah.

1914
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:58,720
Like the least reliable part of the ride is gone.

1915
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:02,080
And there's three drop towers instead of

1916
01:41:02,280 --> 01:41:03,480
wait, just wait.

1917
01:41:03,480 --> 01:41:05,040
No, there's two in Florida. Correct.

1918
01:41:05,240 --> 01:41:07,120
There's two in Florida.

1919
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:08,560
So it's OK.

1920
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:16,080
It's four, four things to get you in the back of the building, four shafts to get

1921
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:18,400
you up to the fifth dimension.

1922
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:22,640
There's two fifth dimensions on top of each other.

1923
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:26,320
Those two go into no.

1924
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:28,000
Wait, go.

1925
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:29,520
It all feeds into one.

1926
01:41:29,720 --> 01:41:32,600
It all it slowly kind of narrows down.

1927
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:35,760
There's crazy blueprints, too, of like.

1928
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:40,840
And so the elevator is going to lead the shaft and go through the lobby, then go

1929
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:45,560
through the boiler like there's crazy blueprints for like they because I think

1930
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:47,080
that's why the lobby is so good.

1931
01:41:47,080 --> 01:41:49,360
Like you said, Eisner wanted it to end in the lobby.

1932
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:50,720
The lobby is so detailed because it

1933
01:41:50,920 --> 01:41:55,360
might have at some point in time be considered to be a show scene.

1934
01:41:57,240 --> 01:41:59,360
You know what it's like? Brackets is what it is.

1935
01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:01,680
Four narrowed down to two.

1936
01:42:01,880 --> 01:42:03,400
Really think of it as brackets.

1937
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:04,360
Yes.

1938
01:42:04,360 --> 01:42:09,800
And then the California, it's three shafts with six different places to enter with two

1939
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,520
levels so that they can load.

1940
01:42:12,600 --> 01:42:16,640
Yeah, you're either up top or up or down the bottom and you can load at either one

1941
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:21,680
of this so they can have a car ready for the tower while the other one's doing.

1942
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:24,720
Right. And there's only this is

1943
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:28,560
I was confused up until like a year or two ago when it was like, yeah, you also

1944
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:32,840
like kind of load into a vehicle on the tower out here.

1945
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:36,800
I didn't I didn't realize that because I one time I go, oh, I see now where like

1946
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:41,120
the mechanism like hooks to pull you forward once you're done with the ride.

1947
01:42:41,320 --> 01:42:45,760
And then you when you push out from the exit, you get loaded into this little box

1948
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:51,320
and that little box, that cube, excuse me, the cube, the cube, the three cubes.

1949
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:54,680
So that cube is always working.

1950
01:42:54,880 --> 01:43:00,280
But the cube changes like it goes up and down to go back and forth between the

1951
01:43:00,280 --> 01:43:02,440
levels. That's the most confusing way I could have said that.

1952
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:04,440
But the cube is always working.

1953
01:43:04,440 --> 01:43:06,160
The cube is always working.

1954
01:43:06,360 --> 01:43:08,600
But the little cars are not always working.

1955
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:10,720
They're alternating.

1956
01:43:10,920 --> 01:43:13,160
Yeah. Yeah.

1957
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:17,600
This is why, look, you listen to the show for the jokes, not for the, you know, you

1958
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:22,040
can watch your detailed explanations on YouTube, but in those, you're probably not

1959
01:43:22,040 --> 01:43:25,920
going to get that joke. You're not going to get the jokes, voices and all that fun stuff.

1960
01:43:26,120 --> 01:43:30,120
The cubes and 100 grand bar references.

1961
01:43:30,760 --> 01:43:32,040
Al Lewis talk.

1962
01:43:32,240 --> 01:43:34,360
No, I've seen fresh baked Disney.

1963
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:37,840
He doesn't just wander into an Al Lewis discussion.

1964
01:43:38,040 --> 01:43:39,360
Come on, fresh baked.

1965
01:43:39,560 --> 01:43:40,640
He's alarmingly on.

1966
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:42,360
Yeah. What is that?

1967
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:43,400
Come on.

1968
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:47,520
So, yeah, cubes, folks, cubes working.

1969
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:49,000
There's some fun tricks.

1970
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:52,000
There's some fun tricks in the California one.

1971
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:54,280
Rooms become star feet like there.

1972
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:56,160
It's not I'm not saying it's not cool,

1973
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:59,400
but if it had come along first and then the Florida one came along,

1974
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:04,320
could you imagine how blown away you would be as opposed to the other way

1975
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:09,280
around where in one summer when one summer California got abbreviated tower

1976
01:44:09,480 --> 01:44:12,720
of terror and abbreviated revenge of the mummy is so funny.

1977
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:13,920
Right.

1978
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:16,000
And dark times, dark time.

1979
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:19,280
And of course, this will save this for the actual mission breakout episode.

1980
01:44:19,480 --> 01:44:26,000
But I California then solved, I feel like solved a problem we didn't know existed

1981
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:33,880
by making the drop sequence more entertaining and a little longer is still, I think.

1982
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:38,440
Yeah, yeah, I think you can't because like basically what I'm saying is like

1983
01:44:38,640 --> 01:44:41,560
after mission breakout, which I know mission breakout is controversial still,

1984
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:43,840
which I don't I'm a big fan.

1985
01:44:44,040 --> 01:44:47,800
It's like my favorite ride other than like Big Thunder at the resort.

1986
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,360
Like I have to admit it.

1987
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:51,000
I go on it almost every time.

1988
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:54,640
If I can go on one ride, it's oftentimes that

1989
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:57,880
I think it's really I think they did a really great job with it.

1990
01:44:58,080 --> 01:45:00,240
But the actual ride itself.

1991
01:45:00,240 --> 01:45:03,760
So when we went in Tokyo's and then we went back to Florida and the actual drop

1992
01:45:03,960 --> 01:45:09,080
sequence basically just happens in the dark with no music and it feels a little

1993
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:11,040
underwhelming, but that's not its fault.

1994
01:45:11,240 --> 01:45:13,120
I don't want to be negative here because

1995
01:45:13,320 --> 01:45:17,520
before I was spoiled with the drop sequence of Guardians of the Galaxy.

1996
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:19,280
There was I didn't think twice.

1997
01:45:19,480 --> 01:45:23,840
I didn't think twice about it, but it is randomized now in Florida.

1998
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:26,360
Yeah, it's still fun.

1999
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:28,840
And then but you get a taste of that at

2000
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:31,840
Guardians, too, because you don't know what song you're going to get.

2001
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:33,880
It kind of changes and the footage changes.

2002
01:45:33,880 --> 01:45:36,960
It almost feels like now that you now that I've seen the Guardians,

2003
01:45:37,160 --> 01:45:41,040
you would want something similar with the Twilight Zone where like you stop,

2004
01:45:41,240 --> 01:45:44,640
you see a weird, creepy scene and you go back up.

2005
01:45:44,640 --> 01:45:46,320
Like there's there's something to do there.

2006
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:48,000
I don't think you can do that, though,

2007
01:45:48,160 --> 01:45:53,240
especially in Florida, because there's nothing there's not much in front of you

2008
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:58,440
in Florida in California, they just repurposed the normal Tower of Terror

2009
01:45:58,640 --> 01:46:03,040
scenes and areas to be with those have the screens and have the one like control

2010
01:46:03,240 --> 01:46:07,240
room part over at the there's no scenes in the tower.

2011
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:09,600
I guess that is the California innovation

2012
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:14,440
that along that which makes enables that guardians experience that the doors open

2013
01:46:14,440 --> 01:46:16,440
and you don't know what you're going to get in Florida.

2014
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:17,880
The doors only open at the top.

2015
01:46:17,880 --> 01:46:20,280
Right. Because, yeah, there's just no other spot.

2016
01:46:20,280 --> 01:46:23,320
I don't think there's any depth to those to that area because you're right

2017
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:28,400
in front of the building versus California where you had there was room

2018
01:46:28,600 --> 01:46:32,720
because that's where the show scenes were in front of the building or in the front

2019
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:36,160
of the building. All the towers bring something to the table and they all like

2020
01:46:36,360 --> 01:46:41,640
elevate each other and raise your expectation for the others, except for France.

2021
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:43,200
You stay in France.

2022
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:46,520
You didn't you didn't bring Jack shit to the table.

2023
01:46:46,720 --> 01:46:48,680
You know what France needed?

2024
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:54,520
I Rod Sterling experience I once had, which was if the car has his archives

2025
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:59,000
because he taught there towards the end of his life and every Halloween they would

2026
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:03,520
do a Twilight Zone marathon and a number of years they would just use the DVDs.

2027
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:09,880
But one year they used original masters like transferred original masters,

2028
01:47:10,040 --> 01:47:14,640
which includes the Chesterfield cigarette commercials.

2029
01:47:14,840 --> 01:47:21,280
So you got to see like a solemn tobacco farmer in his fields and then a full

2030
01:47:21,480 --> 01:47:26,200
marching band pops up from the fields and they play the Chesterfield song.

2031
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:28,640
And then at the very end of the episode,

2032
01:47:28,840 --> 01:47:34,040
Serling says and stay tuned next week and make sure to while you're watching,

2033
01:47:34,040 --> 01:47:41,600
enjoy a delicious Chesterfield cigarette, 21 kinds of tobacco for 21 wonderful smokes.

2034
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:45,920
And I have tried to find these commercials for years to no avail.

2035
01:47:46,120 --> 01:47:50,520
But it is so funny that and Sterling, like in a lot of his intros,

2036
01:47:50,720 --> 01:47:55,200
like the intro of Nick of Time, he's sitting in a diner booth smoking a cigarette

2037
01:47:55,400 --> 01:48:01,800
on camera. So you would plus up France by giving a cigarette to every rider of the ride.

2038
01:48:01,960 --> 01:48:04,840
They love cigarettes in France.

2039
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:09,840
And so I think just put it in there because, you know, they oh, that's the other.

2040
01:48:09,880 --> 01:48:13,800
That is one because I was wondering what do the French like the Twilight Zone.

2041
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:19,320
And there's that episode, the occurrence at the Al Creek.

2042
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:20,760
What's the full name?

2043
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:25,560
An occurrence at Al Creek, an adaptation of an Ambrose beer story.

2044
01:48:25,560 --> 01:48:29,360
It was a short film that won the best short at Cannes and the Academy Awards.

2045
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:33,520
And the Twilight Zone people just licensed it for the Twilight Zone.

2046
01:48:33,720 --> 01:48:35,800
And it is really creepy.

2047
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:39,320
So there was a French connection to the Twilight Zone.

2048
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:40,640
Interesting.

2049
01:48:40,840 --> 01:48:45,680
Did anyone watch the Kirk Cameron special?

2050
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:48,720
Jason? Yes, yes, I have.

2051
01:48:48,920 --> 01:48:50,640
Do we have another hour?

2052
01:48:50,640 --> 01:48:52,680
No, I know we did some of the highlights.

2053
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:57,360
So they basically like the first part of it is like

2054
01:48:57,560 --> 01:49:03,000
K Fabe wrestling term for like in universe, like it's a spooky hotel.

2055
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:05,760
And then like the second half is

2056
01:49:05,960 --> 01:49:11,440
imagineering talk and like the actual creation of it.

2057
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:12,840
And

2058
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:16,040
there's a couple of things I really I like about it.

2059
01:49:16,240 --> 01:49:20,480
He he basically like when they're doing the transition, he like explains the

2060
01:49:20,680 --> 01:49:24,520
legend of the Tower of Terror and then to transition out.

2061
01:49:24,680 --> 01:49:30,960
He explains that Disney built a recreation of the hotel.

2062
01:49:32,040 --> 01:49:35,480
So like it's like try they were like, how do we square this circle?

2063
01:49:35,480 --> 01:49:37,920
It's real. But why would it be in a theme park?

2064
01:49:38,120 --> 01:49:42,000
So they're like, and he's like, so Disney built a real version.

2065
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:46,840
And it's like, there's no real need for what for this piece of exposition.

2066
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:48,480
And then they go into and then I think

2067
01:49:48,680 --> 01:49:52,320
pretty quickly we get a little Eisner blurb.

2068
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:55,800
And he basically just he's excited about it.

2069
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:57,720
He doesn't say anything particularly funny.

2070
01:49:57,920 --> 01:50:02,800
But what I like about it is that all of the lower thirds, anyone who's like name

2071
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:06,560
pops up on the bottom of the screen, it gets introduced with a piece of like

2072
01:50:06,760 --> 01:50:09,120
lightning shooting at it.

2073
01:50:09,400 --> 01:50:11,040
So it's like it's like it's like crack.

2074
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:13,520
And then it like Michael Eisner appears on the bottom.

2075
01:50:13,720 --> 01:50:15,280
And it's the same with like Marty Sclar.

2076
01:50:15,480 --> 01:50:18,880
It's like Marty Sclar on the bottom.

2077
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:21,320
And they're like, I love that.

2078
01:50:21,480 --> 01:50:22,880
Very jumbo shrine.

2079
01:50:23,080 --> 01:50:24,000
That's real stupid.

2080
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:27,200
Yes, it's not as aggressive, probably as the noise I'm making.

2081
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:30,840
But there's an absolute there's a noise and a lightning strike.

2082
01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:36,080
And then Michael Eisner appears on the bottom of the screen, which is exciting.

2083
01:50:36,280 --> 01:50:43,040
Kirk Cameron is like 50 pounds soaking wet in that he is like so tiny and he's like

2084
01:50:43,240 --> 01:50:48,240
wearing like the stop making sense suit and none of his

2085
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:49,880
suits fit.

2086
01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:54,360
And they have written him the most flowery like narration dialogue.

2087
01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:55,880
He's not nailing any of it.

2088
01:50:56,080 --> 01:50:57,960
He looks like such a dweeb.

2089
01:50:58,160 --> 01:51:00,000
Like I wanted to squirrely him.

2090
01:51:00,200 --> 01:51:03,280
They're making him do like old timey dialogue.

2091
01:51:03,480 --> 01:51:06,840
And he's doing he's doing his best.

2092
01:51:07,040 --> 01:51:09,240
They should have had Robert Evans.

2093
01:51:09,240 --> 01:51:12,200
They should have just hired Robert Evans to do it.

2094
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:14,400
Or even like a Jerry Orbach type.

2095
01:51:14,600 --> 01:51:17,560
They should have had an old man do it.

2096
01:51:17,720 --> 01:51:19,520
But yeah, Kirk Hammons are real dweeb.

2097
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:23,880
And of course, now he thinks, you know, the hotel is haunted by demons.

2098
01:51:24,080 --> 01:51:27,040
Now he thinks the real tower of terror is

2099
01:51:27,240 --> 01:51:32,160
the DNC headquarters where the Democrats do their devil worship.

2100
01:51:32,360 --> 01:51:36,120
Yeah, well, he likes the story of the people in the elevator just suddenly

2101
01:51:36,120 --> 01:51:38,440
disappearing because he thinks it's kind of like the rap.

2102
01:51:38,440 --> 01:51:43,680
Yeah, they were living in centers, centers, kissing actors who aren't your wife.

2103
01:51:43,880 --> 01:51:47,240
You can't kiss sectors who aren't your wife.

2104
01:51:47,480 --> 01:51:49,480
Mike, there is a moment in that, Mike,

2105
01:51:49,680 --> 01:51:57,680
did you catch the moment in the special with the one Imagineer talking about drawings?

2106
01:51:57,880 --> 01:51:59,400
I probably watch it, but I'm not sure

2107
01:51:59,600 --> 01:52:01,560
what you're which part you're talking about off.

2108
01:52:01,760 --> 01:52:04,280
OK, they interview an Imagineer.

2109
01:52:04,480 --> 01:52:09,440
I forget his name, but he's talking about being in meetings and he's working like

2110
01:52:09,640 --> 01:52:11,480
in the meetings, he's like always doodling.

2111
01:52:11,680 --> 01:52:15,560
And he said a word that I'm like, oh, that might be a new show word.

2112
01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:20,680
He says, I'm sitting with a sketch pad making roughies.

2113
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:24,680
I did not pick up the roughies making roughies.

2114
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:28,160
I rewatch it like five times.

2115
01:52:28,360 --> 01:52:29,240
I had to hear it.

2116
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:30,640
Make sure I heard it right.

2117
01:52:30,640 --> 01:52:32,840
Make sure I heard him say making roughies.

2118
01:52:33,040 --> 01:52:35,400
I had never heard roughies before.

2119
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:36,280
That's like that.

2120
01:52:36,280 --> 01:52:38,960
I feel like that's something you might have said as a child, like you when you

2121
01:52:39,160 --> 01:52:43,320
were feeling rammy and then you would make roughies after that.

2122
01:52:43,560 --> 01:52:45,680
You tumbled around too much on the playground.

2123
01:52:45,880 --> 01:52:47,800
You were making roughies.

2124
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:49,360
You too. You and your brother.

2125
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:51,760
Stop making roughies.

2126
01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:54,480
Wow, I did not catch.

2127
01:52:54,680 --> 01:52:57,000
Yeah, we it's it's a new show word.

2128
01:52:57,200 --> 01:52:58,880
We love roughies.

2129
01:52:59,080 --> 01:53:00,120
Send us your rough.

2130
01:53:00,320 --> 01:53:05,200
If you have your if you have any access to exclusive Imagineering roughies,

2131
01:53:05,400 --> 01:53:07,400
we want to see them.

2132
01:53:07,600 --> 01:53:10,680
We'll pay top dollar for your roughies.

2133
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:12,400
And

2134
01:53:12,600 --> 01:53:14,600
listen to that podcast,

2135
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:18,240
Bind the Paywall with Tony Baxter, because he talks a lot about his roughies.

2136
01:53:18,440 --> 01:53:23,200
Cash for roughies, call one eight hundred cash for roughies.

2137
01:53:23,960 --> 01:53:24,960
Wow, roughies.

2138
01:53:25,160 --> 01:53:29,240
Is that is that just like a cute thing that guy said or is that actually a term?

2139
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:30,640
I think it's just a thing.

2140
01:53:30,840 --> 01:53:34,200
He was he met like rough sketches, rough doodles and stuff.

2141
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:36,680
But roughly I never heard roughies before.

2142
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:37,160
Wow.

2143
01:53:37,160 --> 01:53:39,160
Maybe it was something they said in the office.

2144
01:53:39,200 --> 01:53:43,840
But it just it just it's I'll never forget roughies now.

2145
01:53:44,040 --> 01:53:46,880
Yeah, no, it's a very memorable way to say it.

2146
01:53:47,080 --> 01:53:48,400
Well, I'm saying it now.

2147
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:50,000
It's we're all saying roughies.

2148
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:53,200
They're all saying we're all saying you're hearing it more and more.

2149
01:53:53,400 --> 01:53:54,800
You're hearing it.

2150
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:00,040
Uh, I had I had one.

2151
01:54:00,240 --> 01:54:05,120
Oh, we actually as we talk about sitcom stars going into this attraction,

2152
01:54:05,320 --> 01:54:09,000
I think it's come up before, but I just want to reiterate, I find it very bizarre.

2153
01:54:09,200 --> 01:54:11,960
That both Step by Step and Family Matters

2154
01:54:12,160 --> 01:54:16,200
did Disney World episodes, they where they went to the Tower of Terror.

2155
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:20,480
And it is the same right operator with the same blocking.

2156
01:54:20,680 --> 01:54:23,920
It is like like two characters.

2157
01:54:24,120 --> 01:54:25,720
Every the

2158
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:27,960
elevator is already full, the car is full.

2159
01:54:28,040 --> 01:54:29,920
And then two characters stop at the door,

2160
01:54:30,120 --> 01:54:35,480
kind of address whatever plot situation is going on while a creepy bellhop kind of

2161
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:36,320
stares at them.

2162
01:54:36,520 --> 01:54:39,800
And then he starts the ride and like, see you on the other side.

2163
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,240
And it's the same guy.

2164
01:54:42,440 --> 01:54:43,840
And that's really weird.

2165
01:54:44,040 --> 01:54:47,320
But then on top of that, then I was I found both of these on Hulu.

2166
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:48,920
And I rewatched them.

2167
01:54:49,120 --> 01:54:54,000
The episodes are both called We're Going to Disney World.

2168
01:54:54,200 --> 01:54:58,360
They have the scenes happen in the middle of part two, where they were both

2169
01:54:58,560 --> 01:55:03,800
in the middle of a two parter and they aired two days apart from each other.

2170
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:04,640
Wow.

2171
01:55:04,680 --> 01:55:08,440
So if you were a big watcher of both of these shows, as I was, you got to see the

2172
01:55:08,640 --> 01:55:11,840
same scene at the Tower of Terror twice in a week.

2173
01:55:12,040 --> 01:55:12,480
Wow.

2174
01:55:12,680 --> 01:55:13,840
That's so funny.

2175
01:55:14,040 --> 01:55:17,360
I guess they maybe shoot it on the same day.

2176
01:55:18,280 --> 01:55:21,800
Yeah, maybe the same next like just double back to back, maybe next like one day.

2177
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:23,120
Next next day.

2178
01:55:23,320 --> 01:55:27,240
That's like filming the you film the American version and the Japanese version

2179
01:55:27,240 --> 01:55:28,840
immediately. Well, we got the set here.

2180
01:55:29,040 --> 01:55:29,960
The camera set up. Right.

2181
01:55:30,160 --> 01:55:32,000
Let's just knock them out.

2182
01:55:32,200 --> 01:55:33,920
And that's funny.

2183
01:55:34,120 --> 01:55:36,000
Yeah, yeah.

2184
01:55:36,200 --> 01:55:40,360
You know, but you know what I like to talk about is is the exit.

2185
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:44,320
When you when you come down in the Florida Tower of Terror, I forgot about this.

2186
01:55:44,520 --> 01:55:46,160
You come down in a little room with it,

2187
01:55:46,360 --> 01:55:50,240
with a little screen with the kind of famous Twilight Zone, like what do you call

2188
01:55:50,440 --> 01:55:53,440
it, a spiral or something with the black and white

2189
01:55:53,640 --> 01:55:55,280
and the music playing.

2190
01:55:55,480 --> 01:55:59,240
And you're like, you don't end up in the same spot you started and which is very

2191
01:55:59,240 --> 01:56:00,520
cool.

2192
01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:03,960
And there's a lot of little trinkets and stuff in that little.

2193
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:05,240
It feels like you just got dumped in a

2194
01:56:05,440 --> 01:56:09,120
little room and then your car spins around to like gets you to the exit.

2195
01:56:09,320 --> 01:56:15,080
And I didn't realize it until I went on it a couple of years ago that Caesar,

2196
01:56:15,280 --> 01:56:21,200
the ventriloquist dummy from one of the famous episodes called Caesar and me, who,

2197
01:56:21,400 --> 01:56:25,280
of course, the dummy is real and the man is fake is the big revelation.

2198
01:56:25,480 --> 01:56:27,800
I'm sorry. Spoiler alert.

2199
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:31,720
But Caesar is sitting there in the room

2200
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:35,440
and I got so excited to see him and I'm I like Twilight Zone.

2201
01:56:35,560 --> 01:56:37,360
I'm I didn't know his name was Caesar.

2202
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:39,800
I'm just trying to say, like, I'm not like, oh, my God, it's Caesar.

2203
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:42,080
But I said, oh, my God, it's the dummy.

2204
01:56:42,280 --> 01:56:45,920
And I was very excited because I am a big dummy.

2205
01:56:46,120 --> 01:56:47,720
I'm a big dummy fan.

2206
01:56:47,920 --> 01:56:51,800
Yeah, there's two dummy episodes of Twilight Zone.

2207
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:56,360
Yes, there's another dummy one, too, where I think that dummy is meaner.

2208
01:56:56,520 --> 01:57:01,960
OK, maybe I'm actually confusing my dummy episodes.

2209
01:57:02,160 --> 01:57:03,960
It is Caesar in the right.

2210
01:57:03,960 --> 01:57:05,080
It is Caesar for sure on the right.

2211
01:57:05,080 --> 01:57:05,720
But I can't remember.

2212
01:57:05,720 --> 01:57:09,000
Maybe I'm thinking of mixing up my dummy and I apologize, folks.

2213
01:57:09,200 --> 01:57:15,200
I'm just a big fan of dummies, not necessarily the Twilight Zone episodes.

2214
01:57:15,400 --> 01:57:16,840
But I'm right.

2215
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:20,480
So any Night of the Living Dummy Goosebumps book.

2216
01:57:20,680 --> 01:57:22,400
Big fan of that. Yeah.

2217
01:57:22,600 --> 01:57:25,800
Have you ever seen the Mystery Science Theater movie Devil Doll?

2218
01:57:25,960 --> 01:57:30,280
I have not with a creepy

2219
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:33,520
the dummy's name is Hugo, I believe.

2220
01:57:33,720 --> 01:57:35,360
And there's something that

2221
01:57:35,560 --> 01:57:40,200
my wife and I say every time, like, like very often when we're drinking wine,

2222
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:45,680
which is that which is very often would end the that is that the you know,

2223
01:57:45,880 --> 01:57:50,560
that is also kind of a possessed dummy and he wants to have wine.

2224
01:57:50,760 --> 01:57:54,360
And then the ventriloquist says, but you can't have wine, Hugo.

2225
01:57:54,400 --> 01:57:55,640
You're just a dummy.

2226
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:57,720
Like, I want wine.

2227
01:57:57,920 --> 01:57:59,480
I know what wine is.

2228
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:01,280
Give me some.

2229
01:58:01,480 --> 01:58:07,880
We when we decide we're going to have wine, we really often say, I know what wine is.

2230
01:58:08,080 --> 01:58:10,760
Wow. So you're you're dummy fans, too.

2231
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:12,040
I guess I am, too. Yeah.

2232
01:58:12,240 --> 01:58:15,240
Well, you're a you're a Caesar guy.

2233
01:58:15,440 --> 01:58:16,760
I'm who are you guys?

2234
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:19,960
Who are your dummies? I'm a I'm a Hugo guy.

2235
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:22,440
Jason, who's your favorite dummy?

2236
01:58:22,600 --> 01:58:25,480
Oh, well, I

2237
01:58:25,680 --> 01:58:28,920
from Batman, from Batman, the animated series.

2238
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:30,920
Is it Scarface? Is that his name?

2239
01:58:31,120 --> 01:58:34,360
Oh, Jason, are you talking about the toy I have right here?

2240
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:35,560
Yes, that's right.

2241
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:37,920
Yes. The ventriloquist and his dummy.

2242
01:58:38,120 --> 01:58:39,480
Scarface, of course.

2243
01:58:39,680 --> 01:58:42,160
Yeah. This is one of the greatest toys ever, by the way.

2244
01:58:42,360 --> 01:58:43,880
That is great. Yeah.

2245
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:48,200
It's kind of funny that we all like dummies considering that we are freaked out

2246
01:58:48,200 --> 01:58:53,360
by things and I'm so scared of like creepy baby.

2247
01:58:53,360 --> 01:58:53,840
Right.

2248
01:58:54,040 --> 01:58:57,320
Things. Maybe I just maybe I wouldn't like a baby dummy.

2249
01:58:57,520 --> 01:58:58,640
Maybe that's the line.

2250
01:58:58,640 --> 01:59:00,240
Is there such a thing in media?

2251
01:59:00,240 --> 01:59:03,600
Oh, my God, there has to be a baby dummy that would scare me.

2252
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:04,480
That's a good question.

2253
01:59:04,680 --> 01:59:07,760
I mean, do you think Caesar is cute from the Twilight Zone?

2254
01:59:07,960 --> 01:59:09,520
That's a question I have.

2255
01:59:09,720 --> 01:59:13,440
I think we like these dummies, but I don't think any of us are calling me cute.

2256
01:59:13,640 --> 01:59:15,320
Let me send a photo to everyone.

2257
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:17,600
I like Hugo. I don't think Hugo is cute.

2258
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:18,440
OK, here we go.

2259
01:59:18,640 --> 01:59:19,320
I mean, I don't care.

2260
01:59:19,320 --> 01:59:20,640
We go just so we're all on the same page.

2261
01:59:20,840 --> 01:59:23,080
Here's a picture of Caesar.

2262
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:25,320
You're I texted it to both of you.

2263
01:59:25,520 --> 01:59:30,160
Yeah. And then officially is so cute.

2264
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:35,360
Look, I think I'm sorry, but like a big,

2265
01:59:35,560 --> 01:59:39,040
thick eyebrows are just kind of kind of get in the way of cute.

2266
01:59:39,240 --> 01:59:41,760
You can look good or handsome or sharp.

2267
01:59:41,960 --> 01:59:44,280
I don't know that I would call Caesar cute, though.

2268
01:59:44,480 --> 01:59:45,680
No, Jason. Yes.

2269
01:59:45,880 --> 01:59:46,960
You think yes.

2270
01:59:47,080 --> 01:59:47,960
I don't know.

2271
01:59:48,160 --> 01:59:51,480
I like I like those cheek the cheekbones with the eyebrows.

2272
01:59:51,680 --> 01:59:55,280
I think are cute and the Stoge got a big Stoge.

2273
01:59:55,480 --> 01:59:57,160
This is a semantics issue.

2274
01:59:57,360 --> 01:59:59,720
I think he looks cool.

2275
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:00,800
I like him.

2276
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:02,840
You like to be.

2277
02:00:03,040 --> 02:00:04,080
I think he's cool.

2278
02:00:04,280 --> 02:00:05,760
Not cute. You guys are crazy.

2279
02:00:05,960 --> 02:00:07,960
I didn't know the Twilight Zone dummies.

2280
02:00:08,160 --> 02:00:09,840
I didn't rule yet.

2281
02:00:10,040 --> 02:00:12,040
I have not ruled.

2282
02:00:12,240 --> 02:00:16,640
I have just posed the question and I'm just listening to all

2283
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:19,160
the different things I'm going to rule.

2284
02:00:19,360 --> 02:00:21,320
I'm going to say,

2285
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,200
I think he looks cool.

2286
02:00:24,400 --> 02:00:25,960
Yes, exactly.

2287
02:00:26,160 --> 02:00:26,880
He's cool.

2288
02:00:27,080 --> 02:00:29,080
Not cute. It's very clear.

2289
02:00:29,280 --> 02:00:32,160
I'm glad sometimes there's sanity on these cuteness.

2290
02:00:32,360 --> 02:00:34,960
I just think I'm look, I'm not troll.

2291
02:00:35,160 --> 02:00:36,840
I'm being fair and balanced.

2292
02:00:37,040 --> 02:00:40,440
That's a phrase I came up with.

2293
02:00:40,640 --> 02:00:43,760
Well, then we'd like to know more.

2294
02:00:43,880 --> 02:00:48,080
Obviously, I love when creatures are put into my Twitter feed.

2295
02:00:48,280 --> 02:00:51,880
So if you think you have a dummy that's cute,

2296
02:00:52,080 --> 02:00:55,840
if you can think of a baby dummy, and I'm not talking puppet,

2297
02:00:56,040 --> 02:00:57,000
there's baby puppets.

2298
02:00:57,200 --> 02:01:00,360
Yeah, it has to be a ventriloquist dummy.

2299
02:01:00,560 --> 02:01:01,440
Yeah.

2300
02:01:01,640 --> 02:01:02,440
A baby.

2301
02:01:02,640 --> 02:01:07,360
Do you think that there's a ventriloquist equivalent of baby Grinch or baby?

2302
02:01:07,560 --> 02:01:10,520
I mean, if I look up baby dummy.

2303
02:01:10,640 --> 02:01:14,920
Well, what about that baby Navi that we've been bombarded with that everyone's

2304
02:01:15,120 --> 02:01:20,120
Carly and our various members of our Facebook group are like, I blame you for

2305
02:01:20,320 --> 02:01:24,880
this, they're getting the Etsy ad for this Navi baby.

2306
02:01:25,080 --> 02:01:26,840
Like those

2307
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:33,560
multi hundred dollar doll babies you can adopt that like crazy people.

2308
02:01:33,760 --> 02:01:36,040
Do you think that's cute?

2309
02:01:36,240 --> 02:01:38,080
No, no, no, I hate the I hate that.

2310
02:01:38,280 --> 02:01:39,640
Absolutely.

2311
02:01:39,800 --> 02:01:45,800
And as I looked up baby ventriloquist dummy, there's just I'm seeing like a real

2312
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:51,520
child's Halloween costume where the lines are drawn on his chin and he's got the rouge.

2313
02:01:51,720 --> 02:01:52,760
This I hate.

2314
02:01:52,960 --> 02:01:55,640
I very much make the rules clear.

2315
02:01:55,840 --> 02:01:58,040
Well, I do like some ventriloquist dummies.

2316
02:01:58,240 --> 02:02:01,920
A real child as a ventriloquist dummy is not cute.

2317
02:02:02,120 --> 02:02:03,000
This is bad.

2318
02:02:03,200 --> 02:02:08,200
No, no, I will not be making my baby Halloween's coming up.

2319
02:02:08,360 --> 02:02:10,880
No, no, no, no, he's going to be truffles.

2320
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:11,720
He's truffles. All right.

2321
02:02:11,720 --> 02:02:12,640
That is cute. All right.

2322
02:02:12,640 --> 02:02:17,040
But next year, yeah, I'm seeing that a gentleman who's a ventriloquist named Paul

2323
02:02:17,240 --> 02:02:21,600
Zerdin has some sort of baby dummy that he uses.

2324
02:02:21,600 --> 02:02:23,040
I don't know anything about the act.

2325
02:02:23,240 --> 02:02:28,120
I just see a thumbnail that he is working a baby puppet.

2326
02:02:28,320 --> 02:02:30,920
So we'll have to look into that.

2327
02:02:31,120 --> 02:02:34,600
See what we think of Paul Zerdin.

2328
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:35,800
You know, I'm watching it.

2329
02:02:35,800 --> 02:02:36,960
It's neither here nor there.

2330
02:02:36,960 --> 02:02:41,520
It's not, you know, he actually really this this so-called baby could all be

2331
02:02:41,720 --> 02:02:45,080
just as easy as a 95 year old man.

2332
02:02:45,280 --> 02:02:47,960
So it's

2333
02:02:48,600 --> 02:02:51,680
I don't know. I think I think it doesn't qualify.

2334
02:02:51,880 --> 02:02:53,640
Oh, and then he later read in the same video.

2335
02:02:53,840 --> 02:02:56,440
He does bring up an old man immediately.

2336
02:02:56,640 --> 02:02:58,400
OK, all right.

2337
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
I just think I think also like in this,

2338
02:03:01,200 --> 02:03:03,400
again, we've been talking too long here.

2339
02:03:03,600 --> 02:03:05,480
I do love old dolls.

2340
02:03:05,640 --> 02:03:09,120
I I I'm fascinated with

2341
02:03:09,320 --> 02:03:11,680
I don't know. I'm not going to go with you on that.

2342
02:03:11,880 --> 02:03:15,960
Like I'm fascinated by, of course, Robert, the evil doll.

2343
02:03:16,160 --> 02:03:17,360
Well, sure.

2344
02:03:17,560 --> 02:03:18,920
Who is terrifying.

2345
02:03:19,120 --> 02:03:22,000
I'm not going to I'm not going to tell you I think Robert is cute,

2346
02:03:22,200 --> 02:03:24,120
though I do feel bad for Robert.

2347
02:03:24,320 --> 02:03:28,200
You know, if you don't know, this is Robert and you're he's and he's

2348
02:03:28,400 --> 02:03:33,000
like the basis sort of for like the Chucky legend, like the inspiration for like

2349
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:34,600
haunted dolls.

2350
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:36,080
I see.

2351
02:03:36,280 --> 02:03:39,320
And I well, what's an old doll that you think is cute?

2352
02:03:39,440 --> 02:03:41,200
Well, I just said I'm a fan of old.

2353
02:03:41,200 --> 02:03:43,240
I didn't say I think all the old dolls are cute.

2354
02:03:43,440 --> 02:03:47,600
I'm just saying if it's an old doll, I like it.

2355
02:03:48,480 --> 02:03:53,040
Scott, are you going to dress your child like we all I'm assuming we're

2356
02:03:53,240 --> 02:03:57,520
dressed for picture day in school, like tiny little dolls like boys and girls

2357
02:03:57,720 --> 02:04:01,720
alike dress like tiny, fancy little dolls, which was very popular in the 90s.

2358
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:06,720
I am there's a big there's a picture of me in a full sailor suit as a child.

2359
02:04:06,920 --> 02:04:08,400
Yeah.

2360
02:04:09,320 --> 02:04:10,960
Of course, there is.

2361
02:04:11,160 --> 02:04:15,560
I don't know if I have a hat, but the rest of it is the sailor suit.

2362
02:04:16,160 --> 02:04:19,000
And Jason, that's just what he wears to a party.

2363
02:04:19,200 --> 02:04:23,160
Well, it's oh, yeah, especially when it's Fleet Week.

2364
02:04:25,320 --> 02:04:27,360
All aboard must produce this photo.

2365
02:04:27,360 --> 02:04:29,200
Yeah, I find the sailor suit photo.

2366
02:04:29,200 --> 02:04:32,400
Jason, do you have to have a sailor suit photo?

2367
02:04:32,600 --> 02:04:34,360
I don't know about sailors.

2368
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:39,760
I feel like I had an unseemly number of turtlenecks as a boy like Robert.

2369
02:04:39,960 --> 02:04:43,040
Like a young Robert Evans, like a young Robert Evans.

2370
02:04:43,240 --> 02:04:46,240
Yeah, turtlenecks and sweaters.

2371
02:04:46,440 --> 02:04:47,640
I did find.

2372
02:04:47,840 --> 02:04:50,280
Well, you guys like this.

2373
02:04:50,480 --> 02:04:53,600
And I'm assuming it was just written

2374
02:04:53,800 --> 02:04:57,240
because it's clearly my mother's handwriting, a letter to my grandparents

2375
02:04:57,280 --> 02:04:59,000
dated September 1988.

2376
02:04:59,200 --> 02:05:03,360
I came across this the other day, written as if I had written it.

2377
02:05:03,560 --> 02:05:05,000
What?

2378
02:05:05,200 --> 02:05:09,200
It is like I finally got my haircut and I kicked and screamed.

2379
02:05:09,200 --> 02:05:11,000
But if I'm a good boy, I'll get a toy,

2380
02:05:11,200 --> 02:05:13,440
a little toy, a Kmart and get to ride a ride.

2381
02:05:13,640 --> 02:05:20,480
So the the keystone for the show was implanted in my brain a lot longer ago

2382
02:05:20,680 --> 02:05:22,640
than I thought. Wow.

2383
02:05:22,840 --> 02:05:24,360
I'm being ruffy.

2384
02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:26,640
But yeah.

2385
02:05:26,800 --> 02:05:28,000
Wait, what's the other phrase?

2386
02:05:28,200 --> 02:05:29,360
Ramy.

2387
02:05:29,560 --> 02:05:35,440
I'm being Ramy and I got into ruffies, but I but I got a little doll anyway.

2388
02:05:35,640 --> 02:05:39,960
I got a little an old doll, a little old doll, a little old doll.

2389
02:05:40,160 --> 02:05:43,120
And we're going to be dressed the same

2390
02:05:43,320 --> 02:05:47,440
two sailor suits, same size, please.

2391
02:05:47,640 --> 02:05:52,520
Child Jason, a little older child, Jason and current Jason would very much have

2392
02:05:52,560 --> 02:05:57,720
both enjoyed the Henry Bemis action figure that is very hard to find from the

2393
02:05:57,720 --> 02:06:02,240
Twilight Zone. Henry Bemis, the Burgess Meredith character from time enough at last.

2394
02:06:02,440 --> 02:06:04,120
They have these toys now.

2395
02:06:04,320 --> 02:06:06,800
I know they're so hard to track down.

2396
02:06:06,880 --> 02:06:08,000
Yeah, they're very expensive.

2397
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:09,560
If you do find them, they always have them.

2398
02:06:09,760 --> 02:06:12,320
I don't want a house full of Twilight Zone toys.

2399
02:06:12,520 --> 02:06:15,360
This is a recipe for them all to come to life and bother me.

2400
02:06:15,560 --> 02:06:17,640
What about like a full size Caesar, though?

2401
02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:21,680
You could just sit overlooking the crib.

2402
02:06:23,480 --> 02:06:24,720
Hi.

2403
02:06:24,920 --> 02:06:26,640
Hey, you wake.

2404
02:06:26,840 --> 02:06:29,000
Wake up. Hey,

2405
02:06:29,200 --> 02:06:31,560
get up. Rise and shine.

2406
02:06:31,760 --> 02:06:33,560
The day's always been.

2407
02:06:33,760 --> 02:06:35,360
Have a cigar with me, buddy.

2408
02:06:35,560 --> 02:06:39,080
They really in the gift shop, they should sell that.

2409
02:06:39,280 --> 02:06:44,880
Oddly, I think I would dress my baby as Caesar.

2410
02:06:45,080 --> 02:06:50,120
I don't know the safety level of prosthetic eyebrows for infants,

2411
02:06:50,280 --> 02:06:55,160
but you could if I discover that any are safe, I'll consider you do like a headband

2412
02:06:55,360 --> 02:06:57,560
with the eyebrows attached.

2413
02:06:57,760 --> 02:06:58,800
Oh, that's not a penny.

2414
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:00,760
Yes. And the rest is skin colored.

2415
02:07:00,960 --> 02:07:03,080
Yeah, that would be good.

2416
02:07:03,280 --> 02:07:04,440
And then like you could work on that.

2417
02:07:04,640 --> 02:07:06,360
I'll find this.

2418
02:07:06,640 --> 02:07:11,120
I was going to say, do you have a could you find a bottle that looks like a big cigar?

2419
02:07:12,760 --> 02:07:14,640
Give me another hit of that

2420
02:07:14,840 --> 02:07:20,000
little extremer smoke coming out right like a very thin bottle that looks like a

2421
02:07:20,200 --> 02:07:22,440
cigar that you'd put in.

2422
02:07:22,640 --> 02:07:23,680
This ain't bad.

2423
02:07:23,880 --> 02:07:24,480
That's good.

2424
02:07:24,680 --> 02:07:30,400
I think Disney really blew it not having these items available in the gift shop

2425
02:07:30,600 --> 02:07:31,640
for the Tower of Terror. Right.

2426
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:33,800
I want our Twilight Zone branding.

2427
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:41,320
We want our cigar bottle disguises and eyebrow straps for babies.

2428
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:46,440
Oh, of course, I have I guess I should mention that I have the Terry Cloth

2429
02:07:46,640 --> 02:07:48,160
Hollywood Tower Hotel Bathrobe.

2430
02:07:48,360 --> 02:07:49,800
Mm hmm.

2431
02:07:51,160 --> 02:07:51,960
And it's great.

2432
02:07:52,160 --> 02:07:53,160
It's you wear it.

2433
02:07:53,360 --> 02:07:54,360
It's very practical.

2434
02:07:54,560 --> 02:07:55,720
Oh, yeah. I still use it.

2435
02:07:55,920 --> 02:07:57,000
Yeah. It's hanging on the door.

2436
02:07:57,200 --> 02:08:02,400
We're in overtime here, but you you're a bathrobe guy.

2437
02:08:02,600 --> 02:08:03,440
I'm a bathrobe guy.

2438
02:08:03,640 --> 02:08:04,800
Yeah.

2439
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,360
I love to be one.

2440
02:08:07,560 --> 02:08:08,280
I have one.

2441
02:08:08,480 --> 02:08:10,400
I just never I never do it.

2442
02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:13,640
Scott, what are you a bathrobe guy?

2443
02:08:13,880 --> 02:08:14,840
Yeah, I'll do it.

2444
02:08:14,880 --> 02:08:15,680
Everyone's OK.

2445
02:08:15,880 --> 02:08:17,520
Yeah, I got one.

2446
02:08:17,720 --> 02:08:19,520
But, yeah, I don't know.

2447
02:08:19,720 --> 02:08:20,480
It's odd to do.

2448
02:08:20,680 --> 02:08:21,480
Jason, are you a bathrobe?

2449
02:08:21,680 --> 02:08:22,760
I can't imagine constantly.

2450
02:08:22,960 --> 02:08:25,040
Are you you're like an everyday bathrobe guy.

2451
02:08:25,240 --> 02:08:26,760
Am I wrong?

2452
02:08:26,960 --> 02:08:28,440
Yeah, sometimes.

2453
02:08:28,640 --> 02:08:29,240
What?

2454
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:32,480
Get out of the get out of the shower, put on that rope.

2455
02:08:32,680 --> 02:08:37,280
You're like a Robert Evans type where like you would imagine he just wore like

2456
02:08:37,480 --> 02:08:40,760
a smoking jacket around the house or a bathrobe.

2457
02:08:40,920 --> 02:08:43,240
So like you are just like a lounging your

2458
02:08:43,440 --> 02:08:48,320
robe after a shower for hours unless you have somewhere to go.

2459
02:08:48,520 --> 02:08:49,880
Yeah, weather depending.

2460
02:08:50,080 --> 02:08:52,040
Sometimes that's a little too cold.

2461
02:08:52,240 --> 02:08:53,800
You know,

2462
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,680
the difference being

2463
02:08:56,960 --> 02:09:00,680
milk and cookies replacing vast sums of cocaine.

2464
02:09:00,880 --> 02:09:02,240
Right.

2465
02:09:02,440 --> 02:09:04,000
Besides that, sure.

2466
02:09:04,200 --> 02:09:07,920
Maybe Jason is a Robert Evans type.

2467
02:09:08,800 --> 02:09:10,400
Should we do we get out over time?

2468
02:09:10,600 --> 02:09:11,760
Have we done it? Can we do it?

2469
02:09:11,960 --> 02:09:12,880
I think we can do it.

2470
02:09:13,080 --> 02:09:13,800
I think so.

2471
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:14,840
Yeah.

2472
02:09:15,040 --> 02:09:18,840
Haunt cast the Fright, an episode that a while ago was mostly about the

2473
02:09:19,040 --> 02:09:21,840
Twilight Zone Tower of Terror.

2474
02:09:22,040 --> 02:09:23,080
That's a blast.

2475
02:09:23,280 --> 02:09:29,000
It's nice to talk about such a such a fantastic ride, a lynchpin, an institution.

2476
02:09:29,200 --> 02:09:34,840
And as we said, almost this almost has to become a yearly, a mini yearly series

2477
02:09:34,840 --> 02:09:37,120
because we have to hit Japan, we have to hit the film.

2478
02:09:37,320 --> 02:09:41,920
And of course, an entire episode devoted to the systemic abuse of Sally.

2479
02:09:42,120 --> 02:09:46,680
Sean is very evident from the one unspeaking shot of.

2480
02:09:46,880 --> 02:09:47,400
Yes.

2481
02:09:47,600 --> 02:09:49,480
Do we think Mission Breakout?

2482
02:09:49,680 --> 02:09:50,720
That's not counted, right?

2483
02:09:50,920 --> 02:09:51,680
Because it's not spooky.

2484
02:09:51,880 --> 02:09:53,200
No, I think it's not.

2485
02:09:53,400 --> 02:09:58,040
But it is a Monsters After Dark, the Halloween overlay.

2486
02:09:58,240 --> 02:10:00,800
That has to be an Haunt Cast the Fright.

2487
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:04,440
Maybe on a second gate, maybe behind a paywall.

2488
02:10:04,600 --> 02:10:06,080
I think so.

2489
02:10:06,280 --> 02:10:08,000
I think those are the rules.

2490
02:10:08,200 --> 02:10:12,520
So we have to cover it in the off season and unless we do Monsters After Dark first,

2491
02:10:12,520 --> 02:10:13,680
it gets very right.

2492
02:10:13,680 --> 02:10:14,920
We could do Monsters After Dark first.

2493
02:10:15,120 --> 02:10:17,240
And you have you have not you've done

2494
02:10:17,240 --> 02:10:20,400
Guardians, but not Monsters After Dark now haven't done Monsters After Dark.

2495
02:10:20,600 --> 02:10:22,080
Right. Which I love.

2496
02:10:22,280 --> 02:10:22,800
Spooky.

2497
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:24,680
Yeah, my favorite.

2498
02:10:25,640 --> 02:10:26,520
Does sound cool.

2499
02:10:26,520 --> 02:10:29,200
All right. So this look, we're not done with these towers.

2500
02:10:29,400 --> 02:10:31,360
We'll be back in the tower.

2501
02:10:31,400 --> 02:10:33,080
We may have to be

2502
02:10:33,280 --> 02:10:38,920
similarly over in the Creatures Choice Awards to we'll figure that out.

2503
02:10:39,120 --> 02:10:43,040
Hey, like we said, there's a lot of Haunt Cast the Fright to come.

2504
02:10:43,240 --> 02:10:45,960
We got good topics, good fun coming up.

2505
02:10:46,160 --> 02:10:49,360
So stay tuned.

2506
02:10:49,560 --> 02:10:50,480
What's a monster?

2507
02:10:50,680 --> 02:10:52,920
What's a Halloween pun?

2508
02:10:53,120 --> 02:10:58,560
Stay Glued to your

2509
02:10:58,760 --> 02:11:03,600
podcast app and be sure to

2510
02:11:04,640 --> 02:11:07,920
skeloscribe to that's horrible.

2511
02:11:08,120 --> 02:11:11,280
Skeletal Skeleton subscribe.

2512
02:11:11,480 --> 02:11:12,320
Look, I don't know.

2513
02:11:12,520 --> 02:11:13,680
I'll tune these up later.

2514
02:11:13,880 --> 02:11:20,440
The point is go to podcast the ride, the cemetery gate for both three

2515
02:11:20,640 --> 02:11:22,600
booness episodes. That's good.

2516
02:11:22,600 --> 02:11:24,120
That's perfect. Yeah, very good.

2517
02:11:24,120 --> 02:11:27,160
Yeah, that's great. I close that on a good one at Patreon.com

2518
02:11:27,160 --> 02:11:28,080
slash podcast the right.

2519
02:11:28,080 --> 02:11:30,600
I'm not going to spookify that one or the URL won't be right.

2520
02:11:30,800 --> 02:11:32,040
OK, very important. All right.

2521
02:11:32,240 --> 02:11:34,600
Well, we'll see you soon.

2522
02:11:36,640 --> 02:11:38,800
