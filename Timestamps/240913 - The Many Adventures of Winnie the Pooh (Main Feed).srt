Warning!

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000

All that plus a discussion of

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
the many adventures of Winnie the Pooh rides

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
all across the world. On today's

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
podcast, The Ride.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Deep in the hundred

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
podcast woods

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
lived a boy named Mike

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Steffer Carlson. Like most

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
forty year old boys, Mike Steffer

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
has many toys.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Many, many, a lot

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
of many toys, but his favorite

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
of all is his rumbly-tumbly

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
little pal, Jason the Pooh.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Now, when Jason

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
the Pooh speaks, he sounds

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
exactly like the Disney character

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Winnie the Pooh. I mean

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
exactly. So, when he

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
speaks in just a second, get ready

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
for a voice that's one hundred percent

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
just like Winnie the Pooh.

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So, here he is now,

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Jason the Pooh.

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Oh, bother.

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Start the party

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
without me.

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You know, it's Eeyore with a

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
twinge of Lorne Michaels.

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yeah, it's a little Lorne.

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You know, the thing about Rabbit is

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
you know, Rabbit needs to take the energy down

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and you know, because there's a mellowness to the

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
hundred acre woods. You know,

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
when Danny and Johnny and I were trying to go get the

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
beehive from the top of the tree,

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
you know, we really just got stung a lot.

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We wanted practical beehives

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
in the sketches.

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And we got that at the Disneyland

49
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
version of this ride. Every other

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
one they went with honeypots. You know, they

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
say that when you're the voice actors

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
when they're creating characters, they combine two

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
voices and that's what Jason just did.

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yeah, so Pooh is Eeyore

55
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
plus Lorne Michaels.

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Right, his Pooh version of Pooh is Eeyore

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
plus Lorne Michaels.

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So, we'll check in with that Pooh

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
constantly during this episode.

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I guess we'll have to. I was wondering,

61
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I was like, oh man, I feel like there's a number

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
of characters in the hundred acre woods

63
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
that could be. Who is he going to

64
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
nail my ass with?

65
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Just the main one. Probably Pooh,

66
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
it could be Eeyore. You made it sound like one of

67
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
them at least. You're not Eeyore.

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You're not the gopher.

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Could be the American original character

70
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
gopher.

71
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Pooh though is the most

72
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
popular character, so it's not all

73
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
bad. You think more popular than Taker?

74
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I think so.

75
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Taker's a little much. Well, when Taker

76
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
joined, you know, Taker broke out

77
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
because Taker was very physical

78
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
and brought an energy, you know.

79
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But Pooh is the thing

80
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
where the cast can't evolve, you know.

81
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And when we made it to Heffalump

82
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
movie, Taker is the sex.

83
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Taker is the draw for the ladies.

84
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Taker is the sex, Taker is the bounce.

85
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
We replaced him with Billy

86
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
and Taker

87
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and I feel like they both hit pretty quickly.

88
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
But yeah, Pooh, I feel like Pooh.

89
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Pooh is like

90
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Pooh is like your Bill Hader.

91
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
He's the Phil Hartman of this.

92
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
These are like some of the main

93
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
stages of the show. Winnie the Pooh cast

94
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
onto. I'm saying

95
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
sort of like reliable, dependable,

96
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
consistent.

97
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That's Pooh there. That's what Jason is.

98
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Well, Rue I think would be, Rue is

99
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
like the Pete Davidson due to youth,

100
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
you see. Of course, yes.

101
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Rue, that's another one I'm like,

102
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
oh, I, I, whatever

103
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
my child like wonder or naivete

104
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
whatever you want to call it.

105
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You would

106
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
identify with Rue? I think I

107
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
identify a little with Rue and Eeyore

108
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and Pooh.

109
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And Piglet. And Piglet.

110
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Oh, I see Piglet with you.

111
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. There is probably

112
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
there's certain times when I feel like Jason and I

113
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
maybe trade off being like Piglet

114
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and Pooh. And Pooh.

115
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Sometimes Jason's like, oh, why are we doing

116
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
this? Why are we doing this, Michael?

117
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What do you mean? We're trying to get into this

118
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Comic Con party. We're going to get arrested.

119
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What do you mean, Michael?

120
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Michael gets really excited about

121
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
like a deal.

122
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You know, you get Tigger

123
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
energy. Like when you said on this

124
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
podcast, who gives a shit or who

125
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
gives a fuck about grapefruit? That's almost

126
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
sort of like kind of a Piglet. Like what are we

127
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
what do you mean, grapefruit?

128
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Who gives a shit about grapefruit?

129
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I think it was coming from a much angrier

130
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
place. I think it was coming from an angrier place

131
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
than any Winnie the Pooh character can come from.

132
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
There's not that much anger.

133
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Also, I hate to tell you this, Mike. You're Rabbit.

134
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Oh, yeah, I am Rabbit.

135
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
That's true. Yeah, yeah. If we're

136
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
going on the equal playing field

137
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
with no dynamics versus another person,

138
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
yes, I am Rabbit, yeah.

139
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yeah, yeah. I think

140
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
so. It's like when there's a... And Jason

141
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
that's where Jason's Pooh because Jason's trying

142
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
to get into your place to steal

143
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
snacks.

144
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And I'm trying to explain something to Jason and he falls asleep

145
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
like Pooh Bear. He's just like

146
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
he just zones out when I'm saying that. I mean, that

147
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
happens to me. Look, let's be honest. That

148
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
happens to all of us when we're talking

149
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
to partners about theme park stuff.

150
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
We are all a little bit Rabbit where we're trying

151
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
to explain the new ride or what we're

152
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
happy about or upset about and then the person

153
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
just falls. And they all turn into Eeyores, just

154
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
energy wise. Yeah, right.

155
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So, we all contain

156
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Eeyores, Pooh multitudes.

157
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
We all contain

158
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
many Pooh characters. This is sort of a new religion

159
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm workshopping right now.

160
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
We all kind of do. You know what's something I think we'll all

161
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
fall into also

162
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
is like, I think we can all have

163
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
an owl about us in that

164
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
owl will like, oh, I know

165
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
all about that and then he'll go get the book

166
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
and then pontificate and here's everything I know

167
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
about this. And the viewer knows

168
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
that he has the book turned upside down.

169
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Right. That's us with our pronunciations

170
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
and our falsehoods.

171
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yes. Everything that we get wrong on a

172
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
regular basis. I say yes.

173
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
We all think honey is spelled H-U-N-N-Y

174
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
in real life. I think

175
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I was trying to figure out the

176
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Pooh astrology of like

177
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Pooh, Sun,

178
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Eeyore, Moon,

179
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Tigger,

180
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Piglet, Rise. And I'm like

181
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I don't remember enough of the specifics

182
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
about like, well everyone knows your Sun

183
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
sign, but then your Moon, Sun

184
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
is really what you are and Rising Sign

185
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
influences you and I'm like

186
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Oh, I don't know this well enough.

187
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You got it better than me.

188
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You're more of an owl on that than I am.

189
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
But he just owl'd himself. He was trying to be like

190
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
an authority, but then he just explained that he doesn't know.

191
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So like, owl has

192
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
shown his owl butt yet again.

193
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Yeah. His owl butt?

194
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Showing your ass, that's the phrase, right?

195
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Sure. It is? Isn't the phrase

196
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
showing your ass when you like, embarrass yourself?

197
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Am I wrong? It is, but I also

198
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
think my tend to be an authority

199
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
was undone by the second a-f

200
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
of my sentence, where I admit my foolishness.

201
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
That's true. You did admit. You're right.

202
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I was pining of like

203
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Oh, I wish I knew this a little better.

204
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You self-owled or something. I don't know

205
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
what the phrase would be. Self-owled.

206
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That's maybe not it, but something like that.

207
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Well, we all have affinity

208
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
for these characters in

209
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
this world, seemingly. And we're here

210
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
by the way, in case, because there's a lot

211
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
of like generic, Winnie the Pooh

212
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
things are always named

213
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
many adventures and advent. I even

214
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
forget what the Saturday Morning Cartoon was called.

215
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And they all win, which is which,

216
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
and it all blends together. To be clear, we are talking

217
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
about The Ride, which is at

218
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
both American parks, it's in

219
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Hong Kong, and it's in Shanghai.

220
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Just so you know. But I think

221
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
it's fair to keep on the table here.

222
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Fondness for the world,

223
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
fondness for the characters, because that might help us

224
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
calibrate how we feel about these

225
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
attractions. Yes, for sure.

226
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And you brought up the Saturday Morning, the ABC

227
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Pooh Bear, because like, I think we all grew up with

228
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
the original cartoons, all those

229
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
songs, The Ride, Winnie the Pooh,

230
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
that stuff. Those I think passed

231
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
generationally excellently,

232
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I can say, because my mom really wanted to

233
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
show me those, and I loved them, and I've passed them to

234
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
my son. Yes. Those

235
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
of all the things that don't

236
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
transcend generations, Mike

237
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Love quote, I'll say.

238
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Winnie the Pooh, definitely. Winnie the Pooh

239
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
is the beach boys of cartoons.

240
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
In a lot of ways.

241
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I think in early- Brian is Pooh.

242
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Another one in early Disney

243
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Channel, where they would chop

244
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
it up, maybe?

245
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Or chop up the segments

246
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
and air it, or just

247
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
air the original movie in its entirety.

248
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It got re-released

249
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
on VHS, it was released on VHS

250
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
in the early 80s, and then re-released

251
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
in the mid-90s. Because it was all these, it was these

252
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
like, separate shorts, like if you were

253
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
watching this in real time, all of the shorts came

254
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
out separately, but then all

255
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
got combined into sort of the unofficial

256
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
feature mini-adventures of Winnie the Pooh,

257
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
which is three of them,

258
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
that's Tigger Two and Blustery

259
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Day, and whichever one is the bees,

260
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I think.

261
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Yeah. But then

262
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
yes, Mike also, the Saturday

263
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Morning cartoon, which I thought

264
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
was wonderful, and I love that theme.

265
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
The theme haunts me.

266
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Haunts me in a good way.

267
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
What a start, there's no

268
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
little

269
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
prelude, it's just gotta

270
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
get it, wow.

271
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Flams in. High energy.

272
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
What's with his homey?

273
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
No little

274
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
fill to get you in there. Starts with the

275
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
words.

276
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I think a lot of, I think everybody

277
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
sees the symmetry between Weezer and the Winnie the Pooh

278
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
universe. Yeah, yeah.

279
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Well, the 90s, around the same era.

280
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Written around the same time, so

281
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
one influenced the other. Weezer, yes.

282
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
River's presumably influenced by the mini-adventures theme.

283
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Pooh did use some of his success,

284
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
you know, his money, to go back

285
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
to an Ivy League school and get

286
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
a degree.

287
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Like Rivers. I hate to say it, he needed it.

288
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Pooh needed it, there was a big education gap

289
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
with Pooh. Yeah, I, since

290
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
we were talking about the original

291
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
many adventures of Winnie the Pooh,

292
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I didn't know a couple things.

293
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
One, I didn't know it came out

294
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
in 1977, like

295
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I didn't know it was so recent,

296
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
like so close to the 80s.

297
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I also didn't know it was originally released

298
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
on a double bill

299
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
with a movie called Escape

300
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
from the Dark, aka

301
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
The Littlest Horse

302
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Thieves. Those are the same movie?

303
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The same movie. Really? In England it's

304
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
called Escape from the Dark,

305
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
and in America it was called The

306
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Littlest Horse Thieves. Thieves.

307
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
These are very different tones of

308
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
title. Yeah.

309
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And there's multiple thieves?

310
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Are all the people in the photo or the

311
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
poster thieves? I think all the people

312
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
are thieves.

313
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
They can't all be thieves, there have to be some

314
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
good guys, are the thieves good? No,

315
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
the thieves are good, they're little. Yeah, yeah.

316
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I think they're trying to rescue horses

317
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
from going to the slaughterhouse.

318
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Oh, they're good thieves.

319
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What a scary premise of a

320
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
movie, you're getting kids in to see Winnie the Pooh

321
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
and now we're thinking about horse

322
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
slaughter? They're going to be worried

323
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
about Eeyore the whole time.

324
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Is there some plant that wants to melt Eeyore down?

325
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Use his tail to make belts?

326
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's probably in that Winnie the Pooh, Blood and Honey

327
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
are rated Pooh Bear

328
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
public domain shit.

329
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
That's too twisted.

330
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Sorry, I'm just saying that now

331
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
that the characters are public domain,

332
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
you can do stuff like that. Blood and Honey

333
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
is a kind of cool phrase. It is a good

334
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
idea. I mean, Blood and Anything,

335
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Elvis Costell's Blood and Chocolate,

336
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Blood and Anything is actually kind of

337
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
a cool title. I guess we could

338
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
find one that isn't.

339
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Blood and

340
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Insulin, it's not as interesting.

341
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
They're in the family.

342
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Blood and Serts.

343
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You know, the candy

344
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Serts. I don't think that's very cool.

345
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's okay. Blood and Swedish Fish,

346
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I say because there's Swedish Fish in the room.

347
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Blood and Swedish Fish is okay, depending on what you're

348
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
titling, I think. That would be the name

349
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
of a really irritating

350
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
stand-up special. Yeah, that's true.

351
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Like a Scottish comedian from 2004

352
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
put a DVD out.

353
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You Americans?

354
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I can't believe this.

355
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
He's certainly fighting against...

356
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Let's talk about the Crusades!

357
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Your

358
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
president is so dumb!

359
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
That was not Scottish. I can't do

360
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Scottish. That is a really hard line.

361
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Littlest Horse Thieves, my god.

362
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Geez.

363
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Oh, and Alistair Simms' last movie

364
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
sat on several levels.

365
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You have to be sad, not that I know

366
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
who that is. Oh, he played Scrooge.

367
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Oh, alright, well he must be a great

368
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
British character actor,

369
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Shakespearean actor, probably.

370
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I saw the phrase, they're trying

371
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
to rescue pit ponies,

372
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
and I'd never encountered that, but I have

373
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
no idea what that means. Pit ponies?

374
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm assuming racing horses

375
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
that can't race anymore, farming

376
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
horses that can't farm anymore.

377
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Mines, they're in the mines. They're in the mines!

378
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I didn't know horses went in the mines!

379
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I guess they have to pull the cards.

380
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Makes sense.

381
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Welcome to Pooh

382
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Corner, also. Yes.

383
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Loom's large.

384
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Welcome to Pooh Corner, the

385
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
live-action, suited

386
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
character show that was on

387
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
early Disney Channel that had this

388
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
really, like,

389
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
specific, kind of

390
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
haunting, kind of creepy vibe

391
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
with its painted backdrops.

392
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Look at the Pooh face on this picture.

393
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Pooh has this, like, thousand-yard stare.

394
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
This mascot-suited character.

395
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Jason, you watch this?

396
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Yeah, I vaguely remember this.

397
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I saw that one, because that

398
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
looks very similar to the one walking

399
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
around the park. There's a

400
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
video on YouTube just called Pooh Falls

401
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Down, and it was just

402
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
the person in the suit was walking

403
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
along with Tigger, and they just

404
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
kind of ate shit, and everyone

405
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
went, no, no, he fell!

406
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Cast members help him up and get him

407
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
off stage, you know, get him backstage

408
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
to, like,

409
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
collect themselves. I feel like on

410
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
this show, if there'd been the episode

411
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
when Pooh fell,

412
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
it would be to, like,

413
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
addiction,

414
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
peer pressure,

415
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
mental illness.

416
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
This show feels

417
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
so heavy to me, and I don't think it

418
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
always was, but I feel like we probably

419
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
all, to some extent, are

420
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
aware of the one about strangers

421
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
and not talking to strangers.

422
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
And just seeing

423
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
the notion of strangers

424
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
even puncture the world of Winnie the Pooh

425
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
at all

426
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
is so, like, no,

427
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
his fluff and stuff brain

428
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
can't handle these

429
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
scary concepts.

430
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Don't put Pooh through these paces.

431
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Yeah, the Hundred Acre Woods was this, like,

432
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
special place where no

433
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
danger like that existed.

434
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Like, I guess

435
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
some danger existed, but it wasn't. Yeah, this is

436
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
too real world. Piglet, this is

437
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
crack.

438
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
That's where you don't, it's too.

439
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
But also, then, just the vibe of this show

440
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
and the show Dumbo Circus,

441
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
which was similar suited characters.

442
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Yes.

443
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Scary. They just are both scary shows

444
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
that were, in the same way

445
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
other, you know, shows almost in

446
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
hindsight are creepy.

447
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Zubili Zoo or something, even though those weren't quite, those

448
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
weren't suited characters they had face paint on, but they're

449
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
a different type of creepy. A different type of creepy

450
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
that you go back and you watch and you're like,

451
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
this is so unnerving,

452
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
but I do think the unnervingness

453
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
was making me

454
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
extra interested in it. I think there is something compelling

455
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
about some of these old shows because of

456
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It lodged in your brain more than like a more

457
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
normal cartoon or kid show

458
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
that didn't have that

459
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
eerie air. Do you think it was probably

460
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
just, like, cheapy shows

461
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
made at the MGM Studios?

462
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Yeah. In Florida? Yeah. I think for sure.

463
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Yeah. I don't think the, well,

464
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I don't know if we know that. Oh, I don't know where

465
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
they were made. I just, I am agreeing with you that they

466
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
were cheapy shows. Oh, okay. I don't think

467
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
there's any way they weren't cheapy shows because they

468
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
kind of had, like, a couple sets. Like, knock them

469
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know

470
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
where they were shot though. It's funny you say the word

471
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
unnerving because I wrote that down

472
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
because, like, there's, like,

473
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
uh, uh, stuff

474
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
in the ride, like, I like the effect

475
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
when Pooh falls asleep

476
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
and starts to dream and it's like

477
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
a projection thing

478
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
and then you go into the Heffalumps and

479
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Woozles. As a kid, the Heffalumps

480
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
and Woozles dream sequence

481
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I found so

482
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
unnerving. Uh, when you would see

483
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
it on the- On the TV. Yeah.

484
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
On the Disney Channel or whatever. Yeah.

485
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Like, it just gave me the creeps. I didn't-

486
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
The song was haunting.

487
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I don't- And I'm like, why is

488
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
this bear? Yeah. He lives in the woods

489
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
with his friend. Like, why has he haunted

490
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
his dreams? I

491
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
don't think I liked it.

492
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I don't remember exactly. Yeah. I think

493
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I, but I think it was more like, eh, we don't need to watch

494
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
this part. I wasn't like so scared

495
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
of it, but it was not the stuff I liked.

496
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Right. Um.

497
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I want to say that this is maybe

498
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
a rare area where I was not

499
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
particularly scared. My-

500
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Perhaps my mother could point

501
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
me to many terrible incidents involving

502
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Heffalumps and Woozles and I'm wrong,

503
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
but I don't- Yeah, I was thinking that because it's, you

504
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
know, within- On this spectrum,

505
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
it's kind of like a psychedelic sequence,

506
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
right? Yeah. And, you know,

507
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
you know, the way we are,

508
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
we'd be like, psychedelic sequences

509
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
for kids, tsk tsk. Yes.

510
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I was like, is it going to go that way? And I don't

511
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
feel that way, but because it's

512
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
like, I think

513
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
obvious precedent,

514
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Pink Elephants on

515
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Parade is way scarier,

516
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
more upsetting. I think Heffalumps and Woozles,

517
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
first of all, they're smiling, and I don't

518
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
find the smiles creepy, and it's such

519
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
just like fun, eye-popping animation.

520
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I don't think I was ever

521
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
upset by it. I don't think- It makes all

522
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
the sense in the world that you guys were anybody

523
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
would be. Yeah, I don't have

524
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
such a scare. Like, I don't have a memory of

525
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
like the end of Pinocchio or anything like that

526
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
where I was so freaked out by

527
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
the donkey stuff in Pleasure

528
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Island and other things,

529
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
and the witch in Snow White and stuff, so I don't have

530
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
that memory, but I don't

531
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
feel it in my brain that I had a big,

532
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
like, any big affection for this.

533
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I could be wrong, but I just don't remember.

534
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
The psychedelic stuff, and then

535
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
also like,

536
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
it's in The Wind in the Willows

537
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
and some of the Pooh stuff.

538
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
There's like this

539
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
melancholy,

540
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
now I recognize like melancholy

541
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
British countryside.

542
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

543
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Pining, and I'm like, as a kid,

544
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
that, I did not like that.

545
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I like the funny stuff.

546
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Yeah, yeah. You know?

547
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Like the feeling of like long, you're getting like

548
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
the feeling of longing. Longing.

549
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And you're five years old. Which now I'm realizing

550
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
it's like people longing for a world

551
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
before the Great War.

552
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Sure.

553
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Of course this is the perspective

554
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Jason brings to the show.

555
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
That's what I, I didn't recognize that

556
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
at the time. Keep in mind, Christopher

557
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Robin lives in a post-war,

558
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
he lives in a war-torn England.

559
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
That's true. So if you ever think it feels

560
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
sad, this is,

561
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I'm surprised there's this much heaviness

562
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
being brought to the, I think they're all

563
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
a blast. I love all the way

564
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
there's like sort of a sadness, like a melancholy,

565
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
like even to the song,

566
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
like, we need to, like,

567
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
No, to the main song?

568
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I think so.

569
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I do think so. I think it's sweet and fun

570
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
and nice. I think it's that too.

571
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Look, everything you're saying about,

572
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I definitely get

573
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
odd feelings from Pooh Corner

574
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
and, but

575
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
even like, I don't think it even has the

576
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
like, to me it doesn't

577
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
quite have the melancholy of peanuts or

578
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
anything. I think of like,

579
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I think of fun and physical and silly

580
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
and he's flying around on the balloon,

581
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
he's spitting bees out of his mouth.

582
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I think there's a lot of like, pure

583
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
joy. I think I

584
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
have trouble

585
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
ascribing the notion

586
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
to Winnie the Pooh

587
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
that it's like melancholy and sad.

588
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
At least not like as it's primary

589
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
facets. I am talking about like there's

590
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
probably five or ten minutes

591
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
cumulative that happens

592
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
at the beginning or end

593
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
of some of this stuff.

594
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
When the book opens and it's the theme

595
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
and it's like Christopher Robin

596
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
there is something there. There is

597
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I don't know if longing is even the right word that I feel

598
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
but there is something wistful.

599
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
There is some extra feeling.

600
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It's not like the ABC Pooh Bear where it's like

601
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
let's fucking go!

602
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
That's the energy of the Pooh Bear.

603
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
That's the energy

604
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
you're ascribing to.

605
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Pooh Bear, Winnie the Pooh Bear

606
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Let's fucking go!

607
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Let's have some fun and shit!

608
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
What would Pooh Bear sound

609
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
like if he said let's fucking go?

610
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Like Deadpool or Wolverine are

611
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
going to say in this upcoming film.

612
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Or it may come out depending on when we release this.

613
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Let's fucking go!

614
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Grab the

615
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Celsius energy

616
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
drink and let's go!

617
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It has to be higher. First things first.

618
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Yeah, that did it

619
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
He's more like this

620
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Pooh Bear. I can get it sometimes.

621
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I think that's pretty good.

622
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
That's pretty good. Jason?

623
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
That helps a ton.

624
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
That nudge.

625
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
That's what it needed.

626
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Let's fucking go, Piglet.

627
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
That's pretty good.

628
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I'm pretty impressed by your Pooh.

629
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
That's like a little...

630
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
That's more like the Sterling Hollow.

631
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Gotta get way back there.

632
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Without saying the phrase to let you say it

633
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
What if Winnie the Pooh shared your

634
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
maybe your primary interest

635
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
in what you like to do when you go to Las Vegas?

636
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
The kind of thing that you like to

637
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
go to.

638
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
But other words though.

639
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
You're missing one key word in that.

640
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Yeah, the adjectives.

641
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Douchey pool party

642
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Piglet

643
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I want to go to...

644
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
What DJ is spinning tonight, Pooh?

645
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
DJ Tigger

646
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
T1

647
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
GG

648
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
8, that'll number 8

649
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
and then an R.

650
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Wet Republic hasn't

651
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
been the same year.

652
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It's hard. I lose after a little bit.

653
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
It's really easy to lose.

654
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Oh bother.

655
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I can reset on oh bother.

656
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Piglet, sing Piglet.

657
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I don't know.

658
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
You gotta keep those key phrases.

659
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Just go back to them.

660
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Oh, let's fucking go.

661
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Oh bother.

662
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Maybe does Pooh Bear say let's fucking go

663
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
in any of these R rated

664
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
public domain movies?

665
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I wonder. He might.

666
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And he should now if nobody's done it.

667
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
We could make a Pooh Bear movie.

668
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I just want to let everyone know in case you hadn't heard

669
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
you can make a Pooh Bear movie tomorrow.

670
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
You can announce it, you can shoot it,

671
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
you will not get sued.

672
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
You probably can't put the red shirt on

673
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
that he wears in the Disney specific stuff

674
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
but yeah, you can use the characters.

675
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
All of our darkest visions can come to life.

676
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
We can swear once.

677
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I believe

678
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
there's a sequel coming to Blood

679
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
and Honey because Tigger went in public.

680
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Well the same people are also making like an evil

681
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Steamboat Willie movie too.

682
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
The Steamboat Willie specific version of Mickey

683
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
is now in the public domain.

684
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I'm trying to find

685
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I'm on the IMDB

686
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
quotes for

687
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
the twisted Winnie the Pooh

688
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Blood and Honey because I was like maybe I

689
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
can hand you some crazy phrase that he says

690
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
but unfortunately the craziest phrase

691
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
there's only two quotes.

692
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Everybody's sleeping on this IMDB but the craziest

693
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
quote is from Christopher Robin and it's this

694
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Pooh, you've got to help me. Something's

695
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
wrong with Piglet. He killed my wife.

696
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
And that doesn't

697
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
show up in the Ewan McGregor

698
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Christopher Robin.

699
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Maybe you're mixing up the quotes

700
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
and it's from the Ewan McGregor

701
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Christopher Robin movie. Yeah, they could have

702
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
it twisted. Maybe that movie's good.

703
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I forgot about that movie existed

704
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
and I was like

705
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I wonder if they should make a grown up

706
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Christopher Robin movie and I thought

707
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
five more minutes about it and I was like

708
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
they did that

709
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
four years ago.

710
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Have you invented it in your brain?

711
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I don't know if I've seen a trailer of it.

712
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I've watched it. Now that is a

713
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
sad movie. That's like

714
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
very sad and melancholy.

715
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I didn't want that. I don't want to be sad.

716
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
That's kind of a bummer.

717
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I'm not going to stand up for something that looks

718
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
sad from that.

719
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
When I was a kid and saw Hook

720
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
in theaters

721
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I was like there's a lot of sad parts

722
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
of this.

723
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I wanted to run away.

724
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I say Hook is to be avoided

725
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
at all costs.

726
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Especially knowing that the man who played

727
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Hook is a real life Hook.

728
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Sure.

729
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
And it's a

730
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
creepy movie on so many levels

731
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
and it's weird that thing that

732
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Spielberg hated

733
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Julia Roberts.

734
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
They did not get along.

735
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I think it would be hard to watch it

736
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
and it's already got the creepy patina

737
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
and now you're going but Spielberg

738
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I thought Spielberg was great. I thought he was everybody's friend.

739
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
What happened?

740
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
It stresses me out

741
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
that he was mad at Julia Roberts.

742
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
He's Mr.

743
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
like everyone likes him

744
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
you would think.

745
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I think of him as like a person.

746
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
A normal person.

747
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I don't know.

748
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
A normal person should be able to get along

749
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
with Julia Roberts I would think.

750
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
But I don't know. I'm not sure.

751
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I don't know.

752
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
That humanizes Spielberg in some ways

753
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
in my mind.

754
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
You just think of him as Mr. Movies

755
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
and he's this sort of inoffensive character.

756
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I don't even know

757
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
what is the Spielberg

758
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
George Lucas you could do a character

759
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
you could do a voice you could do kind of a bit.

760
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
But I don't even know what the Spielberg bit is.

761
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
He's just sort of talking about lenses

762
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
and talking about

763
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I don't have a good lock on

764
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
what he's like even.

765
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
There's not a lot of Spielberg impressions are there.

766
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I don't know what it would be.

767
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
The only way in

768
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
is that we don't have much time

769
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
and ET needs your help.

770
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
It's the only thing that I know that he says.

771
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
He says it kind of hurried. He says it kind of flat.

772
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
We don't have much time. ET needs your help.

773
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Magic bikes. This. Magic passport.

774
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Oh hi ET.

775
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Short clips. Not good on camera.

776
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
So imagine I'm like screaming at

777
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Julie Roberts but it's actually like that.

778
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Maybe it wasn't screaming.

779
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Just being mad at it.

780
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I don't have much time.

781
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I don't like your vibe.

782
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
My notes to you

783
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
will be submitted via form.

784
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
So long.

785
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Big personalities to manage that movie.

786
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I mean what do you mean?

787
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I think

788
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Hoskins.

789
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I think Hoskins is probably the most

790
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
low maintenance.

791
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I feel like he worked in a lot of low budget

792
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
British stuff where he would probably

793
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
be pretty like chill now.

794
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I don't know but you can also hear his voice going

795
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
This production's a madhouse.

796
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Nothing works right around here.

797
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Go stick it up your arse.

798
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I don't know who to blame.

799
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Steven or Julian but I don't like

800
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
either of you.

801
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I thought the bloody kids would be the problem.

802
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
The grown ups are acting like kids.

803
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
And the kids are acting like adults.

804
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Robin Williams is the most

805
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
level headed one of us all.

806
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
What's that saying?

807
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I thought he was a loon.

808
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I seen him in Popeye.

809
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I thought this guy's a loon.

810
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
It turns out he's acting.

811
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
It would be really good if there was like

812
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
a director after they were done

813
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
in the same way that Schumacher was talking about

814
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
the actors on Batman Forever and who he liked

815
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
and who he didn't and who worked well.

816
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
If every director would just put that on record

817
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
and then maybe 50 years later that would all

818
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
become released.

819
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
That would be so interesting to know.

820
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Who you didn't get along with

821
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
who you didn't like.

822
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Who you thought did a bad job.

823
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I'm always fascinated by that.

824
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
There's just no other way

825
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
these famous movies could have been.

826
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
There's no other actor that could have played this.

827
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I'm sure like any creative person

828
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
like certain casting decisions drove them nuts

829
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
and still they go I fucking hate

830
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
the way this person played this.

831
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Years and years from now the

832
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Russo Brothers list comes out

833
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
and there's only one name on it

834
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
and it's you.

835
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
They liked every Avenger

836
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
and only me.

837
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Was that the one where you were on the big plane

838
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
with the wings or what were you doing for

839
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
the Russo Brothers?

840
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I did a Smirnoff

841
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
commercial for the Russo

842
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Brothers for Canada only.

843
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I was going to be in both

844
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
an American spot and a Canadian spot.

845
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
And they brought me back twice for the

846
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
callback. I improvised in front

847
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
of the Russo's twice.

848
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
They said they want you for both. They booked

849
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
me for both. I said well that's good.

850
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Captain America's coming out. I'm surely going to be

851
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Captain America's friend next movie

852
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
then they do one.

853
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Just so you guys know I do a We Need the Pooh.

854
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
If you need that.

855
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
If you want a Pooh Bear. I have a Donald

856
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
but I can't get words out. It's just going to sound

857
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
like it. But I'll work on it. For you guys I'll work on it.

858
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I got nine seconds of Pooh until it starts

859
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
struggling. And then I got

860
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
a call from my agent saying there's

861
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
some sort of rule where you can't do two country

862
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
spots. You can only do one. They want

863
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
you for the Canadian Smirnoff

864
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
because that is the more

865
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
people in this. And this was a whole big like

866
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Adam Scott. Was it Adam Scott?

867
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I think so. Like campaign

868
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
with a bunch of famous people in it.

869
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
So they said we want you for the Canada one because we don't want to be famous

870
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
people. And that's going to be more of a featured spot.

871
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
So I said that sounds great.

872
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
So I did the spot. It was

873
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
advertising the

874
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I'm trying to think. It's a tomato

875
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
sauce. Tomato

876
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
like I'm trying to think. It's a drink

877
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
that's just like celery and tomato

878
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
juice and vodka.

879
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Clamado? Is it a clamado? Is that

880
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
clams? There's some other name for it. I think I saw

881
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Dana. The other name for it is the shit I hate.

882
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
It's not a good name.

883
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Is it a Caesar? It's a Caesar.

884
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Thank you. It's a bloody

885
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
it's a twist on a bloody merriam. I saw Dan Aykroyd

886
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
advertising a Caesar recently.

887
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
So I did this

888
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
popular in Canada. I had

889
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
a couple lines in it. Obviously commercial short.

890
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
A couple lines in it. I talked to a couple people

891
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
who were like these Russo brothers. They love

892
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
to improvise. They're going to let you

893
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
it's going to be so much fun. You're going to be able to improvise.

894
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
And I go well this sounds fantastic.

895
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
This sounds exciting. You're not even going to have to stay

896
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
focused on the Caesar. You can go off

897
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Caesar. I can go off Caesar. Now I had done this

898
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
already a few times. So I know that you're not really allowed

899
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
to really go off that hard.

900
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
This is 30 seconds. But still

901
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I was like alright interesting. I got there

902
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
my lines were all cut. They had already

903
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
been cut. And then I go

904
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
but improvising is in the face.

905
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
It's in the expressions you make and how wide

906
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
your eyes go. And I did

907
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
the thing and it was fine. It was a perfectly pleasant

908
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
day. And then one time

909
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I think I just went like oh

910
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
okay. And I did it in a funny way and Joe Russo

911
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
laughed. And then the commercial never

912
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
aired and I never got paid for it.

913
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
You never got paid for it? Well I got the day rate.

914
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Sorry sorry. The day rate's fine. You get

915
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
a day. Basically it all works. I don't know why I'm talking about the day rate

916
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
you get once. If it doesn't

917
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
air then that's all you get. Which is fine.

918
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
So no it never aired. And then I was not

919
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Captain America's buddy in the next

920
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
one in case anyone didn't know. An insult to injury.

921
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Uh huh. So it didn't happen.

922
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Which sounds like a joke but I feel like Captain America

923
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
does pal around with Rick Jones.

924
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
He sure does. I think we talk

925
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I think at the time I go Jason I booked two

926
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
commercials. Rick Jones a role

927
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
is incoming for me. I think

928
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Did you say that out loud? Well I didn't

929
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
say it in that. Like I was completely

930
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
delusional. But I was probably

931
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
like who can I play Jason? What do you think?

932
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
And we were trying to figure it out or something.

933
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
And we hit on the early 20's

934
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
kind of like eventually

935
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
get super powers.

936
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
And you know why I actually

937
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
You know why I even went down this

938
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
like went down this trail

939
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
was because Dominic Dirkus has

940
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
uh no no DC Pearson. Sorry

941
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I thought of another Derek person.

942
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I mixed them up. DC Pearson is in

943
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Winter Soldier.

944
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
In the Apple Store.

945
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
They did get comedy

946
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
riff raff. You could have riff

947
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
raffed your way in there. That's what I mean.

948
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
So there's still time.

949
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Well something else there's still time for

950
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
is talking about the ride in this

951
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
episode about the ride. We can cut the last part of it.

952
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
We can cut that out.

953
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I don't know. No we're gonna

954
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Yeah but we can cut the last part

955
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
but we're gonna watch all of the

956
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
littlest horses.

957
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
The littlest horse thieves.

958
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Alright so edit.

959
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I've already forgotten the name of the movie.

960
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
So edit here and when we come back we'll have watched all of

961
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
the littlest horse thieves.

962
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Um guys

963
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I'm a little upset. We just finished

964
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
littlest horse thieves and they're so little

965
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
and the horses were so scared.

966
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
And I don't know if we can go on

967
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
with this boo episode but we're gonna have to muscle

968
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
through. It's what the horse thieves would have wanted.

969
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Let's fucking go. Let's fucking go.

970
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Let's fucking go. Let's talk about the ride.

971
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
This ride showed up

972
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
in the Magic Kingdom 25 years

973
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
ago this summer.

974
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
And it was at Disneyland

975
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
not long after. It's been

976
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
added to the new parks that they've built since

977
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
but never made it to

978
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Disneyland Paris, Tokyo, a whole

979
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
other situation I imagine. We'll talk

980
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
about it. Yeah yeah.

981
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I think we probably know the Disneyland version

982
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
the best. Magic Kingdom, it's

983
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
in fantasy land. It

984
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
replaced Mr. Toad.

985
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Disneyland, it is in critter country

986
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
where it replaced the country bears.

987
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
It's a killer. It's killed twice.

988
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Who is the killer?

989
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Blood and honey!

990
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Oh no!

991
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
He still has his souvenirs,

992
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
his trophies, the heads

993
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
are still in the Disneyland one. Mr. Toad's

994
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
head is dripping with both blood

995
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
and honey.

996
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I think that if this ride

997
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
gets a bad rap at all

998
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
some of it might come

999
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
from those initial

1000
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
kickings out.

1001
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
What do you call it when a landlord

1002
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
kicks out a

1003
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
eviction.

1004
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I think that

1005
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
might be like a

1006
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
sting still

1007
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
to some people. Because these are beloved

1008
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
attractions both. That was I think

1009
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
a superior Mr. Toad. An excellent

1010
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Mr. Toad in the Disney world

1011
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
with the two tracks. Yes. Big and expansive

1012
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
different experiences depending on

1013
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
which side that you did. Goes down to one

1014
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
ride with one track.

1015
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
And then country bears

1016
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
two country bear theaters

1017
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
took up a lot of space

1018
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
and it became this one of the

1019
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Poo ride. Now I think at the time

1020
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
there was the feeling that this was

1021
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
crass and that Poo

1022
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
is cute and Poo is moving a lot

1023
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
of merch in the parks

1024
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
and we'll move a lot more merch if we can

1025
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
get an established

1026
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Poo attraction

1027
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
and Poo zone. Yeah. And then we

1028
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
can really make the merch fly off the

1029
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
show. This is I remember the feeling on the

1030
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
internet at the time

1031
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
felt like it's just crass and

1032
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Poo is cute. I though

1033
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
love Winnie the Pooh growing up. To me

1034
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
it makes all the sense in the world that there could have been

1035
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
a Winnie the Pooh ride. Well there wouldn't

1036
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
have been because Poo was made after the

1037
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
fifties. But it's like

1038
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
if there had been a Poo ride

1039
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
in any of these parks much earlier

1040
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
mid eighties I think

1041
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
it would have made a lot of sense. Poo of course

1042
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
deserves a place in

1043
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
the theme parks. There were potentially

1044
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
plans for one.

1045
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
But it kept getting shelved.

1046
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Okay sure. So they were trying

1047
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
they were trying to figure it out.

1048
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I on the other hand

1049
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
loved Mr. Toad so much

1050
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
as a weird little child

1051
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I was very upset

1052
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
to find Toad clothes

1053
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
at a coming soon Winnie the Pooh ride.

1054
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
And the more I thought about it I was like

1055
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I don't think I've ridden

1056
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
the floor to Poo since the nineties.

1057
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Maybe I haven't either. Or early

1058
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
two thousands maybe. I don't know.

1059
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I don't know that I have either.

1060
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Are we discovering it? Well look we've been on the Disneyland

1061
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
one so we're not in such bad

1062
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
shape here and I watch ride throughs of

1063
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
all of them. Yeah

1064
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I've been on it but yeah enough for a while.

1065
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
You're not alone Jason and

1066
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
if you have not made it all the way to

1067
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Club Three the

1068
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
deepest acreage in our

1069
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
hundred acre wood

1070
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
then you have not heard our episode

1071
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
about toadins.

1072
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
A pretty inexplicable phrase

1073
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
until you break it apart and learn

1074
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
that those were the protests

1075
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
when Mr. Toad's

1076
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
wild ride was going away in the Magic

1077
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Kingdom. Toad Hall

1078
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
was going to be demolished. And that was definitely

1079
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
the angle on these things. Basically like

1080
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
what was interesting about the episode and why people

1081
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
wanted us to do it was that these were essentially

1082
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
sanctioned protests

1083
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
in the park that they

1084
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
sort of let slide. It was like

1085
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
alright these are a bunch of nerds from the internet

1086
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
they can do it. They're not getting unruly.

1087
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
We'll let them do it. We'll probably make it worse.

1088
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
We'll rile it up more if we try to stop it.

1089
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
So there was like a guy who worked there and like

1090
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
okay be safe fellas. Be good.

1091
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
And the protests

1092
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
went fine and then they ultimately had

1093
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
no effect and Mr. Toad went away

1094
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
and Pooh came in. But

1095
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
genuinely there was

1096
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
some definite

1097
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
anti-Pooh sentiment.

1098
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
At least in the Magic Kingdom. And I'd say here too

1099
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
on the west coast as well.

1100
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Less so I think just from reading

1101
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
archival stuff. Like it seems like the

1102
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Toad thing obviously was a bigger

1103
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
deal because it had a name and there was a

1104
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
movement more. But there was certainly

1105
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
country bear fans that were not pleased.

1106
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
And as you're saying it was like and then the

1107
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
gift shop goes in. It's

1108
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
interesting because yeah there's no reason

1109
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
like Pooh shouldn't have a ride.

1110
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Those two things though

1111
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
happen that kind of put a

1112
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
cloud over the two rides. And then

1113
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
the Japanese ride

1114
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
also now

1115
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
has a cloud over our American

1116
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Pooh rides head in the same

1117
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
way. So it's like it's not really

1118
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
fully fair to say these rides

1119
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
in America are bad. They're not bad.

1120
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
They're fun. I think you'd be hard pressed

1121
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
to like actually just go on it

1122
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
with no, if you have no knowledge

1123
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
of any of this history

1124
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
or what was there, if you

1125
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
are my then three year

1126
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
old going on this ride

1127
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
it's a delight. You love this ride.

1128
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Like there's nothing wrong

1129
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
with this attraction.

1130
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Maybe sometimes there's the feeling

1131
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
that there's not enough right

1132
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
about it. Well right it's like

1133
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I long for the

1134
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Tokyo Disney Pooh's Honey Hunt

1135
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
which is an amazing

1136
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
attraction. And of course the lore

1137
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
of we could have had this but we didn't

1138
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
get the, like there's no reason we should

1139
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
have a version just as good. So

1140
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
yes there's this, there's all this baggage

1141
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
that the Pooh rides in America have.

1142
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
And it's not fully fair. It's

1143
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
not completely fair because

1144
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
yes for your average park

1145
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
goer, your average child

1146
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
and my child who's

1147
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
just watched the video of the Pooh ride

1148
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
she loves this

1149
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
like video. Just the video. The video.

1150
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
When Pooh floats away she laughs

1151
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
and laughs and then goes again. She goes again.

1152
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
And I go okay so we go back

1153
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
and I'm like. Teaching her to like ride throughs.

1154
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I go wow this is, I know and I

1155
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
as I said before I don't

1156
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
like drill

1157
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
it on, like I don't drill her

1158
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
with this stuff but I'll put something on and see what she

1159
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
responds to. And immediately

1160
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
she responded to Pooh and all the characters

1161
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
on the ride through the Disneyland version.

1162
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Jason as a kid and it's like this is

1163
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
William Holden. Learn.

1164
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Learn to be good.

1165
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Learn about culture.

1166
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Garfield is not interested.

1167
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Just wanders away. Oh you're doing it with your dog.

1168
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I'm doing it to the dog.

1169
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I did try to get him on the big

1170
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
you know bigger screens.

1171
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Try to get him to watch

1172
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Bluey.

1173
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Cause I saw videos online

1174
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
that dogs respond

1175
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
well to it cause the color

1176
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
palette is like

1177
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
bright. It's like

1178
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
not that they can necessarily see

1179
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
the colors but they can kind of

1180
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
see they like it

1181
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
a little more. He did not care.

1182
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Yeah.

1183
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Our dog doesn't care about TV.

1184
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Although

1185
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I say my parents dog

1186
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
recognizes animals on the screen

1187
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
and will go nuts. So he for some reason

1188
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
has like he has the ability

1189
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
to see TV and know what he's seeing.

1190
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Our dog does not have that. He's never

1191
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
ever looked at the TV and cared.

1192
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I don't know why but like if

1193
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
there is a horse in the very

1194
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
background of a shot

1195
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
my parents dog will hop up on the

1196
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
ottoman and go nuts.

1197
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Just bark at full volume until that horse is gone.

1198
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
He has such good vision.

1199
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
It's really weird. Garfield is like

1200
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
10 now and only recently

1201
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
he started like noticing

1202
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
his reflection in mirrors

1203
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
and one day I caught him chasing it

1204
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
and he has also started

1205
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
doing whimpers when he wants

1206
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
attention or a treat.

1207
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
He never did this. He never ever

1208
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
did this before. It's new behavior.

1209
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
So it's new old man behavior.

1210
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Your dog's becoming

1211
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
an old man. He is.

1212
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Edwin's old.

1213
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Do your

1214
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
listeners, do your animals respond

1215
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
to media in this way and do you ever play

1216
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
this podcast around your dog

1217
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
or cat? Do they respond to our voices?

1218
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Do they like some? Do they recoil at others?

1219
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
What do animals think of

1220
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
our voices? It's time to find out.

1221
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Sound off in the comments. I hope

1222
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
by asking that question it's not going to be

1223
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
like that story that just came out of the

1224
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Bitcoin mine in Texas that's like

1225
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
it's emitting such an awful

1226
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
noise that it's hurting people

1227
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
in like the vicinity of the mine.

1228
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
And like animals are

1229
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
upset. So hopefully our podcast is not

1230
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
doing that. The whole town is at the bail on

1231
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
the town. Yeah and people are getting headaches

1232
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
and inner ear infections.

1233
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
But it could be happening because of us too.

1234
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
They're going to have to piece it together like

1235
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
all these doctors across the world.

1236
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
But the reason is that actually

1237
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
the mine was fine. We all blamed

1238
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
the mine. What was really going on

1239
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
is that everyone in that town were ardent

1240
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Podcast the Ride fans.

1241
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Yeah the dogs howl along

1242
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
when we start explaining new

1243
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
restoration systems. A doctor is

1244
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
like let me ask you this question. What do you think

1245
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
of King Features Syndicate?

1246
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
And the person just passes out and they're like I knew

1247
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
it. Podcast the Ride fan.

1248
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
And they're like we have to get you

1249
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
off this. You have to listen to something like smartless.

1250
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
We have to unimprint you. You need to listen

1251
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
to better podcasts.

1252
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
The good stuff. Yes.

1253
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
And doctors recommend smartless.

1254
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Right exactly. That's what I was saying.

1255
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
It's never caused an aneurysm.

1256
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Right. So I am excited because

1257
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I am like priming my

1258
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
daughter for a ride now which is kind

1259
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
of cool. Like yeah I'm very

1260
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
excited to see that when she does it in person

1261
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
what that's going to be like. Which it's closed

1262
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
right now. We're also we can't go because

1263
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
we have the cheap pass.

1264
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
It's all summers kind of. I think

1265
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
we're back in August. We could be

1266
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
back in August. Yeah I'm back in August.

1267
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
We've been looking at going and all of

1268
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
July is blacked out. Which fair enough.

1269
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Sure. And that

1270
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
indicates a place you maybe don't want to be anyway.

1271
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Even though I've heard it's empty all

1272
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
summer. That's what people have been saying.

1273
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Or it's a lot emptier like this summer

1274
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
than Disney would like.

1275
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
So there's not as many people going.

1276
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Well I was reading

1277
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
some accounts

1278
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
that have American flags

1279
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
in their user names and they're saying

1280
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
that's because of this new Tiana right.

1281
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
And even though that's in Disney

1282
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
World and not Disneyland

1283
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
just the whole brand has such a

1284
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
stink at this point that

1285
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
people are avoiding it like a

1286
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
plague. User Breyer Ryan

1287
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Yeah.

1288
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
1776.

1289
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
With the

1290
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
there are a couple of those by the way if you

1291
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
haven't seen this people that have Breyer something or

1292
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
their like icon is

1293
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
a version of them. He even made that joke and I assume

1294
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
No that is real. I've seen a handful

1295
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
of that going on.

1296
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
It's like the person on TikTok who's like

1297
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
they closed the ride. I need

1298
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
my daughter Breyer after.

1299
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I've seen people

1300
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
try to trash the Tiana ride by

1301
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
taking a video of

1302
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
the ride that has like stalled or

1303
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
like the lights have come on because they needed to evacuate

1304
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
and use like a piece

1305
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
of the video where there's not

1306
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
much going on and the lights on

1307
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
and people evacuating to like make

1308
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
it look bad like they're

1309
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
using. Yeah. They're

1310
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
strategically using pictures to try

1311
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
to like get a narrative going.

1312
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
And then they just and then they insert

1313
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
video of Biden just staring

1314
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
off into the distance like and then they just play

1315
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
this and you go by a screen and

1316
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
just plays Biden.

1317
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
That doesn't help anything. Yeah I know

1318
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
there's a lot of screens on the ride now and most of them

1319
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
are just Biden staring. Yep.

1320
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
That's what's happening. Occasionally MSNBC

1321
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
and frankly that takes me

1322
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
out of it. Yeah. That's not what I want

1323
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
on a ride. They don't even own that

1324
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
channel.

1325
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
They aren't even being synergistic. Truly

1326
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
it makes no sense.

1327
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
So you're getting ready for this one and let me see here

1328
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I think I can speak to the Disneyland

1329
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
one more

1330
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
and I watch ride throughs of all of them just to understand

1331
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
the differences. And you know

1332
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
there aren't vast differences I would

1333
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
say between the four versions of the obviously

1334
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Tokyo not included.

1335
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
But it's very

1336
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
it is many adventures

1337
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
the title is correct.

1338
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
In tradition of the

1339
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
original feature that put shorts together

1340
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
you kind of jump through

1341
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
greatest hits Winnie the Pooh

1342
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
adventures. It's blustery day

1343
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
it's rainy you meet

1344
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Tigger have the lumps and

1345
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
woozles. Pooh has a party.

1346
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Pooh at the end is

1347
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
in hog heaven

1348
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
in a little little honey pit with all

1349
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
the honey you could ever want. In some

1350
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
of the other ones but in the

1351
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Disneyland one it just goes

1352
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
it's your birthday! Happy birthday!

1353
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
That does kind of

1354
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
come out of nowhere doesn't it? Yeah it's a little

1355
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
sudden but watching

1356
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
the Florida one and the Disneyland one

1357
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
back to back I'm like oh I think they either

1358
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
had more room or more money

1359
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
in the budget like it just seemed

1360
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
a little less

1361
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
cheap in the way the Disneyland one

1362
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
is fun but a lot of it is

1363
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
peanut flats.

1364
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Yes true. I

1365
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
though want to stand up for the

1366
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
charm of the Disneyland

1367
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
one. Oh sure.

1368
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I now yeah

1369
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
look if I take out of it that it took out

1370
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Country Bears and that's not so hard to do.

1371
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
I like Country Bears but was I so

1372
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
addicted to this attraction that

1373
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I don't remember being like upset

1374
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
when it went away. I remember being

1375
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
confused because it was right before the movie came

1376
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
out and is that not the worst time

1377
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
in the world to take the why would you

1378
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
take out a living ad

1379
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
for a movie you're putting into theaters.

1380
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Very strange.

1381
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Didn't hurt the film which turned out

1382
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
glorious and is a

1383
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
esteemed classic that we revisit to this day.

1384
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Jason didn't look up from

1385
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
his iPad once while I was saying that.

1386
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
I was trying to read and screen grab

1387
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I had a text.

1388
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Just catching up on some business

1389
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
going through Texas spreadsheet

1390
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
looking at some receipts.

1391
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
No about Poo.

1392
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
It was screen grabs of Wikipedia.

1393
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
I was just double checking.

1394
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Poo P O O H

1395
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
got it. Yes.

1396
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Yeah no it wasn't just a big my

1397
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Dookie note is different.

1398
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Your what? My Dookie

1399
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Dookie note. My Dookie note.

1400
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Do you know what that is?

1401
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Like doo doo. Like poop.

1402
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
You never heard it called a Dookie?

1403
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
You if anyone should know what Dookie is.

1404
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
I know I'm slow I didn't put the poo

1405
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
connection to it I'm sorry.

1406
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
You had to wrap your head around the idea that Jason

1407
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
keeps a Dookie note which presumably

1408
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
is some way that he tracks the

1409
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
color consistency. I thought it was

1410
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
this thing the youth say. I thought it was like some

1411
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
youthful thing he was saying and I was like well I'm

1412
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
lost again. Well you said it

1413
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
a long time ago. Listen to that

1414
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
album.

1415
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Alright you're right. That's when you were with it

1416
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
is when kids were saying Dookie.

1417
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I bought Dookie like six years after

1418
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
it came out. I was not ready

1419
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
for Dookie when I was that old.

1420
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
1994 I was not ready

1421
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
for the explosive

1422
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
raw punk rock of Green Day.

1423
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Yeah so I

1424
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
agree with every one of those words that you

1425
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
said about it. I bought blood sugar sex

1426
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
magic in like year 2001

1427
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
and that's many many years after it came out.

1428
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
So this is part of it these are cause it's all

1429
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
your high school music.

1430
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
In some ways it is cause

1431
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
the first Green Day album I bought was Warning

1432
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
I think which is like 2000.

1433
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Yeah I know.

1434
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
It's after Nimrod. You can't

1435
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
start with Warning. I learned how to play

1436
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I learned how to play

1437
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
the guitar from listening to Warning.

1438
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
There's still

1439
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
like pieces of Warning in the way

1440
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I play guitar.

1441
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
So ultimately Warning was

1442
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
an indelible influence on the

1443
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
guitar work of my girls. It was yeah.

1444
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Learning how to play power chords

1445
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
from like the song Cast Away.

1446
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
And it was actually like I

1447
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
picked it up fairly fast which I think

1448
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
like made me keep playing.

1449
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
So I owe a lot to Green Day. Future Club 3

1450
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
topic.

1451
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
If anybody wants to throw it into a poll

1452
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Mike just plays guitar

1453
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Scott and Jason sit and listen and

1454
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
shut the fuck up. Yeah. My dream.

1455
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
And we have to with photographic

1456
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
evidence prove that we didn't leave.

1457
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I guess it could be a video. We could do a video.

1458
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Yeah we'll just yeah. At least at least

1459
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
proof. At least with a time stamp.

1460
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Several time stamps beginning and end.

1461
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Sitting our asses down and listening

1462
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
to you playing guitar.

1463
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Listening to me play guitar specifically the song from

1464
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Warning. Podcasting is

1465
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
conversations and conversations are

1466
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
about listening and sometimes conversations

1467
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
are about listening to your

1468
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
co-worker jam on guitar.

1469
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Yeah. Nail Warning.

1470
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
You all say you're like maybe it could be a video

1471
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
you kept going into like you know

1472
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
maybe it could be like you know down low on me and maybe there's like

1473
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
a fan that's blasting my hair and maybe

1474
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
a smoke machine.

1475
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Maybe it could be at the Wiltern.

1476
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Maybe we could shoot at the Wiltern.

1477
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
We could just sit off on stage. We're on sale.

1478
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Sure.

1479
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
There's a song called Blood Sex and

1480
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Booze on Warning as well and that's not quite

1481
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Blood and Chocolate or Blood.

1482
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
There's two words there.

1483
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
So that's pretty good.

1484
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Yeah.

1485
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
And then the ride not to bring it back

1486
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
too long to Country Bears.

1487
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Did anyone else come across

1488
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I never saw this before

1489
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
I have no idea about this

1490
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
proposal or how far it got.

1491
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
There was a proposal for a

1492
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Country Bear racing attraction

1493
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
called Critter Country

1494
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
500. Oh right.

1495
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
We talked a little bit about this I think in the

1496
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Country Bear week.

1497
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Yeah there was an idea to take the characters

1498
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
in the Country Bear characters.

1499
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Yes and there's some art

1500
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
from it and I wish

1501
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
that was there. That would be awesome.

1502
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Sounds really cool. Sounds really good.

1503
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
It seems like if the ride is cool

1504
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
enough that it doesn't matter

1505
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
that people know the mythology or don't

1506
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
or they know Winnie the Pooh better or not.

1507
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
That's the thing. Yeah that's the thing I would

1508
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
argue until I was blue in the face with any

1509
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
executive where I was like do you understand

1510
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
that the ride has to be awesome and if the ride

1511
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
is awesome people will tell other people

1512
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
it's awesome and they will come here

1513
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
to do the ride. Yeah.

1514
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
This is how all of your

1515
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
lore was created. It's all

1516
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
original stuff that people thought was

1517
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
awesome so they said you've got to see the Haunted Mansion

1518
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
or Pirates. Yeah.

1519
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
It was an IP then

1520
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
it was just a new ride they did.

1521
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
I don't know why this will never happen

1522
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
again. I mean I know why but

1523
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
I also don't know why. I don't know why you would

1524
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
be like we just have to make something that's so

1525
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
amazing that feels original and people

1526
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
have never seen before and they will go

1527
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
nuts for it more so than

1528
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
an IP thing or at least as equal

1529
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
as a good IP. Because people just want to

1530
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
keep their jobs. Yeah.

1531
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
I know why. And because it's Disney

1532
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
they still don't.

1533
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
So actually

1534
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
on the end of

1535
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
not built stuff for the

1536
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
space I remember the rumor

1537
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
and maybe I said this back then

1538
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
when this all came up I feel like I heard

1539
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
the possibility that something

1540
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
that they were exploring which and this is going to sound a lot

1541
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
cooler than what we got is that the Winnie

1542
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
the Pooh ride would have taken advantage

1543
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
of the river front

1544
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
nature of the

1545
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
of the building and that you

1546
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
would have like Splash Mountain gone into the

1547
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
river a little bit and what this might have been

1548
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
was a gentle kids

1549
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
rapid flume

1550
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
type attraction where you're in

1551
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
I'm going to guess a honey pot

1552
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
because that is round like

1553
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
like a rapids raft.

1554
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Yeah. That's the term.

1555
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
But doesn't that sound nice like a little like

1556
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
because I like any attraction like that

1557
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
and with a young kid now

1558
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
and being a scaredy cat kid myself

1559
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
like anything to like help me in

1560
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
lure me into the water. So if there had been like

1561
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
a tiny flume or a

1562
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
tiny

1563
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
rapids ride that would have

1564
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
helped me in the way the tiny coasters help

1565
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
a lot. The gateway ride.

1566
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
A gateway ride. Yeah.

1567
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
They wouldn't like that phrase

1568
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
on Welcome to Pooh Corner. That's true.

1569
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
I would advise against that. But

1570
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
also what you're describing is

1571
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
like what we always talk about liking

1572
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
is just something that kind of intersects with

1573
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
a different part of the park in a way or

1574
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Yeah. It uses what was there

1575
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
and ties it all together. Absolutely.

1576
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
That is like what I would pitch

1577
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
if I worked on an imaginary I would be

1578
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
yelling a lot at the executives and then I'd also

1579
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
be pitching stuff that goes into other rides.

1580
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Like we say it all the time. It's just

1581
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
like the train going through Splash

1582
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Mountain or the Skyway through Matterhorn.

1583
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
People move or going into Star Tours.

1584
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Yeah. So yeah. A little

1585
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
boat ride that started outside of the rivers

1586
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
but then like kind of went in it or

1587
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
a little bit around it and you could kind of see the Mark Twain

1588
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
or something. Yeah. Everything. I think it would

1589
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
have spun down a little bit.

1590
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
And then just bobbed into I think

1591
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Man that's awesome. Yeah. Imagine a tiny version

1592
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
of that drop on Guzzly River

1593
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Rapids. That's awesome. I don't know where I'm

1594
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
pulling that from though. That might maybe

1595
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
that was just a rumor. I don't know if that was

1596
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
ever anything they were actually doing. The idea is cool.

1597
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
The cool idea though of like because it's not

1598
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
inherent that a poo ride

1599
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
would be a dark ride, a Fantasyland

1600
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
style ride.

1601
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
And that's an innovative way

1602
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
to do one. Now what I was

1603
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
going to head for is kind of defending

1604
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
the critter country version.

1605
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
That to me is

1606
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
part of it. I

1607
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
I still have a tough time getting my

1608
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
head around Winnie the Pooh in

1609
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Fantasyland. It feels weird

1610
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
to me. Winnie the Pooh feels

1611
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
like nature, pastoral.

1612
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
I think this critter country

1613
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
placement makes more sense

1614
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
than the Fantasyland version. I don't

1615
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
like the critter country placement though. Really?

1616
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
I agree with you about Fantasyland

1617
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
but I also don't think he belongs in critter

1618
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
country. I think

1619
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
he does because

1620
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
I just I think

1621
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
the place making and some of it is left

1622
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
over from

1623
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Country Bears being there before.

1624
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
But I just I like

1625
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I like the trees there.

1626
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I like the little waterfall. That's

1627
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
one of my little happy places in the park. The little

1628
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
waterfall right when you get off that ride. It's kind of between

1629
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
the ride and the shops.

1630
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Like actually gentle

1631
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
relaxing contemplative

1632
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
a thoughtful spot as Pooh

1633
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
would say in the park.

1634
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I don't know. I like the rock

1635
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
work and I think those big

1636
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
I like those vehicles as opposed to

1637
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
honey pots.

1638
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
These are beehives. They're big beehives.

1639
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
I like being in this line.

1640
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
I find the line the outdoor queue

1641
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
very pleasant. I agree with all that.

1642
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
I like loading outside like Alice

1643
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
does it too. You get in

1644
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
outside and then you go inside.

1645
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Totally. Yes. I never thought about

1646
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
that but I like that too. Yeah. I agree

1647
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
with all of that and I like the Disneyland stuff

1648
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
better. I like that whole area

1649
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
like Hungry Bear. All of that is a little

1650
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
more quiet than like a normal

1651
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Disney spot in general. Gentle Browns

1652
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
it's a little autumn zone.

1653
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Over there. I'm glad it's all kind of it seems like

1654
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Tiana's retaining the

1655
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
vibe. Yeah. Like that corner is still really nice.

1656
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Yes and they made it fit and it

1657
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
it's better but

1658
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
I do think of Pooh Bear

1659
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
as a big book that you open up

1660
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
and that's what I think of with the Fantasyland

1661
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
rides. Oh okay.

1662
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
This is a good debate point. Yeah.

1663
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
I also

1664
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
like the big book. I

1665
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
was happy when

1666
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
the new Winnie the Pooh

1667
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
movie came out in what

1668
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
2010, 2011

1669
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
when was that?

1670
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
You know very like quiet movie

1671
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
that is not a blockbuster that new Winnie

1672
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
the Pooh they did but that's not the vibe

1673
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
of Winnie the Pooh either which makes sense.

1674
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
That's where the ride landed. It's gentle.

1675
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
It's aiming for gentle but I think

1676
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
they did a really good job with that movie making it

1677
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
feel like the shorts and making the book

1678
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
a big part of it. Yeah. Because that

1679
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
is like he bounces on the words

1680
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
and the narrator it's meta

1681
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
we go outside and he uses the

1682
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
words to climb to things

1683
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
or the words get all bunched up.

1684
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I love that stuff.

1685
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Now my counter

1686
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
to you Mike is going to be I don't think they have enough

1687
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
fun with that stuff. Oh that's true.

1688
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
I think that I look at

1689
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Hong Kong, Shanghai, Magic Kingdom

1690
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
and there are storybooks

1691
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
but he's not interacting.

1692
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
It's just open books

1693
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
and we're not having fun with that

1694
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
characters in this world can like

1695
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
hang off of a queue

1696
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
or go bouncing across a

1697
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
paragraph. If that stuff's happening

1698
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
now I like the book stuff.

1699
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I know that they do the book

1700
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
interaction in Tokyo

1701
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
and that's one of the many things that makes

1702
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Tokyo a superior experience.

1703
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Yes. There for sure is that in

1704
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Tokyo. I think I'm more so

1705
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
saying that like I understand

1706
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
thematically why it makes

1707
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
sense to me more that Pooh is in Fantasyland

1708
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
even though it doesn't because it's a storybook.

1709
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
It's a storybook.

1710
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
It opens and closes with books like all the fairy tales

1711
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
do. That makes sense.

1712
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
It's a dumb thing to be like they all start

1713
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
with books so they all go in the same place

1714
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
which is what I'm saying but that is

1715
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
kind of how I justify it to myself.

1716
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
I feel like it's different types of books.

1717
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
I think this is a book in a

1718
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
kid's nursery in this idyllic bedroom

1719
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
as opposed to Sleeping Beauty,

1720
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Cinderella where these are

1721
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
like the Bible. These are

1722
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
these ornate works.

1723
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
It feels too like

1724
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Victorian medieval.

1725
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
I can't square Pooh in medieval.

1726
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
That's what's weird. And you think Toad fits better

1727
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
in that you think? Yeah I think so

1728
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
because it's like Spires and

1729
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
English and Countryside.

1730
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
I think because it's like

1731
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
structures, buildings, halls. That makes

1732
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
sense next to a castle as opposed to

1733
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Winnie the Pooh lives in like a tree stump.

1734
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
That doesn't make sense for a castle.

1735
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
They kind of

1736
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
2010 in

1737
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Disney World, they added

1738
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
an interactive

1739
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
queue

1740
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
where like you can go in little

1741
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
houses and you play in gardens

1742
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
and

1743
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
I think

1744
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
that Florida

1745
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
queue, there are giant

1746
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
pages but you just

1747
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
kind of walk by them.

1748
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
You don't really play with it. I mean maybe

1749
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
play with it in the interactive. And by the way if this wasn't

1750
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
said, part of why I was doing that big argument

1751
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
was, I don't think I

1752
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
clocked this before, that the Critter Country one is

1753
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
the only one that doesn't have the book.

1754
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
And I think it's good. I think it's good

1755
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
that they didn't do book here and they just kept it

1756
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
forest

1757
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
leaves, that vibe.

1758
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Here's what I think would actually be the ultimate

1759
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
is if it was some more of the theming

1760
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
from the Disneyland version, but

1761
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
placed in Fantasyland not by

1762
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
the castle stuff.

1763
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
More like a little mermaid wise.

1764
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Oh sure, yes.

1765
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Little Mermaid is Fantasyland

1766
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
in Florida, but

1767
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
it is not like connected to

1768
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
the castle in the way that those rides are.

1769
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Like feel like they're almost doors you're

1770
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
entering in the castle in a way.

1771
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
In some ways I thought of it like that when I was a

1772
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
kid in Disneyland as well.

1773
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Like you're kind of like going into the rooms in the castle.

1774
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
So like that makes sense

1775
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
that Pooh shouldn't

1776
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
have anything to do with the castle.

1777
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
So that's right.

1778
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
We're saying the same thing.

1779
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
We're coming to an agreement.

1780
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
But yeah, it's interesting.

1781
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Because yeah, critter country, I'm like Pooh's not a critter.

1782
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
I know he's a stuffed

1783
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
animal, but I don't know.

1784
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Critter is from the south or something

1785
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
and there's like a little animal

1786
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
with a country accent and they're playing a fiddle

1787
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
or something. And he's English.

1788
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
He's English, it's not the same vibe.

1789
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Critter, you gotta say the word

1790
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
like this

1791
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
or whatever and Pooh

1792
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
that's not Pooh.

1793
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
We need a dang Pooh.

1794
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Yeah, now if they wanted to do that ride

1795
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
where they just had like a Slim Pickens

1796
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
style voice

1797
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
like do the Pooh story or something

1798
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
and all the characters had southern accents

1799
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
then okay, let's fucking go.

1800
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Let's do that.

1801
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Because that sounds funny.

1802
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
That sounds good.

1803
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
So I'm like,

1804
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
it's a bear, I get it. There were bears there before.

1805
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
But the country bears are critters.

1806
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Do we got somewhere better in Disneyland

1807
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
to put this?

1808
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Space wise? No.

1809
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
I guess. Fantasy, but Fantasyland

1810
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
somewhere.

1811
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
If you could carve out space somehow

1812
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
in like Parade Route,

1813
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Autopia side of

1814
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Fantasyland, Autopia Fantasyland

1815
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
side goes away.

1816
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Like Fantasyland but somewhere else.

1817
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
That's kind of your ideal spot. Is that not

1818
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
kind of what it is in

1819
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Japan? Yeah.

1820
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
That is not connected. Fantasyland

1821
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
adjacent. Right.

1822
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
It's sort of, I'm trying to think, maybe

1823
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
I'm getting the geography wrong in my memory

1824
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
but it feels like it's

1825
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
where the storybook boats are in

1826
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Disneyland almost. Sure.

1827
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Kind of like that. Something like that would work too.

1828
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Not that I'm trying to evict those. No, no.

1829
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
But yeah, that feels more right.

1830
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Because you could build up a little like hilly

1831
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
sort of facade. Totally.

1832
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
If they decided to get rid of the theater,

1833
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
the former Videopolis, that could be a good spot.

1834
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
That would be perfect too. Up in the hills.

1835
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
So it's not that Fantasyland doesn't work.

1836
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
We agree that Castle

1837
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
is strange. I think Castle is strange.

1838
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Well and the ideal is that

1839
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
something like that happens and that it

1840
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
doesn't evict country bears.

1841
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
But it happened.

1842
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
I think it was probably the right

1843
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
move for them ultimately.

1844
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
I think so.

1845
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
It feels like the Pooh Bear ride is never

1846
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
that long of a wait.

1847
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
It feels like it's not that popular.

1848
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
And I don't know if that's true or not.

1849
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
I was thinking how.

1850
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
I think this is a ride that you could use

1851
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
as, I don't know if this is the right

1852
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
term, but Canary

1853
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
and the Coal Mine potentially.

1854
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Because if you are, not that this

1855
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
happens anymore because you have to book many days

1856
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
in advance, but in the old pop down

1857
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
days where you're like,

1858
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
do I feel like popping down today?

1859
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
How are those wait times? That could be

1860
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
a ride, that's a wait time

1861
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
that you look at and you go, that's pretty big.

1862
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Maybe I don't bother

1863
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
making the trip.

1864
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Do you guys have those?

1865
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Because my big one is

1866
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Monster's Inc. If I saw Monster's Inc. at like

1867
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
45 to an hour, then

1868
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
I'm not going anywhere near that place.

1869
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
I think that's different now. I think that could be on a

1870
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
normal day, it's 45 for an hour.

1871
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
I think it's sort of changed.

1872
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Yeah, I don't know. I feel like that's changed.

1873
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
And that's maybe just, that's not right.

1874
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Do you guys know what I'm talking about?

1875
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
I know what you're talking about.

1876
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Or is there no number that will make you not

1877
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
go today?

1878
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
I think I'd go the other

1879
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
way, and I'd look at what the e-tickets

1880
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
are at.

1881
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
If they are unreasonable.

1882
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
That's what I think I do too, but I think what you're doing

1883
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
actually maybe makes more sense.

1884
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
It indicates, if it's stressful over in

1885
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Monster's Inc. then it's going to be really stressful

1886
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
over in Big Thunder or whatever.

1887
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
It is funny that we all have these sort of general

1888
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
ideas that still I think

1889
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
kind of make sense as

1890
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
far as what a wait time should be.

1891
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Because like the last time I was there with my family

1892
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
I'm looking at the, or I think

1893
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
with Lindsay and I actually were just alone

1894
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
the last time we went for a couple hours

1895
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
and we were looking and it was like

1896
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Guardians was 90 minutes

1897
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
and I was like something is wrong.

1898
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
This isn't, it's never

1899
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
it's always an hour. Guardians is always

1900
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
an hour, 45 minutes or an hour.

1901
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Unless it's like end of the day or start of the day.

1902
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
And I kept checking and kept checking

1903
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
and we did do Genie Plus

1904
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
and I was trying to find it. Genie Plus didn't work

1905
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
and I was like something's wrong and then sure enough

1906
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
later I learned that one of the

1907
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
elevator shafts has shut down now.

1908
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Or they had to fix it or whatever.

1909
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Of course, it's never 90 minutes. Something's wrong.

1910
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
And I have it in my head.

1911
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
You diagnosed a problem.

1912
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Because I just know

1913
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
the wait time for Guardians and it's

1914
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
still that way.

1915
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
I think I'm more like, I'll take a look at Space Mountain.

1916
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Space Mountain is like, Space Mountain

1917
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
sometimes can be 90 minutes during the day I feel like

1918
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
or longer. And if it's

1919
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
like Space Mountain's 35 minutes

1920
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
or 40 minutes or whatever, 45 minutes

1921
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
you're like, that's not so bad.

1922
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Because that one's always a pretty long wait.

1923
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
But yeah, poo is an hour.

1924
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Forget it. We're in a lot of trouble.

1925
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Because I think poo being around half

1926
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
hour is probably more than it should be.

1927
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Yeah, and I wouldn't wait half hour for

1928
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
poo. 15 maybe?

1929
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
I did kind of a long

1930
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
maybe in the 25

1931
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
minute range and it was a little hot

1932
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
and that didn't leave the best taste in my mouth.

1933
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
However, on this particular day

1934
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
this was my family meeting up at

1935
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Disneyland with just

1936
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
accidentally there, like we got to do at least one ride

1937
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
together with friend of the show

1938
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
BugmaneBuzzBuzz and

1939
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
MamaBug. MamaBug.

1940
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
I don't know how you say

1941
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
BizBiz?

1942
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
BizBiz.

1943
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
BizBiz, dear.

1944
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
It was a delight to hang with the whole

1945
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
and we all, that's a group

1946
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
of five that's exactly what

1947
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
fits in the

1948
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
honey pot, or no, I was in the beehive

1949
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
rather. So it was perfect.

1950
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
That's a very fond memory.

1951
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Yeah.

1952
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
This is a good

1953
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
corner of the park. I mean, obviously

1954
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
now it connects to Galaxy's Edge.

1955
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
It's not a dead end

1956
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
anymore.

1957
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
But it's sort of off

1958
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
to the side and

1959
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
I'm sure this will change when

1960
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Diana opens out here because that'll be packed

1961
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
for the foreseeable

1962
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
future.

1963
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
But like, yeah, Hungry Bear

1964
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
has a lot of seating.

1965
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
The food's

1966
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
okay. Sometimes

1967
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
it's better than others.

1968
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
And there's a ride without too long a

1969
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
wake and some shops,

1970
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
a candy store

1971
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
you can wander through. You can get the

1972
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
candy store. You're just waxing

1973
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
idyllic about Critter Country. You find

1974
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
longing for the candy store.

1975
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
You find Critter Country just to be

1976
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
basically a pleasant place to

1977
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
be. Yeah, it is pleasant.

1978
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Well, because

1979
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
New Orleans Square really gets

1980
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
out of hand sometimes with the

1981
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
crowd. Yes.

1982
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
That gets really nuts.

1983
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
A difficulty you have though

1984
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
with Critter Country is that dead end nature.

1985
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
I remember in early

1986
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
kid visits that

1987
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
like, okay, I think of all the things

1988
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
in this park, I think he would dig poo. I think

1989
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
poo could be good. But it is, it's

1990
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
way out of the way. It is not, there's,

1991
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
it's not on the way to anything.

1992
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
It is a gamble. If a day where it's getting

1993
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
hot and it's getting, like, you get,

1994
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
that's going all the way into a corner and all the way

1995
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
back and you're nowhere near Main

1996
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Street and the Hub. It ended up being

1997
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
worth it. We've had, we've had positive experiences

1998
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
on that with, with our little

1999
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
The meet and greets are there.

2000
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
You can go buy it on the train.

2001
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Now that's one, like, oh, the

2002
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
train will be even better

2003
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
when Tiana's opens back up.

2004
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Because I think right now it's just

2005
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
pitch black when you go through.

2006
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Oh, you get to see the finale again.

2007
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
You get to see the finale. That will be nice.

2008
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Yeah, yeah, I'm looking forward to that. Toontown

2009
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
though is a similar way where it's like, Toontown

2010
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
it's almost like you're, you're doing

2011
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
a voyage, if you have a kid, you're doing a voyage

2012
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
to the moon. And you're like,

2013
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
okay, it's going to take a long time to get

2014
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
back to Toontown. Whatever we do in Toontown

2015
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
then we got to get back out if this goes

2016
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
wrong. So it's like you, there's not

2017
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
an easy escape in Toontown. There's not an easy

2018
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
escape in Critter Country.

2019
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
And depending on if there's parades, what's going

2020
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
on, it's like, there is a feeling of like,

2021
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
well, here goes nothing when we go, we're

2022
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
going to Toontown. Yeah. Toontown

2023
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
much worse though, because you

2024
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
coming back in a parade

2025
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
route, it's a lot of

2026
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
garish colors, terrible

2027
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
food. Well, that's a whole

2028
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
yes, that's a whole nother discovery, but yes, you're right.

2029
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
One great ride, one pretty good

2030
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
ride back there, but

2031
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
yeah, it's, I think it's

2032
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
more of a gamble than

2033
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Critter Country.

2034
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Yes, I think so. And it's a little

2035
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
more, yeah, it's a little more unpleasant, a little

2036
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
more loud, a little more aggressive.

2037
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
This is an interesting, these are different

2038
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
ways that we are viewing the parks, that I don't

2039
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
think we ever thought about like making the

2040
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
trek. If we're going to make the journey

2041
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
over to, it's like getting stranded

2042
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
on an island overnight or something, or like

2043
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
having to do a layover. Are we really

2044
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
going to really want to be laid over in Toontown?

2045
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Yes.

2046
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
With kids in play. Yes.

2047
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
It's just a different, I mean, in a similar way

2048
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
you would be like, Toontown is like,

2049
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Toontown's so far away, not so

2050
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
loud. But now with a kid you're like,

2051
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
oh, and especially now, if you

2052
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
get stranded there, the meltdown

2053
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
happens in Toontown, we're in

2054
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
trouble. Yeah, yeah. So it's like,

2055
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
maybe we stick, yeah,

2056
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
stick closer.

2057
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Yeah, I apparently

2058
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
people are saying that if they do do

2059
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Disneyland Forward where they build up

2060
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
next to the hotel, Disneyland Hotel,

2061
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
that there would be like

2062
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
that dead end in Critter Country would not

2063
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
be a dead end any longer.

2064
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
That would be the place that crosses over to

2065
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
how?

2066
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Would you have to demolish, would it go through

2067
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
like the stores?

2068
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
I've thought about, listener,

2069
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
if you don't know what we're talking about, that they approved

2070
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
all of this land over

2071
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
across Disneyland Drive

2072
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
that is going to start getting converted

2073
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
into theme park land. But what we don't know yet

2074
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
is if it's a full third gate over there

2075
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
or if it's expansions of Disneyland

2076
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
and California Adventure

2077
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
connected by weird bridges.

2078
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
This all is going to make it, so like,

2079
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
I've always thought of Disneyland as kind of this nice

2080
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
clean little circle, and now it's going to

2081
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
be very strange.

2082
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
It's going to, like, there's this extra appendage,

2083
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
you know? Disneyland's going to look like it's got

2084
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
like an extra vestigial

2085
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
tail. Yes, it's going to, both

2086
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
parks will have little tails if it's just

2087
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
that we're expanding

2088
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
the current parks. Yeah, so like Splash Mountain's

2089
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
here, and the parking lot stuff is

2090
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
all here. So you would have to go out.

2091
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
You would have to go out. I think you don't,

2092
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
wouldn't you, would you have to blow up the stores,

2093
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
the booze stores, or would it be

2094
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
like a cast? I don't know. Because that's kind of

2095
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
like a backstage

2096
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
exit entrance. Well, I think

2097
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
on the other

2098
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
side, I forget whether it's

2099
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
the other side of

2100
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
New Orleans Square or the other side of

2101
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Critter Country, there

2102
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
is precedent that

2103
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
was the area where Walt

2104
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
would have company picnics

2105
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
early on. Okay. Like we

2106
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
would entertain large groups. Those were

2107
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
the kind of beer gardens.

2108
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Is there, well, what's there now?

2109
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
I think the downtown Disney parking lot.

2110
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Oh. So yeah, so there's just,

2111
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
so that's Poo Corner, that's the gift shop, and

2112
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
then the road is here, Disneyland Drive.

2113
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
So you could probably just have

2114
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
like a tunnel or a bridge or something.

2115
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
I bet it can't be a tunnel, can it?

2116
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
They blow up a tunnel under the road?

2117
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Maybe? I am confused because

2118
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
I saw someone stayed

2119
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
in that new

2120
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
tower at the Disneyland

2121
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Hotel, and there are rooms

2122
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
at that tower that exit

2123
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
out onto

2124
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
a walkway that looks

2125
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
onto just a road and a park

2126
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
behind it. So I'm like,

2127
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
wait, how would they wrap Disneyland

2128
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
forward? There's no

2129
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
room. There's just a public

2130
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
road here. You mean behind it? Like

2131
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
what do you? Behind the

2132
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Vacation Club tower.

2133
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Oh. I don't know. I think

2134
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
the hotel is like a dead end.

2135
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Yeah. Like the hotel,

2136
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
because the hotel's not going anywhere.

2137
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
So north of hotel is Disneyland,

2138
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
south is California.

2139
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
I think that's why it can't be like a clean

2140
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
third gate. Right, unless they switch

2141
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
that to the other parking lot.

2142
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Or they build a land that goes

2143
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
up above the hotel.

2144
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
And those towers are about

2145
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
20 stories or so.

2146
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
But if they could build a floating land

2147
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
that casts shadow like Mr.

2148
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Burns' sun machine onto

2149
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
everything at the hotel,

2150
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
maybe that works.

2151
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Go up 20 stories.

2152
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Do we have a preference third gate or

2153
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
expanding out on the sides of the hotel

2154
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
like that?

2155
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
It seems weird, but

2156
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
I think my preference is always third

2157
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
gate. If it's the parking

2158
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
lot, if it's the current

2159
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Toy Story parking lot, I guess my preference

2160
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
is that and new gate. Just

2161
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
because there's more of an opportunity, I feel like, for

2162
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
interesting stuff. But

2163
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
I thought that was like more of

2164
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
a Disney Springs kind of situation.

2165
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
That's what the talk is and that's what the plans are.

2166
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
But that was a while ago.

2167
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
They're zoning it all to be something, like it could be anything.

2168
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
I just want to know what the new,

2169
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
because like, to get a new park

2170
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
name under the current name structure.

2171
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Right, right.

2172
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Ooh, I'm just looking at my chops

2173
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
thinking about how much punctuation is

2174
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
going to be in that, baby.

2175
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Disney wish world.

2176
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Colon slash hyphen.

2177
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Okay, what

2178
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
else about these ride?

2179
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Moments in it, anything

2180
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
that we like. I like

2181
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Heffalumps and Woozles in general.

2182
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
I think it's very clever.

2183
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Like, sure, it's all flats, but I think

2184
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
they're clever with the flats. I like

2185
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
that it's, they,

2186
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
there are those

2187
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
silhouettes that, like, they've

2188
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
cut the shapes of the Heffalumps and

2189
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Woozles and then behind it,

2190
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
the pattern rotates

2191
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
and changes. So it looks like

2192
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
they're changing stripes and colors. I think

2193
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
that is a very clever, I think we're doing

2194
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
some, like, fun

2195
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
house, you know, like,

2196
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
cheap but effective

2197
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
little tricks in there. Well, there's a whole

2198
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
different vibe, I think, to the

2199
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Disneyland version versus Disney World

2200
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
version. And that way you're talking about

2201
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
fun, like, a fun house. There's, like, a day

2202
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
glow neon

2203
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
thing going on a little bit.

2204
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
I mean, as far as, let me see

2205
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
here. Like, Heffalumps

2206
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
and Woozles, this is from 2022.

2207
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
They didn't, unless they changed it in the last two years

2208
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
at Disney World, but I don't believe that's the case.

2209
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
But there is very much

2210
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
more of, like, a bright kind of

2211
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
neon happen. Like, this is Heffalump

2212
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
and Woozle in Florida.

2213
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Okay. Yeah. So more like

2214
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
the Pleasure Island sequence in Pinocchio

2215
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
or something. Yeah. And then the Disneyland

2216
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
one is this. This is the color

2217
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
scheme, which is a lot more neon.

2218
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Right, right. A lot more, like,

2219
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
black light poster

2220
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
style. And the whole ride

2221
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
kind of like that. Yeah. Wait, now God,

2222
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
now I'm confused about which is which. I feel like

2223
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
I forgot. Was it always that way here?

2224
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
That's a good question. Are the Shanghai

2225
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
ones?

2226
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
The micro differences between

2227
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
these are very hard to parse. I know

2228
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
that Owl's House is

2229
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
not in Disneyland, but it's in Disney

2230
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
World. Yes. Well, and it's

2231
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
got the picture on the wall of

2232
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Toad giving Owl

2233
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
the deed to Toad Hall. Great.

2234
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Yes, which is nice. We like that.

2235
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Yes. Yeah. Continuously.

2236
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
I think I like the more

2237
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
weird, like,

2238
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
at Disneyland,

2239
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
if you look up and over your shoulder,

2240
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
you can see Max Melvin

2241
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
and Buff mounted

2242
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
on the wall around the Hevelum

2243
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
sequence. Yeah.

2244
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
That is weirder.

2245
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
That does seem like something you'd

2246
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
see in a nightmare.

2247
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Just a bunch of non-moving

2248
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
animal heads. Yeah.

2249
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
They're dead. They are finally dead.

2250
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Yeah. They were reanimated

2251
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
for the show. They ain't singing no more.

2252
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Also in Disneyland,

2253
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
apparently the mechanism

2254
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
of Pooh is in a hot air balloon

2255
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
at some point. Oh, right.

2256
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
That is the repurposed

2257
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
mechanism that Teddy

2258
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Bara used to...

2259
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Wow. Bara used to... That's cool. Yes.

2260
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
...use to get up and down. Well,

2261
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
that's smart. Yeah.

2262
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
You have to applaud the Imagineers for

2263
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
reuse. Yes.

2264
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
I guess not the most exciting

2265
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
thing to applaud them for, but... And that

2266
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
is something you really can make someone

2267
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
zone out with when you explain

2268
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
while you're on the ride. Yeah.

2269
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
That is just...

2270
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
That fact couldn't excite me more

2271
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
and be more nothing

2272
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
to an average person.

2273
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
This is really...

2274
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
This is so cool. This is the mechanism from the

2275
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Country Bear show that used to be here. Swinging Teddy

2276
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Bara used to be this. She would come down from the ceiling

2277
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
and she started saying, and then Henry would kind of want to go

2278
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
up there and he was horny for her. But like,

2279
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
they're still using it. It's still the same. Like,

2280
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
no way. Nobody cares. Nobody cares.

2281
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Then you had the question, what are country bears?

2282
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Right. Right. What's Teddy Bara?

2283
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Right. Why are the

2284
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
bears horny? Right. Why did you whisper

2285
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
all that? Why did you whisper so

2286
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
long? You said it so fast, too.

2287
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
I couldn't even keep track of what you were saying.

2288
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
You were so excited about it. You were speaking another language.

2289
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
This is a first date and it is

2290
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
ruined. You were losing

2291
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
them when you were like, there's a buffalo

2292
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
and a moose head. Like,

2293
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
and if you were losing them with that,

2294
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
you sealed the deal

2295
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
when you start talking about reusing

2296
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
that. Sealed the deal in a bad way.

2297
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Yeah. Sealed the deal in losing them.

2298
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
I see. Yeah. Yeah. You sealed

2299
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
the deal of the breakup.

2300
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Of checking out. Yeah.

2301
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
This is the final straw.

2302
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
You sealed the deal of the

2303
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
let's not do this again via text.

2304
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Yeah. I know this is

2305
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
first date, but I feel the need to

2306
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
tell you I'm taking the kids to

2307
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
my mother some reason.

2308
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Yes.

2309
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
I don't think

2310
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
that Disney World, you, we were talking

2311
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
about right before we started recording and Jason said

2312
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
the Disney World version is like better. You said

2313
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
it was more elaborate. It just looked

2314
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
in video. I was like, this one looks

2315
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
more built up. And I think there's

2316
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
elements of it like, they might have had more room

2317
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
or a larger budget. I think there's

2318
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
more room and like when you go in

2319
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
or when you first kind of enter the

2320
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
ride, there is like

2321
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
I don't know, kind of like these

2322
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
three dimensional, like

2323
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
I don't know what you call them. It's like part of like a

2324
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
shed or

2325
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Owl's House. Yeah. Yeah.

2326
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Owl's House like giant

2327
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
pieces seem to

2328
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
shift and shake around. Right. Versus

2329
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Disney land version where

2330
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
you just have these flats of like a barn door

2331
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
with some leaves on them. Yes. And that's

2332
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
like. Well, we're not comparing

2333
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
the same sequence here. No, I know.

2334
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
I like when you go past the barn

2335
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
doors. That's just an

2336
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
introductory sequence. And I think that's something

2337
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
you might see in any. That's not too

2338
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
different than Alice in Wonderland. I think that's an

2339
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
unfair comparison. However, I

2340
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
understand that there are more complex aesthetics

2341
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
and craft going on.

2342
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Right. And I'm just trying to compare a version

2343
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
of like walking, going through something.

2344
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
That being said, I still think I like Disneyland better.

2345
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
I like the color scheme better, even though it's not

2346
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
quite the color scheme of the like

2347
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
cartoon. Sure. But

2348
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
it is a much more fun looking

2349
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
color scheme. They play up

2350
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
the blustery day. I think

2351
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
blustery day is nice.

2352
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
It's just all nice. It's a weird

2353
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
ride to be mad at. I don't know if anybody

2354
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
now is mad at it.

2355
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Somebody probably remembers the, you

2356
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
know, any of the scandals

2357
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
from years ago. Because like, look

2358
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
at this. The Tigger here, and this is Disneyland.

2359
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Tigger and Disney World.

2360
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Oh, so

2361
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
they do more ultraviolet light.

2362
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Yes. Stuff. Yes.

2363
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Better lit. Yeah. I will

2364
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
say, the Shanghai, the

2365
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
newer versions they've built, I think the rain

2366
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
effects look really nice. Yeah.

2367
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
I don't know, maybe they've plussed them up here

2368
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
in ways I don't realize, but like all of

2369
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
the projected stuff seems pretty

2370
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
sharp. Otherwise, nothing, there's nothing

2371
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
that insane going on

2372
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
in the other ones. Hong Kong, though,

2373
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
deeply popular, usually runs

2374
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
out of fast passes and wait times over

2375
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
120 minutes

2376
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
on peak. How about that? We're saying

2377
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
like I wouldn't do more than 30.

2378
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
They will gladly do 120

2379
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
minutes, gladly. They will

2380
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
forcibly do 120 minutes

2381
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
in Hong Kong. That's very interesting.

2382
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
The last button,

2383
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Florida, they're trying

2384
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
to start the party, and they're like, where's Pooh?

2385
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
And he's in a big honeycomb, and he goes, start

2386
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
the party without me. Like, really

2387
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
quick as he's like chowing down

2388
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
on honey. Yeah. Start the party

2389
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
without me. Start the party without me. He's got

2390
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
a mouthful of honey. He's got a mouthful of honey.

2391
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
And he's just having the time of

2392
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
his life. That's good. Like, a little

2393
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
less abrupt, kind of a good joke.

2394
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
You mentioned Shanghai.

2395
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Shanghai almost got

2396
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
into, there

2397
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
was, I don't know how much

2398
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
concern on Disney's end. There was

2399
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
worry they might have to change it

2400
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
in the late

2401
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
2017-2018.

2402
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
There was

2403
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
a bit of an issue

2404
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
that, in China,

2405
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
people were

2406
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
making memes of

2407
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Xi Jinping, the president,

2408
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
and comparing him to Winnie the Pooh.

2409
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Right. Especially after this

2410
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
picture of

2411
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Xi Jinping

2412
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
and Obama

2413
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
walking looks very much

2414
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
like Pooh and Tigger.

2415
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
I mean, kind of.

2416
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
One's taller than the other. Yeah, one is tall.

2417
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
I can think of

2418
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
two people here who might look like Pooh and Tigger.

2419
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
I don't disagree

2420
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
with that. But I think people

2421
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
just were tweeting a lot of pictures

2422
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
of Winnie the Pooh. But they were like, we're going to

2423
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
make the president mad if we

2424
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
have Winnie the Pooh here.

2425
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
They were banning it on

2426
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
their

2427
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
heavily fired, well, internet,

2428
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
heavily censored

2429
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
internet. And so

2430
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
there was like, is Disney

2431
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
going to have to redo this? I think

2432
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
it probably would have made him look very

2433
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
stupid if Disneyland Park was

2434
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
we have to re-theme the

2435
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Winnie the Pooh ride.

2436
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
The party

2437
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
and the president don't like

2438
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
this. Yeah. That would

2439
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
have made them look worse.

2440
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Well, I think they should have just kissed up all the way

2441
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
and just made it an animatronic of

2442
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
the president. Yeah, put him in the ride.

2443
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Just make it his.

2444
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
He's caught in a tree trunk.

2445
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
He's caught in a honeycomb.

2446
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Xi Jinping

2447
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
as a rumbly tumbly.

2448
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Problem solved.

2449
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Yeah, there's some cool stuff in

2450
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
that version of the ride. And like

2451
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
it's all just like a little different from each other,

2452
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
which I like, I appreciate.

2453
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
It's not quite the like

2454
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
neon of the Disneyland.

2455
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
But it does kind of have its own like

2456
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
lighting, its own kind of color

2457
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
scheme. Pooh floating off

2458
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
seems like a really good effect

2459
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
in Shanghai.

2460
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
They seem to do that well. But I like this beat in

2461
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
all of them. I like that

2462
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
you follow a projection

2463
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
for a little bit in the Disneyland

2464
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
one. And it reminds me of following

2465
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
the croquet ball

2466
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
in Alice in Wonderland. I think the whole

2467
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
thing reminds me of Alice in Wonderland, which I like.

2468
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
I like that like it's

2469
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
a similar

2470
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
length of vehicle. It's in an odd place.

2471
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Like it feels like

2472
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
kind of outside of the main four

2473
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Fantasyland attractions.

2474
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
That might be a lot of why I like

2475
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
the one here. It feels like of a piece of Alice

2476
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
in Wonderland. Like the oddballs,

2477
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
you know, but still good

2478
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
dark rides that have like little

2479
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
clever effects. And also

2480
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
isn't just like the next time you're trying to go

2481
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
to sleep, just like picture yourself

2482
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
being Winnie the Pooh.

2483
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
I can't imagine a more relaxing way

2484
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
to just imagine yourself

2485
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
becoming opaque and floating

2486
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
off into the air in

2487
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
just a shirt, pants, yes.

2488
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
He's so, that is the deepest

2489
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
sleep. I am, boy would I love

2490
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
to get that Winnie the Pooh sleep.

2491
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
I know. I want that sleep.

2492
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Yeah, yeah. The medication has

2493
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
to be involved to get that kind of sleep.

2494
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
For me, yeah. Like they have to induce a coma

2495
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
to get me to actually relax and

2496
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
fully like have the healing effects

2497
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
of sleep happen to my body.

2498
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
It's just like, yeah

2499
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
I cannot sleep. I

2500
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
stopped drinking caffeine to try

2501
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
to do that. I'm like, you know what? That's gotta be

2502
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
what it is. I'm gonna stop drinking caffeine

2503
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
and the sleep is gonna get so good and it's gonna be

2504
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
so restful. That didn't change

2505
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
at all. No. What the hell?

2506
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
This was supposed to fix all my problems.

2507
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
It fixed none of them.

2508
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
What time did you use to stop

2509
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
caffeine?

2510
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
The afternoon caffeine? I would try

2511
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
to stop it by one, but once

2512
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
in a while I'd go up till three or four.

2513
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Okay. But no, it almost didn't

2514
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
change anything. Yeah. I was expecting

2515
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
some crazy cool thing

2516
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
that was gonna happen. I was gonna be like a different person.

2517
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
No, same person. Same shit.

2518
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Same stuff happened to me.

2519
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
I have an ambient

2520
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
problem.

2521
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
My quill doesn't work so well

2522
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
anymore. I have to do

2523
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
the harder stuff.

2524
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
I have to do the things that really put you

2525
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
out on your ass. I'll sleep for

2526
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
24 hours straight.

2527
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
It's a little bit

2528
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
creepy. It got to the point where

2529
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Yuna-san was keeping me up.

2530
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Where are you even getting these pills,

2531
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
they say. I really can't.

2532
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
You do have a like, it's

2533
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
an inward whistly thing to it.

2534
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
I don't know how you're doing it. Yeah, I don't know.

2535
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
I would annoy Lindsay with it like 10

2536
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
years ago.

2537
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
I think

2538
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
most of my impressions, it just turns cloying after

2539
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
a while and weird and creepy.

2540
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
I think he was like, I think he might

2541
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
have been strung out when I was doing it 10 years ago.

2542
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
It's really hurting

2543
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
my voice for a gentle impression for some reason.

2544
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Oh bother.

2545
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Oh my.

2546
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Wait, just say, I'm just going to feed

2547
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
him to you. Just say, my throat's torn to shit.

2548
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
My throat is torn to shit.

2549
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Owl,

2550
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
give me a lozenge.

2551
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
I do think I used to be like,

2552
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
oh this is what I used to do. I used to be like,

2553
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Piglet, I'm sick. Piglet.

2554
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Piglet, I need help.

2555
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
I need help, Piglet.

2556
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Please. And it's like, stop doing that.

2557
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
That's annoying and creepy.

2558
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
And I'd be like, no, you don't understand.

2559
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Something's wrong with me, Piglet.

2560
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
I have a tear in my anus.

2561
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Poo, I don't, that doesn't

2562
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Are you sure about that?

2563
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
We all have tears, poo. We're made of stuff and fluff.

2564
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
No, you don't understand. The stress has ripped me

2565
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
open again.

2566
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
It's not the same thing as if it were to happen

2567
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
to the humans. I need you to fix me.

2568
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
I need you to fix me. Get the string.

2569
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Get the needle and thread out of

2570
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
the cupboard. I'm going to head

2571
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
into the creek for a little bit. I'm going to go for a round of poo sticks.

2572
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Why don't you take a breather?

2573
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
The door's locked. You'll be here

2574
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
with me tonight, fixing me.

2575
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
There's not enough air for

2576
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
two people in the stump, poo. I hope Christopher

2577
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Robin taught you how to sew.

2578
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Poo and Piglet are fighting

2579
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
again.

2580
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
We're not fighting.

2581
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
We're just having a disagreement.

2582
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Yelling about his

2583
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
anus. That is what it was. It was,

2584
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
it was a bit where poo was really,

2585
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
something was wrong with him. And I would just

2586
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
do that for a while. And

2587
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Lindsay didn't like it. I think you need more help

2588
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
than a little pig can give you, poo.

2589
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
I don't think so.

2590
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
I think you have everything I need.

2591
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
I need a blood

2592
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
transplant. A stuffing

2593
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
transplant, please.

2594
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
That requires a doctor.

2595
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
You can't just do that. I'm a doctor

2596
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
now. Your body might reject mine.

2597
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
I'm a doctor. I'll put on my stethoscope.

2598
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
No

2599
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
offense, poo. And this is a bad time to tell you this.

2600
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
You're not smart. Poo and Piglet

2601
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
haven't been the same

2602
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
since they got into a challenger

2603
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
situation with Kanga.

2604
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
I want to make love to you and Kanga.

2605
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
This is all in Blood and Honey. We're doing Blood and Honey

2606
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
scenes, I think. Yeah, yeah.

2607
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
We're just doing it. No, this will

2608
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
just occur. We just, we said

2609
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
at the start of this

2610
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
episode, anybody can make a poo movie.

2611
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
We just made our little poo movie. We did it.

2612
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
And it's legal, finally.

2613
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Sleeping pills have driven poo insane

2614
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
to where he maybe

2615
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
wants to eat Piglet.

2616
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
And Eeyore is

2617
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
just keeping far away from

2618
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
the whole thing. I'm kind of acting

2619
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
like a Greek chorus.

2620
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
These two

2621
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
right again.

2622
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
We should wind it down.

2623
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Anything

2624
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
else we want to shout out about these

2625
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
or like, do you want to

2626
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
I mean, maybe there's a Poo's

2627
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Honey Hunt episode at some point down the road.

2628
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
But like, in terms of like

2629
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
basic jealousies, I mean

2630
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
now, okay,

2631
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
here's my defense versus

2632
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Poo's Honey Hunt is that sometimes

2633
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
you have a space where a ride

2634
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
could go, but it's not

2635
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
the space, the massive warehouse

2636
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
that is needed to build big

2637
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
state of the art trackless attractions.

2638
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Sometimes there are weird little

2639
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
plots of land that have

2640
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
the same amount of

2641
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
acreage as like a Burbank

2642
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
dentist's office would. And would you rather

2643
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
have a ride in there or not? Now,

2644
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
that said, why could they not do

2645
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
a, you know,

2646
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
a little ride that's on a

2647
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
regular kind of track that has some of the

2648
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
more innovative animatronics

2649
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
that Poo's Honey Hunt has?

2650
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
I mean, I'd love the whole thing.

2651
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
I want a trackless honey pot.

2652
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
That sounds great, but

2653
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
you know, the elevated stuff

2654
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
they do is really

2655
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
cool. There's no, I mean, like

2656
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
there's no reason to not have that

2657
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
advanced animatronics

2658
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
besides money. Yeah.

2659
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
And I'm, yes, this used to be a

2660
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
theater on this land.

2661
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
So it was not a dark ride or anything.

2662
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
So I'm sure, yeah, there's not a ton of

2663
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
land here, but yes,

2664
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
there were elements that were

2665
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
much more expensive in Tokyo

2666
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
that they didn't go with because

2667
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
it's cheaper and we know, blah, blah, blah.

2668
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
We've complained many times before.

2669
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
But Boy

2670
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
is like Poo's Honey

2671
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Hunt almost like an e-ticket to me after

2672
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
going on it. And it's just

2673
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
that is a 45 minute wait that I'll

2674
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
do, that I would do, I think.

2675
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Fairly regularly.

2676
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
30, 45. There is

2677
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
a difference, yes. Now, they might have

2678
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
something pretty right about the trackless

2679
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
ride system. And this is the first Disney

2680
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
one, correct? I believe so, yeah.

2681
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
That, you know,

2682
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
of your myriad

2683
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
of Rise of the Resistance complaints,

2684
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
the one that I could get the closest to

2685
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
is it, I don't

2686
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
know if I agree with your phrasing about it, not

2687
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
fucking me up. I don't think I want the vehicle

2688
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
to fuck me up. But sometimes

2689
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
these trackless vehicles are a little bit lacking in

2690
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
thrill because they can't

2691
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
really turn you

2692
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
and pivot you and shake you up the way that a regular

2693
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
track can. So

2694
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
a trackless vehicle being gentle

2695
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
makes a lot of sense.

2696
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
Beauty and the Beast seems very successful.

2697
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
We haven't gotten to go on it.

2698
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
And this does too.

2699
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Maybe trackless vehicles more often

2700
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
should be aiming for gentle.

2701
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
That might be what they're the best at.

2702
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
I do agree with that. And like

2703
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Mickey and Minnie, they work pretty well.

2704
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
But like my favorite

2705
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
scene, or one of my favorite scenes

2706
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
is the dancing section.

2707
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
And it is because the vehicle does kind of a different

2708
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
thing because you're taking dance lessons

2709
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
with Daisy. And it's kind of jolting

2710
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
you back and forth in a kind

2711
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
of an aggressive manner. Yeah, you slide

2712
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
around. You slide around and you're like

2713
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
there's like a variation

2714
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
on what you're feeling on a ride.

2715
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Depending on the ride, important. And Pooh,

2716
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
there's a bouncy section of the Pooh's

2717
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Honey Hunt that I'm

2718
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
actually not even sure if the whole

2719
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
floor is, I'm not sure what's happening.

2720
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
It just feels like you're all, I don't know.

2721
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
I don't know. I don't know. Maybe that's something to investigate

2722
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
when we do the full Pooh

2723
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
thing. But like that's the most jealous

2724
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
I am of that. Because you go in this little

2725
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
room, there's like screens of Tigger

2726
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
and then it's the Tigger song

2727
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
and you're bouncing up and down in the vehicle.

2728
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
And you know, you already like, if that was your first

2729
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
time going on a trackless ride vehicle, which at the time

2730
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
it was, for us.

2731
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
But like then you go, oh this thing can go

2732
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
up and down. And that felt like just such

2733
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
a unique way to

2734
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
use that ride system too. And again,

2735
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
I don't know if the whole, maybe the whole floor is bouncing.

2736
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
I'm not sure. Because like,

2737
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
why wouldn't you use that bouncing thing?

2738
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
There's no way the entire floor

2739
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
is bouncing. It seems silly, I agree.

2740
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Would it propel the entire vehicle up?

2741
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Or is it an illusion?

2742
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
It has to be in the vehicle.

2743
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Why have none of the other

2744
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
trackless rides used something like that?

2745
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Because there wasn't a character that bounced that called

2746
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
for it. I don't know, but you could have got shot

2747
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
and bounced. Think about it. Give me a picture.

2748
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
How is the entire floor moving?

2749
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
There's no way. That seems silly, you're right.

2750
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Yes. It's too heavy.

2751
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Every trackless ride vehicle is very heavy.

2752
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
And there's people on it.

2753
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
It probably wouldn't be reliable either.

2754
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
That everyone bounces correctly and safely.

2755
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Maybe you go right on a big trampoline.

2756
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
And there's a couple people under just pushing.

2757
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Or a big robot arm.

2758
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
No, I like the people pitch. I think they have

2759
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
full time employees.

2760
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
I guess it has to be in the vehicle, but it's

2761
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
I just think they would have used another

2762
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
used that somewhere else.

2763
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Once you introduce a trampoline,

2764
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
you up the likelihood

2765
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
of hearing the phrase, oh no, Tommy

2766
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
fell off and broke his arm.

2767
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
That's just automatically introduced.

2768
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
What is that from?

2769
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Kids fucking

2770
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
themselves up and back here at

2771
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
trampolines just produce

2772
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
broken arms.

2773
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
But that room I think is the one I'm most jealous

2774
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
of.

2775
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
In addition to just

2776
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
fancier looking robots.

2777
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
And yes, like a perfect

2778
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
use of that ride system.

2779
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
The gentleness.

2780
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Yeah.

2781
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Because yeah, I think now I'm a little

2782
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
bit sick of that ride system.

2783
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
In some ways where I'm like, yeah,

2784
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Mickey and Minnie could have maybe been different

2785
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
if it was a different ride system.

2786
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
I really like Mickey by the way. I'm not putting

2787
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
that right down.

2788
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
I think that's a very successful trampoline ride vehicle.

2789
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
I think Mickey and Minnie might be the best one

2790
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
at the big American parks.

2791
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
That feels organically.

2792
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
I think any of them could use this thing that

2793
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
they can go into different paths.

2794
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
You know, and I

2795
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
have the

2796
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
bizarre leftist opinion that Rise

2797
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
of the Resistance is an excellent ride.

2798
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
So I will stick to that and say

2799
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
that's a very well done ride.

2800
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Bernie bro. Biden bro.

2801
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Lieutenant Beck bro.

2802
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
They should build a

2803
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
track and stride vehicle that has like an arm,

2804
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
like a kook arm on the part

2805
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
on the ground.

2806
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
And then that could like whip you around

2807
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
aggressively.

2808
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
But you can still have that smoothness.

2809
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
I mean, this is not out of the question.

2810
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Well, you know what would be cool is if a

2811
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
trackless ride vehicle went inside

2812
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
kind of a bigger shell

2813
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
that drops you and it becomes

2814
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
a drop ride as well and then you leave

2815
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
in a different way.

2816
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Oh, that is what happens in this ride

2817
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
that is a good ride.

2818
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Another one where you end up outside.

2819
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
It's just a couple

2820
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
letter grade.

2821
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
I didn't get to see my friends.

2822
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
I didn't get to see my friends.

2823
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
There could have been friends and you could get fucked up.

2824
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Those are two things. You want to get

2825
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
fucked up with your friends and you don't get

2826
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
fucked up with your friends when you go on Rise of the Resistance.

2827
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
So that's just a fact.

2828
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
You can't deny that.

2829
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
I want to dislocate my shoulder while

2830
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
the Han Solo watches.

2831
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
Han, I hurt myself.

2832
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
I don't care.

2833
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
That's exactly what I want you to say.

2834
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
You my friend. This ride is great.

2835
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Luke the giant sliding cannons

2836
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
grievously injured me.

2837
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Yeah, and Luke's just like

2838
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
haha, he's giving you one of the

2839
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
good work

2840
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
young Jedi.

2841
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
So yeah, I think that

2842
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
that's a plus up. They can do it.

2843
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
They can't fuck you up but they can

2844
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
end your friends. One of those classic

2845
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Luke Skywalker chill

2846
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
lines, chill cool lines

2847
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
is always saying. Well if it's post Return of the Jedi

2848
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
when he's kind of got that calm sort of

2849
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Jedi thing going before he goes to

2850
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Ock 2 and betrays

2851
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
everyone for 20 years

2852
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
then he would have that calm. He would be able to

2853
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
give you a chill line. I suppose, yeah.

2854
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Give you a chill

2855
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
lime. Chill lime.

2856
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
That's nice.

2857
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
I mean I can't argue with, of course

2858
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
I like the ride but would I like to drink a nice

2859
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
refreshing cocktail with Luke Skywalker?

2860
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Here's a Pooh Bear plus up. I would

2861
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
love that 90s Pooh Bear song somewhere.

2862
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
I know it doesn't fit the

2863
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
vibe of a lot of these things.

2864
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
But I wish that, even throw

2865
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
me a bone and put that in

2866
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Toontown now because they're doing kind of music

2867
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
or music or jazzy versions

2868
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
of Disney afternoon

2869
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
songs. There's like

2870
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
a jazzy version of Eye to Eye playing in

2871
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Toontown which I like and there's a rescue, like a

2872
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
jazzy rescue rangers.

2873
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
We need a little more Pooh Bear. They have turned

2874
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
their back on this song. This is a fantastic

2875
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
song. I really agree.

2876
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Yeah. I don't know anyone, I don't know

2877
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
who was involved in it.

2878
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
I don't know who put it together but boy is it

2879
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
great. And like I just, yeah when you think

2880
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
about like towards the end

2881
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
like Pooh Bear I gotta

2882
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
be there.

2883
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Oh man. I like it. As with all

2884
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
of these songs, they influence my music

2885
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
taste in a big way. I am

2886
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
chasing pop songs that feel like the

2887
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
new adventures of Winnie the Pooh.

2888
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
It feels in the family of those,

2889
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
the rescue rangers and the duck,

2890
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
like it feels. Of course and it's under acknowledged.

2891
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Yeah. It doesn't, yeah you're right.

2892
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
It doesn't show up anywhere. Right. I'm glad we took

2893
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
this time to say how great that song

2894
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
is. Yeah. Completely under acknowledged.

2895
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Yeah.

2896
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Yeah.

2897
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
You know, play, I would say play it

2898
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
at the beginning and end of the day

2899
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
at the park at large. Yeah.

2900
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Many times throughout just on

2901
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
you know

2902
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
if Main Street Electrical Parade comes back

2903
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
ditch the song, play that song instead.

2904
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Yeah. Use it as the fireworks backdrop.

2905
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
Use it as the score to rise

2906
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
the resistance there. We fixed it and you like the

2907
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
ride now. Oh my god that would be awesome.

2908
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Star Wars movie,

2909
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Star Wars.

2910
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Yeah change the lyrics I suppose.

2911
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Looking for maps.

2912
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Always looking for McGuffin,

2913
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Star Wars.

2914
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
And silly old Lieutenant

2915
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Beck.

2916
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Maybe we deep dive

2917
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
on that song and that's a second gate somewhere

2918
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
along the line. The Pooh Bear song from

2919
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
the 90's cartoon.

2920
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Who did this for us?

2921
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Or just the themes in general I bet.

2922
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
That is a good episode idea.

2923
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Oh just go to the themes. Yeah, you're right.

2924
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
And try to determine a best one

2925
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
officially. I have an opinion already but

2926
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
I could be swayed. Okay.

2927
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Okay. Yeah.

2928
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Well yeah, hey that's a good one. Let's do

2929
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
that. I love that. I'm glad we talked about that

2930
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
but for now you survived podcast

2931
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
the ride.

2932
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
And I think we kept things positive

2933
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
about this attraction. Yeah.

2934
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Really quick let me say

2935
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
your rocket launcher thing Mike.

2936
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
I forget if that's been on my main feed

2937
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
ever that you take out a rocket launcher

2938
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
you pick two rides. Which one do you

2939
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
got no time to decide. If it was between this

2940
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
and Buzz Lightyear, Buzz

2941
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Lightyear is gone. I think that's more

2942
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
flat, less charming.

2943
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Yeah.

2944
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
I would, Buzz you're out. Jason

2945
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
what do you think? Between those two?

2946
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Yeah.

2947
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Yeah, that's a tough one.

2948
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
I don't know. Three.

2949
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
It might be Buzz. Two. One.

2950
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
It might be Buzz even though

2951
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
this Buzz is better

2952
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
than Florida's Buzz. Yeah I

2953
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
guess, I guess I say

2954
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Buzz too. I guess cause there's

2955
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
other Toy Story 2

2956
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
representation in the park but I do, I really

2957
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
go on Buzz anymore also.

2958
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
Probably less so than Pooh.

2959
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
So yeah I guess Buzz even though I don't,

2960
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
I'm not like happy about it. Great.

2961
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
I'm not going to be gleeful when the

2962
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
rocket hits it or whatever.

2963
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
But. At least Zerg is dead.

2964
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
That villain of Zerg finally got what was

2965
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
coming to him.

2966
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000

01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
even better Winnie the Pooh

2974
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
related song though? Oh yeah please.

2975
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Mike I wonder if this is something you know already.

2976
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
I wonder. Do you know,

2977
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
alright, I did the show

2978
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
the intro in kind of a Winnie the Pooh

2979
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
narrator way. The Winnie the Pooh narrator is

2980
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Sebastian Cabot who played

2981
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Mr. French on Family Affair

2982
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
correct? Which came up on a second gate.

2983
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Of course. As an idea

2984
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
of the kind of boring

2985
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
stuff Jason and I were talking about.

2986
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Here's what a boring tangent

2987
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
would be about. Family Affair.

2988
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Anyway he was kind of a pre-Mr. Belvedere

2989
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
right? Yes. Stuffy English guy.

2990
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Great narrator for Winnie the Pooh.

2991
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
Do you know about his album?

2992
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
I don't know. Oh boy.

2993
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Holy shit. I'm glad I can.

2994
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Holy shit. Never in a million years could you

2995
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
guess what the Sebastian Cabot album is.

2996
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
So all you need to know is that he's the

2997
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
narrator of Deep in the Hundred Acre Way. That's all you need to know.

2998
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
And he

2999
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
decided to get with the times.

3000
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Address what the kids are

3001
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
thinking about and liking. Good.

3002
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
And he did an album called

3003
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Sebastian Cabot Actor

3004
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Bob Dylan Poet. Really?

3005
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
It is a front to back

3006
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
full spoken word

3007
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Bob Dylan Covers album.

3008
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Wow. And I think this would be

3009
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
good exit music. Here now

3010
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
through the same voice that gives you

3011
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Winnie the Pooh is

3012
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
the song Like a Rolling

3013
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Stone. No way.

3014
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
Once upon a time you dressed

3015
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
so fine.

3016
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
You threw the bums a dime

3017
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
in your prime, didn't you?

3018
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
People call, say

3019
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
beware doll, you're bound to fall.

3020
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
You thought they were all kidding you.

3021
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Used to laugh

3022
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
about everybody that was hanging out.

3023
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Now

3024
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
you don't talk so loud.

3025
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Now you, you don't seem so proud

3026
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
about having to be scrounging

3027
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
for your next meal.

3028
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
How does it feel?

3029
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
How does it feel

3030
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
to be without a home?

3031
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Like a complete unknown.

3032
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Like a rolling stone.

3033
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Now you've gone to the finest

3034
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
school all right, Miss Lonely.

3035
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
But you know you only used to get

3036
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
juiced in it.

3037
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Full album

3038
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
of that. Wow. That's every track

3039
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
is that. This little like whimsical

3040
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
arrangement of the

3041
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Bob Dylan song. Yeah, chimes.

3042
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
This is pre-Rocket Man.

3043
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
It's very Rocket Man-ish.

3044
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Yeah, as much as

3045
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Dylan inspired many after

3046
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
him, Sebastian Cabot certainly inspired

3047
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
William Shatner.

3048
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
In that story of the

3049
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
hurricane, the man the authorities

3050
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
came to blame.

3051
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
How's it feel?

3052
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Feel the

3053
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
without a home.

3054
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
And then roll, make sure, let's try when you hit

3055
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
rolling like a rolling

3056
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
stone.

3057
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
Hey Winnie the Pooh, how's it

3058
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
feel? I don't know. What did I do?

3059
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
You cut that together with the

3060
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Pooh opening clips of that

3061
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
with the Winnie the Pooh. Yeah, there's

3062
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
like a way you can slot in.

3063
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Gotta get going.

3064
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Gotta see a friend of mine.

3065
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
He's round, he's fuzzy.

3066
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
I love him because he

3067
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Pooh Bear, I gotta

3068
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
be there.
