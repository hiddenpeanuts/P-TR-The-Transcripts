1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,040
For many years, this podcast has narrowed its focus to actual theme parks that exist

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,040
in reality.

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:16,260
But in a year when reality was skewed and no theme park actually existed, except in Florida,

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:22,120
we had no choice but to flee to the theme parks of our dreams.

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:27,520
The theme parks conjured by Hollywood's best and brightest, like Steven Spielberg, Michael

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,360
Crichton, and Jeff Phillips, writer of the fourth three ninjas movie.

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,800
Today the fictitious will fight.

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,160
Fake blood will spill between theme parks from movies, television, and children's horror

11
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,160
novels.

12
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:47,160
The ultimate clash of rides we can't go on, lines we can't wade in, and parking lots we

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,520
wish to God we could park in.

14
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,280
It's the fake theme park final four on podcast The Ride.

15
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:22,520
Welcome to podcast The Ride, a podcast about theme parks, and yet again, the only podcast

16
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,760
that does a bracket premise.

17
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,880
I'm Scott Gardner, joined by fellow originalists Mike Carlson.

18
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,880
I am here.

19
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,680
I'm feeling very innovative.

20
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,160
Like I am every year.

21
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,400
I feel very trailblazing.

22
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,000
That's a way to feel.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,800
Scorching trails.

24
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,800
Clear in the brush.

25
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,800
Jason Sheridan also joins us.

26
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,600
You know, there's nothing more satisfying than being an early adopter.

27
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,600
Absolutely.

28
00:01:52,600 --> 00:02:00,560
And, you know, when you're such big college basketball fans, as are we, we're merging

29
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,720
our passions, theme parks and college basketball.

30
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,600
We could go on and on listing our favorite college basketball teams, but we don't have

31
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,600
to do that.

32
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,760
Our load is clear in this bracket format.

33
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,360
Slower moving, lower scoring.

34
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,360
Terrific.

35
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,360
Why watch the NBA?

36
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,360
You know?

37
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,240
Knowing that they're all getting their education as well when they're not on the court.

38
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,480
Tell me their majors.

39
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,760
Tell me how much they're not being paid.

40
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:34,880
Or like they have to go to weird dinners, weird booster club dinners to get like petty

41
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,720
cash from weird, eccentric alumni.

42
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:44,520
How much is this video game platform not paying them for their likeness?

43
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,520
You can hear it.

44
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,520
We could go on.

45
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,520
But yes.

46
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,560
The list of what we love.

47
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,440
But we also love theme parks.

48
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,960
And an area of love within theme parks is fake theme parks.

49
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:03,160
This is an area that we essentially, we have not covered a ton, I wouldn't say.

50
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:11,000
All of the many fake fictional theme parks in movies, television, and other media.

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,760
This is an area we've pretty much avoided.

52
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,200
And we realized this might be a fun way to like address a bunch of stuff, hit it quickly,

53
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,360
say some cool factoids, and maybe in the process discover which are the ones with more meat

54
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,440
on the bone to do an episode about and which have very little meat on the bones at all

55
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,880
and get tossed into the bone pile.

56
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,040
Yes.

57
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,480
We could do, you know, one episode on each of these.

58
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,720
But yeah, this will tell us.

59
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,720
Now this is a sample.

60
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:40,880
This is a Whitman sampler episode where you get to see like, oh yeah, that feels like

61
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,680
they should talk about that longer.

62
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,040
Or hey, maybe they shouldn't talk about this one ever again.

63
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,040
We'll see.

64
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:47,800
Yeah.

65
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:54,360
And it's a real interesting crop of entrants this year from all sorts of media.

66
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,440
And what are you guys going to be looking for today, you know, for the winners?

67
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,360
That's a good question.

68
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,160
I mean, there's a lot of things to analyze here since we're talking about things that

69
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,800
appear in movies and TV.

70
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,800
I'm trying, as usual, I try to separate myself.

71
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,320
I try to really focus in on what we're talking about versus the things that surround it.

72
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,840
So last year when we did fake smells, I was saying I I'm trying not to put in my bias

73
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,800
toward the actual ride.

74
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:29,040
I'm trying to just talk about the smell itself, try to appraise how I feel about the smell

75
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,080
and how it fits in.

76
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:38,600
So, so today I'm trying to analyze the park just as a park, but attractions, atmosphere,

77
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,480
that type of thing versus actually saying, well, I like this movie that it appears in.

78
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,640
That's what I'm going to try to do.

79
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,400
Last year, I wasn't able to completely divorce myself from the other things, but I will try

80
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,160
again in earnest this year.

81
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,280
Yeah, I couldn't agree with you more.

82
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,760
Absolutely. Because it is easy to have biases and we may still have biases.

83
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:03,800
This list includes some of my favorite movies and TV shows.

84
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,240
So what might be considered across the board, just some of the greatest movies and TV

85
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,000
shows and certainly some of the worst, some of the worst things ever made.

86
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,240
But that doesn't mean that they can't have a great theme park at the center or not at

87
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,680
the center or on the side.

88
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,440
I think it's all about innovation in that park that they're making up itself.

89
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:33,800
Yeah, I think commitment to the theme park specifics is going to be a big one for me.

90
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,760
Did the movie or TV show like use it?

91
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,120
Are they just phoning in the references, that sort of thing?

92
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,920
Is it almost an afterthought?

93
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,920
Which in some of these, it kind of is.

94
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,480
And then there were some surprises that really like went, might go all the way.

95
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,760
Yeah. And here's another here's another little thing.

96
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,160
And I don't know if you can always tell.

97
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,440
And maybe some of this will just be pure guesswork.

98
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:06,120
Did the people who made this, do they have some sort of legitimate affection for the

99
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,960
material?

100
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,520
For the rides, for the theme parks, or are they saying it's dumb and we hate it?

101
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,240
Because I'll say I'm going to actually have some more points, I think, for people that

102
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,680
seem like they know what they're talking about here with this parody.

103
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,440
That's a good point.

104
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,200
And you end up maybe with more attention to detail if you are if you really like the

105
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,560
source material or have strong opinions about it.

106
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,040
You know, within that, I would say that something I'll be giving bonus points to is

107
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:39,720
original IP, original characters, not just that they make up a ride, but also like do

108
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,160
they get the details right or the shops right or the restrooms right?

109
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,480
Is the entrance outside correct?

110
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,120
Is there other weird periphery?

111
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,640
And you'll see throughout, it's probably no surprise that there's a number of fake

112
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,840
waltz. Maybe enough to do a fake waltz competition.

113
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,680
That's that's we just thought of a new one, actually.

114
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,280
That is good.

115
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,080
Yeah, that is good.

116
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,520
Because there's fake waltz out there who aren't also in a fake theme park in a movie

117
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,360
or a TV show.

118
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,120
So yes.

119
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,200
But just because there's a great fake waltz doesn't necessarily mean that the park

120
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,040
is great.

121
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,680
So we'll see.

122
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,200
Yeah.

123
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,160
So there's so many different factors, so many variables today.

124
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,320
It's going to be really hard.

125
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,960
This is another one where I have notes up the seat.

126
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,360
I have tabs open on my computer.

127
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,240
It's really it's a lot.

128
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,320
There's a lot here to weigh into juggle.

129
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,240
Yeah.

130
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:40,920
If I could give a shout out to some of the ones who just didn't didn't make it this

131
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,400
year.

132
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,040
Oh, sure.

133
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:48,080
Some of our our ones we do know about, but did not make it, including you are a

134
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,640
reptar land from Rugrats in Paris.

135
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,760
Wonder War from Bob's Burgers.

136
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,840
Adrena land from the Fairly Oddparents, potato land and often cited like.

137
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,000
Talk about potato land.

138
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,400
Talk about potato land.

139
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,480
I'm sure we'll get to potato land at some point.

140
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,400
Potato land having its moment in the sun.

141
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,320
There's a photo op at Hollywood Studios right now in Orlando, you know, and we'll

142
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,320
get there someday.

143
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:14,880
I'm sure.

144
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,520
Yeah.

145
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:15,840
Yeah.

146
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,840
This this was a topic.

147
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,560
I think I saw this a couple of times.

148
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,760
People were throwing some ideas.

149
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,240
I wanted to I was trying to find like everyone who's ever thrown this idea at us.

150
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,480
And I found one person.

151
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:29,160
So if you also had suggested this, I apologize.

152
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,080
But Kyle Edsel has thrown this out in the Facebook group.

153
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,360
So I wanted to shout quick shout out and then shout out to anyone I've missed that

154
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,120
have thrown any of these type of ideas for a final four out.

155
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,400
Yeah.

156
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:39,800
Yeah.

157
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,160
Thank you.

158
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,080
Thanks so much.

159
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:46,640
We're excited to determine definitively the answers.

160
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,680
So though we like your suggestion, it is we who get to choose.

161
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,880
We are the arbiters.

162
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,320
So, you know, don't don't everybody get a big head and think that you get to pick.

163
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,920
This is not a fan voted thing.

164
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,320
This is the three of us were the experts.

165
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,400
We are our opinions are unimpeachable.

166
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,440
Yes.

167
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,720
And I an important reminder, all three of us were born in the mid 80s.

168
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:13,640
So there are some things in here that we have a lot of affection for and are kind of

169
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:19,440
maybe in I'll speak for myself at least glued into my subconscious and then other

170
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,440
stuff like Fairly Oddparents, a show I liked a lot, but just kind of would catch

171
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,080
like occasionally in high school.

172
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,640
It did not loom as large as some of the other entrance today.

173
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:31,680
Yeah.

174
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,240
Yeah, that does maybe affect who we we picked.

175
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,160
I also I was really tempted.

176
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,840
Did you I don't think you said this in your list.

177
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,040
I'm just curious to explore more.

178
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:50,280
I didn't really investigate the fake theme park majestic movie studios, which seems to

179
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:54,880
be a universal equivalent that's in the I'm sure fine feature film Alvin and the Chipmunks

180
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,000
Meet Frankenstein.

181
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,560
No, I have not.

182
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,480
Although I did while researching one of these other topics come across the direct to

183
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:10,360
streaming or direct to DVD movie Tom and Jerry Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory

184
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,960
where it appears Tom and Jerry go to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.

185
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,760
Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory.

186
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:22,120
Yeah, there's a few of those weird movies where it's essentially just the events of

187
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:27,320
the original movie and Tom and Jerry appear and are part of it, but do not drive the

188
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:33,360
story. They just kind of like run around in the margins and because they don't speak.

189
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,760
So how could they really drive the story?

190
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:42,120
So it's just like Willy Wonka goes along as it would, but also Tom and Jerry are

191
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,560
there.

192
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:49,200
That's that's like a lot like LeFou in the France Pavilion, that same movie where he

193
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,840
is in the background the whole time.

194
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,400
They were just stealing the idea from the Beauty and the Beast.

195
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,120
What is it called?

196
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,280
Sing Along?

197
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,920
Is there a more of a time?

198
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,280
I thought there was some sort of a time.

199
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:00,840
Whatever.

200
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,360
It might be a fancier name.

201
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,120
I'm not sure.

202
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,080
But Tom and Jerry might have gotten there first.

203
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:11,920
So when it comes to protagonists who are not protagonists and don't change the story,

204
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,760
Tom and Jerry are pioneers.

205
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,400
Yes.

206
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,120
I have one more thing to consider.

207
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,400
Maybe we can sort of hit this on an individual basis, but one I think one issue that we're

208
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,960
going to find across the board is that very often I'd say in half of these cases or maybe

209
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:32,080
even more than half the narrative function of a theme park in a movie or show is for

210
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,400
people to get endangered or hurt or killed.

211
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,080
Yes.

212
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,080
So how do we take that into account?

213
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:46,080
Do we have to like assess the level of danger at the place as a reason to go or to not go?

214
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:51,000
Do we have to like give the place the benefit of the doubt and say that they do not they

215
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,560
did not intend for people to die?

216
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,400
Although in some cases they definitely did intend for people to die.

217
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,800
Yes.

218
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:58,600
Yes.

219
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:06,880
Another also ran the park from the remake of I think the House on Haunted Hill from the

220
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,480
late 90s, which is different from the late 90s remake of the haunting.

221
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,800
A lot of ghost remakes in the late 90s.

222
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,600
So what do you do with that?

223
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,960
I mean, do you just have to it's like you have to acknowledge it.

224
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:26,560
And yet do you have to like imagine the ideal park in which danger and death does not occur?

225
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,320
Because they're all I mean, yes, so many of these the vast majority are unsafe.

226
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:39,920
So I feel like you just have to I'm going to try to judge it more based on the promise of it

227
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:48,440
versus the death reality, the reality of pain that these places are causing have caused.

228
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,120
That's my personal philosophy.

229
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,680
I'm not telling you guys you have to do that.

230
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:59,640
Like sort of imagine the place before the bad stuff have a go to the September 10th of all of these

231
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,560
places and imagine a better world.

232
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,080
Yes, that's what I'm saying.

233
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,120
All right.

234
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,720
Well, I mean, without further ado, I think we could start getting into it.

235
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,720
Let's kick it off with some one seeds.

236
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,640
You know, yeah, yeah, good.

237
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,000
Right.

238
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,600
One seed.

239
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,000
That's the like do that terminology.

240
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,400
I'm fairly familiar with.

241
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:21,760
Yes.

242
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,800
Yeah, not to give too much credit.

243
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,080
Well, if I'm guessing the number one is a good number.

244
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,200
So probably being a one seed is a good thing.

245
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,200
All right.

246
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,680
Sounds good.

247
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,760
Does anybody feel like kicking it off?

248
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,240
We could round Robin this.

249
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:37,600
Sure.

250
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,880
Who says the names?

251
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,720
That's another thing.

252
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,080
Right.

253
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:40,920
All right.

254
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:46,280
We're starting off hot with the Simpsons bracket, itchy and scratchy land versus Duff Gardens.

255
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,880
Yes.

256
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:57,400
Now there's a thing here already that we made the assessment and I guess nobody disagreed on not doing crusty land.

257
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:01,840
Do we have any thoughts as to why we all felt like that was that was OK?

258
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:17,720
Well, I think stuff was a losing point in my mind if there was a significant representation of it in three dimensional space in our real world, which there is a heavy reproduction of crusty land at the Universal Parks.

259
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,040
That's a good rationale.

260
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,720
It's almost not a fake theme park.

261
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,040
It's almost like a mini area of a real theme park.

262
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:29,240
Yeah, the the big map of crusty land that appears in the queue of the Simpsons ride obviously is not what is there.

263
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:35,800
But and also then they represented this crusty land in the Simpsons tapped out iOS game.

264
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,160
But there is Jason saying there is a piece of it that exists.

265
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,360
Yeah.

266
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,360
So that's a good rationale.

267
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,000
Yeah.

268
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,400
Yeah.

269
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:51,520
And I think there's maybe more variance between the two primary theme parks in Simpsons lore.

270
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,280
We might be unaware.

271
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:58,480
There may be like 12 more theme parks in the last 21 seasons that we aren't aware of.

272
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:05,520
There is the ones I recall, as Jason said from the time that we grew up in itching, scratchy land, death park.

273
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,960
Where to where to begin?

274
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:13,160
Golden Age Simpsons episodes and the itching scratchy land, especially looms large in my mind.

275
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,320
Extremely. I was so delighted that they would do this.

276
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,480
Imagine what you guys don't have to imagine.

277
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,360
You're probably the same way.

278
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,560
You love theme parks.

279
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:30,160
The Simpsons, your favorite show, does a big old theme park episode that is so specific with its Disney references and its visual homages to Main Street USA.

280
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,760
You're like, oh, my God, they're doing the movie and there's a five and dime and a penny arcade.

281
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,040
And they're watching the Roger Myers story, which has bars.

282
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:47,160
That's that's some attention to detail, not bars like rep bars, bars like when you watch a movie, at least you used to in a Disney park.

283
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:52,760
And you had to support yourself on weird beams that shows that they really paid attention.

284
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,400
Yes, that attention to detail.

285
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,800
I definitely I couldn't maybe articulate it at the time, but I felt it.

286
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:06,240
Obviously, Duff Gardens is half Disney, half Bush Gardens type of theme park.

287
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:13,560
Like I could feel I knew there was Disney parodies in it, but itching scratchy land definitely is much more Disneyland specific.

288
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,600
Yeah, the whole way through Disney World in a way.

289
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:22,640
And it's in the sort of level of intensity and the size and the mammoth operation to get there.

290
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,240
The big drive that's part of a lot of these things is the travel to the place.

291
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,640
They convey those experiences well.

292
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,120
I don't know, itching scratchy is tough to beat.

293
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,760
It is such a great episode.

294
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,280
Thinking about just everything about it.

295
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:42,320
The approach on the helicopter, the Jurassic Park,

296
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:50,720
as giant rock shapes of itching scratchy, the the bomb ticket booths on the way in.

297
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,040
You've got your itchy and scratchy money.

298
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:59,120
That's a real like specific slice of tribute to Disney dollars, which we should do an episode about.

299
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,920
I don't know how we've avoided that one.

300
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,200
That seems good and dry.

301
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,840
And apparently, yeah, the lands of itching and scratchy land, of course,

302
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:14,400
explosion land, torture land, searing gas pain land, unnecessary surgery land.

303
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,760
One of the funniest.

304
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,960
Theme park jail.

305
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,600
Yeah, we have your son and your older, fatter son.

306
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,320
Bort license plates.

307
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,240
Bort, of course.

308
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,360
Which they would eventually sell Bort merchandise at Universal Studios.

309
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:28,880
Yeah.

310
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,600
Oh, you can buy Bort stuff. That's cool.

311
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,680
You can. I don't know if you can at the moment.

312
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,920
For a while, they did have it at least on pins, I think, license plates.

313
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:44,320
But yeah, but so itching and scratch on, obviously, I think in our minds is definitely

314
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,120
and I don't want to speak for us, but I think feel like it's taking the lead here.

315
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,640
There's so many shiny objects.

316
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,400
Yeah. But Duff Gardens is a very first of all, it's a very it's much more low key,

317
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,840
but it has some gems as far as Simpson fan.

318
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,080
We have the seven Duffs, which I think I may be like more than any of the characters

319
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,280
walk around mascot characters in itchy and scratchy land.

320
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,720
Those characters are so great.

321
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,280
I'm so glad they're in the universal, but that they're in that beer garden.

322
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,760
I yeah, that's original IP.

323
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,680
You got to give them credit for that and a bunch of them.

324
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,080
The Duff Beermid is wonderful.

325
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,880
The water, the boat ride water that Lisa is forced to drink

326
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,960
to turn into the lizard queen.

327
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,080
I mean, in general, that Duff, it's a small world.

328
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,960
I think it's called Little Land of Duff.

329
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,400
I think that's the official name.

330
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,760
And we've always got to shout out specific rides here.

331
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,440
And I think like real

332
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,560
prominent ticket attractions will help maybe break some ties.

333
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,760
And that's a good one.

334
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:52,040
I mean, all the Duff Gardens ones, how much would you love to go on it in reality?

335
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,680
The Little Land of Duff,

336
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,880
which I assume never that chorus never changes.

337
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,640
There's not verses to that song.

338
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,440
It is just that for, you know, 15 minutes or so.

339
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,640
If you were sitting in a real

340
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,920
Duff Hall of Presidents, if you got to see what that entire

341
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:16,200
presentation is where Lincoln raps and FDR is in a beer helmet,

342
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,720
that'd be so, so wonderful.

343
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,760
Just imagine the full 25 minutes of it in your head.

344
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,120
Yeah, that's it's hard because there's yeah, it's again,

345
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,840
it's not as flashy all the way around, but that is that would be a really,

346
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,000
really funny, great show to see.

347
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,480
It's just an ad for beer using the presidents.

348
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,800
And maybe it's a good fix, honestly, for what Disney World is feeling

349
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,320
maybe right now, where they need to do something to that Hall of Presidents

350
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,320
to keep it from being just a booing, cheering machine for the rest of its existence.

351
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:54,560
Although, you know, the idea of including rapping, I don't know how I feel,

352
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,080
being that there's been these Twitter rumors of some Lin-Manuel Miranda involvement.

353
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,840
Let's not go start thinking that rapping is the way to save the Hall of Presidents.

354
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,480
Let's be very careful.

355
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,160
Is that a false flag?

356
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,760
Does it look like a CIA one designed just to drive us insane?

357
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,640
If Lin wants to write beer related raps for the presidents,

358
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,880
I will say I'm personally on board.

359
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,480
OK, as long as they're like beer ad type endorsements.

360
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,760
I'm totally on board with Lin's writing Warren G.

361
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,600
Harding to pushing some sort of beer Disney is selling.

362
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,240
That's fine. Yeah, as long as it's commercials.

363
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,920
Yes. And, you know, in general, you try to take personal biases out of this competition.

364
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:41,240
But I am the drinker of the podcast and drinking is a big reason.

365
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,240
I go to theme parks and imagine I'm just like,

366
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,840
if I could go to this entire beer oriented place, there's there's argument.

367
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,320
We just talked about is is Duff in reality good or not?

368
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,840
And I think I don't know.

369
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:59,080
I feel like it has to be or at least you have to like know the step up of Duff.

370
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,320
You know, got to know how to handle your job.

371
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,520
But there's so many opportunities to drink here.

372
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,960
You can go to the beer aquarium or a bunch of sick fish swim around.

373
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,240
Maybe I don't want to drink.

374
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,440
You know, they're presumably like shitting in the water.

375
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,360
And, you know, they're being live fish isn't good.

376
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,920
But people do just walk up to that thing for beer from a tap.

377
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,280
And that sounds good. Those beer goggles.

378
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,560
Selma mentions beer smoothies.

379
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,240
That sounds fantastic.

380
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,760
Does that exist in reality?

381
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,160
I would like it to. Got it.

382
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,880
Yeah, it's like at a fair or something.

383
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,360
Somebody has to have made that whole.

384
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,280
Pro is frozen beer you can get at a standard Epcot.

385
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,040
And I think Disney Springs now.

386
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,760
Really? Yeah.

387
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,040
Oh, really?

388
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,240
I would I would also like to shout out to Duff Gardens.

389
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,200
Hooray for everything performs.

390
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,640
That's very good.

391
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,640
Which is a show I would love to see.

392
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,960
Oh, yeah.

393
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,280
Oh, that's kind of pushing me towards.

394
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,440
I know it's hard because the mundane this

395
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,840
of Duff Gardens is what I really like, what it really appeals to me,

396
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,120
which it's in Scratchyland is fantastic.

397
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:08,120
But it's in Scratchyland is much more cartoonish monstrosity

398
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:12,760
of a park versus Duff Gardens is a lot as I was saying, it feels accurate

399
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,520
in so many ways.

400
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,800
It's really funny, but it does feel like they nailed that.

401
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,000
A cheesy type show.

402
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,360
And if you don't know what we're talking about, hooray for everything is like

403
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,600
a bunch of like lame singers doing a politically correct version

404
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,760
of Lou Reed's Walk on the Wild Side.

405
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,000
Is that where that happens?

406
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,640
Is that at Duff Gardens?

407
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,760
I believe so.

408
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,400
That's at least it's in the wiki.

409
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,680
I didn't rewatch the episode, but I've seen the episode many times.

410
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,240
I would like to see that.

411
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,160
Yes. The up with people is the real thing.

412
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:42,960
And hooray for right.

413
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,560
Hooray for everything is the.

414
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,800
Now, let me let me tip it back the other way with my own

415
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,240
argument, and because I was I was kind of going through this in my head

416
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,160
and I similarly landed it.

417
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,720
Maybe it just is Duff Gardens and largely for beer related reasons.

418
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,320
The Dark Horse might tip you to the other side, Parents Island.

419
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,520
There is a way, again, very well observed.

420
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:12,400
Pleasure Island Parity, a place that is only for adults to go within

421
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,560
itchy and scratchy land.

422
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,200
And now that I am a parent,

423
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,800
going to Parents Island, my wife and I talked about this

424
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,840
idea, how much we would love to be at Parents Island right now.

425
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,160
And they say specifics about it.

426
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:32,640
There's 100 bars and saloons at Parents Island.

427
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,400
Homer shouts out TV town, Hammock land.

428
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,360
Marge mentions recipe related bumper cars.

429
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,920
I would like to do all these things.

430
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,240
You get to see a 70s disco, which seems kind of cheesy.

431
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,080
But, you know, that place where it's New Year's Eve constantly

432
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,080
might be a little fun.

433
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,880
And a TGI is a TGI McScratchy.

434
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,720
McScratchy's. We've got another jumper at TGI McScratchy.

435
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,360
Yes. Yeah. TGI McScratchy's

436
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,160
good time food drinkery is the full.

437
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,640
Yeah, I mean, yeah.

438
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,040
All that is like now, does that just take

439
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:09,080
everything that would appeal to me about Duff Gardens?

440
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,120
Like, do they actually have it even more so on Parents Island?

441
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,280
Yeah. And is it Euro itch and scratchy land?

442
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,320
The empty park? Yes.

443
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,040
Referenced at the end.

444
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,560
That's pretty good, especially at that time.

445
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,880
That's a very topical reference. Yeah. Yeah.

446
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,960
This is tough.

447
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,240
I don't know if I know.

448
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,240
Does anybody feel like locking it in?

449
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,280
OK, yeah, you're saying yes.

450
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,600
Itch and scratchy land is a lot more like Disney World in the sense it's large.

451
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,720
It's got a lot of things in it as parents island, which is great.

452
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,000
But I'm trying my debate right now is that I believe right now

453
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,280
I think I would rather go to the park itself.

454
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,040
And this is arguably we have a lot with Disney World versus Disneyland.

455
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:57,040
Disneyland itself is a better park than the Magic Kingdom is.

456
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,040
But I understand when people say, well, Disney World is a whole thing.

457
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,720
It's a different experience because of how large it is

458
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,320
and how much different stuff there is to do.

459
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:09,000
But Disneyland, I keep coming back to and saying, well, I still think it's kind of better

460
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:14,680
because it's the experience of Disneyland is just, I think, a superior one.

461
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:20,520
So Duff Gardens, I think, is a better park than the itchy and scratchy land park.

462
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,040
But I take into what you're saying about all the different things

463
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:29,440
and the size of it. And this is my struggle right now, is do I go

464
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,160
it's purely based on the park itself?

465
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,880
Or do I take into account what you're saying?

466
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,080
This is this is struggling.

467
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,720
I didn't think I would be here this early in this final four.

468
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,960
But I am here. This is where I am.

469
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,920
I genuinely don't know either.

470
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,520
This is tough. Are we going to have to like take a half hour break

471
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,920
and edit this down? I'm upset. I'm feeling upset.

472
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,360
I think I'm going to go with my initial instinct and give it to it.

473
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,400
And scratchy land.

474
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,360
Oh, I think you're a val.

475
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,200
Your arguments are very passionate and valid.

476
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,240
But thank you.

477
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,040
I think the male functioning like is this one of the first

478
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,720
like male functioning animatronic

479
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,000
things like in in film and TV, besides,

480
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,080
you know, a Westworld sort of thing in a comedy thing.

481
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,880
I feel like the specifics are just very good in itch and scratchy land.

482
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,760
But I do appreciate what you're saying.

483
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,360
And I think that's why it's a one seed, the Duff Gardens specifics.

484
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,160
I think I know what I'm going to say.

485
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,520
I do know I've made my decision.

486
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,040
OK, well, then,

487
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:40,240
uh, I think I'm going to throw it into and I I'm still I'm uneasy.

488
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,480
But should we just toss them out at the same time?

489
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,840
OK, one, two, three.

490
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,120
Itchy and scratchy land.

491
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,160
And I don't know.

492
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:52,200
I almost wanted to be the upset and give it to Duff Gardens.

493
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,960
But ultimately, Parents Island is makes the flip for me.

494
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,560
I think that's everything that I want out of Duff Gardens.

495
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,760
But times 10, I get that.

496
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,480
That makes sense.

497
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,000
I think, though, that the whole time, because I thought going in,

498
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,360
it was easy, itchy and scratchy land.

499
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,600
But I think going in, I have to assess that just because I like

500
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,960
there's I think it's just scratching and better episode, funnier episode,

501
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,760
more references or theme park center just because of that, though.

502
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,840
I'm missing. I'm losing perspective.

503
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,280
And I believe Duff Gardens should win. But that's OK.

504
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,240
I understand.

505
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,640
I also another thing that made me want to give it to Duff Gardens

506
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,920
is that that part where Homer is clearly not well and gets in the car

507
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:34,760
and says, Duff Gardens, hurrah, and then lands hard on the steering.

508
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,480
That's how I felt.

509
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,160
I think I relate to that moment so much.

510
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:43,080
I think I felt that way the entire time during the pandemic, having this baby.

511
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,480
I think I felt that way in Disney World with you guys,

512
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,120
where we were never getting sleep and really tired all the time.

513
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,400
I felt like that Homer spirit.

514
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,440
But that's not the park.

515
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,440
That's just a thing I like in the episode.

516
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,920
I'm almost like sad about this because I wanted to be like

517
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:02,840
not obvious at the beginning, but hopefully our struggle is clear.

518
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,680
We are not just handing it to itchy and scratchy land easily.

519
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,760
It's parents parents island.

520
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,200
Yeah, I don't think there is a bad choice between these two.

521
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,960
But I'm sure there'll be upsets going along.

522
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,760
I think this second bracket, I there could be an upset on this one.

523
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,800
It's a tough little tough. Yeah.

524
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,680
Well, I'll go ahead and say it.

525
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,720
I'm calling it the wacky bracket.

526
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,040
And that is this is between two.

527
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,240
We're still in animation.

528
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,360
And it is between Happy World land from Tiny Toons,

529
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,440
how I spent my summer vacation and Glove World,

530
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:47,040
which is from SpongeBob SquarePants factors into a lot of SpongeBob SquarePants.

531
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:52,080
Now, the nostalgia we have to kind of air out, or at least I do.

532
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,800
I did not grow up with SpongeBob.

533
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,960
It seems really great.

534
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,600
And I think it's what I would have watched if that era lined up for me.

535
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,440
But Tiny Toons was my my era more.

536
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,680
But these are both pretty cool and similar in spirit. Right.

537
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,840
I think it makes sense to pair them.

538
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,440
Yes, so yeah, I agree with you, Scott. Happy World land.

539
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:18,160
I was always excited when how I spent my summer vacation,

540
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,160
that episode of Tiny Toons came on,

541
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,200
was not familiar with Glove World.

542
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,320
The whole episode is on YouTube.

543
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,840
And I was shocked.

544
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,280
I thought that was so much fun.

545
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:32,800
I think Potato Land needs to watch its ass because Glove World

546
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,400
really nailed some specifics, really nailed some stuff.

547
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,160
And I think has a lot of fun with it. Yeah. Yeah.

548
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,400
I was going to say, yeah, the Tiny Toons,

549
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,640
happy. What is what am I saying already?

550
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,720
World happy world land.

551
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,960
Geez, I'm losing my mind.

552
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,320
They have it's a very Disney.

553
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,760
It's very, very Disney as far as a parody.

554
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,200
But they do have some rides that look fun.

555
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,280
There's some joke rides that are just this is it's very hurt centric.

556
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,400
Both of these parks are kind of painful,

557
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,520
but Tiny Toons is leaning more into the painful aspects of it.

558
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:13,400
But some of them, if you escaped unscathed, would be fun.

559
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,520
I will say that about Tiny Toons.

560
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,040
Yes, there's one that doesn't look like it's a problem,

561
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,840
which is the gargle.

562
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:26,440
Like you're just in a gargling mouth and then you get spit out kind of at the bottom.

563
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,040
That seems just like a good rapid ride or something.

564
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,560
I'm not scared of the gargle.

565
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,360
A lot of the other ones, though, is fun, too.

566
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,120
The Tooth Fairy itself.

567
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,600
So if you don't know this, it's like this pretty big.

568
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,200
Is this like epic episode of Tiny Toons that I think got released

569
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,240
as its own like mini movie?

570
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,920
It was a tape that I rented extremely frequently,

571
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,600
but it was broken up into episodes, too.

572
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,720
And it's very National Ampoons Vacation-esque,

573
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,320
the quest to get to this place.

574
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,240
They get there.

575
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,680
Unlike Vacation, it's not that the park is closed.

576
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:04,240
It's that Plucky has been with Hampton's family on this exhausting road trip.

577
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,160
And they get there and they just take essentially the monorail around and don't

578
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,680
and see all the rides and then don't go in and do anything.

579
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,040
Thus exasperating Plucky.

580
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,840
The monorail they take around is the Tooth Fairy.

581
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,480
That's just really spelled like a boat fairy.

582
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,560
There's two sets of teeth that like one on top and one on bottom,

583
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:29,240
and they separate and go opposite directions and then meet back at the central point.

584
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,280
And that reminds me a lot of like monorail at Epcot, especially,

585
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,640
where you go you see so much of Epcot before you land.

586
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,000
And that's a fun little trip when you get to do that.

587
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,360
And a great visual.

588
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,080
Like if this was in a real theme park, this is I think this would be very possible to do.

589
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,680
And you'd go, oh, that looks really crazy and cool.

590
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,560
So I give them a lot of points for that.

591
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,400
First thing I go, oh, that's neat.

592
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,200
Yes. And the Happy Centrifuge ride did eventually get built.

593
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,880
It's it's mission space.

594
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,880
It seems like it's just space.

595
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:04,200
So they called that they did call that boring people out like goo moaning.

596
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:08,320
Yeah, that is how I felt like goo when I came off that thing for the first time.

597
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,080
Yes. So that's true.

598
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,480
There's a stairway to heaven.

599
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,640
There's the bullet train to heck.

600
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,120
You don't really see what the bullet train to heck looks like.

601
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,960
No. You just imagine, yeah, pain and fire down at the bottom.

602
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:28,680
I think my exact sense of humor as a child was slap happy.

603
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,200
The ride slap happy where you get in a big hand, a bunch of people load up.

604
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,920
And there's even a moment of excitement.

605
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,280
They're all thrilled to be here we go, everyone.

606
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:42,960
And then just the lever is flipped and then it just slams against the ground.

607
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:49,120
I just loved the like the bluntness of that, the craziness of that.

608
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:54,000
I don't know that I'd go on it, but I just these are all great.

609
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,480
I like this general theme.

610
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,400
I like that a lot of things are happy.

611
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,560
I like that it's there's a lot of body parts.

612
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,400
There's a feet ride to

613
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,680
the happy crashers, just a ship that crashes.

614
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,440
And that's it.

615
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,880
Yeah, there's a lot of great like fun designs.

616
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,320
Now I said there's a couple of things I would like to go on that wouldn't be,

617
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:16,520
wouldn't be so bad, but yes, the majority I will say look like it hurts.

618
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:23,520
They look like they hurt really bad and would leave you very injured, seriously injured.

619
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:24,480
Yeah.

620
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,040
So I do think you have to knock some points off it for that.

621
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,960
I can appreciate the design, but again, if I'm assessing it from just a theme park

622
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,600
that I would go to standpoint, you know, a good teen, good, like kind of out of a

623
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,720
teen working in the parking lot that they may take their picture.

624
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,360
Oh, that's a good one.

625
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:42,640
Yeah.

626
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:42,880
Yeah.

627
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:51,480
Plucky's passion to ride everything while the family is kind of indifferent, like as

628
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,280
their own agenda.

629
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,720
Very relatable.

630
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,520
Very relatable.

631
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:54,880
Yes.

632
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,400
Yeah.

633
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,160
Glove world.

634
00:33:59,160 --> 00:33:59,920
Glove world.

635
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:04,600
Commit so hard to the idea of theme park centered around gloves.

636
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,280
Yes.

637
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,320
I was inexplicably so.

638
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,520
I do really like this.

639
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:11,840
Yeah.

640
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,280
I was just delighted.

641
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:18,560
The glove song, the ride where you are, are they are Spongebob and Patrick.

642
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,320
They're put in a catcher's mitt.

643
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:21,560
Is that right?

644
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,120
Or they're put in the baseball.

645
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,200
Called Catch Me.

646
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,000
You're put in a big baseball and catch it.

647
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,840
Catch me.

648
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,680
You're putting a big baseball and thrown around.

649
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,440
Yeah.

650
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:36,200
And then the theme park, the founder, Hieronymus Glove.

651
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,840
Oh, I missed that.

652
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,560
Ooh, Mr.

653
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,320
Glove.

654
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:43,040
The Walt stand in is pretty good.

655
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,160
Yeah.

656
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,400
There.

657
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:46,600
Yeah.

658
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:51,440
There does feel like there's more treats to love at Glove World.

659
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,280
And again, I back up what you say.

660
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,160
I didn't grow up with Glove World.

661
00:34:55,640 --> 00:35:02,120
I was a Tiny Toons kid for sure, but it does feel like there's more things that you can

662
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,720
appreciate about Glove World.

663
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:05,960
Yeah, there's a lot.

664
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,480
They have original IP.

665
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,920
They have Glovey Glove.

666
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,880
Glove that walks around.

667
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,640
Tiny Toons doesn't, I don't know that they establish who the guy is.

668
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,600
They all wear hats that are like their equivalent of Mickey ears, but it's just

669
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,840
kind of crazy eyes.

670
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,200
And I like knowing who Glovey Glove is.

671
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,600
They have Glove Popsicles.

672
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,880
Good refreshments.

673
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,520
That's a key one also.

674
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,600
In every of these places, you get a sense of what the eats are.

675
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,800
And Glove Popsicles sound good.

676
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,480
I don't know if this makes it more or I don't know if this is a good thing for our

677
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,760
contest, but apparently there is a Lego set for Glove World, which I got very excited

678
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,880
about. I would have been way into that as a kid.

679
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,520
Yeah.

680
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,400
No kidding.

681
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:50,640
I think also the plot of the main Glove World episode is that Glove World is going

682
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:58,080
away. And I guess what probably SpongeBob and Patrick are very sad about this, but

683
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,920
it turns out it's just going away because they're building Glove Universe, a bigger

684
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,120
better park.

685
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,000
I don't think I'm making these facts up.

686
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,320
Well, they get the at least the one I watch.

687
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,840
Maybe there's multiple Love World episodes, but they get locked up in Glove World

688
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:15,720
jail because Patrick accidentally breaks the Mr.

689
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,240
Glove animatronic.

690
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:23,800
And then there's a lot of weird kids in the jail, and those are just funny performers

691
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,880
and funny voice actors, funny animation.

692
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,920
I didn't see any of that.

693
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,240
That sounds good.

694
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,040
Maybe there's multiple Glove World.

695
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:31,640
I think it is.

696
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,480
I was going to say, yeah, there's multiple Glove World episodes as well.

697
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,080
OK, but there is a Frozen.

698
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,600
They meet a Frozen, Hieronymus Glove at the end.

699
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:49,200
And while I usually find that specific kind of tiresome and annoying, I liked it in this.

700
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,480
They seem to have fun with it in this.

701
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,280
I do like that.

702
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,080
I do like that.

703
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,080
And if they're building Glove Universe, then it's on the Grove.

704
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,400
Like this place is popular.

705
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,440
It's something you can only imagine how great Glove Universe is going to be.

706
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:08,080
Well, yes, they had to clean up the toxic waste and then the pandemic delayed the building

707
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,520
of Glove Universe, but they're back on track.

708
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,320
The transit to get over there.

709
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,640
Yeah.

710
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,080
Yeah.

711
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,480
Well, the city infrastructural stuff to do.

712
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:15,800
Right.

713
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,760
Glove World, too.

714
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,760
I mean, Glove World's taken into account.

715
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,280
There's rides for kids.

716
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,040
There's rides for older kids.

717
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,640
There's like I feel like it's a more well thought out park.

718
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:29,040
The Mitten is the ride for like kids that they go on.

719
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,880
I don't see that.

720
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,760
I don't see that in the Tiny Toons episode.

721
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:38,400
I don't see the thought put into, you know, different experiences for different age groups.

722
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,760
That's an interesting aspect of fleshing it out more fully.

723
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,160
Yes.

724
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,920
Making the kids happy and teens and grownups.

725
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:46,680
Right.

726
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:47,720
Yeah.

727
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:51,600
I don't want to vote already, but I feel like you can feel where I'm going.

728
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,240
Maybe I am, too.

729
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,000
I mean, we don't have to belabor these.

730
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,960
No, that's true.

731
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,600
I'm surprised.

732
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,120
And I think the conversations help.

733
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:06,160
I think what like I want to see where everybody else is at and how joyous is the conversation or not.

734
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,160
And I really like talking about Glove World.

735
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,480
Maybe I got to give it to Glove World.

736
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,480
I think it's Glove World.

737
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,560
I think it's Glove World.

738
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:12,880
Yeah.

739
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,800
I mean, it's different things, different things, because there's a lot of build up to Happy World Land.

740
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:22,440
I think it's set up at the top of the episode and then they're the road trip to get there.

741
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:27,520
But Glove World, you just they throw you right in and they've done multiple episodes.

742
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,680
So they do have an advantage in that sense.

743
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,000
But it's underwater.

744
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,120
It's in the ocean.

745
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:32,800
Yeah, that's cool.

746
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,040
Yeah.

747
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,840
We didn't talk about that.

748
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,480
Mm hmm.

749
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,040
But a young upstart.

750
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:36,720
Glove World.

751
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,680
Exciting.

752
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,200
All right.

753
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:38,480
Wow.

754
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,680
A very hip reference from us, I think.

755
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,360
Oh, I think so.

756
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,840
We're up to like 2003 or so.

757
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,320
And I think our coolness is showing.

758
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,560
Is there a theme park on Riverdale yet?

759
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,520
Oh, that's a great question.

760
00:38:54,520 --> 00:39:03,560
I think, you know, they just did the classic trope of an alien corpse preserved in a barrel of Blossom Family maple syrup.

761
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,520
But I don't know that there's really been a theme park yet.

762
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:08,680
Huh.

763
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,080
All right.

764
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,520
Well, that'll be the HIPPER.

765
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:14,880
Well, if we have to do this one again in five years, that'll be the hippest reference if they do do that.

766
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:15,720
Yeah.

767
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:22,000
So that that leaves that we'll come back around to itching scratchy land versus Glove World.

768
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,880
That's pretty exciting.

769
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,400
OK.

770
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,720
Next up.

771
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:34,160
OK, this is called the Crichton bracket, both Michael Crichton stories and movies slash TV show.

772
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,880
Jurassic Park versus Westworld.

773
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,160
Big one.

774
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:40,560
Big one.

775
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,640
Big. This is big.

776
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,600
This is a big one.

777
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,520
Stresses me out to even think about it.

778
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,560
They say there's multiple versions of these.

779
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,560
There's books, movies, newer versions.

780
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,960
Obviously, we're saying Jurassic Park, though, not Jurassic World.

781
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,200
That's a separate park.

782
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:58,720
Yes, though I almost had the question, again, removing the parks from the films.

783
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:04,360
I think if I had to venture a guess, I'd say that we all prefer Jurassic Park to Jurassic World, the movie.

784
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,720
However, right, Jurassic World does have a city walk.

785
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,800
And I guess like the main thing that makes me want to like the movie.

786
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:19,360
And I really like that it's this big battle at the end where they're crashing into Starbucks and Brookstones and Pandora's.

787
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:24,320
I almost want to hang out there is similar to Parents Island.

788
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:29,160
I'm like getting away from rides and we haven't even I'm not even talking about dinosaurs.

789
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:29,680
Right.

790
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,760
There's a Margaritaville at Jurassic World.

791
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,600
Yeah, I know.

792
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,320
Yes.

793
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:38,400
And Jurassic World seemed to operate without a hitch for a while there.

794
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,200
It seems like it's open.

795
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,800
Yes, which Jurassic Park did not.

796
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:46,400
There's a part of me that thought, should this just be Jurassic Park versus Jurassic World?

797
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,040
Oh, can we call an audible?

798
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,440
It's tough because, yes, you're like Jurassic Park, obviously, is the is the better movie.

799
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,880
I don't think that's a controversial statement to make.

800
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:08,040
But if you really think about the experience that all the characters were having testing out the park to dinosaurs, you couldn't see them.

801
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,560
The T-Rex isn't there.

802
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,360
The where where's the Raptor?

803
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,120
Where's the Triceratops?

804
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,760
Triceratops is sick.

805
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:22,760
And they broke when they break out of the ride, when they get out and go look, go into the medical unit.

806
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,880
So like the safety functionality isn't working right from the get go.

807
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,280
Bathrooms collapse immediately as evidenced by the lawyer.

808
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,800
Jurassic versus Jurassic World, where it's like that that cool ball is very cool.

809
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:40,960
Like that would be amazing to go into something like that and get to go in the actual habitat of the dinosaurs.

810
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,560
You could actually go directly where they are hanging out.

811
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:51,760
You don't have to lure T-Rex over with a goat or something to the side because that isn't even you're just getting to see it like kill an animal.

812
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:57,040
I mean, I don't know. It's just kind of the Jimmy Fallon, the very accurate Jimmy Fallon video.

813
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,160
Yes, very accurate.

814
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,480
Yeah, exactly like what the theme park skit would be.

815
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,520
That's essentially what he does on the tram.

816
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,920
Right. The big water show show.

817
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:11,400
Are we are we heading to a controversial one right now?

818
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,240
Or do we make this like this is three?

819
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:21,760
This is this becomes Jurassic Park versus Jurassic, like like the battle at the end between the Indominus and the T-Rex and the Raptor.

820
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,320
I think Westworld beats Jurassic Park.

821
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,960
I will say that right now.

822
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:31,720
I think Westworld beats Jurassic Park, but I don't know that it beats Jurassic World.

823
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,200
That's what I'm going to say.

824
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,240
So what are we doing here?

825
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,720
Are we making this a three for all?

826
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,800
I think this should be a three for all.

827
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:51,200
I think the NCAA tournament should have like a wrestling style run ins where it's suddenly like this is now a triple threat match.

828
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,120
Three teams, three basketball teams competing against each other at the same time.

829
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,640
I agree. Let's shake it up.

830
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,040
OK, great. So they're all in.

831
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:02,400
OK, they are a third basket to the one side.

832
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:08,880
Yeah, so Jurassic Park Westworld versus the Hardy boys there at the back.

833
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:17,600
And Tom and Jerry are running around to Tom and Jerry are here and Rob Delaney is running in with a chair.

834
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:26,800
OK, so I'm on record saying I think Jurassic World beats Jurassic Park, but I don't know about Jurassic World versus Westworld yet.

835
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:37,600
OK, Westworld seems to be like begrudgingly from the little bits and pieces I've seen of the Yule Brenner movie and of the HBO show.

836
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:46,240
It seems like it's you know, it's like we got to show how we got to set it up before we can show all the cool stuff goes wrong.

837
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,800
I don't know. I think you're anti. You're just not in.

838
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,920
You're anti-Westworld.

839
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:58,800
I guess so. I mean, I the reviews on the TV show where everyone was like, this is so much work watching this.

840
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,080
I was like, you're not really selling me.

841
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:05,320
I mean, I like I think Ed Brubaker was on the writing staff, the comic book writer.

842
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,200
I like him a lot. I like Jeffrey Wright.

843
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,880
The show. But you're not talking about the show.

844
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:13,240
I'm not talking about the show, but it's going to eventually you think about this stuff.

845
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:18,400
The movie kind of fucks me up with this, too, because like how cool is Yule Brenner look?

846
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,160
I just like all those dudes.

847
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,000
I like the like it's the first Crichton.

848
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,960
It's yeah, it's so like 70s sci fi in that Logan's run vein.

849
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,840
But then I sort of drift off with it.

850
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,520
I don't like I don't love that movie.

851
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,680
I love the first act.

852
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,840
And then I kind of like veer away.

853
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,320
But is this are we letting the film the products?

854
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,320
We are.

855
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:48,680
Because these are both probably the two most unique experiences on this whole list, on this whole bracket, on these bracket brackets and stuff.

856
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,040
Yeah, yeah.

857
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:57,120
So I think just the experiences we have to try to think of versus the actual movies,

858
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:00,840
because like Westworld is like putting you in a scenario.

859
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:04,520
This is like Westworld is like what they want to do with that Star Wars hotel.

860
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:07,400
But like much more like 100 times 100.

861
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:12,600
You're living a completely like different life for however long it is for a couple of days, for a week.

862
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,160
Or I don't remember what yours.

863
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,600
That's absolutely right. Here's my issue.

864
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,280
I don't want to do that.

865
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:32,480
And when I realized that Galaxy's Edge was not really going to have like people bugging you at the cantina because you flew the Falcon bad or that like they weren't going to do the bright suns for more than the first five days.

866
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:33,760
I was like, great.

867
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,760
Now I can just drink that milk and go to the bar and go on the rides.

868
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,520
I don't think I'm equipped for Westworld.

869
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,880
I don't want to kill anybody.

870
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,280
I don't know. Sexually, maybe I shouldn't get into it.

871
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,320
That's a big part of the appeal is the sex.

872
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:55,760
I don't think that I want to go have sex with saloon girl robots.

873
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:56,880
I don't think so.

874
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,480
So I guess is this still too much personal bias?

875
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,440
It's very impressive.

876
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,080
I just don't think that I want to do it.

877
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,880
And mainly Westworld has no rides.

878
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,480
That's what I'm after.

879
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:08,920
Yeah, that's true.

880
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,000
It's very immersive.

881
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,880
It's almost it's practically like glorified dinner theater.

882
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,200
And there is a veneer of like sleaze involved.

883
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:19,400
Yeah, that's part of this.

884
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,800
That's part of the sex thing.

885
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,240
Like, maybe it'd be interesting to have sex with one of these robots.

886
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:27,800
But then the next day, the day before, some other guys are like,

887
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,800
I like that's weird, right?

888
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,960
I'm like, sharing these robots.

889
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:35,080
Oh, yeah. You've said a different man has had sex with the robot as well.

890
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:37,240
Well, that's probably the case.

891
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,440
I agree that that is a problem.

892
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,760
That is certainly a problem.

893
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,840
Now, I don't think you don't have to have sex with a robot.

894
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,320
No, but you can murder the like it.

895
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:49,080
I don't know that the mistreating robots thing like I feel like.

896
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,760
Well, it's a moral it's a moral quandary for sure.

897
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:55,280
Yeah, I don't think I'm murdering or having sex with any of the robots.

898
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:00,000
If I go to Westworld, I mean that I think I don't think I am.

899
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,280
I don't think I am either.

900
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,760
And I guess, you know,

901
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:09,040
an abomination in the eyes of God is kind of through line through Michael Crain stuff.

902
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:13,320
Yeah, there's a lot of discussion like should these dinosaurs really exist?

903
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:17,520
Like, should we do this, you know, in both Jurassic and all the Jurassic movies?

904
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,120
You know, now let me let me bring this up.

905
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:23,080
Westworld is obviously like Old West.

906
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:26,600
If this was a different time period, would you feel differently?

907
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,240
If this was a different time period or different genre?

908
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:32,280
I think they get to that later seasons of the show.

909
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,000
Well, we do have to take into account that it is part of

910
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:40,400
Delos destinations in which there are multiple.

911
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:43,240
So it's almost like I don't know how much you see of them.

912
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,560
But there's Shogun World, there's War World.

913
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:48,040
That's World War Two is medieval fantasy.

914
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,880
The Raj, which is colonial India.

915
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,760
If any of those. Jesus Christ.

916
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,680
Yeah, that's now. See, the thing is, I don't think I want to do any of those.

917
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:57,880
Those I don't want to do.

918
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:01,880
I don't know. I'm not sure what I would Westworld it for.

919
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:04,320
I don't know what I want to be in an immersive.

920
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:09,160
I mean, it's like all the August Cantina is as close as I want to get.

921
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:12,400
I want to have a blue wine and I want to watch my favorite robot DJ.

922
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,800
So my Westworld exists already.

923
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,840
See, I think I think Jason, you need to think about this because we did

924
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:22,880
this very interactive experience that Eva Anderson invited us to.

925
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,920
And I'm already forgetting the name of it.

926
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:28,160
Delusion, Delusion, the Blue Blade.

927
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,720
That was our production that year, the Blue Blade.

928
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:33,320
And it's a very live, interactive kind of theater thing

929
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:36,520
where you go through rooms and there's elaborate sets and performers.

930
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:39,640
And there's a huge there's a very like a narrative

931
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,720
that ties the whole thing together and you go back in time, blah, blah, blah.

932
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:46,880
Jason Sheridan of the whole group was trying to interact

933
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,680
with the performers more than any of us doing so.

934
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:55,800
So much so that he threw the performers off because I got to do it.

935
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,360
He got too into it. He called somebody Mac.

936
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:01,120
He was trying to like talk like an old gangster.

937
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,880
I was we were blown away because I didn't do that.

938
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,600
I was just like, oh, let's let these performers go.

939
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:08,000
Jason turned into a different character.

940
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,960
I think he's forgetting what happens when he goes into a scenario like this.

941
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,200
He enjoys himself. He'd love to say Mac.

942
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:18,600
He'd love to say like, hey, you you lousy dame.

943
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,160
He loves to say something like that.

944
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,000
Well, hold on.

945
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,480
Fun pretend way.

946
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,520
He's not saying that in real life, but it's a fantasy.

947
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:29,800
I mostly antagonize like a sleazy, like

948
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:32,320
like pickpocket or con man.

949
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,440
And then I got a Nazi upset at me.

950
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:38,400
And in real life, I got a KFN Nazi upset at me.

951
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,640
And then in real life, the actor said I was a challenge.

952
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,840
Yes. She stopped afterward and said you were a challenge.

953
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,320
I don't know.

954
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:52,440
So I'm saying you don't even know what you're capable of when you're in Westworld.

955
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:55,520
You're going to be doing your old timey detective slang.

956
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,760
You're going to be loving it.

957
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,360
It's going to be the most fun you've ever had.

958
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:01,240
And right now you're acting like, oh, I don't think I would like it.

959
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:04,000
A detective from the future came to the old west.

960
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:08,920
And well, I got payback because then I had to swing on a rope over a moat,

961
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:10,560
like an actual moat.

962
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,520
Like I was not prepared.

963
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,600
They told us there might be some climbing and stuff, but it's just like,

964
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,720
I don't want to land in this children's pool.

965
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,760
Me and Jason Wolner, me and Golden

966
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:25,360
Winter, Jason Wolner, director of Borat 2.

967
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,360
Swinging out of line.

968
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,640
I just think Jason's not thinking about him,

969
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:33,560
him in a scenario where he gets to use old detective slang.

970
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,040
I think that's fair.

971
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:38,120
I yeah, I think I would like the acting part of it.

972
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:43,480
I don't know about the murder part of it or like the abuse a robot part of it.

973
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,280
You don't have to abuse or murder.

974
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,760
It's your choose your own adventure.

975
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:47,960
You could solve the murder.

976
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,000
I guess that's fair.

977
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,520
I guess that's fair.

978
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,040
This is so choose your own event.

979
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:54,480
This is not my my kind of deal.

980
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,200
And I have to say

981
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:02,200
that maybe the trashier aspects of Jurassic World are what I want to do

982
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:04,400
more, which is embarrassing.

983
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:09,760
It's it's you know, it's not the smart person's way to view things.

984
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:14,120
I guess maybe we need to parse Jurassic Park versus or did we do it already?

985
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:17,640
I got it. You also like, OK, you got the Jeep ride.

986
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,760
You got that. There is that like Mr.

987
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,920
DNA, but Mr.

988
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,760
DNA is a Jurassic world, too.

989
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:24,440
Again, I don't it's not the movie.

990
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:29,640
The movie's a little tight, but the going there, I mean, aesthetically,

991
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,760
I almost just wanted like different stuff to happen in the movie.

992
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:36,520
But for me to be able to like stare at these settings, because I think they're great.

993
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:41,680
Right. I have thought about like us in the continuity of Jurassic World.

994
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:45,640
We would be like, well, we're excited to see what this new dinosaur is like.

995
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,920
They've really been coasting on that.

996
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:53,120
You know, the water dinosaur, the Megalodon kind of dinosaur.

997
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:57,480
And, you know, much like Disney coasted on DCA 2.0 for a number of years

998
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:59,480
before building a new attraction.

999
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:02,720
So, yeah, yeah.

1000
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:06,520
Jurassic, Jurassic Nets, the message boards on Jurassic

1001
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:10,480
Net are saying that there's this new they're doing a new it's like a T-Rex,

1002
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,560
but like times five and it's going to be sponsored.

1003
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,520
I mean, that's crazy.

1004
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:17,520
And the gym and land covering like Jurassic World news.

1005
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,280
Yeah, I would love to.

1006
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:21,160
I would love it.

1007
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:25,880
Hearing about the the ins and outs like the hourly capacity

1008
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:28,680
of the little triceratops that children ride on.

1009
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,200
And they get about 60, 60 people an hour through that.

1010
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:35,240
Yeah, Len was just standing outside the triceratops ride counting.

1011
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,120
They've been doing a visitor poll.

1012
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:40,840
And would you like it more or less if it were four minutes or six minutes?

1013
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,400
And the results, I think, are very interesting.

1014
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,160
It is a good I like to think about this.

1015
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,400
I like I like this.

1016
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,640
So it's tough.

1017
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:50,960
This stuff, I'm just argue I was just trying to save Westworld

1018
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,400
from being a total blow out here.

1019
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,480
I'm not saying I even have my decision.

1020
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,640
I think that's a good call.

1021
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:59,920
You know, in all fairness, though, even with all their ills,

1022
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:03,360
the evil corporation in Jen at least would have had the sense

1023
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:05,440
to let Gina Carano go.

1024
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,440
So, you know.

1025
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,280
That's true.

1026
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,600
All right. Do we do we want to vote?

1027
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,240
I mean, do we are we do we know what we're going to say?

1028
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,880
I think we I think Scott, I know Jason does.

1029
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:17,440
I yeah, I do. Yeah.

1030
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,960
How do we how do we do this all the same time or at the same time?

1031
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,600
OK, OK.

1032
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,040
To three three.

1033
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,440
Jurassic World. Wow.

1034
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,840
Unbelievable.

1035
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:29,480
It's funny we didn't talk about this before.

1036
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:30,840
And you're like this.

1037
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,480
People are going to hate this.

1038
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,200
Like I think it's just it's just going to feel right to people

1039
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:39,160
that it should be Jurassic Park, easily one of the best movies.

1040
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:42,120
You know, I've read a lot of articles during the pandemic

1041
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,120
that tell me that Jurassic Park holds up.

1042
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:47,040
I was surprised to me.

1043
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,240
I wouldn't have believed that.

1044
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,040
I'm glad people keep writing this article over and over again.

1045
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:53,520
But it is it's a it's a wonderful film.

1046
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,640
I will always watch it.

1047
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:57,160
I will watch it so much more than I will watch Jurassic World.

1048
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:01,720
But I what would I rather like have a screensaver of on my desk?

1049
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:02,960
Where would I?

1050
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,520
I think I want to like see some dinosaurs

1051
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:09,600
in a park that actually got up and running and have a margarita

1052
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:12,240
next to Jimmy while I do it.

1053
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,720
I get that. Believe me, I get that.

1054
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:19,120
If Jurassic World were against almost and maybe half of the rest of the bracket,

1055
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,480
I think it would be Jurassic World.

1056
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,520
I just think Westworld, there's a lot of options.

1057
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,680
And I'd like to see what it's like.

1058
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,160
I may hate it.

1059
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,880
I may absolutely hate it.

1060
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,120
There's very much possibility of that.

1061
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:36,280
But I am interested in it and is not my repressed sexuality or anything.

1062
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:38,920
I don't think I don't think the whole thing is like, I got to get there

1063
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:41,800
to get those like saloon lady robots or anything.

1064
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,280
I don't think that's it.

1065
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:44,800
Wow. Wow.

1066
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,920
It's just such a different type of experience.

1067
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:47,760
That's yeah. Yeah.

1068
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:52,760
So Jurassic World comes out of no, not even on the initial list

1069
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,360
and comes out of nowhere.

1070
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:58,720
Jurassic World cashed in the money in the bank briefcase and went all the way.

1071
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,800
I'm so this is the kind of thing I wanted.

1072
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:05,760
I don't think that I wanted it to be just a cruise through an easy cruise

1073
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,480
for the best movies and shows.

1074
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:09,520
I wanted it to be a little chaotic.

1075
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,000
And it's the city walk in us.

1076
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
What can I say? They have a city walk.

1077
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,120
You can't deny that.

1078
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:16,400
That's why Parents Island got it for me.

1079
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,520
That's why Jurassic World got it for me.

1080
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:22,040
Man, oh man. OK, so where does that take us?

1081
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,080
That leads us to the next one.

1082
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:27,240
I kind of if we're grouping the pairs, you know, we did the animation one

1083
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:31,120
and now we're kind of in the sci fi one a little loosely.

1084
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,120
And that takes us to the next one.

1085
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:34,880
Jason, you want to do the honors?

1086
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,960
Sure. This is what we refer to as the space bracket.

1087
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:42,200
Luna Park from Futurama versus Moron Mountain from Space Jam.

1088
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,280
Yes. I love it.

1089
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,720
I feel like this one's kind of a quick one for me.

1090
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:47,920
I kind of think so.

1091
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,800
That's exactly what I was thinking.

1092
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,200
Well, now, why is that?

1093
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,520
Because I'm not I think I get it.

1094
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,680
But let's let's purse this out a little bit.

1095
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,680
Sure. Of course. Of course. Sure.

1096
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:00,440
Well, Moron Mountain, of course, in Space Jam is what

1097
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:05,320
you know, the monsters, of course, the characters who eventually go up

1098
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,360
against the Looney Tunes in a basketball game.

1099
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:10,960
They start out here working at Moron Mountain.

1100
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:15,520
And, you know, they're trying to think of things to boost interest.

1101
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:20,760
And the theme park of Moron Mountain is similar.

1102
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:25,520
I feel like to the Tiny Tunes idea of like it's stuff that breaks down

1103
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,080
or stuff that looks like it hurts you, I guess.

1104
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:29,200
Maybe that breaks down because something does break down.

1105
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:32,160
But it is an unpopular park is really where I'm going with it.

1106
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,800
Yes. On the down slope or whatever.

1107
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:38,680
It's we don't you don't really get to know that much about it.

1108
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:41,000
There is a ride called Sludge Summit.

1109
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:43,320
You don't really see what Sludge Summit is.

1110
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:48,200
And there is also a sort of astro jets, like a bunch of rockets fly around.

1111
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:54,160
Well, a cat with a cigar fires fire or lasers at you.

1112
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:58,880
I don't recall which makes one of the rockets fall off the thing.

1113
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,440
You know, there's a hey, there's a waltz.

1114
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:02,760
You got to give it that Mr.

1115
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,240
Swack Hammer. Yeah, yeah.

1116
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:07,920
And he I think it's Swack Hammer's face that that's oh, it's not a cat.

1117
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:12,040
OK, I believe that my thing, because he's got a cigar and he's shooting it.

1118
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:14,560
So, yeah, it's Swack Hammer has his face on the ride.

1119
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,000
OK. And it's you know,

1120
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,360
there's there's a part of me that would like something to make it

1121
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:25,280
a little far that looks like an N64 game.

1122
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:29,080
I like that when you land in Moron Mountain in the movie

1123
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:32,320
and you're kind of in a style of graphics and animation

1124
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,440
that is only in that part of the movie.

1125
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,640
Yes, I like that.

1126
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:40,840
But, you know, they don't get the Looney Tunes.

1127
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:43,800
They don't successfully achieve their plan, which is

1128
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:48,040
enslaving the actual creatures, the Looney Tunes,

1129
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:51,680
locking them up like Dumbo and making them perform.

1130
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:53,600
That'd be all other things.

1131
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:57,000
We often complain about the lack of solid Looney Tunes

1132
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,480
presence in a lot of the parks.

1133
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:02,080
And this would certainly be if there was a planet that you could go to

1134
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:06,800
and it's the real Daffy Duck chained up against his will

1135
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,320
doing jokes for you every day.

1136
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,160
Pretty good.

1137
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:15,080
I wanted I mean, yes, we've been lamenting this.

1138
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:19,640
I saw that maybe Bugs Bunny was was featured for some people

1139
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:23,280
on their drive through tour of Six Flags and not mine, not my personal one.

1140
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:24,800
And I was furious.

1141
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:28,920
So, yes, I guess it would have like Bugs be handcuffed to something in Six Flags

1142
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:31,240
while I drove my car through it during the Christmas season.

1143
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,560
That would have been nice.

1144
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:35,080
Handing you fudge against his will.

1145
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:38,320
Yes, handing me two pounds of fudge.

1146
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,400
That would have been that it would have been a dream.

1147
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,720
I also want to say quickly, I've learned the some of the names of the of the

1148
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,800
of the characters.

1149
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:49,040
Well, that could change everything.

1150
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:50,520
So, yes, let's hear the names.

1151
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:51,200
Nerd.

1152
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:54,440
Then there were the nerd lux, which I honestly I've watched

1153
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:55,720
Space Jam a bunch.

1154
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:58,400
I have the nostalgia for it, but I didn't know the nerd lux.

1155
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,440
Did you guys know the nerd lux?

1156
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:04,480
No, I kind of forgot the setup of he was like trying to mindlessly

1157
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:08,320
get a new, you know, thing for his horrific part.

1158
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:10,800
Like, I did not recall that at all.

1159
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,200
That's the stakes.

1160
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:16,480
The if the basketball game doesn't go well, the Looney Tunes

1161
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:19,080
have to live in a theme park in space forever.

1162
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:22,120
Yeah, it's a little convoluted, a little.

1163
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:25,640
Yeah, it's very clean, as will the next one be.

1164
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:29,280
It's we're going to get we're going to put all the Time Warner properties together.

1165
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:34,040
In one film, in all fairness, this is how Iger acquired part of the Murdoch

1166
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:37,200
Empire, the pick up the Disney pick up basketball team bit

1167
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:40,000
beat the 20th Century Fox pick up basketball.

1168
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,120
Right.

1169
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,760
Yes, because they stole NBA players powers briefly.

1170
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:49,080
So that week that Kevin Durant couldn't like get up out of bed.

1171
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:50,120
That's what was happening.

1172
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:51,280
That there was right.

1173
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:54,520
He was on a basketball court at Davos and, you know,

1174
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,680
I real quick, though, the nerd lux have.

1175
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:03,520
So there's nerd luck, bup kiss, nerd luck, bang, nerd luck, blanco.

1176
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,480
Wow. Nerd luck pound.

1177
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,800
Mm hmm. Those are the four I see.

1178
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:12,160
I think there might be one more I'm missing, and I apologize,

1179
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,520
but I just I didn't even know.

1180
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,000
Oh, nerd luck, not.

1181
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,520
Well, so those are the five nerd luck characters,

1182
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:21,120
the little do we be characters then turn into the monsters?

1183
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:24,880
I mean, now knowing that it's nerd luck, nerd luck, not.

1184
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,080
I don't know.

1185
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:30,560
Do maybe we have to give it to Moron Mountain based off of that fact only.

1186
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:33,760
Maybe, maybe. Or what's the real answer?

1187
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:36,920
Because if we say the real answer, we could deal with the other one later.

1188
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:39,960
Oh, I see what you're saying.

1189
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,000
If you're saying, am I going to vote against more on the answers?

1190
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,680
Yes. Yeah, yeah, that's it.

1191
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:46,640
We have no good call. Luna Park.

1192
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,520
Well, so we'll talk about that later.

1193
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,600
The theme park in Futurama.

1194
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:51,960
That works out nicely.

1195
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:54,080
We can save a little time here.

1196
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,760
So which would take us.

1197
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,400
Wait, we're halfway through now.

1198
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:03,400
So that takes us over to what I'm calling the scary division.

1199
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:08,280
And within the scary division, we have.

1200
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:10,520
Oh, I guess, OK, we're going to start with now this here.

1201
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:13,960
These are these are pretty like new to me.

1202
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:16,360
These are things that I have no nostalgia

1203
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:20,880
interrupt in my my thought process here, because we thought we wanted to represent

1204
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,200
the horror area with the horror bracket.

1205
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:27,640
And that is horror land from Goosebumps,

1206
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:30,920
from various Goosebumps books and Goosebumps media.

1207
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:34,480
And what I realized is called McKinley Park,

1208
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:36,960
where most of the action takes place.

1209
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:40,240
I don't actually know that some important action takes place

1210
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:44,920
in Final Destination three, which is the one with a roller coaster

1211
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:47,280
that kills some people.

1212
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:49,520
A horror bracket. What do we? Yeah.

1213
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:52,640
Mm hmm. Well, I will say I as a kid,

1214
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,240
read the first horror land book and loved it.

1215
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:59,680
I was a Goosebumps kid of hardcore for like two years.

1216
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:03,320
It's like the most reading I've ever done, non comic book related.

1217
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,920
It's when I was at my best reading and I wasn't an idiot

1218
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:10,320
with no attention span like I am now, who can't can barely finish a book.

1219
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:14,800
Do me too. And I love after about a year or two,

1220
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:18,240
my friends and I who read Goosebumps, we started realizing like this.

1221
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:22,240
This stuff isn't as good as we maybe thought it was.

1222
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:25,600
It feels like he's using a lot of the same like phrases and tropes

1223
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:27,560
over and over again.

1224
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:29,000
And then we stopped reading the books.

1225
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:33,200
But horror land, I was a big one, very excited as a little kid,

1226
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,080
theme park fan.

1227
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:39,840
So it's again, it's going to be tough for me to take my bias out of this one.

1228
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:43,960
I also I had wondered if there was any bias within your household

1229
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:46,320
because of Lindsay and her podcast, Teen Creeps.

1230
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:49,160
And then I discovered that you were on an episode about horror.

1231
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:51,560
You've talked horror land extensively.

1232
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:54,320
I don't know about extensively.

1233
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:58,000
I don't know that I'm an expert about the Goosebumps series.

1234
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
But yes, I did talk about it.

1235
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,880
I don't remember much about that episode because my brain is getting older

1236
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:07,280
and information is leaving it at a rapid rate.

1237
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:11,080
So, yes, but I will say I have I

1238
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,080
early give the edge to horror land just because of that fact.

1239
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:20,560
Sure. Well, then maybe we need to shine a light on McKinley Park

1240
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:24,120
before we make any official decisions. Yes.

1241
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:27,120
You know, I didn't really know about it.

1242
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:29,280
I don't know if you guys knew this this movie.

1243
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,360
I'm a scaredy cat and I avoid these.

1244
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:35,680
I've never seen the final destination films.

1245
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,400
Perhaps I'm missing out.

1246
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:40,400
Does anyone have any prestanding affection for

1247
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,880
this film or the franchise in general?

1248
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:47,320
No, I don't.

1249
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:50,720
I am again, trying to get better at watching scary things.

1250
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:53,120
I've talked to the podcast about trying to watch.

1251
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:54,560
I watched Hellraiser.

1252
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:57,600
I watched some things that I thought were just snuff films when I was a kid

1253
01:03:58,480 --> 01:03:59,680
just to see what they're like.

1254
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,720
And I like some of them. I don't like others.

1255
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:04,400
And but with Final Destination, I have not seen the movie,

1256
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,920
but I did watch clips of just the theme park.

1257
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:11,120
So this is going to be easier for me to just look at the theme park aspects,

1258
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:15,000
taking out any sort of nostalgia I have for the actual property.

1259
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:19,720
I think this is actually beneficial to this exercise that we're doing here today.

1260
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:23,920
Yeah. I mean, the main clip, the premonition

1261
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:28,960
a OK, so Final Destination three is about this.

1262
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,640
This time they avoid death.

1263
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:37,040
Some people outsmart death by not getting on a derailing roller coaster.

1264
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:39,560
But then some people do.

1265
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:43,600
So it's kind of the like spurring the action of the movie.

1266
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:49,320
And that footage of the derailing coaster is simultaneously gruesome

1267
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:54,240
and very corny, making it a perfect summation of the mid 2000s.

1268
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:58,040
It's like it's a perfect piece of meat, a lot of handy cams,

1269
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:01,600
a lot of digital cameras in this sequence.

1270
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:04,880
And a little like many Blair witches.

1271
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:07,640
We're going to pepper it with Blair witchiness.

1272
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:11,960
Yeah. And it it Devil's Flight is the name of the coaster.

1273
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:14,200
The coaster in real life is called the Corkscrew.

1274
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:16,920
It's at Playland in Vancouver, Canada.

1275
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:21,560
Much of American entertainment shot in Canada, of course.

1276
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:24,880
Yeah, I don't know.

1277
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:28,520
This this one just kind of seems like shitty, like

1278
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:35,000
Final Destination three, the Playland or McKinley Park, the fictional name.

1279
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:37,520
I don't know. It just seems kind of lame.

1280
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:41,520
Horrorland, too, is like a massive franchise within Goosebumps.

1281
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:44,320
There's Horrorland one day at Horrorland.

1282
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:47,600
Return to Horrorland, a multi-book,

1283
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:51,680
multi-part series, no longer self-contained stories.

1284
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:57,680
Horrorland series to Horrorland video games.

1285
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:02,600
It is kind of really, really grown out.

1286
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:05,240
Oh, and I believe on the show.

1287
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:07,440
What's the Goosebumps show on the show?

1288
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:11,640
And I think that that multi-book series involves different Goosebumps

1289
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:16,040
characters from different books, like continuity, like characters meeting

1290
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:17,760
from all the different Goosebumps.

1291
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:23,880
Yeah, Final Destination doesn't have the amount of stuff that's packed in now.

1292
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:24,960
It just didn't have.

1293
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:27,160
There weren't multiple Final Destination three.

1294
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:30,040
Final Destination three, part two, part three.

1295
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:31,440
Yeah, three.

1296
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:34,240
We not that the no, no.

1297
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:37,240
You pretty much have this one ride, which does have like a cool devil

1298
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:38,960
on the outside of it.

1299
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:41,240
And there's and I think Q looks cool.

1300
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:45,920
He got some torches and some scary medieval stuff.

1301
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:48,080
I also wanted to make sure I wasn't missing anything.

1302
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:50,840
And I did find a big list of the stuff that they have.

1303
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,680
I don't know if this was just they were just saying, what's at the actual place?

1304
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,760
Playland. They might be.

1305
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,040
But there's something called Mr.

1306
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:58,720
Ken's Donut Factory.

1307
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:00,280
So you want to go there?

1308
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:02,440
They have got something called the Fudge Factory.

1309
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:04,960
You want to check out the Fudge Factory at McKinley Park.

1310
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:08,440
Calm down in case after some of your friends die.

1311
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:10,840
Something called Electric City.

1312
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:13,000
I don't know what that is, but I like the name.

1313
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:18,640
But then, you know, I didn't even have time to do the deep dive on Horrorland.

1314
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:21,320
I didn't grow up with this, but there's like the Wikipedia is massive.

1315
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:25,040
Just every like phrase you see sounds really great.

1316
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:31,240
And I did watch an episode of the show, as you said, Mike.

1317
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:35,120
I didn't realize this isn't even just the horror bracket.

1318
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:40,400
This is the shot in Canada bracket, because that is a Toronto production

1319
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:43,840
as opposed to the Vancouver production.

1320
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:48,000
And that, you know, you get a good sense of the park there.

1321
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,840
There's all these, you know, there's a lot of creepy monsters who work there

1322
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:55,320
and like work the admission, but they still like have an admission booth,

1323
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:58,800
despite it being like monsters and trying to kill you.

1324
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,640
They still have a guy show up in the booth.

1325
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,120
He tells you admission is free.

1326
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:03,240
So that's plus.

1327
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:06,120
Even though bad things happen, even though you have to get once you get in,

1328
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:08,080
you have to be in a demented game show.

1329
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:09,240
But hey, it's free.

1330
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:12,600
And there's monsters working refreshment booths.

1331
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:17,640
There's and you can I try to do some freeze framing throughout this competition

1332
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:20,760
and see like, what's the rest of that menu or what are the rides we don't get to see?

1333
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:25,160
And you do see the family get Monster Punch,

1334
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:29,880
which is topped with dinosaurs for some reason, which are considered monsters, I guess.

1335
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:33,200
But you don't get to see ordering of toenail tacos.

1336
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:34,720
Or crunchy cockroaches.

1337
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:36,600
That sounds good.

1338
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:39,640
Toenail tacos is a good creepy what the Green Goblin would say.

1339
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:45,960
And they have a they have like six flags.

1340
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:50,120
They have a coffin challenge, which is like a regular ride.

1341
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:54,920
The ride is you get in a coffin and they push you down a river in it.

1342
01:08:55,520 --> 01:09:02,160
And then the people in the show seem surprised that then that is scary to do.

1343
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:04,120
They like willingly get in the coffin.

1344
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:06,600
All right. What's the worst that could happen?

1345
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:11,960
And they're like relaxed and enjoying this coffin ride down a river until

1346
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:16,480
until like the door slams and there's a spider in there.

1347
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:20,800
But, you know, you got to like that it has something like six flags.

1348
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:25,600
So just by virtue of the list of specifics, I feel like we know where we're going.

1349
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:29,320
Yeah, I mean, bad stuff's going to happen at both of these choices.

1350
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:34,680
But the creativity of the bad stuff is so much better and cooler at Horrorland.

1351
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:37,520
I mean, yeah, you go through the Wikipedia and there's so much.

1352
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:39,160
There's like different lands.

1353
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:41,560
There's different there's creative ways.

1354
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:45,560
I mean, roller coaster and Final Destination, it's like it just derails.

1355
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:47,600
I mean, there's some like blood dripping.

1356
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,680
I mean, there's some whatever creative stuff, but like

1357
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,360
there's monsters running a theme park.

1358
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:54,200
That's great. That's just fun.

1359
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:56,600
Working the job is working the job.

1360
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:58,240
They're fully staffed up.

1361
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:00,920
Right. That's what we want Disneyland to be more of.

1362
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:03,840
Or at least I did as a kid, I wanted Mickey to be taking tickets

1363
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,680
at the front of the park.

1364
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:07,720
I wanted all characters, no humans.

1365
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:10,720
I bet also that Horrorland hasn't had to do layoffs,

1366
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:14,000
unlike other theme parks during all this, because monsters love COVID.

1367
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:17,440
It may they thrive on it and it makes them them grow.

1368
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:21,600
And CEOs cut their pay for the whole pandemic as well.

1369
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,480
And they're still fine, you know, if they didn't do it

1370
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:25,880
for just a month like Disney did.

1371
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:28,640
It's you know, they their monsters are bad to us,

1372
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:30,120
but they support each other.

1373
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:32,280
So you got a lot of them for that.

1374
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:33,720
Well, I think that's clear.

1375
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:35,400
I think we can lock it in.

1376
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:37,400
Our landing on you advance.

1377
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:43,200
Congratulations, Horrorland, which takes us to we stay scary here.

1378
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:44,920
We're staying scary.

1379
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:47,920
Mm hmm. Is it me? Is it me? Yeah. Yeah.

1380
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:50,520
OK. Evil Island bracket.

1381
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:55,280
This is Pleasure Island versus Spooky Island.

1382
01:10:55,320 --> 01:11:00,600
Pleasure Island, of course, from Pinocchio, not the Disney World defunct island.

1383
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:03,800
Parents Island type.

1384
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:07,440
Yes. So this is and Spooky Island from.

1385
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:10,720
2002 Scooby Doo.

1386
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:12,200
Thank you.

1387
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:16,640
Which what a what a great treat to in preparation for this,

1388
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:19,680
have an excuse to watch 2002 Scooby Doo.

1389
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:21,960
I think kind of a kind of a sleeper.

1390
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:27,800
I think sometimes I like boy, movies have gotten so insane and awful at times

1391
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:31,920
that now I'm like, wow, Scooby Doo from 2002 really had it together.

1392
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:37,480
Great, great performances, wonderful actors, top to bottom, great aesthetics.

1393
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:40,680
What like I at the time I was all like,

1394
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:44,640
I was trying to get into my Wes Anderson's and like this commercial filth.

1395
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:45,760
No, thank you.

1396
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:47,000
But now I'm like, I'd love to.

1397
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,160
I had a great time watching Scooby Doo.

1398
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:50,200
I felt the same way.

1399
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:53,200
Both of those live action Scooby Doos on HBO Max

1400
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:56,320
leave along with the more recent Scoob,

1401
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:00,800
which was directed by the guy who worked on

1402
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:03,400
Tom and Jerry Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.

1403
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:05,960
Oh, weird. Oh, interesting.

1404
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:09,640
So the director, though, of the live action Scooby Doo,

1405
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:14,840
of course, loses points because it's written by Hollywood sicko James Gunn, but

1406
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:19,240
directed by a guy named Roger

1407
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:25,520
Gosnell, who also directed Never Been Kissed, Beverly Hills Chihuahua

1408
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:29,240
and Smurfs and Smurf 2.

1409
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:31,160
What a lineup.

1410
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:33,440
And the filmography.

1411
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:34,800
Am I correct?

1412
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:35,440
Do you have it in front of you?

1413
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:40,160
I think he I think his film debut possibly was Home Alone 3.

1414
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:42,000
I believe you're correct.

1415
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,400
Yes, a perennial masterpiece.

1416
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:51,120
I think that his career is that he was the editor of the first two Home Alones.

1417
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:53,600
And then he's like one of those odd cases

1418
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:59,200
that was in a non directorial position and then worked his way up

1419
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:01,800
to direct a lot of crazy crap.

1420
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:07,160
But you do have to give him credit, I guess, for the aesthetics of this place,

1421
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:09,320
which how do you even describe it?

1422
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:11,520
I don't. It's why.

1423
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:15,640
There is like choices with there's a vibe with Spooky Island.

1424
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:17,600
Yeah, I don't even.

1425
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:22,640
Hmm. It is like it is very imagineered.

1426
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:25,720
I will say like more than a lot of things on this list.

1427
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:30,240
I feel like, oh, a lot of time and thought have been put into the design of this.

1428
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:34,080
It's it's like there's like it's vaguely like I don't know why I want to say

1429
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:37,560
Mortal Kombat ish, which that's not really true, but it feels like

1430
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:40,480
it feels a video game evil.

1431
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:44,960
Yeah, that's a vague because it's a CGI ish.

1432
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:50,840
Mm hmm. But kind of good, kind of a good example of early 2000 CGI.

1433
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:55,000
I find this sometimes Scooby himself is kind of awful to look at.

1434
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:59,960
But the the place, I mean, like, do you guys all have in front of you

1435
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:03,920
the the the main vista that you see when you arrive?

1436
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:07,560
It's really all about this. I saw it. Yeah, that's the that's the shot.

1437
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:12,520
You know, admittedly, they don't really go into a lot of detail about what the rides are.

1438
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:17,720
But when you land on Spooky Island from Spooky Airlines

1439
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:24,840
set to a very lazy, also ran outcast song called Land of a Million Drums.

1440
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:30,040
There is sorry if you really love that particular song.

1441
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:33,600
There's just like this.

1442
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:37,160
What a great, like beautiful tropical Australia, I think,

1443
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:40,800
is where they shot all these because then there were yes crossover with the theme park down there.

1444
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:47,520
Just like crazy, like studded skull with water slides

1445
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:53,800
bursting out of both of its eyes and then sort of a I mean, lots of big skeleton kind of stuff.

1446
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:58,360
There's a huge I mean, just like amazing fake rock work.

1447
01:14:58,360 --> 01:14:59,640
You got to give it up for that.

1448
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:03,160
This big, like, yes, that mountain head thing.

1449
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,200
The coaster looks fantastic.

1450
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:13,160
It's all it's like a little burning manny, like you almost feel like Raleigh Crump individual.

1451
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:18,800
Like maybe there was one art director who designed all of Spooky Island and it shows.

1452
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:24,800
Yeah, and it has that kind of like it's laid out really well, which is something

1453
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:28,040
you know, how we talk about, especially like a Tokyo Disney Sea,

1454
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:31,200
where like every angle of the park is very impressive.

1455
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:34,640
You could be in the, you know, in the back right corner of it and look and go, oh, wow,

1456
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:36,640
this looks like it was perfectly framed.

1457
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:38,120
And it's not maybe quite as good as that.

1458
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:42,840
But this does look like some thought was put into it from a design standpoint,

1459
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:46,280
where like you would go, oh, I could see how this would be so impressive,

1460
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:49,400
you know, standing here at the front gate.

1461
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:54,760
This image, if you arrive via a boat, which is cool, very cool in and of itself.

1462
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:57,720
If you arrived and saw this main establishing shot,

1463
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,680
you'd be so excited for all the fun you did.

1464
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:04,760
This this frame might be the best frame of anything that we're talking about.

1465
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:07,800
I think. Yeah, I agree.

1466
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,720
I'd love to be there.

1467
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:13,680
But do you dock at points because you don't really get you kind of go around

1468
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:17,720
like this one spooky castle ride is broken.

1469
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:20,400
I don't they don't stress the rides at all.

1470
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:22,200
You don't really have a sense of what the rides are.

1471
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:25,360
No, they they really stress the resort aspect.

1472
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:29,600
There's mention of Emil Mondavarius, the head of the park.

1473
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:32,720
Rowan Atkinson's character,

1474
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:37,000
you know, antagonizing the creatures that supposedly inhabit the park.

1475
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:40,640
And you never want to antagonize the locals when you build a park.

1476
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:42,720
You know, you want to reach out.

1477
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:47,080
So it's it's tough because, yeah, while they don't get into the rides,

1478
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:50,680
you can tell what kind of what the rides are.

1479
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:55,760
You know, it's like, despite the fact that they don't like go over how it works

1480
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:58,240
or they don't ride some of the things you see,

1481
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:02,200
I can still kind of tell what this crazy rollercoaster in the background

1482
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:06,400
or the eye thing, I can kind of imagine what it would be like.

1483
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:09,440
So is that hmm, I don't know.

1484
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:12,080
We're running up into a situation here where I haven't even thought about it.

1485
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:15,920
Is my imagination of what the rides are.

1486
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:18,600
Is that valid in this competition?

1487
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:21,040
Sure, if they don't take the time to show you.

1488
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:26,640
And what they do show you is a cool hotel, a fun spring

1489
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:31,440
break vibe, lots of energetic youths hang around in very inventive pants.

1490
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:34,400
I think this is a place that you want to be.

1491
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,960
It's it's really like a

1492
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:39,960
a place for teens is what it what it feels like.

1493
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:44,000
This is a cool spring break park for teens, as opposed to the

1494
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:48,720
the competitor that we haven't even talked about, which is entirely for children.

1495
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:51,640
So we don't even have the option to go there.

1496
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:54,080
But at this point, there's not one adult around.

1497
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:57,960
Even though I live my life saying hi, diddle, diddy, diddy.

1498
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:02,480
Hi, diddle, diddy, an actor's life for me.

1499
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:04,280
So real tongue with her.

1500
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:08,680
Is that what Walt really thought of actor like, well, these vagabond scumbags,

1501
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:10,960
these crazy, these nasty little creeps?

1502
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,720
I'd like to think he did, but I don't know that to be a fact.

1503
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:17,880
They're manipulated.

1504
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:20,080
There is a great

1505
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:22,560
I started listening to the audio book of Disney War

1506
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:25,160
about like the ousting of the Eisner regime.

1507
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:28,560
And it there's so within

1508
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:32,800
the first 30 minutes, there's so many great details.

1509
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:37,840
But there is an anecdote about like Walt and his family watching

1510
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:41,160
to kill a mockingbird and him going, I wish I could make.

1511
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:42,240
They were all very moved.

1512
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:44,600
And he goes like, I wish I could make a movie like that.

1513
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:49,760
But unfortunately, like they the public has this idea of Walt Disney.

1514
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:51,840
That's not me. I drink. I smoke.

1515
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:54,240
I can't can't make movies like this.

1516
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:56,800
I've never heard this anecdote before.

1517
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:58,160
Mm hmm.

1518
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:02,400
This is like all the the secret movies Lucas makes that we'll never get to see.

1519
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:05,920
Oh, yeah. And they are so experimental.

1520
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:07,400
What are they?

1521
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:10,640
Are they just like colors bleeding into each other and then like loud?

1522
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:13,640
And is it is there like a lot of nudity in them?

1523
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:17,320
Or they would you like throw up if you watched one of these secret Lucas?

1524
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:21,040
Yeah. Is it a snuff movie or is it just like Stan Brakhage?

1525
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:23,440
Like pain on film, like sort of thing?

1526
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:27,760
Or is it like just Kim playing all the parts in his episode seven,

1527
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:30,360
the one that he had in his mind?

1528
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:34,920
And he's making the whole like 22 hour movie and he's playing all the characters.

1529
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:37,280
I'm I'm a will.

1530
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:39,600
I'm Willie Will.

1531
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,680
I'm nerd luck, nerd luck will.

1532
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:46,400
Yeah, it's part of the space jam of verse two.

1533
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:49,440
These are voices that George Lucas is doing.

1534
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:52,360
Let's let's talk about Pleasure Island.

1535
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:56,320
The I look again.

1536
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:58,480
You love it. Personal biases.

1537
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:01,400
You love a little puppet boy.

1538
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:05,520
Have you seen this new Coke Zero commercial with a horrifying Pinocchio in it?

1539
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:07,920
No, I'll send it to you later.

1540
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:10,000
Yeah, it's a real, real nightmare.

1541
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,560
I think there's a couple of them.

1542
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:13,200
This is you.

1543
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:15,040
All right. Another evil island.

1544
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:19,160
You get your you get on a boat and that is that has too many people on it.

1545
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:22,440
And then you run across a bridge that has too many people on it.

1546
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:25,520
And then you get in a Ferris wheel that has too many people on it.

1547
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,560
There's like 12 kids in a car.

1548
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:29,120
They're all exploding out.

1549
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:30,320
People are going to fall.

1550
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:35,280
This is too. This is over capacity to begin with on Pleasure Island.

1551
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:37,480
They've they've overbooked this.

1552
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:40,280
I guess knowing that there'll be a lot a lot of turnover,

1553
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:42,600
that these kids aren't going to be kids for long.

1554
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:46,960
No, I there's a the character.

1555
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:49,920
There are some like what would you say the wall to Pleasure Island is it?

1556
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:53,560
Is it is it Honest John or is it that other guy?

1557
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:55,320
Stromboli, Stromboli.

1558
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:58,880
No, they just like maybe they don't like actually they.

1559
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:01,720
I don't know that we who's like really profiting.

1560
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:04,000
Maybe it is that main that boat guy.

1561
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:05,560
Yeah, that's John.

1562
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:09,760
Wait, no, John is it's that other guy that like sort of.

1563
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:12,080
Well, they say I'm looking at the Wikipedia and I apologize.

1564
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:14,400
You know, we know the ride's better than we know the movies, folks.

1565
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:19,520
But Jay Worthington Fowlfellow is the Fox is Honest John.

1566
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:24,960
OK, and it is implied to be an illegal or extremely notorious place

1567
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,560
as hinted by Jay Worthington Fowlfellow.

1568
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:30,520
So I don't think he owns it, but he is the Fox.

1569
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:33,040
That's the same guy. The Coachman is the owner of the island.

1570
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:35,120
The Coachman does own it.

1571
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:36,840
Yeah, Coachman is the owner of the island.

1572
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:39,560
The guy in the big red smock, essentially.

1573
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:41,840
God, well, why do you think all the bad boys?

1574
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:45,480
There's enough in it for them to this Fox to like just

1575
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:48,600
steal children, just funnel children.

1576
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:51,400
This is this is a child trafficking ring.

1577
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:54,080
This is scarcely a theme park, as I think about it.

1578
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:56,960
Yeah, I guess now that you put it like that, I feel like nobody can vote for it.

1579
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:59,920
Honest John and Gideon work for him.

1580
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:03,840
And I'm remembering, Scott, your story of being set when you were sat on.

1581
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:06,520
Yeah, by Gideon, right?

1582
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:09,280
Yep. So that's that's working against maybe.

1583
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:14,400
That's why I'm being so severe about this in the world of Pinocchio in general.

1584
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:17,960
As much as I think that Joseph Gordon-Levitt's

1585
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:21,200
Jiminy Cricket will make my spirits soar

1586
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:25,160
and make me want to wish upon a star as I did when I was young.

1587
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:27,480
But we haven't seen him yet.

1588
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:28,480
He's not in this.

1589
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:32,600
He's not in this creepy 1940s version full of tobacco.

1590
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:35,760
And how is this being vandalized?

1591
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:37,880
Yes. The Rough House.

1592
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:42,120
There's an attraction called the Rough House, which is a tent where boys can fight

1593
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:46,360
and causes the kids, where the children go to fight.

1594
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:50,520
The character Lampwick, who Pinocchio meets, goes, Oh, boy, a scrap.

1595
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:54,800
I would love to be Lampwick in this live action Pinocchio.

1596
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:57,440
Would love to. Jason for Lampwick.

1597
01:22:57,680 --> 01:22:59,560
Oh, please.

1598
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:04,040
I, of course, will get yelled at by the food stylist people.

1599
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:07,960
They have to prepare as a disembodied voice yells,

1600
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:11,360
get your cake pie, dill, pickles and ice cream.

1601
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:14,120
All the things children love to indulge in.

1602
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:15,680
What is up with that?

1603
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:17,200
Why is this?

1604
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:21,720
Did Walt consider dill pickles a major vice at the time?

1605
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:25,200
Only the worst children would salivate over dill pickles.

1606
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:27,040
Well, and he would go on to sell it.

1607
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:30,360
A lot of this stuff that they're like, oh, look at all this disgusting stuff.

1608
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:31,840
Looks like attractions.

1609
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,960
He would go on to build.

1610
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:35,280
Yeah.

1611
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,640
Uh, so there, but there is.

1612
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:41,320
There is some fun to be had.

1613
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:43,640
The design of it, I find very enticing.

1614
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:45,800
I like the look of it in the cartoon.

1615
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:47,640
I think it looks very cool.

1616
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:48,480
Yeah.

1617
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:51,880
Um, and I guess it's hard, you know, these are good animators

1618
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:54,320
or great animators who put this stuff together.

1619
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:57,600
So I do as well say, despite the fact that I would, if I was a little boy,

1620
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,520
I would come out the other end being a donkey.

1621
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:01,960
I would be excited to go there.

1622
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:04,520
I might be uncomfortable because when I found out exactly like, Oh,

1623
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:07,640
smoking and tobacco that's and scraps.

1624
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:10,760
But as a kid, it would appeal to me just aesthetically.

1625
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:12,560
Yeah.

1626
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:13,120
Yeah.

1627
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:18,400
Um, yeah, boy, you'd really like, maybe you'd like jump off and try to swim

1628
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:24,000
home and either die on the way, but also avoid being a donkey forever.

1629
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:30,040
Um, maybe, uh, yeah, the fear of scraps would might save both of us,

1630
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:32,360
but condemn Jason to donk.

1631
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:33,600
Right.

1632
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:34,640
All right.

1633
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:35,000
Yeah.

1634
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:35,480
That's fine.

1635
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:37,880
I guess that's my lot.

1636
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:40,400
You becoming a donkey.

1637
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:41,000
Yeah.

1638
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:46,080
If you, maybe you might still have access to like unfinished

1639
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:48,840
pickles and like full chickens.

1640
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:50,800
There's some crust in that pie tin.

1641
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:51,440
Give it here.

1642
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:53,120
Give it here.

1643
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:53,680
Lampy.

1644
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:57,560
Um, so this is tough.

1645
01:24:57,560 --> 01:25:01,480
This is difficult except I guess the donkey part is the,

1646
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:04,640
yeah, that is what happens.

1647
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:06,560
This is not a good thing that they're doing.

1648
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:09,960
I mean, it's easy for me, but maybe it's less easy.

1649
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:10,920
Uh, let's see.

1650
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:12,480
I don't want to sway it.

1651
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:17,160
I mean, yeah, as far as an imagineered place.

1652
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:18,520
Yeah.

1653
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:24,800
I, I think, I think I'm going to have to vote against pleasure Island.

1654
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:26,320
I think spooky Island has to win.

1655
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:28,720
Hey, I'll give it.

1656
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:30,080
I'll give it to spooky Island.

1657
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:32,000
It is very intriguing.

1658
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:32,800
Wasn't sure.

1659
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:38,280
Wasn't sure if the, if the pies would have enough sway, but there's probably

1660
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:43,000
pies on spooky Island too, I think teens like pies.

1661
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:43,920
That's true.

1662
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:44,280
Yeah.

1663
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:47,880
So there's gotta be, yeah, there's gotta be elements there and just the rides look

1664
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:50,240
cool, the rides do look cool at spooky Island.

1665
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:51,040
I can't deny that.

1666
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:51,680
Yeah.

1667
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:52,040
Yeah.

1668
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:54,040
Um, okay.

1669
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:57,200
So now we get unscary, thankfully.

1670
01:25:57,280 --> 01:26:02,280
And, uh, we move on to it's, it's, it's, it's, uh, it's all comedy.

1671
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:05,920
It's all, it's all, it's kind of a live action realm from here on out.

1672
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:08,440
Uh, Jason, you want to take this next one?

1673
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:15,200
Um, I, I think I got myself turned around as I do at least once.

1674
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:15,720
Hold on.

1675
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:16,280
Oh, I'll do here.

1676
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:16,920
I got it.

1677
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:20,400
You know, maybe I should do it also because I, I do have some

1678
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:21,520
splaining to do.

1679
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:28,880
Um, I crafted this particular bracket to be the actually magic mountain bracket.

1680
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:29,720
Oh yes.

1681
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:32,080
Foul foul on the court on this one.

1682
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:32,520
Yeah.

1683
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:32,640
Yeah.

1684
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:32,920
Yeah.

1685
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:33,040
Yeah.

1686
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:33,120
Yeah.

1687
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:34,080
I'm, I'm heading there.

1688
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:34,840
I'm going to admit it.

1689
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:40,880
Um, I, and, and this is a competition between Wally world from national

1690
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:48,320
lampoons vacation and mega mountain from three ninjas high noon at mega mountain.

1691
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:52,000
Um, so I had that category makes sense.

1692
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,040
They were both actually filmed at six flags, magic mountain,

1693
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:56,120
makes sense, pair them up.

1694
01:26:56,360 --> 01:27:01,280
I start watching the movie and I'm halfway in and realize this is not, I

1695
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:04,640
thought maybe just some of it was not at magic mountain, but they're going to get there.

1696
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:07,560
I don't know why I always thought this was filmed at magic mountain.

1697
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:09,120
Is it just cause it's called mega mountain?

1698
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:11,320
Did the coaster look like Colossus?

1699
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,000
Yeah.

1700
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:15,240
You see where I was going with it, but we can't call it that it's not

1701
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:16,480
the actually magic mountain.

1702
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:20,400
It's the technically a six flags bracket.

1703
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:25,600
Uh, if you add a few asterisks and explain yourself because mega mountain,

1704
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:31,360
uh, three ninjas, uh, mega mountain was filmed at Colorado's elitch gardens,

1705
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:36,840
which was owned and operated by six flags from 1999 to 2006 until it was

1706
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:40,080
sold off during the Dan Snyder regime.

1707
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:41,760
Oh, yeah.

1708
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:42,040
Yeah.

1709
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:43,280
Interesting.

1710
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:44,160
Okay.

1711
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:47,840
But it is notable now in the last couple of years as the home to

1712
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:50,360
Meow Wolf's kaleidoscope attraction.

1713
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:51,560
Really?

1714
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:52,440
Oh, wow.

1715
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:53,320
Oh, that's cool.

1716
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:55,280
Oh, we should learn more about this place.

1717
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:59,480
Um, and a lot of YouTubers call it shitty.

1718
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,320
So I am interested.

1719
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:04,160
I think it looks nice.

1720
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:06,600
A smaller park, but, um, yeah.

1721
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:07,240
Interesting.

1722
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:07,760
Hmm.

1723
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:11,640
Um, but yeah, I mean, there's similar feels to these things.

1724
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:16,840
There's a big white roller coaster, a wooden roller coaster that's kind of central to it.

1725
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:21,120
Um, you know, bias about the products is going to factor in here.

1726
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:24,640
And national ampoules vacation, one of my favorite comedies for sure.

1727
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:25,640
One of my favorite movies.

1728
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:27,160
Uh, I always love it.

1729
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:27,680
Still love it.

1730
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:30,400
Things still make me laugh really hard in it.

1731
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:34,400
Um, if you can believe it, three ninjas, high noon and mega mountain is a lesser

1732
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:37,160
film, I might go so far as to say.

1733
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:40,280
Uh, yes, I would, I would agree with that.

1734
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:44,120
Uh, I had to brush up on my three ninjas, high noon at mega mountain.

1735
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:45,800
Uh, and I was looking at YouTube.

1736
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:48,800
One of the first videos that pops up is three ninjas, high noon and mega

1737
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:51,120
mountain, 1998 leather compilation.

1738
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:55,200
Uh, Lonnie Anderson is villainous Medusa and sexy leather outfits.

1739
01:28:55,200 --> 01:29:01,320
Someone has compiled all of Lonnie Anderson's scenes or I guess the best scenes into one

1740
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:05,280
clip that seems to be maybe what the most popular aspect of this movie is, I guess.

1741
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:10,560
And you already had that, you had that on your watch later playlist.

1742
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:11,800
So that was very convenient.

1743
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:14,280
You just went to the top of your list and right it up.

1744
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,800
Um, Lonnie in leather.

1745
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:21,080
That's funny when that happens, when you are looking for a clip from something and

1746
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:26,840
then you realize and you find it and you're like, wait, this is framed in some fetish.

1747
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:27,320
Yes.

1748
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,160
What happened here?

1749
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:32,960
There are, let me say this.

1750
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:39,200
I got, I watch a lot of clips of old late night talk shows as I'm assuming we all do,

1751
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:40,920
just old style.

1752
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:41,360
Likewise.

1753
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:44,840
I said before, I like watching Desi, Ernest bore everybody on the tonight show with a

1754
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:52,320
story about Charo and Xavier Kugit, but I now have been getting recommended David

1755
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:59,400
Letterman flirting compilations or Craig Ferguson flirting compilations, 25 minute

1756
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:04,880
videos, part one through 50 of David Letterman flirting with women.

1757
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:06,920
Like who's making these?

1758
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:08,040
Who is tape?

1759
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:12,560
Who was the entire library of late night hosts?

1760
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:17,520
And remembers catalogs moments where David Letterman's like smiling a little.

1761
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:18,680
I it's weird.

1762
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:19,360
Wild.

1763
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:24,320
So yes, finding leather compilation and it's all in lowercase letters.

1764
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:26,280
Leather compilation too.

1765
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:28,560
It's just very, uh, very funny.

1766
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:34,160
The podcast, the ride flirting with guests, a compilation would be zero minutes long.

1767
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:38,520
Uh, we are very tame, even with our own significant others.

1768
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:41,520
Hear every host say I'm sorry.

1769
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:42,160
Yeah.

1770
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:45,760
We love your ride.

1771
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:47,960
Stigment.

1772
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:56,880
Uh, so, um, well, but despite, so high leather content, but that's not Medusa.

1773
01:30:56,920 --> 01:30:59,000
She takes Medusa takes over the park.

1774
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,320
She's not supposed to be there.

1775
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:03,640
Um, let's do, we got to think about the park itself.

1776
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:05,920
And I don't know that you find out a lot.

1777
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:10,280
I think the mega mountain is the most generic theme park there is.

1778
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:10,680
Yeah.

1779
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:15,040
Um, other than that they are briefly featuring, you know, what happens when a

1780
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:22,360
guy wraps up his 15 season long stunt show, uh, and then to commemorate the show

1781
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:26,920
being canceled does a weekend of live performances next to a roller coaster,

1782
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:30,600
which is what Hulk Hogan's character does in this movie.

1783
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:33,360
And then gets himself embroiled in a real mess.

1784
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:38,880
Um, fine Hulk performance, fine Lonnie Anderson, fine Jim Varney performance.

1785
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:39,880
Oh, Jim Varney.

1786
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:41,040
Fantastic performance.

1787
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:44,560
You love, I love seeing a non earnest from Jim Varney.

1788
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:48,360
There's very few of them, but boy, anytime he's not earn, even in the earnest

1789
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:52,320
movies, when he's other characters, when he's that like mean prisoner who steals

1790
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:53,880
earnest identity, that's great.

1791
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:54,840
Love Jim Varney.

1792
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:55,760
Yeah.

1793
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:58,000
He's like Lonnie Anderson is like number two.

1794
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,280
He's, he's Lothar Zog.

1795
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:01,800
That is his character's name.

1796
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:03,480
Lothar Zog.

1797
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:04,840
Z-O-G-G.

1798
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:05,600
Mm hmm.

1799
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:06,360
It's a good name.

1800
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:12,920
I got to tell you, I, this movie sticks out in my mind because I remember going

1801
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:17,120
and seeing three ninjas in theater with my dad and brother had a great time.

1802
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:19,280
Saw the sequel, three ninjas kick back.

1803
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:20,000
Same thing.

1804
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:21,160
Had a nice time.

1805
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,160
Don't remember the third movie, the prequel.

1806
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:25,720
This is the fourth movie.

1807
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:30,600
I remember seeing boxes and blockbuster video and it's one of my early memories

1808
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:33,160
of going like, ugh, what the hell?

1809
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:35,760
Like just being disgusted by this.

1810
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:38,800
And I don't know if it's just like, they're still churning it out.

1811
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:45,160
That's clearly none of the original three kids and Hulk Hogan has the weirdest hair.

1812
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:47,960
And just that poster, that box.

1813
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:49,040
Like, I don't know.

1814
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:51,560
I was just like, ew, I don't know.

1815
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:55,600
Even as a kid, I guess I would have been like seventh or eighth grade when this

1816
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:59,160
got released on video, but like, yeah, I don't know.

1817
01:32:59,160 --> 01:33:01,760
The Elitch Garden seems very generic.

1818
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:03,200
They did change a lot of the signs.

1819
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:07,360
Apparently there are shots where you can see Elitch Garden signs they missed.

1820
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:10,280
Yeah.

1821
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:16,640
I, I don't think they're, I mean, Wally world, this is another early like live action.

1822
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:19,040
Like, okay, Disneyland's been around long enough.

1823
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:23,640
It's a universal enough that we can make fun of it in a big comedy release.

1824
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:29,720
Chevy Chase is a star at the time and a comedy movie that has like held up.

1825
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:34,680
I'm sure there's some dated stuff in it, but like, yeah, there's still very

1826
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:36,520
funny performances and stuff in it.

1827
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:41,480
And yeah, and probably the best like comedy set piece involving the theme

1828
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:42,880
park, I'd have to think.

1829
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:43,400
Yeah.

1830
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:48,880
Just like, yeah, it's being sort of taken hostage by this angry dad

1831
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:50,360
and John Candy's so great.

1832
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:52,200
All reshoots I found out.

1833
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:55,280
I think there was, there was an original ending where they got to Wally world.

1834
01:33:55,280 --> 01:34:00,600
It was closed and then they go to Roy Wally's house, the waltz of this movie.

1835
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:03,840
They go to his mansion and bother him there.

1836
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,960
So none of that John Candy stuff and none of the park is in it.

1837
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:10,680
So they made the right move because boy, that park sequence is so fun.

1838
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:11,440
Yeah.

1839
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:12,720
Marty Moose.

1840
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:13,760
He's Marty Moose.

1841
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:16,520
I was going to say like Roy Wally and Marty Moose.

1842
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:20,320
You don't have a ton of like, it doesn't seem like it was made by like theme

1843
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:25,360
park nerds, but just Roy Wally and Marty Moose go so far.

1844
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:26,400
Yes.

1845
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:30,120
Just as far as specifics and characters you enjoy.

1846
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:32,280
So, I mean, I, it's not a contest.

1847
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:32,760
Yeah.

1848
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:33,160
Yeah.

1849
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:34,400
We could pick up the pace.

1850
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:37,880
I think we could call this one Wally world.

1851
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:39,200
Makes sense to me.

1852
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:42,560
I enjoyed watching mega mountain that I, that I will say.

1853
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:43,560
Oh yeah.

1854
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:43,880
Yeah.

1855
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:46,360
Well, there was so much leather in it, Scott.

1856
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:47,520
How could you not enjoy it?

1857
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:51,040
And Jim Lothar and leather?

1858
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:53,200
Not, yeah, I'm a Lothar fan.

1859
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:54,440
I'm a leather fan.

1860
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:56,520
I'm a leather head like George Clooney.

1861
01:34:57,280 --> 01:35:01,040
Did we say Jason was a leather daddy in one of the episodes like two years ago?

1862
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:03,080
I mean, it's entirely likely.

1863
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:05,480
Seems don't remember why we would have.

1864
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:06,040
Don't remember.

1865
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:07,440
Seems like us.

1866
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:11,240
Um, well, uh, so yeah, if you're a leather daddy.

1867
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:14,680
Uh, then high noon is the, yeah.

1868
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:17,200
Uh, and that, that YouTube clips the clip for you.

1869
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:21,080
Um, that's, that's good because I think we need to get to this one because this

1870
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:24,040
was, this is a, this is a pretty meaty one.

1871
01:35:24,040 --> 01:35:25,200
Jason, do you want to take this?

1872
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:25,840
I do.

1873
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:29,720
This is the wild card brackets and 1994 comedy bracket.

1874
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:34,760
Wonder world from Beverly Hills, cop three versus dinosaur world from the

1875
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:37,840
much panned, but now whole classic film Clifford.

1876
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:38,400
Yep.

1877
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:38,960
Yep.

1878
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:41,200
Both films from 1994.

1879
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:42,360
I was really hoping.

1880
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:43,920
And then like, is the other one?

1881
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:45,320
And it was Clifford.

1882
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:47,640
I don't think wanted to be from 1994.

1883
01:35:47,640 --> 01:35:51,000
I think this is a film that's set on the shelf for some time.

1884
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
This is a, yeah, some maligned movie.

1885
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:56,560
Now I got to tell you though, I, I learned about the existence of

1886
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:58,080
Clifford from the best show.

1887
01:35:58,160 --> 01:36:02,480
Cause, uh, Tom Schartling is a big, uh, proponent of this movie.

1888
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:06,720
And I think I got it from Netflix, like mail you DVD Netflix.

1889
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:10,880
And I think it's, it's so fun.

1890
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:16,000
Like Martin Short, Charles Groten, Mary Steenburgen, it's hard to beat.

1891
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:17,200
Dabney Coleman.

1892
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:19,600
And it's, it's weird.

1893
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:21,520
It is so weird.

1894
01:36:21,560 --> 01:36:23,400
Martin Short plays a 10 year old.

1895
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:28,400
Uh, Charles Groten is one of the angriest characters in film and they're

1896
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,000
just at the top of their game.

1897
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:33,680
And folks, if you haven't check out Clifford.

1898
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:35,040
Also on HBO max.

1899
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:37,560
An odd amount of these things are.

1900
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:43,640
Um, yeah, it's, it's something I feel like I didn't dig it a lot in it's like

1901
01:36:43,640 --> 01:36:45,760
aired on Comedy Central all the time.

1902
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:46,200
Yeah.

1903
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:50,840
Hey day, but there's something about it now again in, in, in hindsight.

1904
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:55,200
And the thing that we've sort of like lost the bizarre character at the center

1905
01:36:55,480 --> 01:37:00,240
of the movie comedy, um, I like, I miss it a lot.

1906
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:04,920
I miss this kind of thing and yeah, it's insane and things don't work about it.

1907
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:09,160
But, um, it's, it's pretty interesting and bizarre.

1908
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:13,920
And then, you know, so are we now, are we just taking like odd affection for the

1909
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:16,600
movie, uh, into consideration here?

1910
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:20,880
Maybe, but the rock, the, the park and the ride.

1911
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:22,520
Oh, I mean, yeah.

1912
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:26,120
Are we all coming in as enthusiastic about dinosaur dinosaur?

1913
01:37:26,120 --> 01:37:29,280
Well, yeah, I just commit so hard.

1914
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:33,000
I feel like it's really like built like a track.

1915
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:35,880
Like it's ride, like it's crazy.

1916
01:37:36,160 --> 01:37:41,600
The scene in the movie, you get a full sense of this entire ride.

1917
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:46,960
It's maybe a rare case where they invent a whole ride and show you every bit of it.

1918
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:53,800
You really, you completely know what the ride is because Clifford, uh, Charles

1919
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:58,040
Groton is not his, is his uncle or something who is Uncle Martin.

1920
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:00,880
Um, and, and it's his dream.

1921
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:02,680
It's Clifford's dream to go to dinosaur world.

1922
01:38:02,680 --> 01:38:06,240
Uncle Martin worked on dinosaur world, so he has access to it.

1923
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:10,320
And eventually he's pushed to the brink so much that he does take

1924
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:15,040
Clifford dinosaur world, but in sort of a kidnapping way, takes them on the ride,

1925
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:18,720
but then takes them on the ride again and double speed and then again and again.

1926
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:24,360
Uh, and so the ride is kind of used as a torture device until, uh, things work out.

1927
01:38:24,680 --> 01:38:31,240
But, um, in setting that up, oh my God, you get to go, this is just, I think one

1928
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:34,120
of the best like ride sequences there's ever been.

1929
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:35,600
Oh, yeah.

1930
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:37,360
And he's just so excited to go.

1931
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:38,080
He is lying.

1932
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:42,080
I believe that dinosaur world is the only place that a boy like me can be happy.

1933
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:44,120
Like it's, it's great.

1934
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:44,760
It's great.

1935
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:45,560
He's right.

1936
01:38:45,640 --> 01:38:46,520
He's right.

1937
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:51,760
This ride is so good and you see it and you see it from all angles of it.

1938
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:55,280
I don't think there's another ride in any of the things we've talked about that is,

1939
01:38:55,400 --> 01:39:00,560
is fleshed out and has shown you almost all parts of it as this.

1940
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:04,720
Like this is like a ride through video of this ride.

1941
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:05,720
Yeah.

1942
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:06,920
Yeah, essentially.

1943
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:11,280
And you get with beautiful coverage and beautiful, uh, matte paintings.

1944
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:13,240
I think you have to give it up for matte paintings throughout this thing.

1945
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:16,720
Cause it's matte paintings that make the entrance to Wally world looks so cool.

1946
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:20,040
It kind of, there's, there's other ones of these that use matte paintings to great effect.

1947
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:24,520
And, uh, oh my God, there's just beautiful painting work to set this up.

1948
01:39:24,520 --> 01:39:28,880
When the, uh, uh, uncle Martin obscons with Clifford in the middle of the night.

1949
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:34,080
So it's kind of like crack of dawn that you're arriving at dinosaur world and you see the

1950
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:36,360
sun rise above it just a little bit.

1951
01:39:36,760 --> 01:39:39,320
And I'm like, this is Disney sea.

1952
01:39:39,560 --> 01:39:45,280
This is Tokyo Disney sea or Nate fake rocks, a whole rich environment.

1953
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:53,680
Um, and within that, I think this ride, which is called Larry, the scary Rex is journey

1954
01:39:53,680 --> 01:39:54,600
to the center of the earth.

1955
01:39:55,120 --> 01:39:57,240
It's, it's in a similar environment.

1956
01:39:57,240 --> 01:39:59,400
It's in a volcano type setting.

1957
01:39:59,640 --> 01:40:05,720
There's magma, there's lava and it's, uh, and like incredible animatronics.

1958
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:10,320
There's it's a works as a gentle dark ride, but then it's really thrilling.

1959
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:17,480
Um, Mike, this, uh, issue of intimacy with characters and animatronics, you get

1960
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:22,520
intimacy big time, you get long moments with.

1961
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:24,320
It's unbelievable.

1962
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:26,280
Oh, yeah.

1963
01:40:26,360 --> 01:40:27,240
You haven't seen it.

1964
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:32,440
If you're listening to this right now, I actually suggest pausing this and just

1965
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:33,600
going, there's a YouTube video.

1966
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:35,120
I think it's called Clifford rides.

1967
01:40:35,120 --> 01:40:36,560
Larry, the scary Rex.

1968
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:39,280
It is, it'll blow your mind.

1969
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:43,320
If you're like us, like you will go, Oh, it, I, it feels like this ride exists.

1970
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:48,480
This is how much work went into this movie that like they didn't, nobody wanted to

1971
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:53,120
come out and that like, isn't like, it's an incredible sequence, but it's also one

1972
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:57,040
of those nineties, like, uh, just kind of becomes like action and stuff.

1973
01:40:57,040 --> 01:40:59,080
And it's not funny per se.

1974
01:40:59,120 --> 01:41:04,280
I remember thinking this sequence is like unpleasant as a comedy ending of a movie

1975
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:09,720
that already has problems and yet taking all that away, just watching it as like a

1976
01:41:09,720 --> 01:41:13,440
ride through, I want this to exist so badly.

1977
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:15,320
There's a shooting element.

1978
01:41:15,320 --> 01:41:17,000
There's so many elements to this, right?

1979
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,560
It was, it feels like it was made by an Imagineer.

1980
01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:22,000
Like there's so much thought put into it.

1981
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:22,880
There are moods.

1982
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:25,200
There are different, Scott was saying with his journey to the center of the earth.

1983
01:41:25,200 --> 01:41:28,960
It feels like there's, they have so many different things that the ride does.

1984
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:31,520
There's thrills, there's robots, there's intimacy.

1985
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:33,160
There's a shooting aspect of it.

1986
01:41:33,160 --> 01:41:33,680
It's shooting.

1987
01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:34,920
It's a shooter ride.

1988
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:35,920
Interactive.

1989
01:41:35,960 --> 01:41:36,320
Yeah.

1990
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:42,920
You have to fire a laser at, it's not just you pass by the titular Larry, the scary

1991
01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:44,880
Rex, you have to kill him.

1992
01:41:45,320 --> 01:41:48,840
You have, you pull out a laser gun that you don't know is there suddenly

1993
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:53,160
surprise drops in your lap and you have to, you have to bring him to the ground.

1994
01:41:53,160 --> 01:41:53,880
It's crazy.

1995
01:41:54,280 --> 01:42:01,680
Meanwhile, here is what Eddie Murphy had to say before Beverly Hills Cop 3 was made.

1996
01:42:01,880 --> 01:42:08,640
If I do a Cop 3, you can safely say, oh, he must've got a lot of money.

1997
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:15,080
Because here's what I learned about this movie.

1998
01:42:15,720 --> 01:42:18,680
A lot of people involved in it have disowned it.

1999
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,480
I want nothing to do with it.

2000
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:30,360
And you know, don't forget that before the film was made, that, you know, we're

2001
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:34,120
all thinking about coming to America a little bit because the sequel is out.

2002
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:38,600
And which, and both these films were Eddie Murphy and directed by John

2003
01:42:38,600 --> 01:42:43,760
Landis, Eddie Murphy said some horrible things about John Landis and yet still

2004
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:44,960
made this movie with him.

2005
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:46,040
It's so confusing.

2006
01:42:46,120 --> 01:42:48,520
Choked him on the set, I believe.

2007
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:58,880
I said stuff about the trial, like essentially, like imagine that you like,

2008
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:04,160
well, I think that this guy was involved in these kids dying, but yeah, sign them

2009
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:06,920
up, get them on Cop 3, why not?

2010
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:09,280
That's how little give a shit.

2011
01:43:10,120 --> 01:43:16,720
Now that all being said, I think in another category, this is a very detailed,

2012
01:43:16,720 --> 01:43:22,000
the 1994 is the curse of this because they have absolutely thought out an

2013
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,520
entire full theme park with Wonderworld.

2014
01:43:24,520 --> 01:43:25,600
It's so detailed.

2015
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:27,760
And characters, this is the thing we're saying.

2016
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:31,320
And I almost feel, yeah, now that we're doing it, I feel almost bad.

2017
01:43:31,320 --> 01:43:35,320
I feel like this should have been in a different category because yes, I

2018
01:43:35,320 --> 01:43:36,560
think it could have won.

2019
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:37,440
I mean, you know what?

2020
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:38,440
We, there are no rules.

2021
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:40,960
Could we throw this and replace it with something else?

2022
01:43:41,240 --> 01:43:42,160
That's interesting.

2023
01:43:42,200 --> 01:43:42,600
Yeah.

2024
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:43,040
Why not?

2025
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:44,400
If there's one, we don't feel like.

2026
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,480
Let's look at the other one, the list of what's one.

2027
01:43:47,480 --> 01:43:51,040
Really don't want to give too much shine to anything with the name

2028
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:52,680
Landis attached to it.

2029
01:43:52,680 --> 01:43:54,240
So what do you mean?

2030
01:43:54,240 --> 01:43:54,680
Why?

2031
01:43:54,680 --> 01:43:56,800
Seems like great family to me.

2032
01:43:58,120 --> 01:44:02,560
I look also, you know, in its favor, a wonderful George Lucas cameo.

2033
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:03,560
Yeah.

2034
01:44:03,560 --> 01:44:04,320
Let's wait.

2035
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:06,280
We were doing George Lucas voices before.

2036
01:44:06,280 --> 01:44:07,840
Let me do my impression of that.

2037
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:08,360
Hey.

2038
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:11,440
He says, Hey, and then let's go.

2039
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:17,200
Incredible to see George Lucas acting and clad in a t-shirt with one of

2040
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:18,760
the characters from this park.

2041
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:22,760
Now they figured out, I think again, in any other category, you'd love it.

2042
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:26,760
That they like invented a whole mythology of like Mickey and friends

2043
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:31,480
esque characters, including Okie Doki, the elephant who Eddie Murphy has to

2044
01:44:31,480 --> 01:44:37,240
dress up like, um, and at the end of the film, a new character is acting.

2045
01:44:37,240 --> 01:44:39,880
The new character is added to the line.

2046
01:44:39,880 --> 01:44:45,160
The, the, the climax, the reward for Axel Foley, for his hard work, doing

2047
01:44:45,160 --> 01:44:50,400
whatever is happening in this movie is that they debut Axel Fox.

2048
01:44:50,640 --> 01:44:54,640
He gets his own original character that wears a jacket like he wears that

2049
01:44:54,640 --> 01:44:59,760
and a big balloon blows up and a bunch of confetti on top of a merry-go-round.

2050
01:45:00,120 --> 01:45:01,520
It's a very exciting ending.

2051
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:04,880
The marching band at the park plays the Beverly Hills cop theme, which

2052
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:07,040
exists in the world of Beverly Hills cop.

2053
01:45:07,960 --> 01:45:08,680
Yeah.

2054
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:10,480
There's a wonder world song.

2055
01:45:10,520 --> 01:45:15,720
There is a wonder world song, um, wonder world portrayed by what is now

2056
01:45:15,720 --> 01:45:19,680
called California's great America at the time was Paramount's great America.

2057
01:45:19,680 --> 01:45:23,960
And this is different from six flags, great America, which was your park,

2058
01:45:23,960 --> 01:45:25,240
Mike, right?

2059
01:45:25,240 --> 01:45:25,840
That is correct.

2060
01:45:26,240 --> 01:45:26,520
Okay.

2061
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:29,000
Number, um, a lot of confusing things.

2062
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:29,520
Yeah.

2063
01:45:29,880 --> 01:45:33,400
The song, the song is the Sherman brothers.

2064
01:45:33,400 --> 01:45:35,200
They got the actual Sherman.

2065
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:38,440
I mean, this would be killing and potentially in an, I think this beats

2066
01:45:38,440 --> 01:45:39,160
Wally world.

2067
01:45:40,680 --> 01:45:41,320
Yeah.

2068
01:45:41,480 --> 01:45:42,960
I think this replaces Wally world.

2069
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:44,600
I would like to, I would like a vote.

2070
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:46,760
I would like a vote right now.

2071
01:45:46,760 --> 01:45:49,040
Should we replace this?

2072
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:51,560
Well, hold on.

2073
01:45:51,560 --> 01:45:52,640
We got a vote.

2074
01:45:52,760 --> 01:45:52,920
Yeah.

2075
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:54,800
Or does it, can it replace something else?

2076
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:56,120
Is it like a, I don't know.

2077
01:45:56,120 --> 01:45:58,920
Let's yeah, we have to figure out the word.

2078
01:45:58,960 --> 01:45:59,800
What happens here?

2079
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:00,920
I mean, yeah, it's really good.

2080
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:02,200
It's, it's definitely really good.

2081
01:46:02,360 --> 01:46:06,760
They have Disney dollars counterfeit money is a part of the story.

2082
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:07,920
So they, they flesh all that out.

2083
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:09,120
They film on real rides.

2084
01:46:09,120 --> 01:46:12,000
They film on an earthquake in on the universal tour.

2085
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:14,200
Um, it's good.

2086
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:15,080
It's pretty good.

2087
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:21,520
Um, but don't we have to hit the vote in this category for, and I'm throwing

2088
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:23,120
my vote to dinosaur world.

2089
01:46:23,480 --> 01:46:23,720
Yeah.

2090
01:46:23,720 --> 01:46:24,320
So am I.

2091
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:27,080
I'm just saying, yeah, dinosaur world is awesome.

2092
01:46:27,080 --> 01:46:31,360
So I'm just saying, can we throw, can we replace Wally world with wonder world?

2093
01:46:32,200 --> 01:46:34,760
Um, but isn't that just a rematch?

2094
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:35,280
You're right.

2095
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:38,680
That is just having to throw up the whole bracket into disarray.

2096
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:40,160
No, I think it's out.

2097
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:40,920
All right.

2098
01:46:40,920 --> 01:46:41,240
Fine.

2099
01:46:41,240 --> 01:46:45,920
Let's revisit maybe potentially down the line, but yeah, I mean, it's, it is, it

2100
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:49,760
is great and if, if we do abandon it, can I just say, and I know we got to move on.

2101
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:53,080
It turns out I read this, that they could not figure it.

2102
01:46:53,080 --> 01:46:56,040
This, the screenwriter had a week to figure out a pitch on Beverly Hills

2103
01:46:56,040 --> 01:46:57,400
cop three, what it was going to be.

2104
01:46:57,680 --> 01:47:02,840
Uh, and in that week, he read an article about the about to open universal city

2105
01:47:02,840 --> 01:47:04,320
walk, they were starting to build it.

2106
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:07,520
And if you remember, it was one of those articles that was really hoity

2107
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:12,760
toity about like, uh, the, the, the fake microcosm betraying what an actual

2108
01:47:12,760 --> 01:47:16,520
community should be like these stupid eyefalutin, what everybody said about

2109
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:20,880
city work, um, and the guy was just like, well, that's a funny environment to put.

2110
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:26,120
That's an environment where Axel is still like, uh, would be a fish out of water.

2111
01:47:26,240 --> 01:47:28,400
So city walk inspired this movie.

2112
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:30,320
That's extremely theme park specific.

2113
01:47:30,760 --> 01:47:34,320
Um, maybe all food for thought for why you might want to bring it back into

2114
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:35,800
the competition, but we'll see.

2115
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:36,600
Okay.

2116
01:47:37,160 --> 01:47:42,840
Um, so in an extremely long first round, extremely long.

2117
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:44,240
Oh my God.

2118
01:47:44,280 --> 01:47:46,320
So we, we just have to plow more.

2119
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:48,880
I mean, we kind of set all our thoughts already.

2120
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:51,200
We just now got to go versus here.

2121
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:53,040
Um, and let's not even recap.

2122
01:47:53,080 --> 01:47:54,120
Let's just dive right in.

2123
01:47:54,120 --> 01:47:56,080
We're going into, we're going into round two.

2124
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:58,400
Uh, which places.

2125
01:47:59,160 --> 01:48:03,360
And again, if you ever want to call, let's put, um, wonder world in.

2126
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:04,600
We'll, we'll talk about it.

2127
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:09,240
Um, so that brings us to itchy and scratchy land versus glove world.

2128
01:48:09,880 --> 01:48:11,600
Um, what do we do there?

2129
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:12,480
What do we do there?

2130
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:14,240
Uh, yeah, that's tough.

2131
01:48:14,240 --> 01:48:17,480
I mean, the glove world, as I said, is very clever.

2132
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:20,000
There's a ton of different specifics.

2133
01:48:20,680 --> 01:48:24,640
Itching scratchy line is tough again, cause I don't think the rides are as good

2134
01:48:24,640 --> 01:48:29,240
there, but the land itself, as we were saying, the sort of experience of going

2135
01:48:29,240 --> 01:48:30,960
on vacation there would be fun.

2136
01:48:31,640 --> 01:48:32,040
Yeah.

2137
01:48:32,360 --> 01:48:32,640
Yeah.

2138
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:36,640
But the, the, I keep coming back to the actual theme park itself.

2139
01:48:36,640 --> 01:48:38,880
That has to be the anchor for this experience.

2140
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:41,880
So that's where I'm struggling right here.

2141
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:46,400
Well, there's that log rock and what you get to see and, but that's just

2142
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:50,960
bad and it hurts you and your log gets, it's only called log ride.

2143
01:48:51,160 --> 01:48:57,080
It gets torn down the middle and, uh, arrows get fired at you and you land on a cushion.

2144
01:48:57,120 --> 01:49:00,040
It doesn't operate like a real ride would.

2145
01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:00,520
Right.

2146
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:02,120
Um, that is fun though.

2147
01:49:02,120 --> 01:49:07,360
But then there, you know, there's the tunnel of glove and glove world, which I really

2148
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:10,040
like, I think that's a funny, funny joke.

2149
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:13,280
Uh, there's a super dangerous mode to that as well.

2150
01:49:13,320 --> 01:49:14,120
That comes up.

2151
01:49:14,600 --> 01:49:14,840
Yeah.

2152
01:49:14,840 --> 01:49:18,080
Um, Oh, this is so tough.

2153
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:24,040
Uh, I guess, I mean, underwater seems really fun to do.

2154
01:49:24,080 --> 01:49:24,560
I don't know.

2155
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:28,480
Am I going to go back to Scott's argument though, that one this that beat my beloved

2156
01:49:28,480 --> 01:49:32,480
Duff gardens, that parents islands and all of it's fun.

2157
01:49:32,840 --> 01:49:33,240
Yeah.

2158
01:49:33,280 --> 01:49:33,480
Yeah.

2159
01:49:33,480 --> 01:49:35,440
There's no version of parents Island.

2160
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:39,440
Cause yes, we look, we're getting older and I'm not a young man anymore.

2161
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:41,040
I can't go to pleasure islands.

2162
01:49:41,680 --> 01:49:45,360
I won't be, uh, recruited by Gideon or honest John.

2163
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:48,800
I do need a few of those experiences.

2164
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:50,040
Yeah.

2165
01:49:50,040 --> 01:49:50,760
I get older.

2166
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:52,520
A hundred bars and restaurants.

2167
01:49:52,640 --> 01:49:53,200
I don't know.

2168
01:49:53,240 --> 01:49:57,000
SpongeBob spun, but, um, I know where my heart lies.

2169
01:49:57,400 --> 01:49:57,800
Yeah.

2170
01:49:57,800 --> 01:49:59,320
I think it's it's in scratchy land.

2171
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:00,800
All right.

2172
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:01,520
Okay.

2173
01:50:01,560 --> 01:50:05,320
Moving along and we'll take out glove worlds.

2174
01:50:05,680 --> 01:50:11,520
And that takes us then to Jurassic world versus Luna park on future.

2175
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:13,840
Right now we kind of skipped Luna park.

2176
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:18,880
Maybe we have to go over it a little to see if it can hold water against Jurassic world.

2177
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:19,320
Right.

2178
01:50:19,320 --> 01:50:24,280
Now what I'll say about Luna park is that it feels very, it feels very

2179
01:50:24,280 --> 01:50:27,560
Duff gardensy to me, obviously it's a Mac grading show.

2180
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:31,440
There's very, some similarities in the way they're portraying rides as

2181
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:33,720
kind of janky with old robots.

2182
01:50:34,280 --> 01:50:37,360
Uh, there's a joke about how, uh, cause it's the future.

2183
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:41,400
They don't know how, uh, people landed on the moon or what that was all about.

2184
01:50:42,040 --> 01:50:43,440
Uh, which I think is very funny.

2185
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:47,880
But the ride itself is very low fi low, low rent.

2186
01:50:48,680 --> 01:50:50,760
And I appreciate that about it.

2187
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:53,480
It's full of robots and it's charming.

2188
01:50:53,480 --> 01:50:58,040
It's still charming, even though the characters are at least fry, uh, doesn't

2189
01:50:58,040 --> 01:51:01,160
like it, doesn't like that specific ride and some of the other aspects of the park.

2190
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:02,680
So I do appreciate that.

2191
01:51:02,680 --> 01:51:05,360
It's another Disneyland, uh, analog.

2192
01:51:06,840 --> 01:51:08,480
You got your goofy gophers.

2193
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:11,840
You have essentially a country bear jamboree.

2194
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:12,760
So that's cool.

2195
01:51:12,760 --> 01:51:14,440
But I don't know if I like the show.

2196
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:17,360
The show is just that they pop up and make little jokes and the country

2197
01:51:17,360 --> 01:51:18,760
where jamboree is so much more.

2198
01:51:18,920 --> 01:51:20,680
That is exactly the same thought I had.

2199
01:51:20,680 --> 01:51:25,400
There's a joke that Monsanto is presenting that, that show, which is very funny,

2200
01:51:25,400 --> 01:51:29,080
but they don't show me in there that they're having a jamboree.

2201
01:51:29,160 --> 01:51:33,480
Uh, cause I clicked on it to refresh myself and I went, oh yeah, that's funny.

2202
01:51:33,880 --> 01:51:37,720
But there's no real banjo plan or fiddle plan.

2203
01:51:38,360 --> 01:51:41,240
I may, maybe there is, maybe they're not showing it to, but they have to show.

2204
01:51:41,240 --> 01:51:42,440
They have to show me.

2205
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:46,760
I sort of set imagination for the Scooby Doo one, but.

2206
01:51:47,480 --> 01:51:47,840
Yeah.

2207
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:52,680
I mean, Whalers on the moon is, I remember this is an early Futurama episode.

2208
01:51:52,680 --> 01:51:57,080
I remember being very excited at Pirates of the Caribbean parody when it aired,

2209
01:51:57,560 --> 01:52:01,680
but some of the other jokes and stuff like ski ball, virtual ski ball, virtual,

2210
01:52:01,680 --> 01:52:04,360
virtual ski ball, that's more of an arcade joke than a theme park.

2211
01:52:04,360 --> 01:52:05,440
That is an arcade joke.

2212
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:06,200
I agree with Jason.

2213
01:52:06,200 --> 01:52:06,760
That's different.

2214
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:08,640
That's different.

2215
01:52:08,680 --> 01:52:09,360
Do we like that?

2216
01:52:09,360 --> 01:52:10,840
It's in a big dome.

2217
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:12,880
It's in a bubble on the moon.

2218
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:13,880
And that's pretty cool.

2219
01:52:13,880 --> 01:52:16,480
So you can, you don't need a space suit to be in there.

2220
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:17,600
That's fun.

2221
01:52:17,600 --> 01:52:18,440
I do like that.

2222
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:23,880
I mean, it feels much more, there is something cold and impersonal about

2223
01:52:23,880 --> 01:52:28,000
Jurassic world and that's kind of even some of the idea in the movie of it.

2224
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:34,120
Sort of, it doesn't have that magic that, uh, that the original, I guess, did,

2225
01:52:34,120 --> 01:52:37,840
even though the movie, the original park never opened in the movie universe.

2226
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:38,160
I don't know.

2227
01:52:38,160 --> 01:52:38,640
Yeah.

2228
01:52:39,200 --> 01:52:41,840
It's like a, um, it's like an LA live.

2229
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:46,440
It's very, it's very corporate, uh, in it's, in it's chosen restaurants and

2230
01:52:46,440 --> 01:52:52,160
everything, but, um, Hey, you see dinosaurs at that T, the T-Rex is there.

2231
01:52:52,160 --> 01:52:53,840
That's one thing to give it up for.

2232
01:52:53,880 --> 01:52:56,880
You would see that T-Rex, uh, get splashed.

2233
01:52:56,880 --> 01:53:01,120
You could be in the splash zone of the big thing, the big, uh, the mega

2234
01:53:01,160 --> 01:53:02,680
fish, whatever it's called.

2235
01:53:03,480 --> 01:53:08,080
I, I think it's hard cause seeing dinosaurs seems pretty good, but being on

2236
01:53:08,080 --> 01:53:09,600
the moon is crazy too.

2237
01:53:09,640 --> 01:53:11,200
Those are two crazy things.

2238
01:53:11,240 --> 01:53:12,080
Oh, wait a minute.

2239
01:53:12,120 --> 01:53:12,440
Yeah.

2240
01:53:12,440 --> 01:53:14,920
I want to go to the crazy ass things.

2241
01:53:15,880 --> 01:53:20,880
And it's tough because basically it's going to come down to, cause I think

2242
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:23,480
actually the content of Luna park.

2243
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:27,680
I like more cause if Jurassic world showed us that had one ride that felt

2244
01:53:27,680 --> 01:53:33,760
very classic dark ride, I do always like that to be an element of a park, something

2245
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:37,520
that feels very much tied to like your classic Disney dark rides.

2246
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:38,280
Yeah.

2247
01:53:38,320 --> 01:53:41,560
So that's, that's what it's coming down to.

2248
01:53:41,560 --> 01:53:46,120
And I'm thinking about it, seeing a dinosaur for real or being on the moon

2249
01:53:46,120 --> 01:53:49,800
and then getting to kind of see a fun janky Disneyland.

2250
01:53:50,720 --> 01:53:55,160
It's hard when you put it like that, it's hard because the dinosaur is crazy.

2251
01:53:55,600 --> 01:53:56,800
But you might meet Buffett.

2252
01:53:57,040 --> 01:54:00,440
You can go to, but you can go to margaritaville in our actual world and

2253
01:54:00,440 --> 01:54:01,880
it's not a very good restaurant.

2254
01:54:02,280 --> 01:54:03,920
So not a great restaurant.

2255
01:54:04,760 --> 01:54:05,880
I might admit that.

2256
01:54:05,960 --> 01:54:08,840
Uh, yeah, make a good argument there.

2257
01:54:08,840 --> 01:54:09,480
It is the moot.

2258
01:54:09,480 --> 01:54:13,880
We are not taking into account that this is going to the moon, going to the moon

2259
01:54:13,880 --> 01:54:16,680
and then seeing a fun robot show.

2260
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:18,600
Yeah.

2261
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:24,480
I, do you guys know what you're voting yet?

2262
01:54:24,720 --> 01:54:25,240
I don't.

2263
01:54:25,880 --> 01:54:26,320
Oh boy.

2264
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:26,600
Huh?

2265
01:54:27,400 --> 01:54:30,480
It's going to be long, but this is the longest episode of candidates,

2266
01:54:30,600 --> 01:54:31,960
least longest in quarantine.

2267
01:54:32,360 --> 01:54:33,280
Um,

2268
01:54:36,200 --> 01:54:38,200
I don't know, Mike, you might have sold me on the moon.

2269
01:54:38,840 --> 01:54:42,200
I hadn't considered that before the actual practical implications of a

2270
01:54:42,200 --> 01:54:43,200
theme park on the moon.

2271
01:54:43,560 --> 01:54:43,960
Yeah.

2272
01:54:44,360 --> 01:54:48,880
I had Moon street USA and you know, probably bars up there too.

2273
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:50,200
USA might push me over the edge.

2274
01:54:50,200 --> 01:54:51,600
I think I'm giving it to Luna park.

2275
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:53,720
I think I am too.

2276
01:54:53,960 --> 01:54:54,480
Okay.

2277
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:55,480
Well, it doesn't matter.

2278
01:54:55,520 --> 01:54:57,480
Um, you might have upset.

2279
01:54:57,800 --> 01:54:58,560
I don't know.

2280
01:54:58,600 --> 01:55:03,880
Maybe just maybe I'll do a protest vote for Jurassic world just to say thanks

2281
01:55:03,880 --> 01:55:06,280
for the effort and I really liked the dress.

2282
01:55:06,280 --> 01:55:09,920
Like what I almost can't believe that we're heading into this without, into the

2283
01:55:09,920 --> 01:55:11,480
end without Jurassic park.

2284
01:55:12,120 --> 01:55:14,800
Um, but I'm glad it's, it was obvious, I think.

2285
01:55:14,920 --> 01:55:17,000
And, uh, this is where we got to be bold.

2286
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:17,440
Yeah.

2287
01:55:17,560 --> 01:55:18,080
Wow.

2288
01:55:18,920 --> 01:55:23,040
Which we ended up with two, it's, it's now a graining, a graining on.

2289
01:55:23,200 --> 01:55:23,600
Yeah.

2290
01:55:23,600 --> 01:55:24,160
Categories.

2291
01:55:24,160 --> 01:55:24,440
Yeah.

2292
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:26,160
Um, okay.

2293
01:55:26,200 --> 01:55:31,640
So we advanced that and that takes us to scary stuff, horror land from

2294
01:55:31,680 --> 01:55:36,920
Goosebumps versus spooky Island from Scooby Doo 2002.

2295
01:55:37,960 --> 01:55:40,040
Um, this is tough.

2296
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:41,160
This is tough.

2297
01:55:41,360 --> 01:55:42,040
Okay.

2298
01:55:42,280 --> 01:55:49,320
Um, spooky Island is obviously not as fleshed out, but that image is so powerful.

2299
01:55:49,960 --> 01:55:50,280
Yeah.

2300
01:55:51,120 --> 01:55:52,040
It was strong.

2301
01:55:52,480 --> 01:55:52,800
Yeah.

2302
01:55:53,240 --> 01:55:59,160
What a, what a Skylar and, uh, you know, bad things are going on on spooky Island,

2303
01:55:59,240 --> 01:56:03,000
but it's not, I think a lot of people don't encounter the bad things.

2304
01:56:03,120 --> 01:56:07,800
Whereas everyone at horror land that is a good point or endangered.

2305
01:56:08,360 --> 01:56:12,800
That is a good point because spooky Island seems like, yeah, you can come away

2306
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:15,920
with nothing wrong and nothing bad happening.

2307
01:56:16,440 --> 01:56:16,840
Mm.

2308
01:56:17,120 --> 01:56:22,000
Um, but there, the sheer amount of stuff you can do at horror land.

2309
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:22,840
Mm.

2310
01:56:22,840 --> 01:56:22,960
Hmm.

2311
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:30,240
And there's werewolf village, horror rapids, vampire village, monster zoo.

2312
01:56:31,080 --> 01:56:34,200
Like there's just the sheer amount of stuff.

2313
01:56:35,120 --> 01:56:36,600
It seems like it goes and goes.

2314
01:56:36,760 --> 01:56:37,760
It goes and goes.

2315
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:41,480
Mad labs is an area on horror land, which mainly consists of mad scientists,

2316
01:56:41,480 --> 01:56:43,000
like buildings and architecture.

2317
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:45,200
Toxic gunk dunk.

2318
01:56:45,800 --> 01:56:46,480
Yeah.

2319
01:56:46,640 --> 01:56:49,240
That shock and roll brain drain.

2320
01:56:50,240 --> 01:56:53,160
Terror tombs is an area filled with mummies.

2321
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:56,200
There's like a weird, and I'm forgetting where I put this in from.

2322
01:56:56,200 --> 01:56:59,920
There's a weird dentist thing too, which sounds like it would hurt you, but what

2323
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:02,160
an idea for a themed experience.

2324
01:57:02,840 --> 01:57:04,280
Plasma Plaza.

2325
01:57:04,840 --> 01:57:05,360
Yeah.

2326
01:57:05,360 --> 01:57:10,360
The fact that it's thought out and was used as the basis for world building to

2327
01:57:10,360 --> 01:57:16,080
like tie together different goosebumps, like sub universe.

2328
01:57:16,400 --> 01:57:18,080
I don't, yeah, I think.

2329
01:57:18,840 --> 01:57:19,680
Now there, okay.

2330
01:57:19,720 --> 01:57:21,720
Let me, now here, let me show you this.

2331
01:57:21,920 --> 01:57:24,040
This is actually just something I'm coming upon.

2332
01:57:24,040 --> 01:57:31,360
Now there's a photo I have here that I think has, has maybe swayed me a little

2333
01:57:31,360 --> 01:57:35,360
bit more, um, and let me, got how to do this.

2334
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:35,760
Of course.

2335
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:36,360
Here we go.

2336
01:57:36,360 --> 01:57:37,240
Look at this.

2337
01:57:38,160 --> 01:57:38,480
Ooh.

2338
01:57:38,480 --> 01:57:43,160
Well, that's better than the Toronto television series that I watch.

2339
01:57:43,160 --> 01:57:44,600
This is more expansive than that.

2340
01:57:44,600 --> 01:57:47,320
That's a very tall coaster with a witch.

2341
01:57:47,320 --> 01:57:54,600
They're all the cauldron, um, black widow, a drop ride, big, uh, dragon.

2342
01:57:55,040 --> 01:57:55,680
Ooh.

2343
01:57:55,720 --> 01:57:56,200
Yeah.

2344
01:57:56,200 --> 01:57:56,960
Yeah.

2345
01:57:57,200 --> 01:58:01,320
Cause the original, the original book, horror land, it was a little bit

2346
01:58:01,320 --> 01:58:06,040
more like kind of a carnival, but from reading about what they've done

2347
01:58:06,040 --> 01:58:09,680
since and all the different lore, it feels like they've expanded it to be sort

2348
01:58:09,680 --> 01:58:12,760
of a multi multi-day resort.

2349
01:58:13,800 --> 01:58:14,120
But.

2350
01:58:14,120 --> 01:58:14,600
Good.

2351
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:18,920
You are going to get like hurt or psychologically damaged if you go.

2352
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:20,760
That is the one trade-off.

2353
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:21,760
Yeah, it's scary.

2354
01:58:21,760 --> 01:58:24,400
You have to ride in a coffin down the river.

2355
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:25,800
Right.

2356
01:58:25,800 --> 01:58:29,400
But that's built in that, like, like in the way that Disneyland has meant

2357
01:58:29,400 --> 01:58:35,560
spark joy from eight to 80, it's accomplishing its stated goal of causing

2358
01:58:35,640 --> 01:58:41,280
abject horror, but I think that spooky Island is achieving its goal of being

2359
01:58:41,280 --> 01:58:48,760
spooky, but also, um, out, lesser outcast music is playing and there's,

2360
01:58:48,840 --> 01:58:53,560
uh, like Tiki bars and it's like a burning man that's has more infrastructure.

2361
01:58:53,560 --> 01:58:57,160
So I don't have to be like a survivalist to be there, but something bad could

2362
01:58:57,160 --> 01:58:59,160
happen to you at spooky Island as well.

2363
01:58:59,480 --> 01:59:01,160
There is a possibility of it.

2364
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:05,640
Maybe, but we know that they've established contact with the mystery

2365
01:59:05,640 --> 01:59:07,240
gang or whatever they're called.

2366
01:59:07,320 --> 01:59:10,600
So, you know, they might come and fix it for me.

2367
01:59:10,840 --> 01:59:11,080
Right.

2368
01:59:11,080 --> 01:59:13,680
I'm just saying there's risks involved in both of these.

2369
01:59:14,160 --> 01:59:17,600
So if there are risks and maybe you're right, maybe they're not equal risks,

2370
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:24,040
but if there are risks with both of these, and I was about to declare what I was

2371
01:59:24,040 --> 01:59:26,600
going to say, but now I'm trying, I'm second guessing my thoughts.

2372
01:59:26,760 --> 01:59:28,240
I'm going to, I'm going to really put it on.

2373
01:59:28,240 --> 01:59:28,400
Yeah.

2374
01:59:28,400 --> 01:59:29,640
I'm going with spooky Island.

2375
01:59:29,640 --> 01:59:35,120
I also just want, like, I really wanted, even though of course, more on mountain

2376
01:59:35,120 --> 01:59:40,920
can't be in, I really want some bad CGI to be in here and that does it for, I

2377
01:59:40,920 --> 01:59:43,160
really just love that Vista of spooky Island.

2378
01:59:43,160 --> 01:59:44,960
So then I'm going to give it to horror land.

2379
01:59:45,040 --> 01:59:47,120
Uh, so Mike, it's your call.

2380
01:59:47,360 --> 01:59:47,840
Yeah.

2381
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:49,960
See, here's the thing.

2382
01:59:49,960 --> 01:59:52,840
And now I've talked to myself about all the different things with horror land.

2383
01:59:52,840 --> 01:59:59,400
And maybe actually that is a deficit to horror land is that perhaps there's now

2384
01:59:59,400 --> 02:00:05,520
so much media surrounding it, there's not a unified horror land that even exists.

2385
02:00:05,560 --> 02:00:10,360
Maybe they've sort of thrown too many ideas at it and spooky Island is a much,

2386
02:00:10,360 --> 02:00:11,720
you can feel it's of a piece.

2387
02:00:11,720 --> 02:00:15,840
If we're thinking of it in terms of an album, a musical album, spooky Island

2388
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:18,800
looks like it's a finite thing.

2389
02:00:18,800 --> 02:00:20,920
It's a piece that was designed meticulously.

2390
02:00:21,040 --> 02:00:23,720
Horror land is maybe more of, and this is going to sound like a

2391
02:00:23,720 --> 02:00:26,320
nod at our, a knock at our beloved knots.

2392
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:31,120
But not as very much suffers from, Oh, here's the section that was built when

2393
02:00:31,120 --> 02:00:33,000
there was a coaster craze in the eighties.

2394
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:34,720
Here's one we're chasing this trend.

2395
02:00:35,160 --> 02:00:37,680
And now they're doing, of course, much more stuff we love, which is

2396
02:00:37,720 --> 02:00:41,320
theming and characters and tying everything to what mythology.

2397
02:00:41,840 --> 02:00:44,880
So now if you're viewing it, if you're viewing it like an album, you know, think

2398
02:00:44,880 --> 02:00:49,640
of it like the soundtrack of Scooby Doo, the motion picture with Shaggy, Sugar

2399
02:00:49,640 --> 02:00:54,400
Ray, a Buster Rhymes, Uncle Cracker cover of Freaks Come Out at Night.

2400
02:00:54,880 --> 02:00:58,560
Um, and if you imagine that that's the kind of music that you're hearing, which

2401
02:00:58,560 --> 02:01:01,360
is you probably are on spooky Island.

2402
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:04,360
Well, and you'd definitely be seeing some fashion nightmares.

2403
02:01:04,360 --> 02:01:08,200
I mean, come on, frosted tips, long dresses worn with jeans underneath.

2404
02:01:08,680 --> 02:01:09,200
Yikes.

2405
02:01:09,200 --> 02:01:10,680
What were we doing back then?

2406
02:01:10,840 --> 02:01:15,320
The Fred and Daphne and Velma are the most tastefully dressed people on.

2407
02:01:15,600 --> 02:01:15,960
Right.

2408
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:16,440
Yeah.

2409
02:01:17,160 --> 02:01:18,200
I think.

2410
02:01:19,040 --> 02:01:20,120
I think.

2411
02:01:21,600 --> 02:01:23,200
I'm going to go spooky Island.

2412
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:24,360
Yeah.

2413
02:01:24,400 --> 02:01:25,320
All right.

2414
02:01:26,360 --> 02:01:30,240
I've just really been rooting for spooky Island since we started talking about this.

2415
02:01:31,520 --> 02:01:32,280
All right.

2416
02:01:32,840 --> 02:01:36,760
Um, yeah, the frosted sugar ray sugar rays there.

2417
02:01:36,800 --> 02:01:37,680
Don't forget that.

2418
02:01:37,680 --> 02:01:38,400
Yeah.

2419
02:01:38,400 --> 02:01:39,160
They're performed.

2420
02:01:39,160 --> 02:01:40,840
They they're hanging out by the pool.

2421
02:01:40,840 --> 02:01:42,920
So sugar ray twice live.

2422
02:01:43,960 --> 02:01:44,760
Thank God.

2423
02:01:45,560 --> 02:01:46,680
In the last 10 years.

2424
02:01:50,240 --> 02:01:51,240
They sounded great.

2425
02:01:51,240 --> 02:01:57,320
Honestly, I was front row in one of these concerts socially distance with mass and

2426
02:01:57,320 --> 02:02:00,120
everyone was tested on the last two.

2427
02:02:00,160 --> 02:02:01,480
I let him in the last three months.

2428
02:02:01,480 --> 02:02:02,000
And days.

2429
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:03,000
Oh, yeah.

2430
02:02:04,760 --> 02:02:08,600
It was at some casino in Florida and there were no masks.

2431
02:02:09,320 --> 02:02:10,400
Mark coughed on you.

2432
02:02:11,200 --> 02:02:16,680
OK, so that takes us to Wally World versus Dinosaur World.

2433
02:02:16,680 --> 02:02:17,520
And you know what?

2434
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:20,440
I don't think there's even no fucking contest.

2435
02:02:20,440 --> 02:02:21,040
Yeah.

2436
02:02:21,040 --> 02:02:21,440
Yeah.

2437
02:02:21,880 --> 02:02:24,840
Look, Vacation, obviously the better movie.

2438
02:02:25,720 --> 02:02:28,000
But oh, my God, I like Dino.

2439
02:02:28,320 --> 02:02:31,320
Yeah, that's a 12 seed defeating a one seed.

2440
02:02:31,320 --> 02:02:32,440
You love to see it.

2441
02:02:32,920 --> 02:02:37,560
But Dino World is one of the great portrayals of an attraction.

2442
02:02:37,960 --> 02:02:38,360
Yeah.

2443
02:02:38,360 --> 02:02:39,920
Unbelievable. Immaculate.

2444
02:02:39,920 --> 02:02:40,400
Wow.

2445
02:02:40,400 --> 02:02:45,240
Attention to detail and who and even if you don't know what the rest of the park is,

2446
02:02:45,240 --> 02:02:49,360
just that that main rate doesn't even even if there weren't anything else.

2447
02:02:49,360 --> 02:02:51,720
But there seems to be a great wooden roller coaster.

2448
02:02:52,440 --> 02:02:54,400
So much going on at Dinosaur World.

2449
02:02:54,400 --> 02:02:56,360
The real Final Four.

2450
02:02:56,360 --> 02:02:58,000
Yeah, we are down as they are.

2451
02:02:58,000 --> 02:02:59,440
Yes, we got it.

2452
02:02:59,480 --> 02:03:06,200
It is itchy and scratchy land from the Simpsons, Luna Park from Futurama,

2453
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:13,600
Spooky Island from Scooby Doo and Dinosaur World from the Martin Short vehicle Clifford.

2454
02:03:14,280 --> 02:03:16,880
We are down to four.

2455
02:03:16,880 --> 02:03:19,280
I'm pretty happy with it.

2456
02:03:19,280 --> 02:03:20,560
I think there's. I love it.

2457
02:03:20,560 --> 02:03:21,720
Yeah, yeah.

2458
02:03:21,720 --> 02:03:25,120
There's there's ones I almost wish Jurassic World could have made it further.

2459
02:03:25,440 --> 02:03:26,680
I almost wish.

2460
02:03:26,680 --> 02:03:30,200
I mean, if you were doing just a pure for maybe Jurassic World is in there

2461
02:03:30,200 --> 02:03:34,640
and maybe Wonder World is in there, but I don't know.

2462
02:03:34,760 --> 02:03:36,600
Agree, disagree?

2463
02:03:37,440 --> 02:03:39,760
Yeah, it's tough. I mean, this is.

2464
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:41,880
I'm not. Yeah, I don't know.

2465
02:03:41,880 --> 02:03:43,960
That's the only two I would maybe slot in.

2466
02:03:43,960 --> 02:03:46,280
I mean, obviously, I would want Duff Gardens over itching scratchy land,

2467
02:03:46,280 --> 02:03:48,280
but that's the only other two I would maybe slot in.

2468
02:03:48,760 --> 02:03:51,000
This is a part of me that would want that, too.

2469
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,080
I I don't know.

2470
02:03:53,080 --> 02:03:56,280
I have my regrets, but you got to look forward, especially when you're

2471
02:03:56,360 --> 02:03:58,040
a longest episode candidate.

2472
02:03:58,040 --> 02:04:04,880
So it seems scratchy land versus Luna Park Clash of the Grainings.

2473
02:04:06,760 --> 02:04:09,880
Again, I think you have to think about that moon argument that really

2474
02:04:09,880 --> 02:04:12,080
like illuminated something.

2475
02:04:12,080 --> 02:04:13,400
You are going to the moon.

2476
02:04:13,400 --> 02:04:17,040
But, you know, this didn't invent going to the moon,

2477
02:04:17,440 --> 02:04:21,040
but it did make like a tangible place for you to go once you go there.

2478
02:04:21,280 --> 02:04:22,920
It's also in the year 3000.

2479
02:04:22,920 --> 02:04:24,280
It's a long ways away.

2480
02:04:24,280 --> 02:04:26,200
You have to be there first.

2481
02:04:26,360 --> 02:04:27,480
Right now.

2482
02:04:27,480 --> 02:04:29,800
Yeah. Now, when we're putting these two up against each other,

2483
02:04:29,800 --> 02:04:30,760
it's they're similar.

2484
02:04:30,760 --> 02:04:33,160
They're very similar as far as parks are concerned.

2485
02:04:33,480 --> 02:04:37,240
It's just the moon element that the moon element is the only thing

2486
02:04:37,240 --> 02:04:40,200
that would make me go with Luna Park over itching scratchy land.

2487
02:04:40,200 --> 02:04:43,080
That would have to supersede all the other stuff we've talked about,

2488
02:04:43,360 --> 02:04:47,160
all the other rides, all the other robots, the board itself.

2489
02:04:47,960 --> 02:04:51,480
Yeah. Yeah. The park itself, itching scratchy lands, undeniably better.

2490
02:04:52,480 --> 02:04:55,960
You maybe have to consider some of the rides that you don't get to see.

2491
02:04:56,200 --> 02:04:58,600
There is a sign at the beginning of the rides that are closed,

2492
02:04:58,600 --> 02:05:00,880
the head basher, the blood bath, the mangler.

2493
02:05:01,360 --> 02:05:04,280
And then what the joke is that it's the first aid station

2494
02:05:04,280 --> 02:05:07,280
or the nurse's station or something.

2495
02:05:07,280 --> 02:05:10,320
You got the restaurant tavern on the scream

2496
02:05:10,320 --> 02:05:14,040
where you have to enter under a big knife that's coming down.

2497
02:05:15,560 --> 02:05:18,720
There's the actual danger element like they're now

2498
02:05:19,160 --> 02:05:22,240
itching scratchy land you are maybe supposed to get hurt.

2499
02:05:22,400 --> 02:05:25,960
That's maybe like in the design, although you get hurt somewhat.

2500
02:05:27,040 --> 02:05:28,040
Although I guess not.

2501
02:05:28,040 --> 02:05:30,200
I mean, they designed the robots not to hurt you.

2502
02:05:30,200 --> 02:05:33,800
But then right there, you have robot is robot parades all the time.

2503
02:05:33,800 --> 02:05:35,080
Yeah. Yes.

2504
02:05:35,080 --> 02:05:37,400
And obviously that's really good.

2505
02:05:37,400 --> 02:05:41,600
Yes, it's just it just comes down to that moon element, I think, for this,

2506
02:05:41,600 --> 02:05:45,200
because they're both they both have the stuff you're looking for

2507
02:05:45,200 --> 02:05:47,640
from a themed experience.

2508
02:05:47,640 --> 02:05:50,920
I don't think Luna Park is fleshed out enough for me

2509
02:05:50,920 --> 02:05:53,160
compared to itching scratchy land. Right.

2510
02:05:53,480 --> 02:05:55,840
I think there's just more stuff you like.

2511
02:05:55,840 --> 02:06:00,960
And I agree itch and scratchy land is moving on.

2512
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:02,800
We've gained speed.

2513
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:06,560
And I think I feel like we'll keep gaining speed

2514
02:06:06,560 --> 02:06:10,520
because there was division with the other one, but there's no division with

2515
02:06:11,360 --> 02:06:14,360
dinosaur. We love dinosaur world as much as Clifford.

2516
02:06:14,400 --> 02:06:16,280
Yes. Yeah, we're all little Clifford's.

2517
02:06:16,280 --> 02:06:18,600
100% dinosaur world. Yeah.

2518
02:06:18,600 --> 02:06:21,960
Yeah. I don't like the realization that we're all little.

2519
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:23,200
We're all Clifford's.

2520
02:06:23,200 --> 02:06:25,240
We are three Clifford's hosting a podcast.

2521
02:06:25,240 --> 02:06:28,840
That's the new that is the new tagline for this podcast.

2522
02:06:29,080 --> 02:06:34,440
Our partners are all Charles Groten yelling, can you just be like a normal boy?

2523
02:06:36,720 --> 02:06:40,640
Jason, of course, our parents are also screaming that

2524
02:06:41,280 --> 02:06:45,280
Jason knows the only one, though, that is half Charles Groton, half Clifford.

2525
02:06:46,440 --> 02:06:48,840
Wow. Wow. That actually.

2526
02:06:48,920 --> 02:06:51,120
Oh, no. Accurate description.

2527
02:06:51,120 --> 02:06:55,880
I think it's probably not great when I if I meet with agents and managers,

2528
02:06:55,880 --> 02:06:57,680
I try to explain myself that way.

2529
02:06:57,680 --> 02:07:00,960
And it's like, oh, yeah, two characters from a fucking bomb

2530
02:07:00,960 --> 02:07:03,000
from a million years ago. Very neat.

2531
02:07:03,520 --> 02:07:05,520
You are definitely selling yourself to us.

2532
02:07:08,360 --> 02:07:11,600
An old crank and a guy who likes to play creeps.

2533
02:07:12,520 --> 02:07:14,800
I'm a combo of both.

2534
02:07:14,800 --> 02:07:16,480
But I'm nice, please.

2535
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:18,560
I'll work long hours.

2536
02:07:18,560 --> 02:07:22,880
Clifford in general, I feel like is like he thought he could do peewee.

2537
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:26,600
Like peewee is a little boy in theory, but you don't really think about it.

2538
02:07:26,880 --> 02:07:28,920
And you're just always thinking about that.

2539
02:07:28,920 --> 02:07:30,600
This is the grown man.

2540
02:07:30,600 --> 02:07:33,240
You just you kind of don't overcome the creepiness and like,

2541
02:07:33,480 --> 02:07:37,360
you don't stop and think that peewee is 11 or whatever.

2542
02:07:37,400 --> 02:07:41,760
He's supposed to be his other character, just kind of peewee to Ed Grimley.

2543
02:07:41,760 --> 02:07:43,600
Is that the name? Ed?

2544
02:07:43,600 --> 02:07:45,000
They're similar. Yeah, they're similar.

2545
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:46,640
Grimley is very similar to peewee. Yeah.

2546
02:07:46,640 --> 02:07:48,480
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

2547
02:07:49,280 --> 02:07:52,400
Martin Shore, very, very talented performer,

2548
02:07:52,680 --> 02:07:57,080
has had many unnerving characters in his his long career.

2549
02:07:57,120 --> 02:07:59,040
Oh, yeah. What do you excels at?

2550
02:07:59,040 --> 02:08:05,400
Yeah, it's always bizarre that like the weird, pale, mop topped Jackie Rogers Jr.

2551
02:08:05,440 --> 02:08:06,640
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

2552
02:08:06,640 --> 02:08:12,360
I love them all, but like there's no as a kid, they he scared me for sure.

2553
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:14,080
Yeah, yeah.

2554
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:17,280
More often than not, I guess Frank is lovable.

2555
02:08:17,280 --> 02:08:19,200
Yes. Father of the bride.

2556
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:23,920
Yeah, that's the but if that's your most normal, it's your most relatable guy.

2557
02:08:24,600 --> 02:08:27,640
Maybe the guy who Captain Ron bothers.

2558
02:08:27,640 --> 02:08:29,640
Maybe that's the last human.

2559
02:08:29,640 --> 02:08:31,000
That's true.

2560
02:08:31,680 --> 02:08:33,480
But we're not here to talk about the Martin Shore filmography.

2561
02:08:33,480 --> 02:08:36,480
We're here to talk about the final two.

2562
02:08:36,600 --> 02:08:40,640
We suddenly plowed to the last two and I love the last two.

2563
02:08:40,680 --> 02:08:44,000
Very happy with the last two. Yeah.

2564
02:08:44,080 --> 02:08:45,120
Here's a question.

2565
02:08:45,120 --> 02:08:51,360
Does Wonderworld beat itchy and scratchy land?

2566
02:08:52,640 --> 02:08:54,960
Hmm. I don't think so.

2567
02:08:54,960 --> 02:08:56,280
I don't think so. Probably not.

2568
02:08:56,280 --> 02:08:58,400
Yeah, yeah. You've got the cartoon element.

2569
02:08:58,400 --> 02:09:00,520
You've got the yeah, it's so inventive.

2570
02:09:01,760 --> 02:09:05,960
Does Jurassic World's be itchy and scratchy?

2571
02:09:06,040 --> 02:09:08,040
I guess not, because it already.

2572
02:09:08,040 --> 02:09:09,960
Yeah, I don't think so.

2573
02:09:09,960 --> 02:09:11,920
Well, all right. Just kind of road testing these.

2574
02:09:11,960 --> 02:09:18,680
So that brings us to is also is itching, scratching land the episode also from 1994?

2575
02:09:19,720 --> 02:09:21,560
No way. Is that right?

2576
02:09:21,560 --> 02:09:24,720
Itchy and scratchy land.

2577
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:29,400
And that episode is from the fourth from the sixth season,

2578
02:09:29,680 --> 02:09:34,480
which aired in on October 2nd, 1994.

2579
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:39,000
Wow. It's now a clash of the 1994s.

2580
02:09:39,120 --> 02:09:41,320
Wow. Wow.

2581
02:09:41,600 --> 02:09:43,200
Interesting.

2582
02:09:43,200 --> 02:09:44,440
Well, a good era.

2583
02:09:44,440 --> 02:09:45,160
And you know what?

2584
02:09:45,160 --> 02:09:47,440
It was like a very this is not the screenwriter.

2585
02:09:47,440 --> 02:09:48,760
This is a tactical.

2586
02:09:49,080 --> 02:09:53,800
This is like there's like, you know, they're tangible experiences.

2587
02:09:53,800 --> 02:09:56,200
So much in itchy and scratchy land.

2588
02:09:56,200 --> 02:10:01,120
It's like, so, you know, the real stuff you can do real robots, real danger.

2589
02:10:01,480 --> 02:10:05,520
Dinosaur World obviously is like, can you imagine if it existed?

2590
02:10:05,680 --> 02:10:08,840
If you could go on Larry, the scary Rex, that it would be very

2591
02:10:09,320 --> 02:10:14,120
you would feel like pirates, it would feel like it's in the era of Indiana Jones, too.

2592
02:10:14,360 --> 02:10:18,760
Right. It's like it's like in a in a time where Disney was killing it.

2593
02:10:18,760 --> 02:10:22,320
And if they did something that was as good as the movie scene is.

2594
02:10:23,280 --> 02:10:25,920
Right. Yes. It'd be incredible.

2595
02:10:25,920 --> 02:10:28,400
And that's and then what you're saying,

2596
02:10:28,400 --> 02:10:33,160
thinking of the quality of it from the dinosaur, the ride,

2597
02:10:33,880 --> 02:10:38,600
and then taking that and applying what they would have done then to the whole theme park.

2598
02:10:39,200 --> 02:10:43,040
Yeah. You have to start your imagination starts to run wild with

2599
02:10:43,360 --> 02:10:46,720
what this whole thing would be, as you're saying, Disney sea level.

2600
02:10:47,920 --> 02:10:50,440
Attraction, I think so.

2601
02:10:51,800 --> 02:10:54,680
Now, do you maybe we've docked

2602
02:10:54,680 --> 02:10:59,960
points in the past or maybe you don't get the best sense of what the whole thing is.

2603
02:11:00,280 --> 02:11:04,080
And you really only know Larry, the scary Rex.

2604
02:11:04,680 --> 02:11:06,880
But that is a blockbuster attraction.

2605
02:11:06,880 --> 02:11:09,280
It's almost like, yeah, if they didn't have anything up. But like.

2606
02:11:10,120 --> 02:11:13,760
Yeah. Is it bad that it relies on our imagination?

2607
02:11:13,920 --> 02:11:15,680
Yeah. Is that enough?

2608
02:11:15,680 --> 02:11:20,400
Is that enough to defeat like the iconic itch and scratchy land? Right.

2609
02:11:20,400 --> 02:11:27,400
But if this were just, you know, final four fake theme park ride, final four.

2610
02:11:27,400 --> 02:11:29,600
Oh, then easy. Oh, easy. Yeah.

2611
02:11:29,640 --> 02:11:31,120
Then no question.

2612
02:11:31,120 --> 02:11:36,600
But just because the Simpsons have more jokes and more stuff.

2613
02:11:37,400 --> 02:11:40,120
Does that mean it wins?

2614
02:11:40,960 --> 02:11:43,640
Potentially, you have a better sense of what the whole thing is.

2615
02:11:43,640 --> 02:11:48,400
Again, Parents Island, I don't know if there's I don't know if alcohol is even allowed

2616
02:11:48,480 --> 02:11:52,200
at Dinosaur World, they have not addressed this in this movie.

2617
02:11:52,200 --> 02:11:54,960
That's not about this. Right.

2618
02:11:54,960 --> 02:11:58,760
But the ride itself is so good.

2619
02:11:59,760 --> 02:12:03,360
Really, you would have to imagine that the park.

2620
02:12:04,440 --> 02:12:05,960
Comes close to that level.

2621
02:12:05,960 --> 02:12:07,280
Let me let me look, let me show you.

2622
02:12:07,280 --> 02:12:09,840
Let's look at this picture, and this is taken off my TV.

2623
02:12:09,840 --> 02:12:15,840
It's not all clarity quality, but just to get a sense of, OK, what is the rest of this?

2624
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:19,120
The volcano is three volcanoes in a row.

2625
02:12:20,360 --> 02:12:23,920
That might all be the structure of the Larry, the scary Rex ride.

2626
02:12:23,920 --> 02:12:25,320
You've got big lakes.

2627
02:12:25,320 --> 02:12:28,040
There's a big brontosaurus in one.

2628
02:12:28,080 --> 02:12:30,360
The rest you can't necessarily tell, but it does.

2629
02:12:30,360 --> 02:12:34,040
There is a knots quality, I think it looks a little like rustic.

2630
02:12:35,680 --> 02:12:37,800
Knots had that great dinosaur ride, which is kind of

2631
02:12:37,800 --> 02:12:40,160
attributed in Wonder World and Beverly Hills Cup.

2632
02:12:40,160 --> 02:12:44,280
And if it feels like that, imagine if it's like little or dark rides

2633
02:12:44,280 --> 02:12:46,840
that are like Kingdom of the Dinosaurs.

2634
02:12:48,080 --> 02:12:52,280
And yeah, this is this is this is a nice looking park

2635
02:12:52,280 --> 02:12:54,760
from just this kind of blurry painting.

2636
02:12:55,840 --> 02:12:57,960
Nice piece of concept art, for sure.

2637
02:12:58,280 --> 02:12:59,760
It's really good.

2638
02:12:59,760 --> 02:13:04,480
I think I have maybe one more visual from the movie,

2639
02:13:04,480 --> 02:13:07,320
just if we're if that's helping us with anything.

2640
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:09,400
Let me share the screen.

2641
02:13:09,400 --> 02:13:14,000
So I mean, there's the outside of Larry, the scary ride, incredible facade.

2642
02:13:14,360 --> 02:13:17,080
Although, but how about this, though?

2643
02:13:17,080 --> 02:13:21,160
Isn't in theory, isn't that what the T-Rex Cafe looks like?

2644
02:13:21,320 --> 02:13:23,400
It is not. Yes.

2645
02:13:23,400 --> 02:13:26,160
Does not the T-Rex Cafe suck.

2646
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:28,080
It is not good.

2647
02:13:28,080 --> 02:13:29,760
Well, I've never died.

2648
02:13:29,760 --> 02:13:31,760
But I can't say from first hand.

2649
02:13:31,760 --> 02:13:36,160
My friends, Tyler and Kia did, and they said it stank to high heaven.

2650
02:13:36,480 --> 02:13:39,920
Scott, the those mountains are in the distance, so that can't be

2651
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,960
the show area for Larry the Scary Rex.

2652
02:13:43,480 --> 02:13:46,160
Still separate.

2653
02:13:46,200 --> 02:13:48,480
So there might be full

2654
02:13:48,480 --> 02:13:52,040
journey to the center of the earth in those different volcanoes.

2655
02:13:52,280 --> 02:13:55,080
And you've also got there's a dinosaur there.

2656
02:13:55,080 --> 02:13:57,800
There's like seems like a skyway type attraction.

2657
02:13:58,080 --> 02:14:00,040
There's a brontosaurus behind them.

2658
02:14:02,040 --> 02:14:03,200
Let me let me say this.

2659
02:14:03,200 --> 02:14:05,160
Let me throw this into your brains.

2660
02:14:05,160 --> 02:14:09,640
If you didn't have any affection for the Simpsons or itchy and scratchy

2661
02:14:09,640 --> 02:14:14,040
as a property before going to itchy and scratchy land,

2662
02:14:14,240 --> 02:14:17,440
wouldn't that take out a lot of the novelty and fun?

2663
02:14:18,560 --> 02:14:23,360
If we're just judging this based truly on the design and the rides

2664
02:14:23,880 --> 02:14:26,440
and you take out your years of watching the Simpsons

2665
02:14:26,440 --> 02:14:30,160
as a little kid and loving it, you're in the Simpsons universe.

2666
02:14:30,160 --> 02:14:33,000
Maybe you are an adult and you know of the cartoon.

2667
02:14:34,200 --> 02:14:38,560
You almost have more to combat in that when we were kids,

2668
02:14:38,680 --> 02:14:42,920
the movie Clifford was around and I feel like maybe I said to my parents,

2669
02:14:42,920 --> 02:14:44,160
should we see Clifford?

2670
02:14:44,160 --> 02:14:46,600
And they said, no, that looks bad.

2671
02:14:46,600 --> 02:14:49,800
And then I watched it on Comedy Central and I thought it was bad.

2672
02:14:50,040 --> 02:14:53,280
So I'm almost more I'm overcoming this

2673
02:14:54,560 --> 02:15:01,040
this huge gulf of hate in order to get to where I have gotten to with Dinosaur

2674
02:15:01,040 --> 02:15:03,000
World, which is very and it's all new.

2675
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,280
This is new feelings that we all found together.

2676
02:15:05,640 --> 02:15:08,520
It is now what theme parks are about making memories together.

2677
02:15:08,680 --> 02:15:12,680
You're we're filling in a lot of blanks about dinosaur world.

2678
02:15:12,680 --> 02:15:18,120
We all have talked recently about revisiting some childhood cartoons,

2679
02:15:18,120 --> 02:15:20,440
the Ninja Turtles cartoon, the X-Men cartoon.

2680
02:15:20,880 --> 02:15:26,000
And so many of them you go like, I didn't remember them not moving this much.

2681
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:30,920
Like, I guess my brain filled in the blanks and I remember it fondly.

2682
02:15:30,920 --> 02:15:36,960
I've been getting a new kind of YouTube recommendation, which is someone has taped

2683
02:15:37,240 --> 02:15:42,080
someone in the past tape full blocks of Fox Kids from start of airing

2684
02:15:42,080 --> 02:15:44,920
through commercials with full episodes.

2685
02:15:44,960 --> 02:15:48,480
I'm very excited to revisit those because I think that'll be a real trip.

2686
02:15:48,880 --> 02:15:53,440
But I think it's just scratchy land laid out, kind of laid out in front of you, Michael.

2687
02:15:54,320 --> 02:15:58,040
It is. But so much of the enjoyment of itchy and scratchy land is because

2688
02:15:58,040 --> 02:16:00,040
we know it's a parody of Disney.

2689
02:16:00,040 --> 02:16:02,040
We know that these are all jokes.

2690
02:16:02,040 --> 02:16:05,440
So much of my love of it in scratchy land is because it's packed with jokes

2691
02:16:05,640 --> 02:16:08,280
that are references to things at Disneyland.

2692
02:16:08,600 --> 02:16:12,120
It's all sort of based on there's layers to itchy and scratchy land

2693
02:16:12,120 --> 02:16:13,440
and to the enjoyment of it.

2694
02:16:13,480 --> 02:16:16,280
Obviously we're talking about parents Island a lot, because we know that would

2695
02:16:16,280 --> 02:16:21,240
purely be a fun experience to go to a dumb TGI Fridays where you ring in the new year.

2696
02:16:21,520 --> 02:16:27,120
But would I rather go to a fresh kind of old feeling dinosaur land park that looks

2697
02:16:27,120 --> 02:16:29,440
like Scott's the picture, Scott just pulled up.

2698
02:16:29,800 --> 02:16:35,960
Or would I go to this park that is a joke park based around Disneyland?

2699
02:16:36,080 --> 02:16:37,760
Which one is better?

2700
02:16:37,760 --> 02:16:43,160
And I'm trying to take all of my nostalgia for the Simpsons and for my childhood's

2701
02:16:43,160 --> 02:16:48,360
viewing when I'm thinking about it, because I think if the ride quality is to be

2702
02:16:48,360 --> 02:16:53,360
believed at dinosaur land, that park might be better.

2703
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:55,400
That's that's where I'm leaning.

2704
02:16:55,400 --> 02:17:00,640
I think that might be a better park, a more satisfying experience and a new, more

2705
02:17:00,920 --> 02:17:06,400
feeling original experience as opposed to going on stuff at itchy and scratchy land,

2706
02:17:06,400 --> 02:17:10,640
which is all I get how they're making fun of a thing that I've been on before.

2707
02:17:11,240 --> 02:17:12,480
Yeah. Right. Yeah.

2708
02:17:12,640 --> 02:17:15,600
There's no precedent for dinosaur world.

2709
02:17:15,880 --> 02:17:21,240
Right. There's dinosaur experiences, obviously, but it's not making fun of so many of

2710
02:17:21,240 --> 02:17:24,720
the things on this list are jokes based on stuff at Disney.

2711
02:17:24,960 --> 02:17:30,440
The people, the good people who made Clifford, they were trying to make an original

2712
02:17:30,720 --> 02:17:32,480
dinosaur experience.

2713
02:17:32,800 --> 02:17:38,400
They were trying to give people something completely new using, of course, the classic

2714
02:17:39,120 --> 02:17:41,320
theme park tropes and ideas.

2715
02:17:41,440 --> 02:17:47,840
But giving us a wholly new themed experience and something that we actually feel like

2716
02:17:47,840 --> 02:17:51,720
we've been on at the end, which is why I'm voting for dinosaur world.

2717
02:17:51,720 --> 02:17:52,680
Oh, my goodness.

2718
02:17:54,960 --> 02:17:56,280
Yeah. OK. OK.

2719
02:17:56,280 --> 02:17:57,440
We have one locked in.

2720
02:17:57,440 --> 02:17:59,200
So the power is in our hands.

2721
02:18:02,040 --> 02:18:04,880
Think one thing also.

2722
02:18:06,040 --> 02:18:10,880
There's. You know, there's there's things like in Wonderworld where it's a little bit

2723
02:18:10,880 --> 02:18:12,880
like, oh, this is kind of a corny attraction.

2724
02:18:13,120 --> 02:18:16,160
They do not make that choice with dinosaur world.

2725
02:18:16,160 --> 02:18:18,160
Right. This is just a great level.

2726
02:18:18,200 --> 02:18:25,400
You go up to there's like it's it's as if the log flume in Splash Mountain stopped

2727
02:18:25,400 --> 02:18:31,520
up at the perch gave you a full scene with a pterodactyl who comes back in a different

2728
02:18:31,520 --> 02:18:32,760
mode flying.

2729
02:18:32,920 --> 02:18:37,040
Then you see one of the greatest animatronics you've ever seen fire a laser at it.

2730
02:18:37,400 --> 02:18:40,640
Yeah, I'm almost like if there was nothing else here.

2731
02:18:40,640 --> 02:18:47,240
Right. It's scratchy land is full of like irony and great funny jokes.

2732
02:18:47,480 --> 02:18:53,200
But isn't it nice to not have to see irony once in a while?

2733
02:18:53,200 --> 02:18:54,920
That's all our personalities are.

2734
02:18:55,080 --> 02:18:56,720
That's nice to have a break.

2735
02:18:57,120 --> 02:18:58,280
Yeah, that's true.

2736
02:18:58,280 --> 02:19:03,960
And I think a thing to acknowledge in the universe of the movie, Charles Gruden appears

2737
02:19:03,960 --> 02:19:06,560
to be good at what he does.

2738
02:19:06,680 --> 02:19:10,720
Yes. Like he wants this project, this transportation infrastructure.

2739
02:19:10,880 --> 02:19:12,240
That's his passion.

2740
02:19:12,520 --> 02:19:14,200
He's trying to solve Los Angeles.

2741
02:19:14,200 --> 02:19:16,120
He's like fixing stuff that we need.

2742
02:19:16,120 --> 02:19:17,280
And he'd probably be good at it.

2743
02:19:17,480 --> 02:19:20,880
And dinosaur world was like a stepping stone to that.

2744
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:24,200
So like, yeah, he might actually solve Los Angeles.

2745
02:19:24,240 --> 02:19:29,560
Oh, in that way that we're always like, like, oh, you know, Walt was testing out these

2746
02:19:29,560 --> 02:19:34,120
forms of transportation to maybe take them to make like transportation in your city or

2747
02:19:34,120 --> 02:19:35,920
the airport or whatever more efficient.

2748
02:19:35,920 --> 02:19:39,840
Let's take these Disney ideas, incubate them and then do them on a bigger scale.

2749
02:19:39,840 --> 02:19:42,400
Isn't that what Uncle Martin is?

2750
02:19:42,400 --> 02:19:47,520
You talk about your Walt figures and you're like, and we love our rides, our Tonys and

2751
02:19:47,520 --> 02:19:50,320
our Joe roadies who have their personal stamp.

2752
02:19:50,320 --> 02:19:52,880
Uncle Martin is absolutely one of those.

2753
02:19:52,880 --> 02:19:57,680
Absolutely. He is Clifford is us just like passionate about these three.

2754
02:19:57,680 --> 02:20:00,080
Clifford's. We're three Cliffords.

2755
02:20:00,600 --> 02:20:02,720
I think I know how I'm voting.

2756
02:20:03,480 --> 02:20:05,960
Mommy, I want to go to Dinosaur World.

2757
02:20:05,960 --> 02:20:07,400
I want to go to Dinosaur World.

2758
02:20:07,400 --> 02:20:08,840
Take me Uncle Martin.

2759
02:20:09,120 --> 02:20:16,040
I like Michael drew me to the edge and then that mischievous maniac Clifford pushed me

2760
02:20:16,040 --> 02:20:16,960
over the cliff.

2761
02:20:18,800 --> 02:20:19,800
Unbelievable.

2762
02:20:19,800 --> 02:20:26,000
Wow. Dinosaur World from the disliked 1994 Martin short vehicle.

2763
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:33,680
Clifford takes the fake theme park final for a tumultuous one.

2764
02:20:33,680 --> 02:20:35,120
Rules were broken.

2765
02:20:35,120 --> 02:20:42,280
Major beloved franchises were tossed to the side in favor of very disliked ones.

2766
02:20:42,280 --> 02:20:44,480
And that's what took it all the way.

2767
02:20:44,480 --> 02:20:47,840
Boy, that was an incredible speech, Mike.

2768
02:20:47,840 --> 02:20:53,960
And I think we all did anyone sort of think this could be it?

2769
02:20:54,120 --> 02:20:55,920
I was wondering a little bit.

2770
02:20:55,920 --> 02:20:59,520
I was for sure going to come in with a lot of passion for Larry the scary Rex.

2771
02:20:59,520 --> 02:21:03,680
And I wondered if it'd be reciprocated if it'd be a little like, oh, interesting.

2772
02:21:03,680 --> 02:21:04,600
So you liked that.

2773
02:21:04,600 --> 02:21:08,440
And then so the comfort and discovering that all three of us felt the same way.

2774
02:21:08,440 --> 02:21:14,440
Well, we all have we all have ride taste, and it's impossible to watch that and not

2775
02:21:14,440 --> 02:21:15,680
go. Oh, my God.

2776
02:21:15,680 --> 02:21:16,760
That would be amazing.

2777
02:21:16,760 --> 02:21:17,680
It's impossible.

2778
02:21:17,680 --> 02:21:19,360
It does every 60.

2779
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:25,280
It's like exactly as advanced of a coaster as I could do as a kid, probably still today.

2780
02:21:25,280 --> 02:21:27,160
That's as far as I could go.

2781
02:21:27,160 --> 02:21:28,920
It's a coaster and a dark ride.

2782
02:21:28,920 --> 02:21:30,240
There's surprises.

2783
02:21:30,240 --> 02:21:33,120
There's a little splashdown like the Matterhorn.

2784
02:21:33,120 --> 02:21:36,000
It becomes addictive as you watch it in fast motion.

2785
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:41,760
And I'm sorry that it hurt Clifford and that he had to be pulled out of Larry's jaws.

2786
02:21:41,760 --> 02:21:43,120
But it all worked out.

2787
02:21:43,120 --> 02:21:48,880
He's a nice old monk now teaching Ben Savage to not be bad.

2788
02:21:48,880 --> 02:21:49,880
Mm hmm.

2789
02:21:49,880 --> 02:21:50,880
So there's that.

2790
02:21:50,880 --> 02:21:52,480
It all worked out.

2791
02:21:52,480 --> 02:21:56,720
Clifford got perspective from his experience, and I feel a lot of perspective right now.

2792
02:21:56,720 --> 02:22:02,640
I definitely when I glance, I was like thinking itchy and scratchy land was going to win.

2793
02:22:02,640 --> 02:22:11,040
But I definitely was like, oh, Dino, Larry the scary Rex is going to push this one very

2794
02:22:11,040 --> 02:22:13,200
far into the tournament, at least from my perspective.

2795
02:22:13,200 --> 02:22:14,960
I didn't know how everyone else was going to feel.

2796
02:22:14,960 --> 02:22:17,600
I thought I was going to actually lose too.

2797
02:22:17,600 --> 02:22:22,880
I thought even though I gave one of the best speeches of my life just now, the most inspiring

2798
02:22:22,880 --> 02:22:26,640
speeches I've ever given, I thought there was a chance that you go, yeah, that's true.

2799
02:22:26,640 --> 02:22:28,960
But we like itchy and scratchy land.

2800
02:22:28,960 --> 02:22:30,080
Yeah, it wouldn't have been bad.

2801
02:22:30,080 --> 02:22:33,280
But is there maybe also the bias in general?

2802
02:22:33,280 --> 02:22:38,080
Maybe I have it of like, do you, doesn't it just feel obvious to say like the Simpsons is good?

2803
02:22:38,080 --> 02:22:40,000
So we give, of course we love the Simpsons.

2804
02:22:40,560 --> 02:22:44,640
It's like the fundamental of my brain.

2805
02:22:44,640 --> 02:22:47,680
I love the Simpsons so much and I love that episode so much.

2806
02:22:47,680 --> 02:22:55,520
But isn't it more, we're charting, we're like assigning new IP by suddenly liking this Clifford

2807
02:22:55,520 --> 02:22:56,160
thing so much.

2808
02:22:56,160 --> 02:22:59,600
It's too obvious, I think, the Simpsons.

2809
02:22:59,600 --> 02:23:00,320
That's part of it.

2810
02:23:00,320 --> 02:23:05,360
But as I said at the start of this, I'm going to try to divorce myself from the material.

2811
02:23:05,360 --> 02:23:07,920
And that's what I believe I successfully did here.

2812
02:23:08,880 --> 02:23:11,200
I think this is absolutely the right choice.

2813
02:23:12,080 --> 02:23:14,480
I think you're right, it's the more interesting choice for sure.

2814
02:23:14,480 --> 02:23:17,440
But I do think it's the right, I do think it's the correct choice.

2815
02:23:17,440 --> 02:23:23,520
And you could squibble and squabble with various things about this decision.

2816
02:23:23,520 --> 02:23:28,480
But I think there's no question that in all these things, the best, fullest, most thought out,

2817
02:23:28,480 --> 02:23:32,480
most awesome ride, no question is Larry the Scary Rex.

2818
02:23:32,480 --> 02:23:35,520
And isn't that what it's all about is rides.

2819
02:23:35,600 --> 02:23:39,440
And somewhat like places, you know, bars and stuff.

2820
02:23:39,440 --> 02:23:43,600
But I pushed some bars and stuff as far as I wanted to.

2821
02:23:43,600 --> 02:23:48,720
But I mean, no one commits to the bit, I think as hard as Larry the Scary Dinosaur.

2822
02:23:48,720 --> 02:23:57,520
Like no one commits to the theme park, you know, assignment quite like this movie.

2823
02:23:58,320 --> 02:23:59,520
And it doesn't need to.

2824
02:23:59,520 --> 02:24:00,320
That's the other thing.

2825
02:24:00,320 --> 02:24:01,440
It doesn't have to.

2826
02:24:01,440 --> 02:24:04,080
They could have just done like a rinky-dink sort of.

2827
02:24:04,800 --> 02:24:11,040
It's one of the only ones on the list that didn't do a jokey, make fun of thing.

2828
02:24:11,680 --> 02:24:11,920
Yeah.

2829
02:24:11,920 --> 02:24:13,760
I played it like it sucked.

2830
02:24:13,760 --> 02:24:16,960
It's one of the less insane things in Clifford.

2831
02:24:19,600 --> 02:24:23,600
So which luckily, thankfully, you can watch just that piece on YouTube.

2832
02:24:23,600 --> 02:24:26,240
But maybe I want to watch the whole movie now.

2833
02:24:26,240 --> 02:24:28,000
Oh, I definitely love.

2834
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:33,680
And I want to watch it in full quality, too, in sparkling HBO Max quality.

2835
02:24:33,680 --> 02:24:34,960
Now they have new movies.

2836
02:24:34,960 --> 02:24:37,920
They have Wonder Woman 84 and they have Tom and Jerry.

2837
02:24:37,920 --> 02:24:41,120
But now I think and they have some of the sopranos.

2838
02:24:41,120 --> 02:24:43,040
They have wonderful pieces of art.

2839
02:24:43,040 --> 02:24:52,400
But I think now the crown jewel of HBO Max is clearly Larry the Scary Rex scene in Clifford.

2840
02:24:52,400 --> 02:24:54,560
And a bungled rollout.

2841
02:24:54,560 --> 02:25:00,080
But HBO Max is it is starting to feel like old streaming Netflix where it's like,

2842
02:25:00,080 --> 02:25:01,520
man, they have everything.

2843
02:25:01,760 --> 02:25:03,760
They have so much on here.

2844
02:25:03,760 --> 02:25:05,280
Might be the best now.

2845
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:11,120
It's the Clifford of streaming services.

2846
02:25:12,320 --> 02:25:19,520
And I hope there's a longer cut of Clifford somewhere involving more of this theme park

2847
02:25:20,640 --> 02:25:23,520
that could be released in a four hour version.

2848
02:25:24,640 --> 02:25:27,760
This is where I want to try to contact a production designer.

2849
02:25:27,760 --> 02:25:28,640
I want to know more.

2850
02:25:28,640 --> 02:25:32,000
Maybe there's more like layers to this onion that we can unpeel.

2851
02:25:32,800 --> 02:25:35,280
For a whole dinosaur world episode.

2852
02:25:35,280 --> 02:25:37,520
Clearly, this is the one with the meat on the bone.

2853
02:25:38,400 --> 02:25:43,200
Let's get out of here because this has been a mega one, but with good reason.

2854
02:25:43,200 --> 02:25:49,360
You survived podcast, the ride, the fake theme park, Final Four.

2855
02:25:49,360 --> 02:25:51,360
Do we maintain fakeness?

2856
02:25:52,160 --> 02:25:53,360
All three have been faked.

2857
02:25:53,360 --> 02:25:54,480
Are they all fake?

2858
02:25:54,480 --> 02:25:58,160
Is that how this works or do we change the format entirely next time around?

2859
02:25:58,880 --> 02:25:59,600
That's a good question.

2860
02:25:59,600 --> 02:26:01,360
Is this like a trilogy of fakeness?

2861
02:26:02,400 --> 02:26:03,920
Maybe we could do something different.

2862
02:26:03,920 --> 02:26:06,880
Is it a cinematic universe of fakeness that never ends?

2863
02:26:06,880 --> 02:26:09,760
That has 40 episodes.

2864
02:26:11,680 --> 02:26:15,920
If you're trying to nudge us to doing a thick seat Final Four because that's not

2865
02:26:15,920 --> 02:26:18,560
anything having to do with fakeness, possibly.

2866
02:26:19,600 --> 02:26:21,440
I'm not sure that that's what I'm trying to do.

2867
02:26:22,640 --> 02:26:26,320
I wouldn't say at all that's what maybe we, I think fans expect, I think,

2868
02:26:26,560 --> 02:26:29,680
that fake is part of it because fake gets alliterative with Final Four.

2869
02:26:30,960 --> 02:26:32,400
In a way that thick just isn't.

2870
02:26:33,200 --> 02:26:34,240
I understand what you're saying.

2871
02:26:34,240 --> 02:26:35,440
We'll talk about it off air.

2872
02:26:38,080 --> 02:26:38,880
Give us your thoughts.

2873
02:26:38,880 --> 02:26:43,680
Tell us what you want us to do and come revel in Larry the Scary Rex with us

2874
02:26:43,680 --> 02:26:48,080
on our social media and for three bonus episodes every month,

2875
02:26:48,080 --> 02:26:52,960
subscribe to podcast, the ride, the second gate at patreon.com slash podcast, the ride.

2876
02:26:53,440 --> 02:26:57,920
Guys, it's been transcendent.

2877
02:26:59,120 --> 02:27:06,720
I feel as exhausted as Uncle Martin after a week with Clifford, but more positive,

2878
02:27:06,720 --> 02:27:07,440
I think, than him.

2879
02:27:08,480 --> 02:27:11,840
But I just want us to all remember and I guess the live may, you know,

2880
02:27:13,600 --> 02:27:15,200
we're three Cliffords for sure.

2881
02:27:15,200 --> 02:27:17,360
We've determined that and there's been a lot of talk.

2882
02:27:17,360 --> 02:27:21,600
People sometimes say, oh, what are the listeners or the fans of the podcast called?

2883
02:27:22,160 --> 02:27:23,680
And we really haven't had a name.

2884
02:27:23,680 --> 02:27:27,120
We haven't like dubbed a name, an official one, but let me throw it out there that we

2885
02:27:27,120 --> 02:27:28,240
just call them Cliffords.

2886
02:27:30,080 --> 02:27:32,160
This seems like a path to Stan.

2887
02:27:32,160 --> 02:27:39,760
This seems like this becomes like a bad term, like a bunch of Cliffords storm the Capitol.

2888
02:27:42,640 --> 02:27:43,520
It's possible.

2889
02:27:43,520 --> 02:27:45,040
I don't know if it starts here.

2890
02:27:45,600 --> 02:27:47,600
It'll start in an innocent place, I think.

2891
02:27:48,720 --> 02:27:50,960
You know, but maybe, yes, maybe you're right.

2892
02:27:50,960 --> 02:27:52,880
Maybe it grows into something monstrous.

2893
02:27:52,880 --> 02:27:53,360
I don't know.

2894
02:27:53,360 --> 02:27:55,280
I'm just throwing it out as a possibility.

2895
02:27:55,840 --> 02:27:56,880
Let me ask the listeners.

2896
02:27:56,880 --> 02:27:58,960
Do you want to be referred to as Cliffords?

2897
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:03,360
Are you are Cliffords after this experience?

2898
02:28:03,360 --> 02:28:05,040
Perhaps that's for you to decide.

2899
02:28:05,040 --> 02:28:05,680
Let us know.

2900
02:28:06,240 --> 02:28:07,600
Thanks for listening.

2901
02:28:07,600 --> 02:28:10,000
That was something so long.

2902
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:10,500
Bye.
