1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Warning. The following podcast may...

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Look, there's no other way to say it. It includes bodiness, okay?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm so sorry, but it does. It's very bawdy.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Specific bodiness may involve caught pieces, cleavage horns, ye olde sex toys, and an odyssey through Jason's bladder.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Johnny Pemberton leads us on a Rye-Bald Expedition through the world of the Renaissance Fair on Podcast The Ride.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Huzzah and good morrow! Welcome to Podcast The Fair, hosted by three good lads who doth taketh interest in horseless buggies that toss ye hither.

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm Scott Gertner, that's the end of that. I was joined by Jason Sheridan.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Difficult to sustain for long periods of time.

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The entirety of the podcast will not be done in such language, unless somebody wants to try it on their own, but I'm stopping. Mike Carlson.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Hi, yes, and thank you for stopping it before you got to me, because I was really like, okay, how am I going to do it?

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And everything that popped in my head was definitely like saying stuff in a pirate manner, but more positive, like, are ye mateys?

14
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And I was like, that's not it. That's not the way to do this. So thank goodness it stopped before I was put under pressure.

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's not an area that we're prepared to speak in for a very long time.

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I was thinking about this how, like, there's sort of a through line between what we're talking about today, Renaissance Fairs, and like areas of nerddom that I don't think we have.

17
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I feel like among the three of us, there is not Lord of the Rings and Hobbit so much. Right?

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Unless we just never come up. For me, at least. Game of Thrones. Does anybody do you even watch?

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Is this somehow an area that eludes all three of us nerds? It's not my scene.

20
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Well, I did see like every Lord of the Rings and Hobbit movie were usually Christmas releases.

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So that was like between Christmas and New Year's. Oh, we'll go see this. And it was a very pleasant experience.

22
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You're not a fan of those as much as you are as a fan of Christmas pleasantry.

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
As much as like, oh, we'll go to a movie and then go out to dinner. You know?

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
A fan of dinner. That we know. That's been established.

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Any sort of medieval fiction you're happy as long as there's an Applebee's afterward.

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yeah. It's like, oh, I wonder what I'll get at Romano's macaroni grill after this. Probably the same thing I always get.

27
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You're zoning out while Gollum is like trying to grab the ring and there's a big climax.

28
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yes, I am just imagining the ring has been replaced with like meat ravioli.

29
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
An onion ring. Oh, an onion ring. Sure.

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Jack Daniel's barbecue sauce. Jack Daniel's sauce. On pond pasta.

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's not. This is one of those where I feel like disappointed in myself that I haven't watched Game of Thrones.

32
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
That I'm not that into like the castles and drag.

33
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I like dragons, but I'm not so into it. So it feels like I've let people down.

34
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Imaginary people down are upset by me for not having some like intense fandom for this type of thing that feels so adjacent.

35
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Because maybe this maybe I'll get there because like I'm trying to be a little horror boy.

36
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm trying to get into all that stuff recently. I just got through the third Freddy Krueger movie.

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Which is very exciting. Right after Halloween. Great.

38
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Look, there's a baby and sometimes Scott, something you said where you had to get through movies in chunks.

39
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
That is very true with our baby as well. Yeah, I'm going so slow.

40
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Dream more. 90 minute movies take three days.

41
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So it's nice about this. You can sit down and do a 90 minute experience that can't be interrupted.

42
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Unless somebody needs to pee or something. But let's barrel in because now's the chance.

43
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
If anyone's mad at any of us for not being into anything medieval adjacent fantasy adjacent.

44
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Let's start figuring it out because this topic I feel like is a no brainer.

45
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I can't believe we haven't done it. And it took our excellent guest to bring it to us.

46
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,000
A Renfair fan. And when I asked about credits, he encouraged the instructions were to go to your Mozilla.

47
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Type his name in and don't worry about spelling it right. And hopefully there's an auto correct.

48
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So if you're if you want to know more, then go to Mozilla and type in Johnny Pemberton. Hi.

49
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Hi. Huzzah to the tipper. So the what?

50
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You already lost me on one. What's what was that word? Huzzah.

51
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
No, the other one. You said that to when you're at Renfair when you when that's what they say to you.

52
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The workers, when you tip them, they say, Huzzah to my tipper.

53
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Huzzah. Oh, I just feel like this sort of like this weird thing when you take Renfair out of Renfair, it feels a little like cringy.

54
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Oh, sure. Yeah. When you're not in the garb and when you're in a modern studio, when you're in a very well lit place.

55
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yeah, yeah. Where everyone's moderately clean and there's no indoors.

56
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
There's something about Huzzah to the tipper that you shutter as it's. Yeah, it's like a little bit.

57
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I think I figured out you guys blind spot, though. Oh, really? This whole thing.

58
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Listen to your you know, your your opening introduction discussion. Yeah.

59
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Is it possible that you guys don't smoke a lot of weed? Not so much.

60
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Not so much. Jason, not two of us, not two of us. Yeah.

61
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yeah. I mean, not in a while. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's what it is.

62
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Huh? I think the fantasy stuff, all the people I know who have been super into fantasy stuff are stoners.

63
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Ah, huh. I think that's it. Yeah. I got into it around 30. So I'm a cool guy.

64
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
OK. So was it not till then? I guess I didn't realize your time.

65
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,000
In my later 20s, like I tried edibles and they're very intense.

66
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Oh, yeah. And so I've gone backwards to the weaker stuff. Gotcha. Yeah.

67
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Interesting. Why do you think there is that correlation? Why is it a stoner experience?

68
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I think it's like you get lost in the experience because for me, the whole Renfair thing is you go and you get to kind of like time travel a bit.

69
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Yeah. And that's very conducive to being out of your head a bit, being high.

70
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Also, I mean drinking too. They serve alcohol at Renfair. Yeah.

71
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And people love to drink at Renfair. Sure. It seems like, yeah, that super boozy affair.

72
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's certainly candy. Something about the, something about psychedelics and weed, I think, are very conducive to the, to, yeah, time traveling.

73
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
To transporting. To another.

74
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I feel like there's a thing too where like everyone's like committed to the bit. Oh, for sure.

75
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Like everyone really wants to be there. Everyone was. I feel like this would be a place where I would be more comfortable dressing in the period garb than like cosplaying a comic con.

76
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Absolutely. It's the kind of thing where the first time I went, I found that out very quickly.

77
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And then every year after, you got to dress up. Otherwise you get ribbed by the the jokers who roam the the boulevards of the Renfair.

78
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
They'll rib you. The opposite of the Huzzah for the tipper.

79
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You're not being commended. You're being, you're, you're, you'll be committed for dressing like a future man.

80
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yeah. They're like, what is this garb that you wear? This is what is this strange printing on your shirts? Good, sir.

81
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm confused by stuff like that. Printing press does not work on fabric.

82
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Oh, that there's a lot of times where people like two guys will join jump in on someone and be like, yes, what is this man doing with what is this strange contraption?

83
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
He has like you have to bring your phone out or something. That kind of stuff, which I like.

84
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I think it's cool that they get after you. Sure. They're like basically like you can't.

85
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
How dare you? How dare you not time travel with me?

86
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
That does that sounds humiliating. So it's like completely in your best interest to to just jump in, do it.

87
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Yeah. Well, also, we're talking about the Renaissance Pleasure Fair here, which is a Southern California thing.

88
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Oh, yeah. Well, that's a good question. I know how you wanted to narrow it, if it is the general thing or if you're if we're focusing on on so because you've been a regular of the SoCal one.

89
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So the Renaissance Pleasure Fair, which is very important to say because it is a it is a sexually tinged Renaissance Fair.

90
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And it's that's well known. Everyone knows this. Yeah. Yeah. It's part of the tradition of it.

91
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's it's what they call it's a bit body. Well, you don't even know what you just stepped in.

92
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Body has been a running word on this. Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

93
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I noted that body comes up in Ren fair discussion. Oh, yeah. A lot.

94
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What what what are your associations with bike and fill you in on why it's come up with us?

95
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I would say for me, it's the sort of thing where it's a way to say something that's sexual in nature, but it's also kind of jokey and it's good nature.

96
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's good nature. It's not like it's a little bit pervy, but not in the sense where it's obscene or uncomfortable.

97
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:02,000
On a graphic. Yes. It's like everyone's in this arena where everything you say is like, oh, everything's a double entendre.

98
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So yeah, it feels like it's body in this with playful. It's very playful. Sure.

99
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Here's the best example I have of it is a lot of people who work at the stalls and stuff there are women and they have a significant amount of cleavage available to see.

100
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
This seems like a big thing about this is a big thing. There's a lot of pushing up going a lot of pushing up with the corset.

101
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And a lot of times these women who have the extremely ample bosoms will put a little horn in between in their cleavage and they will squeeze their boobs together and honk this horn.

102
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
When you tip them like you're buying a turkey leg, it's like honk honk.

103
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Honk honk. That to me is not at all sexual. I find it to be not.

104
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You know what I mean? That is not a rousing at all. That is because you could do that with your your butt.

105
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Right. That's very just like weird anatomy. That's body.

106
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Huh? Yeah. That's on the fringes of here's what the human body BODY can do.

107
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:12,000
But not like that's not a you're not watching that in a pornographic film. I don't think unless there's got to be something some porno where that's in there.

108
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Sure. But I'm just saying it's not honk honk for sure.

109
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I wish I could do it. I've never been a Peewee Herman ask.

110
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I feel like a little bit. You know what I mean? It's kind of a it's sexual maybe for like a teen or like a child or something.

111
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yeah. Oh, that's sexy. It's like, no, it's kind of being used in some way.

112
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I watched some shows from the the one I went to growing up, the Pennsylvania Renaissance Fair.

113
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,000
That's probably a great one. It is incredibly elaborate. It's on a wineries like property.

114
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'm already. So they they also now are partnered with a brewery and a distillery and a hard cider local hard cider company.

115
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And they've built Tudor structures in stages and stuff.

116
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Where is this in Pennsylvania? I didn't know about this. It's like north of Lancaster.

117
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
OK. And it's at the Mount Hope Winery.

118
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And there is a show called like The Washing Wenches Show.

119
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And there was literally like this woman. Everyone's on, you know, benches.

120
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And this woman stood on a bench with like her crotch in a man's face and gave him the instruction of like, all right, I need you to we need to check each other for weapons.

121
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
So pat your way from the top of my back to my bottom and give it a squeeze.

122
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And I was like, dear God, this is cross the line from body to straight up horny.

123
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Call the local authorities, local authorities and add the only shut down.

124
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I called the sheriff and you know what happened?

125
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
He slipped and fell in the mud pit on the way to the Washington Wenches Show, because that's one of the other.

126
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
There's a mud pit. There's there's all the things.

127
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
There's like a Globe Theatre replica. You got to have that.

128
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's very essential. You got to have that.

129
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:15,000
There is the what everyone I only went once we went for a school field trip and they're like, do not miss the human chess game, which I learned just in the last year or two is now called the Tournament of Arms.

130
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Same show. Skip the chess moves.

131
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
So everyone just does stage combat.

132
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Oh, that sounds a little more exciting than watching the steps be taken.

133
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Well, one over and two up.

134
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,000
What happens is when your rook takes the other person's pawn, they fight for a second and they don't always like win.

135
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I feel like.

136
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Oh, so it's not by chess moves.

137
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It's literally by combat moves.

138
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Yeah, kind of like everyone is moving like the chess pieces they represent.

139
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
But then there is battle.

140
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I guess it's I guess it's stage so that like the piece is taking another piece.

141
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Right. The one wins.

142
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Like metaphorically, this is what's happening in chess.

143
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
We don't we just don't think about it.

144
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
We just do it as like knock off at most.

145
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
But in every chess move, there is like blood being shed.

146
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:10,000
The game of Star Wars chess game where like the monsters fight each other and one dies.

147
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's really that's sort of what's happening in chess.

148
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Oh, that's the actual eyes to get violence into a little board game.

149
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Yes.

150
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Yeah.

151
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Well, it's nice they provide an opportunity to finally flesh out what chess really we should really like more in each piece as we got to go to this Ren fair.

152
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Yeah.

153
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
We want to go now.

154
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
This is it's really cool.

155
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
And it's like I watched some videos.

156
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:42,000
They rehearse for like a month and then it runs August, September and October on the weekends and the holidays.

157
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:58,000
But when I was like 12, like in seventh grade, we definitely went on a school field trip, got in the bus at the middle school, went up there and they were just like, all right, meet back up at five and just unleashed us.

158
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
And we just did whatever we want.

159
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
So I remember like doing archery.

160
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I remember pricing out swords.

161
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
This became a man.

162
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Would you say I became a man?

163
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I became a very fussy man because I was saying to you guys before the show.

164
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It happened. I was like, we have to be back on the bus at five o'clock.

165
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
But the grand finale is a five thirty.

166
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
We're going to miss.

167
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
We never saw the end of the story.

168
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
The Queen's procession.

169
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Yeah.

170
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I now they call I believe they call it the final pub toast.

171
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
They have fully leaned into the boozyness.

172
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And now it's just on the weekends.

173
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It's not really on the weekdays except like school days where they seem to mostly do like, you know, they they do a Shakespeare workshop and they do like a different educational workshops.

174
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Less boozy, presumably, and less body.

175
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Hopefully, hopefully.

176
00:15:51,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Yeah, no, it's not just like we're doing the day and we're unleashing 12 and 13 year olds to like go wild.

177
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Like it was but it was so exciting in 1997.

178
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It's like, wow, I get to get a turkey leg not at Disney World.

179
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It is. It is an amazing experience.

180
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I went as a kid to the one in Minnesota and where I grew up, Minnesota and Chocopee.

181
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And I was I was blown away by I loved it.

182
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Remember, there was a guy walking around the shirt off who was selling pickles and everything he said out of his mouth was a was a joke about his penis, but also about the pickle.

183
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Yes.

184
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It was great.

185
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It was so body.

186
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It was just off the charts body.

187
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
That was my first Ren fair.

188
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I remember that that guy at the pickle salesman really just it sunk its teeth me because I realized, oh, this guy's walk around.

189
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:50,000
This guy's probably I mean, he's about as close to close to unemployed with a job that you can be an occasional job for a brief.

190
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Yeah.

191
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And a really specific strange job.

192
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Here's let me here's a little mind blower of because I was thinking like I was probably the Minnesota fair.

193
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I should look up what's up with the Minnesota fair and somebody I don't know if this was your pickle boy or pickle man.

194
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Oh, well, we guess he's got a restraining order or something like that.

195
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
No, I don't have like I don't have a rap sheet.

196
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
No, it's it's it's good news.

197
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
It's one of our one of our finest performers got started as a pickle boy.

198
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Jason Mraz.

199
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Really?

200
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
At that one.

201
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Minnesota specifically.

202
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
So you're a pickle boy.

203
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Wait, probably not.

204
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Hello.

205
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Jason Mraz is like our age is and I don't know how he's a little older than this guy.

206
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Well, all right.

207
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Could have been that this guy was a little older.

208
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I think this guy was definitely you didn't say pickle man.

209
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Not pickle.

210
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
He was pickle man.

211
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
He was definitely a man, but he wasn't like that old man.

212
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm pretty sure it wasn't Jason Mraz.

213
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
This guy feels like kind of guy.

214
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Forty five years old.

215
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
OK.

216
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
OK.

217
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Yeah, that timeline doesn't line up.

218
00:17:49,000 --> 00:18:03,000
But, you know, I feel like Jason Mraz has a kind of a direct line to to people's hearts, their heartstrings and maybe this like the sensuality of the pickle boy job that you described.

219
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Maybe it got him thinking, how do I write songs that, you know, tingle people?

220
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:20,000
He seems like he would be the perfect guy to like motion capture that like rooster in the Robin Hood Disney movie, like with the little like with a little guitar or whatever.

221
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
The mandolin.

222
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
That seems like a yeah, mandolin.

223
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Like it seems like he's definitely like hat tip to one side, like strumming and making like bawdy jokes while singing.

224
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
He's a rake.

225
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I would say that.

226
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
What's that word?

227
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
He's kind of a rakish, a rakish.

228
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Carouser.

229
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
He's a rogue.

230
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Yeah, rogue.

231
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Rogue gets used a lot in this language.

232
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I agree with you, by the way, Mike.

233
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
But you know that they're going out to Lin-Manuel first on that.

234
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,000
When Lin-Manuel passes, whenever Disney does this, then we're getting then then they'll go to Mraz.

235
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
But Lin-Manuel can't really sing, can he?

236
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Can he?

237
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I think he can't.

238
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:07,000
He sings like he sings like if you're not singing, it's more like you're trying to sing, but you're not really singing.

239
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
You're doing a thing that's like this of a sing.

240
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
There's a certain musicality to it that I could do it.

241
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
But he doesn't have pipes.

242
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Yeah, maybe not.

243
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Yeah, could he like say that?

244
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Yeah, yeah.

245
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
He might divide up his own.

246
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
He invented that whole thing because he doesn't have pipes.

247
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
He had to figure out how he could.

248
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
How can I make it in musical theater without being a real triple threat?

249
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Yes.

250
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
But writing parts for singers like there are some very good singers.

251
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Yeah, a lot of his shows.

252
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Sure, sure.

253
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Yeah, I watched a video.

254
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Do you want to talk about actors at this fair?

255
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
The Pennsylvania one, at least.

256
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
They did like interviews with people who work there.

257
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And it's so funny because someone was like, yeah, I got the job here because I had done a few plays in the area and I knew a little stage combat.

258
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
And after three or four months, I'm jumping out of a second story window.

259
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Wow.

260
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Wow.

261
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Because so everyone like picks up skills.

262
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,000
And it's also like for like an actor, it is like a four month gig.

263
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Like at least at the bigger ones, they do like a month or more of rehearsals just to get ready for it.

264
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Oh, yes.

265
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You don't think about that part.

266
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You think of it as a weekend thing.

267
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
But it's like, yeah, it's a way to be employed with odd skills for a while.

268
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Yeah, it's like a scary actor.

269
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Oh, yeah.

270
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It's I would say it's it is on that level of scare actor where it's a little bit.

271
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
It's barely employed.

272
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It's sort of that.

273
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
You know, I mean, like you're you're almost fully employed.

274
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Yeah.

275
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
But the reason you do it is not so much for the job, but because they're letting you do this thing that you want to do.

276
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Yeah.

277
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Like I watch a lot of scare actor auditions.

278
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
You ever watch those?

279
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Oh, I know there are videos and documentaries that I haven't gone into.

280
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
There's some good ones.

281
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Oh, really?

282
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,000
And it's a certain type of person who is very much the job is like they have to pay you.

283
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
But that person, they would do it for free.

284
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
You would definitely do it for free.

285
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Just the privilege of being able to play in the arena.

286
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I feel like a lot of Ren Fair people are that way where there's a lot of people who aren't paid to work there.

287
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:23,000
They just sort of camp there and they they walk around in garb and character interacting with people.

288
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
But they're not being paid.

289
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I think it's more they're more just camping there.

290
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I'm not really sure how it works, actually.

291
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I know there's a lot of there's a big behind the scenes at Ren Fair that is I've never been a part of.

292
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Sure, sure.

293
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Did you ever consider trying your hand at working it with that ever occurred to you or scare in your acting?

294
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I definitely have not thought about scare acting because I only learned about that sort of recently.

295
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I think it's something where I don't know.

296
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I don't think I want I don't think I'd be the right person for that.

297
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It'd be a step down at this point.

298
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I guess so.

299
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Yeah.

300
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
And I also just don't think I have the I don't have the passion those guys have to do it.

301
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Yeah.

302
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
But Ren Fair, I think I don't know.

303
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I don't know.

304
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Maybe I maybe I could do it.

305
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Maybe I would do it.

306
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I don't think it's a commitment.

307
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
You also have to buy a lot of stuff.

308
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I don't have like a ton of stuff to wear that would be really sink me into the period enough.

309
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Yeah.

310
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
What is there a position there you would want?

311
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Like if there was like one role there that would seems more fun than others.

312
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I mean, probably the pickle guy.

313
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Sounds like it.

314
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Yeah.

315
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Selling those pickles.

316
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Do you remember what a pickle double entendre was?

317
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Wait, we're looking at a pickle guy.

318
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Oh, thanks.

319
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
And he's shirtless too.

320
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Wow.

321
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Was your shirtless?

322
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Yes, he was shirtless.

323
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Wow.

324
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Oh, I didn't know that was a dimension of being a pickle guy.

325
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I didn't know that either until just now.

326
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Geez.

327
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I think the pickle thing, it's just everything.

328
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
You just talk about your penis, but you say pickle instead of penis.

329
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Yeah.

330
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Ladies, would you like to take a so we're sucking one of my pickles.

331
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
They're juicy and long.

332
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Hey, everybody.

333
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I got some fat, juicy pickles.

334
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You can suck on them while you walk around.

335
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
No problem.

336
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Touch my pickle.

337
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I dare you.

338
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
It won't hurt you.

339
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Geez.

340
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Was this something that actually there was a documented man who would do this in olden

341
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
days?

342
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I bet.

343
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Like, was there a?

344
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Yeah.

345
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Ye old Disneyland, Mike.

346
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
That's where they got the idea from.

347
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Oh, OK.

348
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
That's the big thing about Renfrair too is it's also it's an amalgamation.

349
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
There's nothing.

350
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
They have like steampunk people there.

351
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
There's no wrong way.

352
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
There's no hard.

353
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
There's hardliners.

354
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
But there's also people who are just anything from like I don't even know, probably from

355
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
like eleven hundred to sixteen hundred kind of falls in there.

356
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
It all counts.

357
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
It all blends together because I like looking at this big chart you can look at of all of

358
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
them across the country and they all define a specific era that they're set.

359
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,000
And there's a difference between Elizabethan and more like Tudor Robin Hood.

360
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
That's Elizabethan, isn't it?

361
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I don't even know.

362
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Is it?

363
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I don't even know.

364
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I don't even know.

365
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
That's what they I've seen the houses and the stages and buildings described as.

366
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
They also a lot of them do theme weekends.

367
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Yes.

368
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
So there's pirates.

369
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
There's unlicensed Harry Potter weekend.

370
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
So you're fine on the yard if you still want to do it.

371
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Yeah.

372
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Yeah.

373
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
If you want to give us a yard.

374
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Hey, great.

375
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
OK, OK.

376
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
That was a little theme minute to the pirates.

377
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Pirates are big.

378
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Pirates are really big.

379
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Pirates.

380
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Yeah.

381
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
The crossover pirates.

382
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,960
I think what happened when Space

383
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,960
dosage wasuls was time traveler weekend.

384
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,880
And there are just like leaning on a phone on the Doctor Who phone booth.

385
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:53,000
And so it's like because I do think well, it would be very fun to dress up

386
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
and go to these things.

387
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
It is funny to wear a Star Trek outfit and go to the I think it is funny.

388
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
That's funny.

389
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
That's pretty funny.

390
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I thought I think it's funny.

391
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
It's eight hours of funny though.

392
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And that long funny.

393
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I mean, there are a lot of improv shows at the sort of like ye olde

394
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Shakespearean like 20 minute improv shows at different little pop up areas.

395
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Ye olde Harold.

396
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I've done a bunch myself actually because usually I have some sort of psychedelic

397
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
and then drink a bunch and a lot of times ends up being where you're shouting

398
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
just like don't look at this tree.

399
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
How dare you look at don't look.

400
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
And it's just to people you don't know, which becomes like this weird.

401
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
It's like your own personal improv show because you're just so fucked up that

402
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
you don't care that you become an entire other.

403
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I really I like the voice first of all, because I was I was curious.

404
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Yeah, what you become when you go there.

405
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
And that is that like I feel like you like de-aged yourself with that voice.

406
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Like you're a boy now.

407
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
You're a lad.

408
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
What are you doing here, sir?

409
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Please give me your sword.

410
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
It's like so about that voice.

411
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
It's so stupid.

412
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
But you know right away what it is.

413
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
You're a person.

414
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
You're just you're you're bothered by everything.

415
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
And you think people aren't where they're supposed to be.

416
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Or you have like a boy with a job who like keep moving.

417
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Move up, move forward.

418
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Keep passing.

419
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Keep walking.

420
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Don't stop here.

421
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Don't touch the deer.

422
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
You're an order keeper.

423
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Yeah, kind of a medieval hall monitor.

424
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Keep walking.

425
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I'm I'm 13 years old.

426
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Life expectancy is 26.

427
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
So I'm having midlife crisis ease.

428
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Who wants to marry me?

429
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I have nothing.

430
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Looking for a good woman who works hard.

431
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Peaches, peaches.

432
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
We all have adult colic.

433
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Tapeworm, tapeworm, a limonade.

434
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Eat this now.

435
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
So for no sulfur here.

436
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,000
So you walk around with like mush or ice cubes or something to get rid of people's tapeworms.

437
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:16,000
That I usually carry like a big huge stick like an old sunflower stalk and have a bunch of rosemary and like bunch of herbs on it and stuff.

438
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
And we'll we'll touch people with it like from a distance.

439
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Whoa.

440
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And sometimes that's usually pretty fun.

441
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And that that cures them with something or gives them more power.

442
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
It's kind of like it doesn't matter, right?

443
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
That's the whole thing.

444
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
It's just a grab bag.

445
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
If it's kind of ye olde, then it works.

446
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:43,000
You can have like a but you can walk around with a bunch of rosemary and have like a wool blanket and some mud on your face and you would you'd fit in like a slot boy.

447
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Yeah, you're the slot boy.

448
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Who carrying a bundle of sticks back to your master who is the blacksmith, the smithy.

449
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Sorry, the smithy.

450
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Pardon me.

451
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Who needs them for your collecting.

452
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
He's like probably got a burn stuff.

453
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
He needs a fire to fuel his blacksmithery.

454
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
So you need a bunch of sticks.

455
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
All you have to do is just be dirty.

456
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
If you're just filthy, that's your costume.

457
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Filthy, no labels.

458
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Instantly and you're instantly time travels.

459
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
You could wear the current clothes as long as you you cover up all logos.

460
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:23,000
If you're wearing a Tasmanian devil shirt, just like modem up real good and then you're not going to get my and just be very almost horrified and confused.

461
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Like what time am I?

462
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Where am I?

463
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
When am I?

464
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Well, for the time travelers, for the time travelers weekend for sure.

465
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
But and you can buy pretty much any accoutrements.

466
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
You can buy herbs.

467
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
You buy walking sticks.

468
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,000
This was the only field trip I ever went on where they're like, remember, you cannot buy weapons.

469
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Weapons will not be let back on the bus.

470
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Wooden swords may be discussed, but like they have very elaborate like swords and knives and stuff for sale because that's the other thing.

471
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,000
This employs not just actors for a while, employs like all kinds of crafts.

472
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Blacksmiths, glass blowers, sword makers, candles.

473
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Oh yeah, candles.

474
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Yeah, right.

475
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
That's a part of it because I've never done one of these.

476
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
What's everybody's full literacy?

477
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I guess just Mike is full literacy.

478
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I can read.

479
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I'm able to read.

480
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Actually, that's one of my special gifts during the Rensma's Fairs.

481
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I'm able to read stuff.

482
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Wow.

483
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Wow.

484
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Which a lot of people probably people were not educated at that time.

485
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
So you're doing them a real like labels.

486
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Labels.

487
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Anyone need a label read?

488
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I knew how to read.

489
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
And then I read Martin Luther's proclamation he put on the church door.

490
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
And I was just like, never again.

491
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Horrifying.

492
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I will.

493
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I will bang my head on something until I don't remember.

494
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I'm a papist and I don't know what this Protestant nonsense is.

495
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I've gone blind.

496
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I meant to say Ren fair literacy and by which I mean experience and not literacy.

497
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
So that having been said, Mike, you ever done it?

498
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
No, never done it.

499
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Anytime when I was little and I would go past anything that looked like it, honestly,

500
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
it made me uncomfortable.

501
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
And I don't know if it was the body Ness or the ladies.

502
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I don't even know if that was being conveyed to me that that's what was happening.

503
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
But there was something about it that made me feel odd.

504
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I didn't want to be part of it.

505
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
And I guess it's carried over into my adult years, but I'm not against it now.

506
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
It's just no one's ever invited me in the last 10 or 15 years to even go.

507
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
So it's never come up.

508
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Oh, no.

509
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Well, somebody invited me.

510
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I just said go.

511
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Well, I'm looking.

512
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I was a leader.

513
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Like, yeah, I was looking for like a woe is me like no one invited me.

514
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
So I don't want to know.

515
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I don't want to go if no one invites me.

516
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Well, if you go, you got to take acid.

517
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
OK, so I'm working on weed.

518
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I'm working on getting weed to work because that freaks me out too much.

519
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
And I end up like vibrating at a different frequency.

520
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,000
So acid seems like it's going to be maybe 30 years away from from now.

521
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Unless you're right. Is it possible that somehow acid works in a way that weed doesn't?

522
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I guess I'm asking for myself because I haven't done any drugs in a while.

523
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I think it's all very different on the different person, probably.

524
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
But all of it can probably be scary as hell at Renfair if it's done wrong.

525
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I've had bad experiences there.

526
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Mm hmm. Oh, yeah.

527
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Not to take you back to it.

528
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Way too high, like accidentally too high from edibles to the point where you're not going to be able to do anything.

529
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,000
It's difficult to leave the shade of a small tree like sort of stuck.

530
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Oh, shit. Can't move.

531
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
One of the last ones.

532
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:36,000
One of the last times where I where I was like, I think I'm going to stop doing this is I got high at that thing.

533
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I was out with you, Mike. Desert trip.

534
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
When we split off, we like parted ways and I met a friend and got too high.

535
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,000
And I just remember that like I was so high that I was like, OK, you got to get your shit together.

536
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:56,000
And you're going to use cash money correctly and use it to buy a hamburger.

537
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,000
And the person when you do it right, the person is going to be so impressed that you did it.

538
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:09,000
These are my high thought like you're going to blow her away with your ability to put out money correctly.

539
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,000
And so then I'm doing it so slowly and carefully and weird.

540
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I remember walking up to watch the Neil Young set still full of pride that I used money right.

541
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:29,000
And then when I came to us like this seems like it's not the fit of getting like five hundred percent dumber for not something I want to do.

542
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
That sounds about right. Exactly.

543
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Yeah, this is what I was going through, though, too.

544
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:40,000
And I was in the pit watching Paul McCartney and I also was high and weird.

545
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Like I was so weird. Yeah.

546
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
And I was watching Paul McCartney and I literally all I could see was his old skeleton.

547
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Like I just saw the man's old skeleton dragging himself from the piano to the bass guitar and being like this one's for John.

548
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
And like I'm imagining his skeleton talking to me.

549
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
And I'm like, I don't know.

550
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I love this song, but I'm a little too much right now.

551
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,000
The opposite of the joy of a Beatle concert that you had.

552
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
That's misery.

553
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
It's hard to control your dosage with edibles.

554
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:21,000
But if you go get like you go to a dispenser and say, what is the cheapest pre-roll you have like a four or five dollar pre-roll?

555
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
That's pretty reliable.

556
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Yeah. And that's going to rip you up to a good way.

557
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:34,000
You know, it's going to get you again because they say there's no there used to be like people talk about mids like middle of the road week weed.

558
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:42,000
And now there's people believe that those have been bred out by decades of like weed is too strong now.

559
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Oh, huh.

560
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
So but if you know class of weed has been eliminated.

561
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Yeah. But if you go for the cheaper stuff, it's usually weaker and it's easier to control because there's I mean there's edibles and there's so many gadgets and do that nowadays.

562
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
And those can really mess you up.

563
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Accurate.

564
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Can you regulate?

565
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Yeah, I think that's right.

566
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Okay. Okay.

567
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Also, everyone's different.

568
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Yeah. Yes.

569
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Some people find one thing that works.

570
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:17,000
And also, I think with with Renfair, I think it's good to get just a little more than you want a little more than you're comfortable with.

571
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,000
So you get to that time travel zone where you're feeling that's what I call it is time traveling.

572
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Yeah.

573
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Yes. That's cool.

574
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:32,000
And the other thing is if you're too high at Renfair, all you have to do is look at your friends you're with and you say if you're getting skeezed out, you got to just say, shall we carry on?

575
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
And that's how any situation you just say, shall we carry on?

576
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
That's the instant eject button for uncomfortableness.

577
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Oh, okay.

578
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Okay.

579
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Well, because from the looks of of like Pickle Boy, for example, right, the uncomfortableness seems like something.

580
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Oh, there's another one.

581
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Oh, no.

582
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I well better or worse than the previous.

583
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
But we were looking at the first one we were looking at.

584
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
You can watch this on YouTube on the forever.

585
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
YouTube.

586
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:06,000
But the first Pickle Boy was shirtless and kind of like Pete Davidson physique.

587
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:13,000
This guy's shirted, which is an improvement, but a little bit of like a beret long hair beard creeps.

588
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
This guy's older.

589
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
He's probably put a shirt on because he's come along in years.

590
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I'm sure he used to be shirtless.

591
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Was once a Pickle Boy, shirtless Pickle Boy.

592
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Now he's shirted Pickle Man.

593
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
He's a veteran.

594
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
He passes out the start work.

595
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,000
He passed out the W 9s at the start of the season.

596
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Hey, man, I hate to do this, but you got to sign this crap.

597
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
It sucks.

598
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
It's going to be the last modern thing you got to do after this.

599
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
You're in the past.

600
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
You don't got to worry about taxes.

601
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
They're really good.

602
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
They're really fast, though.

603
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
And you pick weekly or every other week.

604
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
You know, it's cool.

605
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
They're all swarthy, though.

606
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
They're all swarthy.

607
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Yeah, they're all coxman.

608
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Yeah.

609
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Well, on that point, Jordan, can I ask for a clip?

610
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
This is the first clip of two from PM Magazine.

611
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
This is the second time this has come up lately.

612
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
This early 80s pleasant snooze magazine show that I like.

613
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
They profiled the Cabbage Patch Kids.

614
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,000
And then this woman in a really sharp PM Magazine baseball shirt.

615
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
She's touring the great...

616
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
This is the Houston Ren Fair, I believe.

617
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
And this is a guy I think you would want to carry on from.

618
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
As quickly as possible.

619
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I'm a rogue.

620
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Come here.

621
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I give away free kisses.

622
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Would you like one?

623
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Yes.

624
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Oh, kissing the reporter.

625
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Rogue.

626
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
He's into it.

627
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I know what you are.

628
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
You're a renaissance dirty old man.

629
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
That's what a rogue is all right.

630
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
You got it, lass.

631
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
There you go.

632
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Yeah.

633
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
A renaissance dirty old man.

634
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Just going in and she had to turn left to break the kiss.

635
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
All she had to do was not be directly lined up with it.

636
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
So that's a rogue for you.

637
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Another certainly swarthy...

638
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Are beards part of swarthiness and long hair part of swarthiness?

639
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
They certainly can be.

640
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I feel like it's all about the movement.

641
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
If you got something jangling around, you got some long hair,

642
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,000
you got anything baggy or anything that attracts attention,

643
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
that's all swarthy to me.

644
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
They're all very Captain Jack Sparrow-esque to me.

645
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
They're all half in the bag.

646
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Yeah.

647
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
They're definitely half in the bag in the daytime,

648
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
roaming around looking for whatever will say yes

649
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
or whatever doesn't say no immediately.

650
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
That's a question for you.

651
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:41,000
We've established bodiness, but there's also certainly horniness to it.

652
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,000
What has been your level of comfort with the general horniness?

653
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Or are you, as the impish hall monitor, not privy to the horniness as much?

654
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I don't know.

655
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
There's definitely a lot that's on display and stuff.

656
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
You see it just in the costumes and the way people act.

657
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,000
People will say ribald comments to you, to strangers.

658
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
They'll say stuff about your appearance.

659
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I've had people hit on my girlfriend right in front of me,

660
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
and I had to defend her honor.

661
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
But it was very fun.

662
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
That's kind of fun. Yeah, yeah.

663
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
The weirdest thing I think I've seen in terms of that is something called

664
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
the Dragon's Lair, which we stumbled upon very late in the day.

665
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
It's a glass-blowing area.

666
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
You can go back in this tent and you go back to the Dragon's Lair,

667
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:41,000
which is 18 plus, which is a bunch of dildos and stuff back there.

668
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I remember seeing this stuff.

669
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
This is outstanding, going into the Dragon's Lair.

670
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
That's what it's called.

671
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
They keep all the hand-blown glass dildos and sex toys to have.

672
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
That's a surprise.

673
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
That's not what you're expecting.

674
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
You're like, am I going to see the most impressive animatronic?

675
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Is fire going to be breathed?

676
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Good sir, fair maiden, would you like to come to ye old dildo shack?

677
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
You can't call it that. You have to call it the Dragon's Lair.

678
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
The old Dragon's Lair.

679
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Are they medieval, are they past-oriented dildos?

680
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Isn't every dildo a past-oriented dildo?

681
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Because I don't think anything has really changed, right?

682
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Ultimately, there's a basic structure to it that you're after

683
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
and a task that you need to fulfill.

684
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Is it like one side is a dragon's mouth

685
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
and the actual apparatus is coming out of its mouth?

686
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Is there anything crazy like that?

687
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Weirdly enough, I don't have a great memory of this.

688
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I just remember going in there and being like, oh God.

689
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
We just stumbled into the Dragon's Lair

690
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
and thinking this was not expecting to see that.

691
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I was also probably pretty high at the time.

692
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
This was a shall we carry on?

693
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
This was fast, shall we carry on?

694
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Would you now like to examine the booklet of skews?

695
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
The ISBN numbers for ye pleasure instruments?

696
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
That is the best part of it too, is all the commerce,

697
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,000
how quickly it shifts from oh good sir to browse me where's to,

698
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
okay, the square isn't reading the,

699
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I'm going to have to type this in manually into the iPad I have here.

700
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:30,000
When it's done like that, it's pretty great just how quickly commerce takes over character.

701
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Hey, did you notice that the blacksmith has an iPad with a Naruto cover on it?

702
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
This was the thing in the,

703
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
they were trying to get a Renaissance fair vibe going

704
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,000
in the very early days of Star Wars Galaxy's Edge, the Star Wars landing.

705
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
It seemed like the bar they were trying to hit was full time travel

706
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
or in another place in this different language that we speak.

707
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I don't know if you did it ever in that time or have since.

708
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I think what they thought would happen that people will come and kind of live in the world,

709
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
and I think it did not.

710
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I think it is a place with rides and you buy stuff.

711
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
That was certainly where the roads diverged.

712
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Because I bought something on the first day and there was some fancy term for credit card.

713
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I already don't remember what it was, and I did not have fun with it.

714
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I was just like, what are you talking about? Your credit card.

715
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
They had a name for it. I remember this.

716
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Yeah. Do you guys remember the name?

717
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Credits is usually what they say in the Star Wars universe.

718
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
They say credits for money.

719
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
But I would have known that.

720
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
They call it like a pass or something like that.

721
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I call it like a, I remember distinctively being like, I like this.

722
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I like this that they're all in.

723
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
They won't talk to you at all about anything.

724
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
They're hardliners.

725
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I appreciated that.

726
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
You brought that term to us too.

727
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Hardliner being just like fully go for it.

728
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Would you call yourself a hardliner or would you not give yourself that full?

729
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
No, but I really like, anytime there is someone there,

730
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,000
a lot of times what I will do is a walk to the very end where they have all the,

731
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
there's a lot of people camping there.

732
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
A lot of people camp there every weekend.

733
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
There's people who do reenactments.

734
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,000
There's a whole group of people who reenact Scottish Highland warriors from that area.

735
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,000
And I talked with one guy for probably, I would say more he talked to me,

736
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:31,000
but for probably about 40 minutes I sat there and it was so interesting.

737
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
He was talking about all the Hallbirds, all the different pikes and stuff,

738
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
explaining each one of them to me.

739
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I was pretty high and having a bunch of beers,

740
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:49,000
but it was fascinating that he was also explaining and it ended with him clearly seeing I was very interested,

741
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:55,000
saying, let me get your phone number and email and we have meetups every weekend.

742
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
If you would like to join us, take it down.

743
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
And I just, you know, I'm not going to say, oh, no, no, no.

744
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I said, okay, yeah.

745
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:07,000
And sure enough, I got a call from this guy for a couple of weeks in a row before he realized

746
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I'm probably not going to go out to these Highland events.

747
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Which are where? Which are like out, probably like in Whittier or Pacoima or something like that.

748
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
The fair itself is like half hour east of here.

749
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Yeah, it's in Irwindale Recreation Dam area.

750
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
But I kind of wanted to go to them. I did. It just didn't work out.

751
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
It's not something, it's kind of, I think it's a, you got to be in.

752
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:38,000
You know what I mean? It's a real, it's like any kind of extremely dorky thing where you're kind of, you can't be half in.

753
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a commitment.

754
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Like I remember going to comic stores growing up and seeing like the Warhammer miniatures.

755
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:51,000
And I thought they were very cool, like these little soldiers and tanks and all this stuff.

756
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:57,000
And I was like, I don't know. This seems cool, but I cannot commit to this.

757
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Like I knew I was like, this is another world.

758
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,000
This is the back of the store. And I gravitate to the front of the store.

759
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:12,000
And they're never shopping to two houses equal of dignity, but not.

760
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Jason, do you remember when we were at the Margaritaville Grand Opening at City Walk and this like some of the heads of the San Diego parrot head chapter were there.

761
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:31,000
They were very enthusiastic and they met us and they were like so excited by the idea that we could come down and be part of their San Diego chapter of paradise.

762
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Because they said the San Diego parrot heads were much more active than the Los Angeles.

763
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
And the Orange County more vibrant. Yeah, it was a much more vibrant community.

764
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
They talk shit on the Orange County crew.

765
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Yeah, they said that they were the best ones and that there were like a lot of like political problems with the other chapters of the parrot head organizations.

766
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
But they were like, like, yeah, here's our information. Like they were so ready.

767
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
This is exactly the same thing. It's totally parallel. Yeah, 100 percent parallel.

768
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Same thing. Yes. And it was like I wanted to do it, but like I'm like, am I really? No, there's no way you're going to go to San Diego and then you're justifying it.

769
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
You're explaining it to friends like, well, why do I drive all the way?

770
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Oh, yeah. Well, it's just better. There's less politics. It's just organized.

771
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
What you just said doesn't make any sense. How do you explain it to friends?

772
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:22,000
No, you don't have friends. Those are your friends. Yeah, that's the issue.

773
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
That's what that guy was doing. He's like, oh, clearly you don't have any friends.

774
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Do you want to be friends with us? Because we'll welcome you.

775
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Which is kind of beautiful. And like he really thinks he's like that you're a you are a lost soul who he can recruit into his band of married men.

776
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Why would anyone else listen to a speech about Hallberg's for 30 minutes and keep asking follow up questions unless he was a person without friends who needed to have some friends and had weekends?

777
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Weekends? I'm open. It did not occur to him that you might be gacked out of your mind and frozen in the spot.

778
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Loving it. But still, like, I'm here. I'm visiting. I'm not like looking to move into this area.

779
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I'm just I'm here as a tourist. I'm a tourist to your world.

780
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I'm cosplaying in Renaissance gear, but also cosplaying as a person who would do who would listen to you.

781
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Yeah. The interesting thing with all of this set with the body and the boozey.

782
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Yes, I do. I will say Renaissance fairs are very family friendly.

783
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:33,000
A lot of them do outreach for school groups. So I would say like the vibes are pretty chill.

784
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Like you can kind of pick whatever level you're at.

785
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I don't think they've gotten into the some parks that do haunts have started selling like light up necklaces that you can pay extra for and go like, please don't scare me.

786
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Oh, really? Yeah. So I I'm wondering if there's money to be made to like beef up the budgets on these Renaissance fairs.

787
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I'm like, hey, give me extra personal space. Like, I want to commit to this.

788
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,000
But I a necklace that you wear that lights up where you're like, don't throw a double entendre at me, please.

789
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Please don't. Yeah, I do not want a washing wench to try to make me give them a piggyback ride.

790
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,000
See, that's what I think about the Ren fair is it's so close to not happening at all.

791
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:23,000
You know, it's so homespun DIY that they just they can barely do what they're doing to do.

792
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:28,000
That would be it would break their backs to try to accommodate people.

793
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,000
And that's a system. Yeah. A subtle form of accommodation that wasn't like a sort of thing.

794
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Like, I think it would probably just tear them to.

795
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
I just why would you why would you not want to have someone?

796
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Why would you come if you didn't want to have someone talk to you?

797
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
It's like the whole point of it. It would just take this gnashing in your brain.

798
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
I have a back. I want to give people rides on it.

799
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:54,000
There was a disclaimer on the Pennsylvania one website of like, look, the pathways are all paved.

800
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:59,000
They're ADA compliant. There are some stages that are in grass fields and we can't do anything about that.

801
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Talking about this, my memory of the marketing for the Pennsylvania one was like very like low budget commercials where it would be a shot of a night on horseback and then the logo and slowly panning over like a slideshow logo that says like sponsored by Burger King.

802
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,000
And like someone just singing like the Pennsylvania Renaissance Fair.

803
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:32,000
But Jordan, if you can pull up that video I sent you, this is the twenty twenty two commercial for it.

804
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
And they upgraded their marketing budget.

805
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Oh, crap.

806
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Let the celebration begin.

807
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Indeed. We went out of a castle to a woman doing a dance.

808
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Oh, one flops.

809
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Turkey lay women surrounding the turkey guy.

810
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Or fair maidens.

811
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Oh, fish are swimming out of graphics.

812
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Visit pa renter dot com.

813
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Whoa, I'm there next year.

814
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I'm going.

815
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
It's great. And there's travel packages.

816
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:13,000
They partnered with local hotels in the areas, which there is many because this is a city that's been in the business for a long time.

817
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I didn't know this was such a big rent fair.

818
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
That's cool.

819
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Yeah.

820
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,000
And at some point they swapped out one small stage and built a mermaid tank.

821
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I saw that.

822
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
That is truly they're just gone.

823
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
They're gone for broke.

824
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Aren't they?

825
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Yes.

826
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
That is truly absurd.

827
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:38,000
The mermaid tank that is like so unnecessary and has nothing to do with the Renaissance at all.

828
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Yeah.

829
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Square.

830
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I guess it's mythological.

831
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
It's fantasy.

832
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:50,000
But I love that's what I like about it is it's sort of just that's the theme at Renaissance fair that no one ever talks about.

833
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
It's the original inclusive place.

834
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
It's the original all inclusive.

835
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
There's no no one's turned away.

836
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:02,000
You can be the biggest freak you want to be and show up and no one's going to say anything to you whatsoever.

837
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Other than just like hell yeah.

838
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Anything is anything's welcome.

839
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Yeah.

840
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:17,000
I was looking into the history of it which I didn't know because I didn't know like have these been going since the Renaissance has it been 200 years or has it.

841
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,000
And I didn't know it was in this it came out of the 60s.

842
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
It's a 60s Laurel Canyon thing.

843
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Malibu.

844
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Specifically.

845
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Huh.

846
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
OK.

847
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
That was original was in Malibu in the hills of Malibu.

848
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
I think.

849
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Oh and Agoura is where it's at.

850
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Yeah.

851
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Yeah.

852
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
It was there for a while.

853
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
It was a really bad documentary about it.

854
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
That's not that fun to watch.

855
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
I have watched and that.

856
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:47,000
So this Renaissance fair here Renaissance pleasure fair is not the longest running but it is the oldest.

857
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I think.

858
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Yes.

859
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
This one.

860
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
That's what they credit is like the first real.

861
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
There was a littler historical festivals smaller ones.

862
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
I think an early one was at the Paramount Ranch.

863
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
That's the Agoura one.

864
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Yeah.

865
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Which is the filming location for Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman.

866
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Oh wow.

867
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
It all burnt down though I believe sadly.

868
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
So sorry to tell you Quinn heads.

869
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
You can't go to the apothecary or whatever.

870
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Is that a thing in the Old West?

871
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Yeah.

872
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Is that OK?

873
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Yeah.

874
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
All right.

875
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
My history literacy.

876
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Early version of pharmacy.

877
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
OK.

878
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
That would have been.

879
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
All right.

880
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
But yeah.

881
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
But what I.

882
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
There's a bunch of hippies.

883
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Yeah.

884
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Yeah.

885
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:34,440
I did not know any of that lineage to it that it was like it was a hippie oriented thing

886
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:41,640
and besides the the theming and the time travel of it there was also just the very hippie element

887
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:48,280
of anybody come and it's communal and you peddle your wares and and and where and it

888
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,600
was like sleep with anybody you want to.

889
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:55,920
It was very like it's very openly like free love kissing booth kind of thing.

890
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:56,920
Yeah.

891
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:57,920
That's how it used to be.

892
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:02,520
There are articles I was reading I think Bloomberg is one of them that like they they were like

893
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:09,040
you can draw a straight line from early 60s birth of Renaissance Fair to Woodstock or

894
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:14,200
any of that that like that did not have the theme to it obviously but the idea of it's

895
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:21,040
going to be a semi organized field that is communal and everybody take care of each other

896
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:26,600
that maybe that doesn't happen without the rise of Renaissance Fairs a few years earlier.

897
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:27,600
That makes sense.

898
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:34,520
I just didn't know that like and that also a lot of it was done in counter to like a

899
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,800
Red Scare like really.

900
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:43,120
Yeah I think so that like like the idea of a place where like hippies and lefties can

901
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:47,360
come work and not be like like the school teacher.

902
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:52,040
What's the name Phyllis Patterson was the person was the person who started what became

903
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:58,440
the pleasure fair but that she was like very put off by like the get these pinkos out of

904
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:03,720
here like that you know and a world where like people couldn't work because of their

905
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:07,120
ideas and their freewheeling ways.

906
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,120
Yeah.

907
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:13,480
The whole thing was a rebellion to of the 50s essentially.

908
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:14,480
Wow.

909
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,480
Yeah.

910
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:19,280
So it's like you can see the like the thing that I keep thinking of is like there's a

911
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:24,880
lot of furry cons like there's a thing called Midwest Fur Fest and I go this is just a ren

912
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:31,360
fair for people with fursonas and big costumes animal costumes basically like it's the exact

913
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,360
same thing.

914
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:36,000
There's the exact same amount of horniness as far as I can tell I've never been a little

915
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
bit more.

916
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Yeah.

917
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,160
Maybe a little bit more horny.

918
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,160
That's fair.

919
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:47,080
But yeah it's like everybody's like almost recreating the model I feel like.

920
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,080
No.

921
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:49,080
Yeah.

922
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:54,440
I also I think then I have notes about how like they encountered rebellion like there

923
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:59,440
were people who tried to shut down the early ren fairs because they read of that these

924
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:05,480
places are full of lewd dances and distribution of literature advocating free love and the

925
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:06,480
use of LSD.

926
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,480
Oh.

927
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:10,280
We must shut down these these dreaded endeavors.

928
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,280
Only the CIA can use LSD.

929
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,280
No no.

930
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,280
No no.

931
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:17,480
That's a good slogan right there.

932
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:20,360
Only the CIA can use LSD.

933
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:23,000
I'm sorry but only the CIA can use LSD.

934
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,080
I have a card it's to treat my Havana syndrome.

935
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,080
Oh.

936
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:35,720
Which is suspiciously similar to a very bad hangover.

937
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:40,760
Let me stay in in the free love horniness zone a little more.

938
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:43,680
Can we pull up the other clip from PM magazine.

939
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:49,600
This is like we discuss dildos but there's one word that that is adjacent to dildo.

940
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:50,600
Maybe it's not actually.

941
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:51,600
Is it a pud?

942
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:54,520
Well what we're looking at right now is the codpiece.

943
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:59,880
Let's hear this guy discuss his codpiece.

944
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:03,800
And the codpiece here is a symbol of one of Henry's idiosyncrasies.

945
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:09,420
He had a rule that no man could have a larger codpiece in the kings and it was a privilege

946
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:13,280
to be with the king when he dressed and so he would deliberately get his courtiers to

947
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:18,800
help him dress with a moderate sized codpiece so they would happily go out and put on theirs.

948
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:22,360
Let's just stare at this codpiece for a second too.

949
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:26,600
Kind of like fancy pattern yellow orange a rose on top.

950
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:27,600
I just.

951
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,000
It's like a little locker like a little purse.

952
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
A satchel.

953
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,160
It's a little satchel for his penis.

954
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:36,880
It's a penis purse.

955
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,120
A penis purse.

956
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:41,840
I just never given a lot of thought to the codpiece.

957
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:46,920
I think it's an interesting facet of this that it's like a way to.

958
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:54,080
Like a comfortable environment to for people to be able to wear a codpiece and it's just

959
00:55:54,080 --> 00:56:01,840
a funny item because you know like there's clothing meant to accentuate women's body

960
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:09,040
parts but very little for the penis and with the codpiece having dropped off in popularity.

961
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,040
I don't know.

962
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,040
I'm fascinated.

963
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:14,320
It's interesting if codpieces came back all of a sudden.

964
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:18,520
Yeah maybe like it's a different name maybe it's like a pickle storage box.

965
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:19,520
Pickle purse.

966
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:20,520
My pickle purse.

967
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:21,520
My pickle purse.

968
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:22,520
My pickle.

969
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:25,320
I think you've got to get rid of that name.

970
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:32,800
The name is so why is there a name of a fish which feels limp feels gross not the way you

971
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:33,800
want to present your penis.

972
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:39,120
I wonder what it is if there's any relations of the fish cod and the codpiece.

973
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:40,120
I don't know.

974
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,720
Yes why cod.

975
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:46,120
This is something you'd ask someone at Renfair and they would give you a lengthy explanation

976
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:48,640
in the Queen's English.

977
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:53,880
And you'd be invited if you want to join the codpiece society if you want to like fight

978
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:56,960
the fight to get codpieces back in the national consciousness.

979
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:57,960
Going to the cod tank.

980
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:01,320
It should at least be a better fish.

981
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,080
Yeah what's a more virile.

982
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:04,080
A marlin.

983
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,960
Strong for a barracuda.

984
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,720
Yeah marlin definitely.

985
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,480
Marlin and barracuda are both good.

986
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:10,840
I don't know.

987
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:13,160
A trout is not.

988
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:14,160
Trout would be bad.

989
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,160
Troutpiece.

990
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:16,160
Walleye.

991
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:17,320
Is funny but yeah.

992
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:20,320
What's that one.

993
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,360
Anything like the cheaper stuff at a restaurant.

994
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,360
You don't want a tilapia piece.

995
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:25,360
No.

996
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:26,360
Scrod.

997
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,360
Scrod.

998
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,360
Scrodpiece.

999
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:29,360
Scrodpiece.

1000
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,080
You've managed to find one that's worse than codpiece.

1001
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,920
Just took a couple extra letters.

1002
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:37,800
In the modern era similar clothing pieces are worn in the leather subculture.

1003
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:38,800
Oh yeah.

1004
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:43,800
And in performance costumes such as for rock musicians and metal musicians.

1005
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:44,800
So like.

1006
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,800
Well I think of it with Batman and Rob.

1007
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,800
I feel like Batman's the main.

1008
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:49,800
Batman had a cod didn't he.

1009
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,800
Yeah you'd call that a codpiece I would say.

1010
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,560
He's got a dangler.

1011
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:57,040
There's that yeah there's that Chris O'Donnell toy that hasn't come out yet from Batman Forever

1012
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:03,400
That I Want and his codpiece is possibly the biggest I've ever seen on any person or toy.

1013
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,720
Bigger than King Henry here with his rose.

1014
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:08,240
That's why he doesn't work as much anymore.

1015
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,960
I'm going to find the picture and I'll just send it in the chat.

1016
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:11,960
That's why he doesn't.

1017
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:17,120
He's relegated to NCIS New Orleans because they're like well it's a party city so it

1018
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:19,920
makes sense for his character to always have this codpiece on.

1019
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:24,040
He has to wear a codpiece it's just like a it's actually a medical device.

1020
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:27,880
What does it do for him?

1021
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:32,680
I already helped medically but is it like are they like is there like a like a gas moving

1022
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,000
through it that's just like.

1023
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
I don't really know.

1024
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
I'm not really sure.

1025
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,240
I've never worked with them on this.

1026
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:38,240
I don't really know.

1027
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,880
I mean it'd be a cool thing to explore I think.

1028
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:44,480
They'll give you the run day if you're ever cast in something with Chris they'll give

1029
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:45,480
you the talk.

1030
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,560
Hey Johnny can you come into that office real quick.

1031
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:49,200
The UPM might talk to you.

1032
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,480
Hey we're happy to have you.

1033
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:57,080
Won't you know a little something about Chris and that you know the rest I won't say because

1034
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:58,080
I don't know what to say.

1035
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:02,360
You don't know the specifics of it but yeah but the main thing is Chris's eyes are up

1036
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:03,360
here all right.

1037
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:05,520
He is not his codpiece.

1038
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:08,400
There's a lot of room for improvisation in this scene.

1039
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,520
Whatever you do don't punch him in the dick.

1040
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:13,320
I know you are a naval deserter in this scene.

1041
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:19,000
You are deserting from the Navy and the NCIS are after you but whatever you do don't become

1042
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:23,640
so desperate that you try to punch him in the dick because you will be hurt by the codpiece.

1043
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:27,520
I wasn't going to do that but I guess I definitely will not.

1044
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:28,920
This is standard safety meeting.

1045
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:29,920
It's in the SAG.

1046
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:32,080
It's in the twenty twenty two agreement.

1047
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:35,120
And we've told people not to do it and they say they won't do it and then they still do

1048
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:36,360
it.

1049
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:37,360
So we want to make sure you're not one of those.

1050
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:38,360
OK.

1051
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:39,360
Your word is your bond.

1052
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:40,360
No I didn't come here.

1053
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:42,720
I didn't spend my entire life just to get to this moment where I could do a thing that

1054
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:46,240
I was told not to do.

1055
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,240
OK great.

1056
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:50,840
So your handle remain functional and you'll be fine.

1057
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:52,000
I sent it in the chat.

1058
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,560
So it's look I don't know that he it's actually based on his own thing.

1059
00:59:55,560 --> 01:00:00,920
I think this the toy makers got excited perhaps and decided to really like have fun with it.

1060
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:01,920
You sent us the picture.

1061
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:02,920
I don't know.

1062
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:04,120
Well Jordan the picture is in the zoom.

1063
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,560
Jordan if you can wait a second.

1064
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:09,720
Chris O'Donnell COD.

1065
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:11,520
Oh my God.

1066
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,520
Oh fuck.

1067
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:17,080
Been hiding in plain sight all these years.

1068
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:18,080
God.

1069
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,080
What's up.

1070
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:20,080
God.

1071
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:22,360
I just want to give an update.

1072
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:25,440
Chris O'Donnell is in NCIS Los Angeles.

1073
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:28,480
Scott Bakula is NCIS New Orleans.

1074
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:33,400
I like your notion that a story in the show is about capturing naval deserters.

1075
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:36,160
Well that holds water to me.

1076
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,160
It's exciting.

1077
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:38,160
It sounds good.

1078
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,560
Like military crimes I believe.

1079
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:40,560
It could be.

1080
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:43,840
I have zero idea what a plot would be on NCIS.

1081
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:44,840
Yeah.

1082
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:45,840
Jack.

1083
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:51,520
I think the original one is like well Mark Harmon is super competent and he's really

1084
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:52,520
handsome.

1085
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:55,920
Like that's his character's game.

1086
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:56,920
And he got punched in the dick.

1087
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:59,680
That's why he finally left the show.

1088
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,640
He got punched in the dick too hard.

1089
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:03,880
My dick's getting too old for this shit.

1090
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:06,560
And O'Donnell's like just listen to my voicemails.

1091
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:07,560
Call me back.

1092
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:08,560
That is.

1093
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:09,560
Okay now we're looking at it.

1094
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:10,560
Now we got it.

1095
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:11,560
This is the toy.

1096
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:12,560
Wow that is not right.

1097
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:13,560
The COD piece.

1098
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:14,560
That can't be real.

1099
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:15,560
That's insane.

1100
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:16,560
The movie wasn't like that.

1101
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:17,560
It's like a thrusting outline.

1102
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:18,560
That's what I'm saying.

1103
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:19,560
Like a movie didn't look like that.

1104
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:20,560
That's ridiculous.

1105
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:25,600
It's even got like a sort of webbing that indicates it's under stress.

1106
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:26,600
The fabric is being.

1107
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:27,600
You know what I mean?

1108
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,600
Like it wasn't designed to.

1109
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:29,600
Being pushed to its limit.

1110
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:31,560
It feels like plastic to me.

1111
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:34,960
And even the plastic is like we're breaking down here.

1112
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,480
Because the Batman one is more like a shell.

1113
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:38,720
Like a protective thing.

1114
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:40,360
This appears to be.

1115
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:42,040
Yeah that's a protective.

1116
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:45,520
That's a protective thing to protect Batman's balls.

1117
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:48,440
Kind of makes sense with the way the legs are sculpted.

1118
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:49,440
You can see veins.

1119
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:52,560
If you squint enough you're seeing a bonobo monkey right now.

1120
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:55,240
Kind of with the red nose right?

1121
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:58,840
Or instead of bonobo whatever that one's called with the red nose.

1122
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:00,560
It's that monkey that has the big ol.

1123
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:01,560
A proboscis monkey.

1124
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:02,560
It looks like that.

1125
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:03,560
Whoa what a pull.

1126
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:05,800
It's like a Snickers bar.

1127
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:08,080
It's got the caramel dick veins on it.

1128
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:09,080
It's not.

1129
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:12,320
Batman's codpiece is playing defense and this is playing offense.

1130
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,400
This is like facing forward.

1131
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:15,400
If he lines.

1132
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,400
If he jumps.

1133
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,360
Like jumps at the penguin.

1134
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,120
He could poke his eyes out on the way.

1135
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:23,720
I think Ace and Gary are less sexual than this.

1136
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:24,720
I think so yes.

1137
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:27,840
They didn't push it far enough.

1138
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:30,280
The company that makes this is called Hot Toys.

1139
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,280
Oh well.

1140
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:32,280
Well.

1141
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:34,680
Takes on a different meaning now.

1142
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:35,680
You could.

1143
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:39,440
Yeah this would be in the dragon's lair no problem.

1144
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,040
Mike you have to let.

1145
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,040
Are you getting this?

1146
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:44,520
Is this going to be in your home soon?

1147
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:45,600
It's not out yet.

1148
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:49,000
I haven't pre-ordered it.

1149
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,920
If I get it obviously the first people that will know is the podcast the right audience.

1150
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:53,920
That's what I was going to say.

1151
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:59,640
As soon as it is available please bring it to a video version of the show.

1152
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:03,980
And then I don't want to say where it should go in your apartment but you know I love that

1153
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:06,940
Leonardo with the big dick tail.

1154
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:12,720
I just think you put these right next to each other.

1155
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:13,920
Touching you want their dicks to touch.

1156
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,480
That's exactly what I want.

1157
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:19,040
And then I want to see photographic proof of it and then also keep your daughter out

1158
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:20,040
of there.

1159
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:23,680
Yeah no she should not be exposed to this film.

1160
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:25,440
Robin's a rogue.

1161
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:27,920
Yeah he's a rogue.

1162
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:32,440
And Mike so you moved recently so you might still have some flex space that you haven't

1163
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,320
decided what to do with yet.

1164
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:39,720
It sounds like you need to make it an in-home dragon's lair.

1165
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:40,720
For dildos?

1166
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:43,320
Well for your filth toys.

1167
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:46,480
For my toys that have prominent dicks.

1168
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:50,720
Yeah sweetie and remember honey you're not allowed to go to the dragon's lair until you're

1169
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:55,720
much much older and we have a talk with you about dragon's lairs.

1170
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:58,280
The dragon's lair.

1171
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:03,120
Again it's funny to say this but I think like the level of body in this of a lot of the

1172
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:07,320
shows and the Pennsylvania website does like there are icons where it's like this is a

1173
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:10,040
PG-13 show or like this is a.

1174
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:11,040
Oh yeah.

1175
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:13,320
Plus PG-13 plus like avoid the kids.

1176
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:16,320
Like I think you can take families to the Renaissance Fair.

1177
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:20,280
It's just maybe now and then you have to go like oh hey we're not going that way.

1178
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:24,600
It's a more natural form of sexuality.

1179
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:30,240
It's not like a junior at the computer finding something and all of a sudden he can't unsee.

1180
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,600
It's everyone's around you can discuss it.

1181
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:33,600
It's out in the open.

1182
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:34,600
Sure.

1183
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:38,960
It's a more like you know it's a more like old school version of it.

1184
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:44,080
It seems less if it's something that's outside it's in the air it's daytime it's less like

1185
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,080
you know what it's not.

1186
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:47,080
Shameful.

1187
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:48,080
Yeah it's not shameful.

1188
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:49,080
La Civie.

1189
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:54,760
It's not this thing where it appears to be dark and vicey it's more fun and maybe maybe

1190
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:58,960
it's titillating but it's kind of it's OK to embrace your sexuality a bit as opposed

1191
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:02,400
to having to hide it and to be.

1192
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:03,400
Yeah I don't know.

1193
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:09,760
I've just all of a sudden got very like philosophical with this whole thing.

1194
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:14,520
There's no like step mother father siblings business going on.

1195
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:16,520
There's no Ted Cruz likes.

1196
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:17,520
Yeah.

1197
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:18,520
Twitter likes business going on here.

1198
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:21,920
You're just saying porno mother daughter porno stuff.

1199
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:22,920
Huh.

1200
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:25,760
That was a confused that was an interesting pile of words.

1201
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:28,480
Were you saying step like you were saying like porno scenarios.

1202
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:34,400
Yeah yeah there's no step there's no step business going on there's no Dean Norris sex

1203
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,400
gifts going on.

1204
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:36,400
Dean Norris.

1205
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:43,080
The characters are the characters of the Renaissance Fair are talking about like my step sister.

1206
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:44,240
Which is which.

1207
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:45,680
What did what was Ted Cruz.

1208
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:46,680
What's the truth.

1209
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:51,200
Ted Cruz liked and then what a Dean Norris someone on Ted Cruz's staff liked like a gift

1210
01:05:51,200 --> 01:06:00,000
from like a step sibling like Johnny's in porno movie and then Dean Norris just attempting

1211
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,560
to Google tweeted the phrase sex gifts.

1212
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:05,800
Oh my God.

1213
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:09,400
Much respect to never deleted it.

1214
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:10,400
That is awesome.

1215
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,400
Yeah that is great.

1216
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:13,720
He saw the humor in it.

1217
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:14,720
Yeah yeah yeah.

1218
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:19,400
I think there has to be some sort of something to invent a thing for as you get older that

1219
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:22,920
limits your ability to interact with technology so things like that can't happen.

1220
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:25,400
It's going to happen to everybody if you don't stay.

1221
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:30,160
If you're not super techie and current you're going to misstep when you're trying to use

1222
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:32,040
a thing you don't know that well.

1223
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:35,240
Next thing you know you're tweeting out sex gifts.

1224
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:38,520
Well it's either even not like a child lock or child.

1225
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:39,880
It's a grandpa lock basically.

1226
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:46,200
It needs to be a grandpa lock on things where you just you can't have access unless someone

1227
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:51,480
in your inner circle is with you showing you like OK so if you want to see the stuff that

1228
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:52,480
we know you want to see.

1229
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,480
I'm not asking questions.

1230
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:57,720
You have to be really open minded with your parent or grandparents.

1231
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:58,720
Right.

1232
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:02,000
Don't judge them in any way but just like a discussion before you want to see Marina

1233
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,360
search is naked.

1234
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:08,080
This is a this is called Firefox focus.

1235
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:09,080
It's a browser.

1236
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:12,680
It's always in private mode and it only opens one website at a time.

1237
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:13,680
Yes.

1238
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:14,680
You're not logged in anything.

1239
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:16,680
It won't leave you logged into anything.

1240
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:18,880
That would be great actually.

1241
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:19,880
That'd be pretty good.

1242
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:21,600
This is a good business idea.

1243
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:22,960
Maybe something to file away.

1244
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:25,760
Hi I'm Marina searches.

1249

Yeah this is yeah this is the audience.

1255
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:03,480
Wait let me admit that I don't.

1256
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,240
I've liked the sound of it in the reference.

1257
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:08,680
Oh but I actually talked about counselor Deanna Troy from Star Trek.

1258
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,160
Oh OK OK.

1259
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:14,800

01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:15,800
Scott Wow.

1261

She was.

1263
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,840
I didn't know that I used to love that show.

1264
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:21,840
Hmm.

1265
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:22,840
She's like she's the Mona.

1266
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:23,840
She's gargoyle.

1267
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:24,840
Wow.

1268
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:25,840
Antihero gargoyle.

01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:26,840
Is that right.

1270
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:29,840
She's like the main female gargoyle.

01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:35,440

Don't start down that rabbit hole or you might never come out.

1274
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:39,440
That's there.

1275
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:41,440
Yeah that is for sure there.

1276
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:42,440
Yeah.

1277
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:43,440
Well I'm looking at these results.

1278
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:46,440
There's guys at Patreons probably who have that like what do you do.

1279
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:51,440
I do gargoyles gargoyles porn you know gargoyles.

1280
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:54,440

01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:55,440
Oh yeah.

1282
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:57,440
Yeah and not a set.

1283
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:58,440
Yes.

1284
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:00,440
Jordan did not pull up a sex gift of her.

1285
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:03,440
That would not be proper for the forever dog YouTube channel.

1286
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:04,440
Red carpet photo.

1287
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:06,440

Everyone in Star Trek Next Generation I'm a massive fan of.

1290
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:12,440
I would not disrespect any of them.

1291
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:13,440
Michael Dorn.

1292
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:14,440
Gates McFadden.

1293
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:15,440
None of them deserve.

1294
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:18,440
Gates McFadden does not deserve that.

1295
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:23,440
Jonathan Frakes.

1296
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:26,440
Also on gargoyles the bad like the bad guy on gargoyles.

1297
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:27,440
Oh yeah.

1298
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:28,440
Yes.

1299
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:32,440
I mean I was at a meet there and Gene Roddenberry was just like hey I like this show a lot.

1300
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:34,440
I'm just gonna steal the cast.

1301
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:35,440
Not Gene Roddenberry.

1302
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:37,440
Who's the EP for next gen.

1303
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:38,440
The later one.

1304
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:39,440
Do you know?

1305
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:40,440
Yeah.

1306
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:44,440
Well gargoyles is like 95 and Gene Roddenberry dies in like 90.

1307
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:45,440
Okay so it was not.

1308
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:46,440
It was not.

1309
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:50,440
So gargoyles they met on Trek and they went on to work on gargoyles together.

1310
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:51,440
I get it.

1311
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:52,440
But now you know.

1312
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:56,440
Look up that show and you're essentially getting extra Star Trek Next Gen.

1313
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:57,440
Damn.

1314
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:58,440
Some bounding.

1315
01:09:58,440 --> 01:09:59,440
Sexy gargoyles.

1316
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:00,440
What's it called?

1317
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:01,440
Shipping?

1318
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:02,440
Is that what they call it?

1319
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:03,440
Oh yeah I guess so.

1320
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:04,440
Yeah yeah.

1321
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:10,440
If you've ever wanted your favorite Star Trek characters to be gargoyles first of all.

1322
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:12,440
A little Riker Troy shipping.

1323
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:13,440
Not really.

1324
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:17,440
But not really needed because they're together so you don't need to ship.

1325
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:18,440
They've been shipped.

1326
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:20,440
Oh shipping is if they aren't together.

1327
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:21,440
Yeah yeah.

1328
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:22,440
Got it.

1329
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:24,440
That's like Diva and Chitara.

1330
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:26,440
Yeah yeah yeah.

1331
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:29,440
Or like you would ship Data and Troy.

1332
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:31,440
I thought it was like different shows.

1333
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:37,440
Like you take like Tracer from Overwatch and have a scene with.

1334
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:39,440
I think that is allowed.

1335
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:40,440
I think that is.

1336
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:41,440
There's a lot of umbrella.

1337
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:42,440
I think that falls under the same.

1338
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:43,440
Yeah.

1339
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:44,440
Well let me.

1340
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:45,440
Jurisdiction.

1341
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:46,440
Can I.

1342
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:48,440
Then I'd like to ship.

1343
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:53,440
Let's say Ed Asner's character from Gargoyles Hudson.

1344
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:54,440
Okay.

1345
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:58,440
With Mark Harmon's character from NCIS.

1346
01:10:58,440 --> 01:10:59,440
Okay.

1347
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:00,440
Put those together.

1348
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:01,440
Okay yeah.

1349
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:02,440
That's great.

1350
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:04,440
In a sexy New Orleans type setting.

1351
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:10,440
Like I really like they've had a bunch of Sazeracs and now they're going back to his place in the French Quarter.

1352
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:17,440
And it's the place where Hudson is a gargoyle on the building.

1353
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:18,440
Okay.

1354
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:19,440
So like it's you know.

1355
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,440
Oh he lives in an old building that has a gargoyle.

1356
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:22,440
Yeah yeah.

1357
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:23,440
Full moon.

1358
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:24,440
I can't get into this.

1359
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:26,440
I can't get into this for free.

1360
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:27,440
That will be on the.

1361
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:28,440
Yeah.

1362
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:29,440
We'll start.

1363
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:32,440
Yeah we'll do all of our fan fiction shipping behind a paywall.

1364
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:35,440
Before we wind it today here let me just do some like quick hits of stuff we have.

1365
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:37,440
Let me see if you have experience with these.

1366
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:41,440
Do you like these big parts of your rent fare experience.

1367
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:43,440
We haven't talked jousting.

1368
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:45,440
You watch joust.

1369
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:50,440
Yeah I thought the joust is the what do you call it like the most obvious thing.

1370
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:53,440
It's the it's the kind of part of the big finale.

1371
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:54,440
Yeah it's crowd pleaser.

1372
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:57,440
It's also kind of the normy part of the rent fare.

1373
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:58,440
Sure.

1374
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:00,440
So you take your kids take the whole family down to joust.

1375
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:03,440
It's always crowded and that's where you go.

1376
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:06,440
It's fun but it's also to me it's the normy part of it.

1377
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:09,440
Like you see it once you've seen it enough.

1378
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:10,440
Sure.

1379
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:11,440
Yeah yeah.

1380
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:12,440
You got that's interesting.

1381
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:19,440
I think it's interesting that there are rides at rent fare but not electric powered rides.

1382
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:22,440
All the rides are like pushed around by somebody.

1383
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:25,440
I saw Adrian Grenier on a swing one time.

1384
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:26,440
That was cool.

1385
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:27,440
Wow.

1386
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:28,440
Wow.

1387
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:29,440
That's pretty good.

1388
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:33,440
Yeah you get on like a big big rocking horse a giant rocking horse.

1389
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:34,440
That seems like fun.

1390
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:35,440
Yeah.

1391
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:36,440
You get in a big maze.

1392
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:39,440
I don't think we ever talked about big mazes on this show.

1393
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:40,440
Oh that's a good one.

1394
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:41,440
I kind of like a big maze.

1395
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:43,440
These mazes aren't super big though.

1396
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,440
The ones at least in my experience they're not huge mazes.

1397
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:50,440
It's not like the big mazes are attraction themselves right.

1398
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:53,440
This is more just like a it's more for kids I think.

1399
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:54,440
OK OK.

1400
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:59,440
I think you set up hay bales and you make a maze as opposed to like a pre-built hedge

1401
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:00,440
maze.

1402
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:01,440
Oh sure.

1403
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:02,440
Yeah yeah.

1404
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:03,440
Hedges.

1405
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:04,440
That's too much.

1406
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:05,440
You like put one of those up permanently and then that stays.

1407
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:06,440
Yeah.

1408
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:07,440
Yeah yeah.

1409
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:08,440
You die in it in the snow.

1410
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:09,440
Yes.

1411
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:12,440
I think terrorized your family.

1412
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:13,440
Yes.

1413
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:17,440
Hey I feel like we got to talk about maypoles real quick because I just feel like Jason

1414
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:18,440
would like a maypole.

1415
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:23,440
I mean I can't remember if I've ever done a maypole but I like the concept just ribbons

1416
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:28,440
off a pole and you you everyone runs around it and you wrap the ribbon around the pole

1417
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:30,440
and then you do it all over again.

1418
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:31,440
You got to do a maypole.

1419
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:32,440
I've never done it.

1420
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:35,440
I've never been there in time to participate but they do it all the time.

1421
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:37,440
It's a giant line.

1422
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:40,440
You got to get there five in the morning to do the maypole.

1423
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:42,440
That's very family friendly.

1424
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:44,440
A lightning lane for a maypole.

1425
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:45,440
You got to pay extra.

1426
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:50,440
It's the rise of the resistance of the renaissance pleasure fair.

1427
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:53,440
I drinks there.

1428
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,440
Well first of all what's going on with mead.

1429
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:56,440
We got we got mead happening.

1430
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:57,440
Is mead any good.

1431
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:58,440
It's kind of sweet.

1432
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:01,440
It's honey wine basically.

1433
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:02,440
It's slow fermented honey wine.

1434
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:03,440
I don't like it.

1435
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:04,440
It's too sweet for me.

1436
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,440
Yeah it doesn't sound like it would.

1437
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:08,440
But you know people like it because it's of the time.

1438
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:10,440
It's very it's such.

1439
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:12,440
I think it's the oldest fermented beverage maybe.

1440
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:13,440
It might be.

1441
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:14,440
Sounds right.

1442
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:15,440
It's before beer.

1443
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:16,440
Right.

1444
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:18,440
So what are you drinking then usually?

1445
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:21,440
I'm drinking a lot of usually a lot of just beers.

1446
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:26,440
I'm drinking a lot of let's say I have craft brew now so you get a higher ABV.

1447
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:28,440
If you really want to get blitzed.

1448
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:33,440
Just get real slacked so you're just dragging your foot around there you know what I mean.

1449
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:34,440
Just real.

1450
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:35,440
Yeah.

1451
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:39,440
Real inebriated to the point where you feel totally unencumbered from saying literally anything.

1452
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:40,440
Of the period.

1453
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:41,440
Yes.

1454
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:42,440
You know.

1455
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:43,440
Ye old double IPA.

1456
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:44,440
Yeah.

1457
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:47,440
Ye old double IPA from Goose Island.

1458
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:55,440
But back then Goose Island was just an island that was terrorized by geese.

1459
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:57,440
People you could never go there.

1460
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:59,440
Beware Goose Island.

1461
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:01,440
That's not our kingdom anymore.

1462
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:02,440
That belongs to the geese.

1463
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:04,440
You want to be goose food?

1464
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:05,440
Are you crazy?

1465
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:06,440
Yeah.

1466
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:11,440
Scott I was telling you before we started recording the day I was there the day me and

1467
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:18,440
like 50 seventh graders were just unleashed on our own to like all right just have a buddy.

1468
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:22,440
You can run around all you want just don't do it alone.

1469
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:32,440
I ate a turkey leg and then they gave us like refillable cups at the fair and just all day

1470
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:34,440
for eight hours only drank Coca-Cola.

1471
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:41,440
So this was like the the field trip that I left feeling like I am dying.

1472
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:43,440
Something has gone wrong.

1473
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:47,440
And I so and of course it wasn't it was just a yellow school bus.

1474
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:51,440
And I'm like we're so many hours away from the middle school.

1475
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:52,440
How will I live?

1476
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:54,440
And I looked it up.

1477
01:15:54,440 --> 01:16:00,440
I looked at the Google Maps and from the Renaissance fair to my school was an hour and 10 minutes.

1478
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:09,440
So I was in such a state I was just like that that was probably when I learned like OK if you go to

1479
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:14,440
Renaissance fair you go to theme park because these are essentially very so like pop-up theme parks

1480
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:17,440
for like two three four months of a year.

1481
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:19,440
I need to drink a lot of water.

1482
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:20,440
Yeah.

1483
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:22,440
Because a lot of that would have helped this situation.

1484
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:25,440
I mean what I think this would have helped I would have felt better.

1485
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:26,440
Yeah.

1486
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:32,440
The peak would not have been resolved but I would not have felt like shit from that much corn syrup and caffeine.

1487
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:36,440
Would it have been would it be justified to wear a diaper.

1488
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:39,440
Such as I don't think you wore diapers back then.

1489
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:40,440
I definitely did.

1490
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:41,440
Yeah probably.

1491
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:44,440
Yeah I think it's almost you can piss yourself there.

1492
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:47,440
I think it's one of the few places you can piss yourself and it's not a big deal.

1493
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:48,440
Geez.

1494
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:49,440
It's really not.

1495
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:54,440
That's that hippie idea to not be judged for your clothes being soaked in urine.

1496
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:55,440
You could also probably sell it.

1497
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:59,440
You could be like I'm the bad man of the town.

1498
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:02,440
I'm the piss man.

1499
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:04,440
Or just say it's pickle brine.

1500
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:05,440
Give me a hug.

1501
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:07,440
I'm the piss man.

1502
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:08,440
We gotta hug the piss.

1503
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:10,440
We came all this way we can't not hug the piss man.

1504
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:11,440
Oh honey look it's the piss man.

1505
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:13,440
I got some of his piss on me.

1506
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:17,440
He ran out of snake oil and just started selling piss.

1507
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:21,440
Is that Jason Mraz playing the piss man.

1508
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:24,440
I was the piss man for a little bit then I was the pickle man.

1509
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:25,440
I upgraded to the pickle man.

1510
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:26,440
Wait a minute.

1511
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:28,440
Is the remedy piss?

1512
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:31,440
Has this whole time the remedy?

1513
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:33,440
The remedy is the experience.

1514
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,440
The serious is the dangerous liaison.

1515
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:38,440
The liaison is you in a toilet.

1516
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:40,440
Yeah we all know the lyrics to the remedy Jason.

1517
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:41,440
Yeah.

1518
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:45,440
I'm surprised you do.

1519
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:51,440
I have one more little thing before we wind it down.

1520
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:52,440
Is it the dunk tank?

1521
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:53,440
Oh wait we haven't talked about that.

1522
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:56,440
I've seen the phrase drench a wench.

1523
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:59,440
Oh my god I have drenched that wench every time I've gone.

1524
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:00,440
I'll do it two or three times.

1525
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:01,440
Wow.

1526
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,440
And I'm like deadly accurate too.

1527
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:04,440
Jeez really.

1528
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:05,440
Wait what are you throwing?

1529
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:11,440
These little like kind of like it's like if you go to a batting cage it's like a softball from a batting cage.

1530
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:13,440
But I have I have drenched this wench.

1531
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:15,440
She insults you like crazy.

1532
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:17,440
She will be very very mean.

1533
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:18,440
She will insult your manhood.

1534
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:24,440
She'll insult like if you're with a significant other she'll insult that person all kinds of stuff.

1535
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:29,440
And I have hit I have dunked that wench right in the middle of an insult.

1536
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:36,440
That's something that feels better in the entire world than drenching a wench right when she's saying she's mouthing off and you just dunk her.

1537
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:37,440
Wow.

1538
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:38,440
Wow.

1539
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:39,440
In the midst of sailing.

1540
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:42,440
Oh you and your little your little cut.

1541
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:44,440
Oh really.

1542
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:45,440
Jeez.

1543
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:49,440
She doesn't even get out the full thing that mouth floods with water and then that.

1544
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:51,440
That's only happened one time I had the perfect timing.

1545
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:57,440
But you must really feel that like because they also if you're if you're high in trend then you're probably like the emotions are stronger too.

1546
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:01,440
So like that rage like you feel it go into your your hand.

1547
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:05,440
This is usually early on it's kind of early in the fair so I'm probably pretty sober at that point.

1548
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:07,440
OK. Oh you hit that one on the early.

1549
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:08,440
Yeah.

1550
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:09,440
Well for accuracy I guess.

1551
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:10,440
Yes.

1552
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:12,440
Yeah. You don't want to be throwing willy nilly.

1553
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:19,440
We would have dunk tanks at like fundraising school fairs and stuff and like teachers or principals would like rotate through doing it.

1554
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:23,440
And I always liked and got along with most of my teachers and the principals and stuff.

1555
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:26,440
But when I saw them at the dunk tack I was like I want to I want to get them.

1556
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:27,440
Oh yeah.

1557
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:29,440
I would have dunked them in the water.

1558
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:30,440
It's a primitive thing.

1559
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:31,440
You just want to drench.

1560
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:32,440
Yeah.

1561
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:34,440
You're allowed you're allowed to like.

1562
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:35,440
Yeah.

1563
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:38,440
Own someone you know just really get it.

1564
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:40,440
Sorry Mr. Salvatore.

1565
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:43,440
That polo is getting drenched.

1566
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:44,440
Did you dunk Mr. Salvatore.

1567
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:46,440
I think so.

1568
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:51,440
I am not the most accurate throw but I was always pretty good at dunk tanks.

1569
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:52,440
Oh it's the best.

1570
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:57,440
It's something we should maybe offer to the listeners possibly is like if you want.

1571
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:01,440
So we've had our you know we had our gripe situation complain at us that way.

1572
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:02,440
But splash the Scott.

1573
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:03,440
Sure.

1574
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:04,440
Yeah.

1575
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:05,440
Oh yeah.

1576
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:06,440
Uh huh.

1577
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:09,440
Oh it's hard to think of them for the other.

1578
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:11,440
This is not splash.

1579
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:12,440
Wait wait.

1580
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:13,440
We'll splash the Sheridan works.

1581
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:14,440
That works.

1582
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:15,440
Yeah.

1583
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:16,440
Yeah.

1584
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:17,440
Um.

1585
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:18,440
So.

1586
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:19,440
You got soaked.

1587
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:20,440
You got drenched.

1588
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:21,440
You got wet.

1589
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:22,440
Mm hmm.

1590
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:23,440
You got splashed.

1591
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:24,440
Michael.

1592
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:25,440
Yeah.

1593
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:26,440
Get what get Mike Brown.

1594
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:27,440
Drown Michael.

1595
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:28,440
Drown Michael.

1596
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:31,440
Somebody a listener really hates you if that's the.

1597
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:32,440
I guess that's true.

1598
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:33,440
Yeah.

1599
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:37,200
But you know like instead of just complaining at us if we get stuff wrong give if we gave

1600
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:42,440
people an opportunity to like you think you know everything about I love Lucy you motherfuckers.

1601
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:45,440
Those years were all over the map.

1602
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:46,440
Bang.

1603
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:47,440
Drowned.

1604
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:49,440
And then you then you don't know everything about Marina Surtis.

1605
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:50,440
You faker.

1606
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:51,440
You liar.

1607
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:52,440
Oh I do.

1608
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:53,440
No I do.

1609
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:54,440
All right.

1610
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:56,440
I.

1611
01:20:56,440 --> 01:21:01,000
One thing I saw on the Pennsylvania website that I really like they listed all the vendors

1612
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,840
and it's so like specific.

1613
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:04,360
There's so much cool stuff you can buy.

1614
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:08,080
There's so many craftsmen employed like in selling their wares and stuff.

1615
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:14,040
But the list was like swords.

1616
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:16,740
You know candles homemade longbows.

1617
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:22,840
And then there was just a little icon that just said cheese steaks.

1618
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:28,680
And for all the language there are a lot of comforts of the modern.

1619
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:35,120
There are like there are ATM scattered throughout the fair and in the wine shop.

1620
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:39,720
It was mostly cash though as surprise but they're like OK you can go in and with a credit

1621
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:45,160
card that you know there's all those like if you have cash converted to a debit card

1622
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:46,280
this was the opposite.

1623
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:52,200
If you have a credit card you can buy coins that you can use for goods and services at

1624
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:54,720
the fair or just take one home as a souvenir.

1625
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:57,120
And I thought that was a really clever way to do it.

1626
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:58,120
Yeah.

1627
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:03,200
And they're like oh if change is required we will just give you change in regular legal

1628
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:04,200
tender.

1629
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:05,200
OK.

1630
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:06,200
They don't have every increment of coin.

1631
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:08,640
I can't believe how good the pen of Pennsylvania one is.

1632
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:09,640
I didn't realize that.

1633
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:10,640
It sounds really solid.

1634
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:11,640
Yeah.

1635
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:12,640
Seems like a strong one.

1636
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:17,280
A quick quick thing before we wind down.

1637
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:19,080
Here's somebody you might want to drench.

1638
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:20,080
This is Jordan.

1639
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:25,080
Can you pull up the one that the clip that has the words January 6th.

1640
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:26,080
Oh yeah.

1641
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:28,200
I'm happy to bring those words in.

1642
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:29,200
What's that mean.

1643
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:31,200
I don't know if you know.

1644
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:35,280
Oh it's a topsy turvy day from the hunchback of Notre Dame.

1645
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:36,280
That's true.

1646
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:37,280
That is a bizarre thing that that is true.

1647
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:38,280
All right.

1648
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:42,560
Let's let's see this.

1649
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:48,000
A woman from Pennsylvania accused of stealing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's laptop during

1650
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:53,400
the January 6th riot will be allowed off of house arrest this weekend to go to the Pennsylvania

1651
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:54,400
Renaissance Fair.

1652
01:22:54,400 --> 01:23:00,640
Again Riley Williams of Central PA had asked a judge to let her go to the fair this Saturday.

1653
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:05,560
The judge granted that request today making this her second trip to the fair while on

1654
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:06,920
home confinement.

1655
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:09,440
She was allowed to go last month as well.

1656
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:15,760
Honestly I heard about this and I support this and I love this woman despite everything

1657
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:17,240
that she has done.

1658
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:21,160
I feel like this is like this is the jewel of a human.

1659
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:22,160
You know what I mean.

1660
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:25,640
There's something there's this dichotomy going on there.

1661
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:28,560
Ren Fair and insurrection meet.

1662
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:29,560
Yeah.

1663
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:30,560
And a person.

1664
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:31,960
It's just like this is it's too good.

1665
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:34,120
It's almost like how is that a real story.

1666
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:35,240
It's so good.

1667
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:40,440
Your honor my client is not Mr. Ren Fair in 20 years and the first time she went the mermaid

1668
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:45,320
tank wasn't ready but now it is open.

1669
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:47,120
She's got blogs to make your honor.

1670
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:51,040
You expect her to not partake in the bountiful cheese steaks.

1671
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:57,880
Yeah there are a lot of videos like video full videos of shows videos of like what's

1672
01:23:57,880 --> 01:23:59,200
new at the Renaissance Fair.

1673
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:03,480
There is a lot of crossover with like theme park vlogging stuff of like here's what's

1674
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:05,480
new here's what's the best.

1675
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:09,600
Like secrets and she'd probably make the best one of all of them and we don't want to give

1676
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,320
her a we don't want to give her a shot.

1677
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:13,200
We know that she's a dynamo.

1678
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:15,480
She's the one who made it in there and got the laptop.

1679
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:21,160
I think she should probably be in the military and she's got what it takes to be a leader

1680
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:22,160
in the military.

1681
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:23,160
Well she's right.

1682
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:28,260
She got into the capital and she got out of she broke out of house arrest with everyone

1683
01:24:28,260 --> 01:24:33,120
what legally to go to clear to go to the past.

1684
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:34,320
This is just too good.

1685
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:36,520
It's just like this is so good.

1686
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:38,480
It's like a perfect story.

1687
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:39,720
Basically you're in love.

1688
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:40,720
Did she bring.

1689
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:42,440
Did she bring the laptop to the fair.

1690
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:44,800
Ye old pilfered goods.

1691
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,440
She get on the podcast.

1692
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:47,000
Yeah sure.

1693
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:47,520
Yeah.

1694
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:50,040
She could stand her house arrest.

1695
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:53,480
But obviously as with you Johnny in person it's you know it's it's better it's more

1696
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:54,320
organic it's more fun.

1697
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:55,320
So we're going to want to.

1698
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:56,240
Well let's start.

1699
01:24:56,240 --> 01:25:01,680
We'll file an appeal and see if we can get I don't remember her name but we'll know it

1700
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:04,480
and cherish it soon enough.

1701
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:08,120
Yeah just add her to the pile of all the different January 6 people we've tried to get on the

1702
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:09,120
podcast.

1703
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:12,040
They're just they're they're too in demand.

1704
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:13,040
Yeah.

1705
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:14,040
We were right out.

1706
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:16,400
They just kept saying I don't need to tell you that.

1707
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:18,120
Am I being detained.

1708
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:22,760
Is it possible that the insurrection was sort of a pop up theme park.

1709
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:23,760
Wow.

1710
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:24,760
Wow.

1711
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:29,920
Well it was it was a themed experience like you know the boring capital got rethemed for

1712
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:30,920
a day.

1713
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:34,680
It's like it's Viking Day in the capital.

1714
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:35,680
Yeah.

1715
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:36,680
There's a lot of lore.

1716
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:38,760
There's a lot of exhausting canon.

1717
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:39,760
Yeah.

1718
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:43,560
It's a lot of people who live in fantasy worlds.

1719
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:46,280
Yeah that's well that's really what it is.

1720
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:52,040
The people who've the who are the most the biggest hardliners are the people who've gone

1721
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:55,120
a full insurrection mode.

1722
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:58,280
Mike and I'm waiting in an 80 hour line.

1723
01:25:58,280 --> 01:26:01,120
We want a chance to buy that laptop.

1724
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:02,920
It's very similar if you think about it.

1725
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:05,000
It's got to there's definitely got to be a crossover.

1726
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:10,280
It's a full time cosplay that you're you forgot is a cosplay.

1727
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:11,280
Mm hmm.

1728
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:12,280
God.

1729
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:13,280
Yeah.

1730
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:14,280
That you never come back from.

1731
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:21,040
Also Nancy Nancy Pelosi's laptop is still using an unsupported version of Internet Explorer

1732
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:26,600
with six different search tat those search bars that would just add themselves to your

1733
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:29,040
browser back in the day.

1734
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:34,560
It makes it harder to buy like child blood on the black market when when you've got all

1735
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:35,560
those pop up.

1736
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:36,560
Yes.

1737
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:45,240
And you have not renewed Norton antivirus 2005 but it is still prompting you to.

1738
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:47,080
Well look I'm sorry we didn't.

1739
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:51,680
If I'd known I would have gotten her today to be here to be at the fourth microphone.

1740
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:54,200
But unfortunately hey it was still great to talk to.

1741
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:55,200
It's great to you minus.

1742
01:26:55,200 --> 01:27:00,800
Glad to be here in her stead.

1743
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:02,160
Well yes so happy you could.

1744
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:05,360

Let's exit through.

1750
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:12,960
Let's exit through the the the Dragon's Lair.

1751
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:15,120
Is there anything you'd like to plug.

1752
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:19,520
You know I guess I just Google me and whatever you whatever comes up you can engage with

1753
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:20,520
it how you will.

1754
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:26,840
You can choose to listen to my podcast or you can also you can just like look at photos.

1755
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:27,840
Just kind of ugly.

1756
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:28,840
Yeah.

1757
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:29,840
I admire you.

1758
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:30,840
Do that.

1759
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:35,720
I do watch you can purchase films I've done in the past.

1760
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:38,060
Maybe purchase them a couple of times or watch them on direct TV.

1761
01:27:38,060 --> 01:27:39,520
I don't know something like that.

1762
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:40,520
Okay.

1763
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:44,600
Do all those things you could find information of when films you've been in will write on

1764
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:46,640
direct TV and on what channel.

1765
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:50,280
I pay the three hundred dollar license for a getty image photo.

1766
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:51,280
Yes that would be great.

1767
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:54,280
Actually I don't think I get any of that but.

1768
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:58,400
Here's one I don't know if this is a purchasable one or if this is just this one's for free.

1769
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:00,240
These are all these are all getting right.

1770
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:02,280
I love looking at my face on this.

1771
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:03,280
This feels so great.

1772
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:04,280
A big TV.

1773
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:05,280
Yes wonderful pixelated.

1774
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:09,880
You know interact with these interact with these photos you know doctor them make them

1775
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:13,080
look like they're from the Renaissance.

1776
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:14,080
Go for it.

1777
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:17,080
Give you funny mustaches and turn them into a shirtless pickle man.

1778
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:18,080
Exactly.

1779
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:21,040
I you know what I think that's in the spirit of the Renaissance where you're essentially

1780
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:23,640
saying like gay cut loose.

1781
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:27,760
You explore my body of work at your own pace.

01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:30,880
No regulations.

1784
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:31,880
Yeah.
