1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,040
Warning, the following podcast is the final installment of our Las Vegas month.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:16,080
It contains garbage fans, efficient firefighters, Rich Littles personal YouTube videos, and magic

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,120
set to new metal.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:23,680
Get ready to have your mind free as Jason Wollner returns to talk Chris Angel's A Mystica on

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:44,800
Sin City Nights.

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,200
Welcome to the last Podcast the Ride Sin City Nights.

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,240
The final penny in the little shop of horrors penny slot.

10
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,440
Audrey too will grow no more.

11
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,640
Sadly, I'm Scott Garrett and you're Jason Sheridan.

12
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,520
I'm out here in the desert digging my grave.

13
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,560
Boy, things really.

14
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,240
How much money do you owe that the little shop of horrors penny slot?

15
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,160
My Carlson fellow host has a weapon pointed at me, you know, just like the end of it,

16
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,800
just like the one scene in Casino.

17
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,240
I'm about to finally do it.

18
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,360
We're about to make a new haunted casino property blossom or haunted a stadium.

19
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,320
So you're saying I'm about to kill you, bury your body in the desert and then build a casino

20
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,560
on top of you.

21
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,560
So it's haunted.

22
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,360
So it's haunted like the Luxor.

23
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,040
So as you can see, things took a turn.

24
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,880
Sin City Nights was a bad idea.

25
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,880
It destroyed the podcast, destroyed everything.

26
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,360
Can you imagine the people when they go to this hotel and they're like, well, there was

27
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,360
this ghost, but he was just sleeping in our bed all day.

28
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,120
Like he was haunting us, but it was really, he was just kind of like lazing around.

29
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,120
That's Jason's ghost.

30
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,120
Yeah, yeah.

31
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,520
He turned King of Queens on the TV and he's been watching a six hour block.

32
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,520
He started smiling.

33
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,520
Yeah.

34
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,400
He said, don't disturb my slumber and put ghostly earplugs in.

35
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,400
Yeah.

36
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,400
So that would be nice.

37
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,400
That would be like a real novelty, I feel like.

38
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,400
Well, look at that.

39
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,960
You got the story in.

40
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,000
I knew we wouldn't escape the month without the retelling of Jason.

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,280
Yeah, but it was in a different context.

42
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,480
So was the ghost context did add something to it.

43
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,480
That's right.

44
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,320
Hey, well, we're here.

45
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,160
We're wrapping it up and before we shoot Jason in the head, we're going to have a little

46
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,720
bit of fun on the way out.

47
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,720
We've done a lot.

48
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,240
We've done so much in this series.

49
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,560
We've talked 90s Vegas.

50
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,120
We've talked modern Vegas.

51
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,380
We went to Vegas.

52
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:39,520
We blended some groove, but there are two big missing presences thus far in this series

53
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,160
that we're going to rectify here on the last one.

54
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:48,000
One is today's topic, Las Vegas's loudest illusionist, Chris Angel.

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,920
We love to talk Chris and we're going to do it and we're going to do it with the help

56
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,400
of somebody who has been on almost every podcast, the ride series.

57
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,680
I don't think we've done a very barely an extended thing without our guest.

58
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,680
You know, somebody we can trust, somebody we can count on.

59
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,680
That's why we call him the Harland Rust of podcast, the ride from Baltic Omen and Bar

60
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,680
and Sub's good movie film.

61
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,680
It's Jason Waller.

62
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,640
Hey guys, thanks so much for having me back.

63
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,460
Great to be back.

64
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,100
I'm so happy you could do it.

65
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,100
Your firm guiding hand, much like Sheriff Rust.

66
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,100
Is he a sheriff?

67
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,100
I don't know.

68
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,100
There's so much mythology.

69
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,100
We've been focused on so much other stuff.

70
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:30,300
We're just going to have to find out when we all surely go see Rust the day it comes

71
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,300
out.

72
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:36,180
What will definitely be a theater and not an awkward to be release.

73
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,820
Well, the tension of that movie is going to be like, is it the scene yet?

74
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,580
Is it, oh, they're in the church.

75
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,220
If you see an exterior, but then wait, it was a trick and then just a horse went by

76
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,100
and you don't go into the church.

77
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,100
It's good.

78
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,100
Like that.

79
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,100
Yeah.

80
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,100
We'll all be on pins and needles.

81
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,100
It's horrible.

82
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,100
It's a horrible tragedy.

83
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,420
The man should be executed from.

84
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,500
Right after Jason.

85
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:05,100
But just for his Trump impression.

86
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:10,980
But in that scene, like the first half of the scene, like he'll like, what's going to

87
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:16,460
It'll be whatever it is, a showdown and he pulls his gun and then there'll be a cut and

88
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:19,580
suddenly he'll be like 30 pounds fatter.

89
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,300
He'll be like all tired.

90
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:26,220
Like it'll be suddenly you're in the, you're in the reshoot bags under his eyes that look

91
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,700
like you drew it with a marker.

92
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,180
Like every time you would see him, then it would, he would get puffier bags under his

93
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,180
eyes.

94
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,180
What happened to rust?

95
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,780
He's going to be all bags for the second half of the movie.

96
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,380
He's had three kids too.

97
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,780
You can tell in his face.

98
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,780
New kids since.

99
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,620
The only thing that can ease my pain is more children.

100
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,620
Wait, what did you say?

101
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,700
I said he needs to keep working because he's had so many kids.

102
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,140
He's got to put those kids through college.

103
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,260
Wait, when's it number 14?

104
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,260
When did that happen?

105
00:04:55,260 --> 00:05:00,340
I just love every time I come here, I was originally referred to as the Alec Baldwin

106
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:05,540
of podcast the ride because I had done it a bunch of times, much like he at one point

107
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,420
had hosted SNL a lot of times.

108
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:12,620
Before the stuff happened, yes, they would allow him on the show.

109
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:18,340
Now we always have to talk about this horrible tragedy for a few minutes.

110
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,340
There's no way.

111
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,260
There's no way to have jokes about a genuine.

112
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,180
Avoiding something actually terrible.

113
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

114
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,180
Well, yes.

115
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:32,140
That's why I propose, could I now be maybe known as the Kevin Spacey of podcast the ride

116
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,620
in that I'm innocent of any wrongdoing?

117
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,620
Oh, that's right.

118
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,660
Yes, it is passed through several courts of law.

119
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,260
Yes, there is not a problem.

120
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,260
That means problem.

121
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,260
I'm back.

122
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,260
I'm doing well.

123
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,260
I'm working again.

124
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,260
Completely accepted.

125
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:50,500
Three of my teachers have been found dead.

126
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,500
That's true.

127
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,500
Yeah, he's right.

128
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,940
Get up, Kevin Spacey kills people.

129
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:03,420
But those ones aside, most media is not willing to cover it the way we are here on podcast

130
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,420
the ride.

131
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,340
It's more out there and we've been through the trials.

132
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,340
Oh, yeah.

133
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,340
Well, absolutely.

134
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,340
Take it.

135
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,340
The Kevin Spacey podcast the ride.

136
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,020
The completely innocent man of some things.

137
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:19,420
Jason, I'm so happy you could close out Vegas with us, especially because we've spent so

138
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:27,180
much of the last over a month talking about things that have gotten our attention because

139
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,180
of you.

140
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,660
We've talked a little bit of Chris Angel and Kblip.

141
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,220
Copperfield, of course, comes up all the time and the Blue 32 show.

142
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,980
You can't not talk about it.

143
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,940
Before we dive into Chris specifically, I guess, what was my question?

144
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:49,420
I guess, are those your two favorite findings or is there some hot new Vegas finding of

145
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:54,260
yours that you're willing to share or anything you think is on the bubble?

146
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:58,060
You've just brought so many amazing souvenirs back.

147
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:02,500
The Copperfield show I've seen seven times now, I think.

148
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,500
Wow.

149
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,700
It's one of my favorite things in the whole world.

150
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,180
Chris, yeah, we've seen a lot of his shows.

151
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,180
We've seen him through a lot of phases.

152
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,180
I'm excited to chat.

153
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,180
A Mystica.

154
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,180
Yeah.

155
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,180
His great folly, perhaps.

156
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,420
It's pure numbers wise.

157
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,700
The numbers aren't good.

158
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,460
I went earlier this year, I think.

159
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:27,860
There's nothing on that level right now, except I did see Rich Liddell's show, which is worth

160
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,860
seeing.

161
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,860
Oh man.

162
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,540
Mike was so disappointed.

163
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,540
We wasn't playing.

164
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,540
When the weekend we were there.

165
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,540
It was a rare weekend of.

166
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,540
Did he die?

167
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,540
Is he dead?

168
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,540
Due to dying.

169
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,540
It's possible.

170
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,860
I imagine that's the only reason we wouldn't be playing.

171
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,860
It's crazy.

172
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:46,460
It is like a living funeral for a person who's there like three feet from you.

173
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,220
But all of his jokes, he's like so right wing.

174
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:57,100
And it's all about how Biden is an idiot and Kamala, what the hell is she smiling about

175
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,180
all the time?

176
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,260
Does he try to do Kamala?

177
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,260
I hope.

178
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:05,900
I think he just does maybe a smiling face.

179
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:13,220
But most of the show is him kind of like settling old grudges and just like bashing people who

180
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:17,300
are long dead where he'll just be like, I forget there was a, who is that?

181
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,340
It was like a character actor from the sixties and he's like, I was guest hosting for Johnny

182
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:26,140
one night and this, oh, the guy who played the really like, was it the Nazi?

183
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,180
It wasn't the Nazi.

184
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,380
There's a really flamboyant Dick Shawn, I think in the producers.

185
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,380
Right.

186
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,380
Okay.

187
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:36,740
And he's like, this guy, I don't know what he was on, but this guy was a damn idiot.

188
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,740
And then he just moves on.

189
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,740
Like there's no joke.

190
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:46,660
So it's really just him on stage talking about who is now dead was an idiot or bothered him.

191
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,860
Is it Shawn in Captain EO?

192
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,860
Is he the guy?

193
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,340
Captain EO, the hologram guy.

194
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,340
Yeah, I think you're right.

195
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,460
That might be my only con to tie it into the first.

196
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,460
Yeah, I think you're right.

197
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,380
Did the audience seem to know who he was?

198
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,260
How old was the average audience member?

199
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,340
Very old, very, probably in their seventies.

200
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,340
Yeah.

201
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:06,580
I went with a few friends and we were the only people younger than that.

202
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,380
And what was the venue?

203
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:15,140
The venue is the comedy club in, I believe the Tropicana, which is like a chain.

204
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:18,660
Maybe it's like the laugh factory or something, but it's just like a depressing room.

205
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,460
Well, cause it's getting demolished.

206
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,700
That's going to be gone in a matter of months.

207
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,700
I think.

208
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,940
Rich May as well.

209
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,140
They're just going to leave him in there?

210
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,140
Yeah.

211
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,820
Let's just implode a man too while we're at it.

212
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:38,460
And then he does caricatures of people that he'll show on a screen and then they speak

213
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,060
in a really kind of ghoulish way.

214
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,940
And so he's doing impressions with himself back and forth.

215
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,100
And then it's mostly YouTube clips.

216
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:52,140
He sits there and watches clips of his life for about half the show.

217
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:56,220
He just like moves to the side or doesn't, or just maybe he's blocking the screen.

218
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,220
I don't know.

219
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,220
He does.

220
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,220
And just sits with you and watches.

221
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,220
Basically, yeah.

222
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,220
So it's just a Twitch stream.

223
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:07,100
It's a live in person Twitch stream from a man who would not know what that phrase meant.

224
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,100
No.

225
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,100
He does Obama, I know, right?

226
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,100
Well, he does, he Twitches sometimes.

227
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:15,100
So he does Obama.

228
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,540
His Obama wasn't great, I will say.

229
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,540
You don't say.

230
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,020
Was that the newest impression he does?

231
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,700
Probably, yeah.

232
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:27,740
But I mean, there's Biden, but I've seen his Biden on Huckabee on the talk show.

233
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:31,940
And it is just kind of an old man, which is what he is.

234
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,940
Not a stretch.

235
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,180
He doesn't have a take on it, you're saying.

236
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,180
No, not really.

237
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:38,420
Just that he might fall asleep in the middle of a sentence.

238
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,060
But Trump's old.

239
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,060
Trump is very old as well.

240
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,740
But he's, I can't, I say that, the man has energy.

241
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,740
We know this.

242
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,020
He loves to shriek.

243
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,020
He loves it.

244
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,460
He's becoming more twisted and gnarled day by day.

245
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,460
Trump?

246
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,460
Yeah.

247
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,460
Sure.

248
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,460
Demonic.

249
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,460
You don't even have to mention it.

250
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,460
It's just a given.

251
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,340
Well, Rich hopefully will be there next, when we go next.

252
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,580
So we can do a Rich.

253
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,860
It's worth, you guys should go.

254
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,860
You would enjoy it.

255
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,860
It's very cheap.

256
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,360
And there's no one there.

257
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,980
You can sit like three feet from him.

258
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,980
Does he take questions around him?

259
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,980
They're building a dugout.

260
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,860
Like as it's happening around us, the visitors' dugout is being built.

261
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,900
For the baseball stadium.

262
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,900
Yeah, for the baseball stadium.

263
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,540
You have to, you've referenced this several times and you've had to like, then we're blank

264
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,140
and then you go, because they're building a baseball stadium there.

265
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,140
It's odd.

266
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,620
It's very odd, you know?

267
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:33,820
Do you think Rich Little could play one night at the Sphere for me?

268
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,820
For you?

269
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,100
With the clips, because now we can find out there's a clip component to Rich Little's

270
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,100
show.

271
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,100
Oh, they project him in the Sphere.

272
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,100
Yeah.

273
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,100
We could see him.

274
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:47,740
240p quality clips at 160k or whatever the Sphere is.

275
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,780
He's still mad about Obama phone, you know?

276
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,060
He's still mad about that.

277
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,060
What's that?

278
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,820
You stumped me twice in a minute.

279
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:03,780
Well, the government used to give away phone service to low income people because it is

280
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:07,500
like, it's better that everyone has phone service.

281
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,140
It's better for emergency services.

282
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:16,140
So then as phone service gravitated towards mobile phones, they started giving away basic

283
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,140
mobile phones.

284
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:23,940
So someone put up a video saying, I got my Obama phone and Project Veritas and Fox News

285
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,140
just went nuts about it.

286
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:30,140
It sounds like Jason could fill in for Rich Little on certain nights.

287
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,140
Your current events whisperer.

288
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,500
Yeah.

289
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,140
It was like a tan suit era scandal.

290
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,140
You know what he does?

291
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:49,700
He does What a Wonderful World as a duet with him as Louis Armstrong and a Kermit the Frog

292
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,140
on his hand that he's puppeting.

293
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:57,140
And his Kermit voice is I think very similar to his Obama voice.

294
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,140
It's not very accurate.

295
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:02,140
Yeah, we'll do it next time.

296
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,140
He's pulling from the Danny Gans playbook.

297
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:09,140
He's one of the last classic Vegas impressionists, like a Danny Gans type guy.

298
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,140
Yeah, yeah.

299
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:14,140
I know you did the screening recently where you showed a project that you did that was

300
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,140
based on Danny Gans.

301
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:21,140
And that sent me down the Danny Gans rabbit hole where he definitely does Louis Armstrong,

302
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:24,140
What a Wonderful World, definitely does Kermit.

303
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,140
Didn't think of bringing them together.

304
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,140
That is a good impression crisscross that makes no sense.

305
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,140
Should I?

306
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,140
That project is secretly on YouTube.

307
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,140
We put it up.

308
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:36,140
I made a fake Las Vegas trailers account.

309
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:39,140
And I put it up six years ago and no one has discovered it.

310
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,140
I looked at it the other day.

311
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,140
It's got like 140 views.

312
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:46,140
And they're all me reloading it to see if anyone discovered it over the past six years.

313
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,140
Are you willing to speak about this on the?

314
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,140
Yeah, I might as well spill it, right?

315
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,140
Sure. Oh my God.

316
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,140
Happy to have the exclusive.

317
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,140
This thing is so funny.

318
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,140
It's called Billy Glimmer.

319
00:13:55,140 --> 00:14:02,140
It stars Ben Stiller as a Las Vegas style impressionist along the lines of Danny Gans,

320
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,140
the late Danny Gans.

321
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:10,140
So a big movie star has been in a secret video for years without anybody finding it.

322
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,140
It was like a demo video we made.

323
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:15,140
We were maybe going to make a movie about it or then it became maybe a web series.

324
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,140
Then it became a secret YouTube video.

325
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:20,140
It became podcast, the ride bonus content.

326
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,140
I'm so sorry.

327
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,140
Typical passage of Hollywood projects.

328
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:29,140
But if you look it up on, it was announced at some point as a web series and then it never happened.

329
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,140
We did shoot this one thing.

330
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,140
It's on YouTube.

331
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:35,140
Maybe podcast ride fans keep it our little secret for now.

332
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,140
You check it out.

333
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:39,140
But let's see if someone discovers it.

334
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:45,140
But they didn't find it with this username top Las Vegas entertainment show.

335
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,140
That's so funny.

336
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,140
I thought so.

337
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:54,140
If you look at that account, I made that account and I just put up a bunch of like Vegas trailers and then hid this among them.

338
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,140
I assume someone would be like, what the fuck is this?

339
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:01,140
There are so many accounts actually like this, though.

340
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,140
Yeah.

341
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,140
Start looking up Vegas stuff.

342
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,140
Yes.

343
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,140
No one ever found this one.

344
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,140
Wow.

345
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,140
Feel free to subscribe.

346
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,140
It will never post another video.

347
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,140
I can promise you that I've lost the password.

348
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,140
Secret Stiller just for the Cliffords.

349
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,140
Thank you for that.

350
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,140
This thing is this video is so funny.

351
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:22,140
And I like when you screened it, I was dying at it.

352
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,140
And then I watched.

353
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,140
And then I watched.

354
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,140
And then I watched.

355
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:29,140
Like, I wonder what it was based on and was it exaggerated in any way?

356
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:33,140
And the actual Danny Gans sizzle reel is precisely what you.

357
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:39,140
Yeah, it is only because it only because of the accident quality of he is trying to make people laugh.

358
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:42,140
But then you aren't laughing the way he's intending.

359
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,140
But you're laughing in a new twenty twenty three way.

360
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,140
There's a lot of layers.

361
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:50,140
I think the real Danny Gans video is is funnier because it's real.

362
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,140
Yeah, he's not trying to.

363
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,140
Yeah, it's just hard to beat it.

364
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,140
It's so insane.

365
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,140
He does.

366
00:15:54,140 --> 00:16:00,140
He'll just like announce an impression singing premise that makes no sense.

367
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,140
We're like, why are these people together?

368
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:07,140
And then like, ladies and gentlemen, Michael Bolton with featuring Dr.

369
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:16,140
Ruth and then do a bad Michael Bolton with a man, those woman and then switches characters.

370
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,140
He'd better wear a condom.

371
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,140
Why?

372
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,140
Why?

373
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,140
That's the punch line.

374
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:25,140
And then and then audience dying, dying.

375
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:31,140
An audience of twenty seven thousand people laughing harder than I've seen anyone laugh

376
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:34,140
anywhere I've been in a supposed comedy career.

377
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:40,140
Never have I seen an audience, even sat in an audience that's killing the way Danny Gans is killing.

378
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,140
It's crazy.

379
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,140
I saw this is only tangentially related.

380
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:46,140
This morning I was sent a clip of the guy who played Kevin from the office.

381
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:49,140
In front of like an office con group of like of attendees.

382
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:54,140
And there's a kid dressed as him and he just whispers to the kid like identity theft is a crime.

383
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:59,140
And I've never seen a crowd laugh harder or longer than this clip.

384
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,140
Camera shaking.

385
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,140
They drop it.

386
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,140
I'll never see anything.

387
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:06,140
It goes over with the audience.

388
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,140
I love office.

389
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,140
Sorry.

390
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,140
I love office.

391
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,140
Fanda.

392
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,140
I love it.

393
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,140
It's going to.

394
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,140
Yeah.

395
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,140
This is.

396
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,140
Where is this hitting?

397
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,140
I don't know.

398
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,140
I don't know.

399
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,140
But I can't.

400
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,140
I'm a lot of your savings account to that Stanley.

401
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,140
I did.

402
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,140
Series that is being returned to you.

403
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:27,140
I sent twenty five thousand dollars to the actor who played Stanley on the office for

404
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,140
his project to make a Stanley spinoff.

405
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,140
But he sent the money back to me.

406
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,140
So sorry.

407
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,140
I'm sorry.

408
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,140
You have that money.

409
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,140
I want him to have what a waste.

410
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,140
I'm trying to get it back to him.

411
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,140
I'm trying to send him cash in an envelope.

412
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,140
You're trying to find him on Venmo.

413
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,140
Yeah.

414
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,140
Yeah.

415
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,140
I'm going to buy lots of Stanley action figures.

416
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,140
Yeah.

417
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,140
Yeah.

418
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,140
Just want to spend this on Stanley.

419
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,140
I'll buy Stanley Funko Pops.

420
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,140
Four hundred of them.

421
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,140
Yeah.

422
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,140
OK.

423
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,140
Well, these are great tips.

424
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,860
Thank you for the secret video and the rich little tip.

425
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,860
We got to go.

426
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,860
We'll go.

427
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:58,860
But let's talk about.

428
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,860
What's that?

429
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,860
He's quite old.

430
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,860
Time is of the essence.

431
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,860
Yeah.

432
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,860
Well, you're good.

433
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,860
Mike, if it lines up with your Sphere trip.

434
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,860
I'm going to Sphere.

435
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,860
You must.

436
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,860
You must go.

437
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,860
What are you doing in Sphere?

438
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,860
And I'd like to apologize to Lindsay in advance.

439
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:10,860
I'm seeing you too.

440
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,860
Oh.

441
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,580
Yeah.

442
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,580
No, I wish I was.

443
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,580
Is it cool, though?

444
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,020
How many impressions is Bono going to do?

445
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,020
I think very little.

446
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:21,460
Well, if he does the Mirror Ball Man and if he does McFist, though, these are different

447
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,500
voices at least, different characters.

448
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:30,020
Let's talk about the real, you know, the greatest entertainer who has not gotten the spotlight

449
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,020
in this series.

450
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:36,220
He closed out Celebruary long ago, but we got to talk about him here.

451
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,620
And that's Chris Angel.

452
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,940
Jason, you joined us for that.

453
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:40,940
You did a little guest appearance.

454
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,020
That's right.

455
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,020
We did a little week.

456
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:48,820
Episode where we talked about about some of your your initial Chris Angel fandom, your

457
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:49,820
Chris Angel journey.

458
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:57,260
So, you know, not to reiterate too much of that, but, you know, it's you did the human

459
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,340
giant sketch, which is based on him.

460
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:03,940
But you didn't actually like it was years later that you actually saw Mind Freak with

461
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,500
your own eyes, which was revelatory, seemingly.

462
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,500
A few years.

463
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,500
Yeah.

464
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:14,900
Believ, that was his like, and maybe we talked about this, his like collab with Cirque du

465
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,700
Soleil that was kind of short lived and I think very acrimonious.

466
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,500
Is that the I was I got confused about when it became Believ.

467
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,020
I even saw him and I don't I don't know if it was Believ or Mind Freak.

468
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,020
It was At Luxor at the time.

469
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:34,060
Believ was At Luxor, I think, and it had like weird Cirque elements, like a bunny rabbit

470
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:38,300
that like run like weird little people and like, you know, it had a bunch of that kind

471
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,300
of stuff.

472
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,300
Yeah.

473
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,300
Then I saw Believ, I think.

474
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:46,740
And then I think he changed the show to Mind Freak and now it's at Planet Hollywood.

475
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,740
And I went and saw that.

476
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,740
Which is what it was initially.

477
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,260
Like it was it was Mind Freak.

478
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:53,580
It was a version of the show, but live for many years.

479
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,780
Then this Cirque du Soleil thing that I did.

480
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,500
I'll get to this quote.

481
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,180
I don't know where this is from, but one of the most brutally reviewed shows in the history

482
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,180
of Las Vegas.

483
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:08,380
This will be a recurring theme of the episode, is his tortured relationship with critics

484
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,780
who try to drag him down.

485
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,780
But that was the first to you.

486
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,780
He is the Trump of magic.

487
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,780
We said it before.

488
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,780
Everybody's after him.

489
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,780
We.

490
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:22,340
And then years later, I was there with some friends and we saw the Mind Freak show.

491
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,180
And that's kind of like I wasn't really obsessed with him.

492
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:29,420
We did the thing on Human Giant and and saw his show and it was funny and dumb.

493
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:33,500
But it was years later we went back and saw Mind Freak and got like truly obsessed and

494
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,020
told everyone like, oh, you have to see it.

495
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,740
He's doing a crazy thing.

496
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:41,940
Partially because of that childhood cancer segment that becomes like a laser dance party.

497
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,020
That's just everything we talked about it last time.

498
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,780
It's just insane.

499
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:51,060
I forgot that I re listened to what we talked about and I forgot that some of this involved

500
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,260
a woman in a bald cap.

501
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,260
Yes.

502
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,260
Who gets her childhood.

503
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,260
Yes.

504
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,260
Insane.

505
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:04,900
There's also an illness angle in the Copperfield show too, right?

506
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,340
You mean that Blue is dying?

507
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:09,420
No, no, there was before Blue even comes out, at least when I saw the show.

508
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:12,220
Oh, the guy with the sister who died that he makes the guy levitate?

509
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:17,460
Which is also in one of the TV's, one of the prime time TV specials.

510
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,460
OK, OK.

511
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,460
Oh, wow.

512
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,700
Wait, but it's always in there?

513
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,980
So is this a thing that he?

514
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,460
I've only seen the show once, but it was in there.

515
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:30,540
The guy whose sister died, not to give too much away, is there every night, yes?

516
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,540
I see.

517
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,540
Well, that's nice.

518
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,540
At least all seven times that I've been there.

519
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,540
He's got somewhere to go.

520
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,900
He may be in on it.

521
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,100
Could be a plant situation, or maybe just a big fan.

522
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:47,700
It was his sister's dream that I think David levitate him.

523
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,700
Wow.

524
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,500
Now he gets to do it every night.

525
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,500
She's dead.

526
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,500
Yeah, now over again.

527
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,500
David owns him now.

528
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,500
Yeah.

529
00:21:54,540 --> 00:22:00,740
I forgot that in our initial Chris Angel Talks, the aspect of him being best friends with

530
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,300
Gary Oldman.

531
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,020
That is a funny detail.

532
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:07,860
And through a mystical, I'm sure we'll talk about, we learned about his other best friend.

533
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,420
Wait, which?

534
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,420
Mike Hammer.

535
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,420
Oh, yo, that one.

536
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,420
We'll get into it.

537
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:15,420
Yeah, I don't know who's closer with him.

538
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,420
No, no, no.

539
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,420
I'm getting ahead of myself.

540
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,900
Yeah, well, we'll learn all about Mike Hammer.

541
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:27,860
I mean, if you, unfortunately, will learn all about Mike Hammer, if you Google Gary

542
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:33,940
Oldman, Chris Angel, just photo after photo, something he tweeted, this was my favorite.

543
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,580
They're best friends.

544
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,580
Always kissing people.

545
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:41,860
I love Gary Oldman, the best of the best, class act and insanely talented.

546
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,860
So on it.

547
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,860
He's my friend.

548
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,540
Just, yeah, so much.

549
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:53,060
I went to Chris's Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony just as an observer.

550
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:56,340
And Gary Oldman introduced him and gave the speech.

551
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,940
They are truly best of friends.

552
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:04,140
Do we know where this, Gary Oldman doesn't feel like he's from the same universe as Chris

553
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,420
Angel.

554
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,940
I think he just looks like a kind of dignified guy.

555
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:14,020
Are you thinking of like Commissioner Gordon version of Gary Oldman?

556
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,180
Yeah, am I like applying some air and some class?

557
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:21,100
Yeah, we might be projecting, or the Churchill.

558
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,100
Yeah, yeah.

559
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:27,620
Not too much the dilapidated slow horses, Gary Oldman.

560
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:33,420
Yeah, yeah, more of like the Chris Angel's best buddy, Gary Oldman.

561
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,420
The true, the truest true Gary Oldman.

562
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:39,900
True romance, Gary Oldman would be best friends with Chris Angel.

563
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,180
What do you think they talk about?

564
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,940
God, I don't know.

565
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,540
What if it's only public?

566
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:47,780
You think Gary Oldman's eating a ka-blip?

567
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,780
That is a crazy image.

568
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,620
You gotta come out, I'll comp ya.

569
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,220
I'll comp ya, Gary.

570
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:56,180
If he's staying at his house maybe, they get in like the limo and go?

571
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,180
Possibly.

572
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,180
Maybe.

573
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,180
I don't know.

574
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:03,340
Has he gone dirt biking with him in the beautiful Moapa Valley?

575
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,340
Definitely.

576
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:08,740
So, should we get into how we found out?

577
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:14,220
Basically, they announced that Chris, it was like announced in years before it came out

578
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:21,140
that Chris was doing a new show, was gonna have a show that followed his Mindfreak show.

579
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:25,140
And it was called A Mystica, and it was like his dream project, and it was going to be

580
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:29,060
about his life, a magic show about his life story.

581
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:32,860
And so we were all, we all got on a text thread and were like, well we absolutely have to

582
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,900
go see this.

583
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:39,060
And then I think we were like, we either bought tickets where we were about to, and then the

584
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,100
show got like, postponed, just like, right?

585
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,100
It got postponed three times.

586
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,860
Yeah, I think there was a three month that I remember, oh maybe there were, yeah, that

587
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,860
makes sense that we're all about.

588
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:51,740
And then they started, and we were like, oh, if we, yeah, if this is about his life, this

589
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,020
is gonna be, like, we have to see this.

590
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:57,300
Also, I think we had a hunch that it wouldn't last very long.

591
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,620
Yeah, sure, yes.

592
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:04,700
And spoiler, listeners, if you're curious to see Chris Angel's Mystica, you cannot.

593
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,500
Well, I'm sure Chris did not make it out of 2022.

594
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,500
Well, unless they get the international tour off the ground.

595
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,500
Sounds, I'm optimistic, I'm optimistic.

596
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:25,100
Just some numbers, okay, opens May 2022, closes October 2022.

597
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:30,100
Now that is not a long run for a theatrical endeavor in any respect.

598
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,100
No.

599
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,700
But especially in Vegas.

600
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,700
It's been a long run for four years.

601
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:39,700
Forever, and like, Mindfreak is still pulling like 1200 people a night.

602
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,900
Well is it?

603
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:44,300
That's what the Los Angeles Review Journal said.

604
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:50,300
But they made sure to note that the closing night of a Mystica for a theater that seats

605
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,700
1400, there were 150 people there.

606
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,700
Oh my god.

607
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,700
Yeah, wow.

608
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,000
We did the same as them.

609
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,980
In the weeks leading up to our trip, so we got a little group together, and we were like,

610
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,100
we're gonna go to Vegas.

611
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,100
Which Mike and Jason were invited to, they were not cut out of it, you guys couldn't

612
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,100
do it, but you could have experienced the manager.

613
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,100
But I had COVID, so I didn't go.

614
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,100
Mike had COVID.

615
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,100
Oh, you're right, oh, because it was right after New York.

616
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,100
I was out of town.

617
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:19,100
I said that Mike and I were two of the designated comedy survivors, like us and Tim Heidecker

618
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,100
were not on the trip.

619
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,100
You guys texted, you agreed, you texted Tim.

620
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:27,100
Yeah, yeah, we texted fellow Forever Dog, a host, Tim Heidecker.

621
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,100
Friend of the show.

622
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,100
Friend of the show.

623
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,100
I don't know.

624
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:37,100
And because this was like, it was you guys and Eva and Tom Sharpling and John Daly.

625
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,100
Yeah.

626
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:41,100
Yeah, it was like a big comedy contingent.

627
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,100
It sure was.

628
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:50,100
I don't know, it was just so many of you pulled it off, like got together and organized this.

629
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:58,100
And you know, anticipation is building as we're, you know, trying to settle on a date

630
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:04,100
to do it because little flickers of information keep coming out about it and how it is different

631
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:08,100
and why it goes deeper and hits harder than the typical Criss Angel show.

632
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:13,100
And by the way, I guess, you know, the typical Criss Angel show already, because I was looking at reviews

633
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:20,100
of like the main one and the reviews often are like, there were like five tricks over the course of 90 minutes.

634
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,100
Yes.

635
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:27,100
It's a lot of loud music, a lot, you mentioned last time, a lot of Jonathan Davis from Korn.

636
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,100
Oh my God.

637
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,100
Did a bunch for it.

638
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:33,100
And it's all stuff of that style or kind of this like Evanescence variety.

639
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:38,100
And then a lot of like, I also saw reviews saying like, I don't know if he was doing illusions or something.

640
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:42,100
I couldn't tell because he was blasting strobes at us the entire time.

641
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,100
So I don't know exactly what he did or didn't do.

642
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:48,100
So, but basically, you know, the main show.

643
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:52,100
And we should say this is this was a collaboration with Franco Dragone.

644
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:57,100
Yes, who was a major director of Cirque du Soleil.

645
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,100
Yeah, he was.

646
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:06,100
I think Chris says a big part of establishing the look, feel and language of Cirque du Soleil.

647
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:10,100
He directed all the major shows from 85 to 98.

648
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,100
That is so so a big figure.

649
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:17,100
And he passed away in the fall of 2022.

650
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:25,100
And then I believe that part of influence the decision to close a Mystica, although he passed away in Cairo.

651
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,100
So it wasn't like he was.

652
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:30,100
What was the order of events, though? Did he hear it was closing and that was too much for him?

653
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:34,100
No, no, I'm saying he passed away and then the show killed him.

654
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,100
That's what I'm suggesting.

655
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:39,100
Seeing his name on an ugly billboard killed him.

656
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,100
Killed his body.

657
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:46,100
He got one text from somebody like, hey, I saw the show.

658
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,100
And then he came out when we were there.

659
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:53,100
He was there. Yes, we got we were graced by the presence of Franco himself.

660
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,100
Franco comes out with Chris, right?

661
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,100
Yes. Yeah. In the beginning.

662
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,100
And what does he say? I don't also is very drunk.

663
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,100
But we saw this show.

664
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,100
No, me as well and only got more so as it went.

665
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,100
So I was relying on some.

666
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:19,100
Well, in this case, a smuggled video and I knew that I like I knew the risks of filming at a Chris Angel show via you, Jason, because I know you were kicked out of a show.

667
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,100
I had been previously removed.

668
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:27,100
Yes. And forced to delete all your photos in front of a watch and guard.

669
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:34,100
But no, we got we got a little special intro from the from the two minds from Dragone and Chris.

670
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:39,100
I don't remember if this is anything or interesting, but I'll play it.

671
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:44,100
What you have been through because this would be a model for the young generation.

672
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,100
So this is a message of hope, love and light.

673
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:50,100
And we hope you enjoy this presentation, ladies and gentlemen.

674
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:54,100
And by the way, make sure if you bought a ticket, you're going to stick around.

675
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:58,100
Oh, yes. OK, so not much there, but it's a story of hope.

676
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,100
It's a story of love and light of love.

677
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,100
And that's that's all big stuff. That's heavy stuff to get into.

678
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,100
It's bigger than your run of the mill magic show deals with.

679
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:13,100
We and and then before we went on this trip, we I found on Vimeo a video from August 2000.

680
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:17,100
So over 20 years old called Chris Angels, a mystic.

681
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:21,100
And it's like this it's before anyone knew who he was.

682
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:25,100
This crazy, like kind of 80s, like hair metal kind of song.

683
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,100
It's like into a mystic car.

684
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:30,100
And it's this like Terminator knockoff robot walking.

685
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,100
And Chris does this thing. It's up there. It's still up there.

686
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:35,100
I look today and it looked crazy. It looked great.

687
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:39,100
And it's like, oh, wow, he's been this is the show he's been planning to do for 20 years.

688
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:49,100
We're going to see like this guy's masterpiece, which is like the zone you want to be in of just someone like what was so great about his other show, about the childhood cancer thing.

689
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:53,100
It was like, oh, this is such a bad idea and in such poor taste.

690
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,100
And no one's saying no to him.

691
00:30:55,100 --> 00:31:07,100
And I was hoping that this whole show would just be that of just like, oh, you're getting this kind of dimwitted guy's life story who thinks his life is like so important and heavy and melodramatic.

692
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:12,100
And and so the expectations were very high when we saw this show.

693
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:20,100
Yeah. Well, and the mythology, you know, before we even get into what it is, I just want to build the picture of what we're coming in with, because there is the legend of this.

694
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:29,100
We know that it is a prequel to his regular show, a show with no story, a show that's a bunch of stuff and a rave in the face of childhood cancer.

695
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:34,100
How do you do a prequel to something that is just not a plot?

696
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,100
So there's that.

697
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:42,100
Then and there's the discovery that a mystica is a word that he uses in lots of things.

698
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,100
He tried to mount a show.

699
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,100
He posted on his Instagram.

700
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,100
I forgot about this.

701
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:51,100
An old photo that says a mystica.

702
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:55,100
This was my license plate 25 years ago.

703
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,100
Like a young, much like a very jerseyed out.

704
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:02,100
But it's crazy with an emoji.

705
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,100
Crazy mind blow.

706
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:09,100
Is he is he saying that this like it wasn't a vanity plate that that just happened to be the letters he got when he got a car?

707
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,100
Yeah, it was the sign.

708
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:15,100
I got some random letters and I knew I had to turn it into a show.

709
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,100
Doesn't he also have an amistica tattoo?

710
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,100
No, does he?

711
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,100
And he didn't name one of the kids a mystica, did he?

712
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,100
Because there's I know he has all these words that he recurs.

713
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:28,100
What's the thing that it's that elusia, I believe?

714
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,100
Elusia is his coffee.

715
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,100
Wait, the coffee.

716
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,100
I think it's the coffee and one of his children.

717
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,100
Yes.

718
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,100
Elusia is one of the kids?

719
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,100
I think so.

720
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,100
Yeah, yeah.

721
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,100
OK.

722
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,100
So there are a number.

723
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:48,100
So basically, Chris Angel is a guy who thought of four words 25 years ago and his whole career has been about like just releasing them one by one.

724
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,100
Sure.

725
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,100
And then all caps the caption on that.

726
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,100
Never give up on your dream fire.

727
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:59,100
So the more this builds, we're like, boy, this is like completely what is in this guy's heart.

728
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,100
And it's his personal story.

729
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:08,100
And then but then bits of information you're getting that we're probably texting to each other on the way to it just make it seem stranger and stranger.

730
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:13,100
In fact, I don't remember this, that the show was originally titled Mr. Smiles and Molly.

731
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,100
Yeah.

732
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,100
Do you remember what that refers to?

733
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,100
I feel like we knew it at one point.

734
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,100
I don't remember.

735
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,100
Is it in the show?

736
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,100
Is there a toy that's Mr. Smiles?

737
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,100
I think it was probably cut from the show.

738
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,100
Possibly.

739
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,100
Much like Christos.

740
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,100
But we'll get to that.

741
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,100
I was trying to remember that.

742
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,100
OK, well, that's a detail.

743
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:36,100
So we found out from just researching it, the original name of the show was not a mistake.

744
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,100
Mr. Smiles and Molly.

745
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,100
And it was actually announced.

746
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:47,100
And there's an article in the Las Vegas Review Journal from twenty twenty one, which is like, oh, very right before it opened.

747
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,100
I think so.

748
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,100
He had I mean, like everything.

749
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,100
It's like this whole plan.

750
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,100
And then he's like, fuck it.

751
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,100
Just call it a mystic.

752
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,100
This is dumb.

753
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:58,100
Like it is like he like the name of Mr.

754
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:03,100
is almost like when you're a kid and you just like write the same word in your notebook like a hundred thousand times.

755
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,100
He fixates on these things.

756
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:16,100
Or like when you think of like a fake production company name, if you did that like little filmmaker Scott in high school, like you like make your logo, you make your logo before you make anything.

757
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,100
Yeah.

758
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,100
Yeah.

759
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,100
Getting that Stussy.

760
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,100
Yeah.

761
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,100
Yeah.

762
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,100
It's like America.

763
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,100
The mystical.

764
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,100
Is that what it means?

765
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,100
Yeah.

766
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,100
What is it?

767
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,100
Let's talk about the phrase.

768
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,100
What is something?

769
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,100
It's like a.

770
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,100
Yeah.

771
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,100
Is it a mystic?

772
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,100
It's America.

773
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:37,100
But it's like it's a whole country for magic basically.

774
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,100
Well, he's very patriotic.

775
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,100
That's another thing about Chris saying.

776
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:45,100
But he said the back half of the word was for swastika.

777
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,100
What?

778
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,100
No, he didn't say that.

779
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,100
He said that's that's daring.

780
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:53,100
We're getting some actual going for two minutes.

781
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,100
Yeah, we would have.

782
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,100
He's like a big Nazi guy.

783
00:34:56,100 --> 00:35:01,100
Martin and Lewis, Sigfried and Roy, Alan and Rossi, Penn and Teller, Donnie and Marie.

784
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,100
And now Mr. Smiles and Molly.

785
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,100
That's how this article begins.

786
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:09,100
We're talking about Dragone and Chris Angel collaborating in a new venue under that title.

787
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:12,100
And it was going to be some it wasn't going to be anything like what we saw.

788
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:18,100
It was like a club or it was interactive, immersive, euphoria is how they described it.

789
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:24,100
Dragone says it's a bold fusion between the world of electronic music and theater.

790
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:28,100
They didn't announce where and when a surreal pre nightclub experience.

791
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,100
It sounds nothing like the show we saw.

792
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:34,100
By the time you saw it, it's not even a magic show.

793
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,100
It's what the what was it?

794
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:47,100
It was like, well, OK, one thing we realized that we didn't know until we were there is that Chris Angel is basically not in the show until like the last 15 minutes.

795
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,100
Yes.

796
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:57,100
Well, there was this question in the lead up to it and then and in the press in the lead up to it that like, wow, it's Chris Angel's new show.

797
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:01,100
But will Chris be in the show at all?

798
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:07,100
And I found an interview where he kind of like, well, first of all, here's an article.

799
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:34,100
One thing to say here, too, is that we found that Chris had, I'd say, lost the like what he he like the Vegas Press has had a very cantankerous relationship with Chris, a very combative relationship where like some stories have been written about this guy that are rough.

800
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:48,100
So people I think the Vegas Press was like excited to watch this thing fail and looking for cracks because I'd see articles called Vital Vegas and a writer named Sam Novak and these guys, I think all pretty after Chris.

801
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:52,100
So quotes, Chris Angel, the most hated fraud in Las Vegas.

802
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,100
Wow.

803
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:56,100
One of the nastiest shit balls I've ever encountered.

804
00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:02,100
And these are the places that are supposed to just be posting puff pieces of, hey, check out Chris Angel's new show at Planet Hollywood.

805
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,100
And instead, they are they are posting.

806
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,100
They are trying to take this guy down.

807
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:18,100
That's like, you know, like whatever mice chat being like this motherfucker Bob Iger or something like the theme park press, which is a very favorable thing.

808
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,100
Yeah, it's usually extremely positive.

809
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,100
No.

810
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,100
So it's it does seem rare.

811
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:27,100
So one of these sites said because also you want access in like the theme park world.

812
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,100
Yes.

813
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:37,100
Well, anything that's like a niche market that has a press quote unquote has to be very favorable because you just get iced out if it's not like podcast the ride like podcast the ride.

814
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,100
Right.

815
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,100
Except Vegas.

816
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,100
Yeah.

817
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,100
You just well, they.

818
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,100
Well, I think like he was there's a famous story.

819
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:48,100
I think was it this one or something that he he kicked a guy out who had written about him.

820
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,100
Do you have that?

821
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,100
It was this guy.

822
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,100
Sam Novak, who I just mentioned.

823
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,100
He was writing for something called Vegas 411.

824
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:58,100
He wrote an article called I was thrown out of Chris Angel's new show.

825
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:05,100
He much like James Dolan, which we talked about kicking people out of the garden who've been critical of him.

826
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,100
Yeah, and that was right to do it.

827
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,100
And he was great.

828
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,100
He was absolutely correct.

829
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,100
Don't mess up Mike's fear.

830
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,100
So he wrote a big angry article.

831
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:20,100
He just like he was in his seat about to start and then two suited men come up to him and like, wait, no, this cannot stand.

832
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:23,100
And then he wrote a bit like a very defiant article.

833
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:30,100
My expulsion from Chris Angel show was nothing more than censorship blocking the public's access to information.

834
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:33,100
It damages tourism and the entertainment community.

835
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:41,100
And then he goes on to say, I am a longtime fan of co-creator Franco Dragone.

836
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:56,100
I've it is my dream to one day see his down House of Dancing Waters and Macau is a biggest dragone head, but he was yanked away from getting to experience dragones, possibly final work and certainly worst work.

837
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:59,100
And I'm so guaranteed worse thing he's ever been part of.

838
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:02,100
So this is the tenor of the press going into this.

839
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:06,100
So when rumors start leaking about this show, they're asking questions.

840
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,100
Here is an article I found, I think, from Vital Vegas.

841
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:12,100
The biggest problem is probably the terrible name of the show.

842
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:17,100
The second biggest problem is it's unclear if Chris Angel actually appears in the show.

843
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:21,100
Try and spot him anywhere in this promotional video for a mystica, which is true.

844
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:24,100
The video videos he put out, you can't make heads or tails of him.

845
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:28,100
It's just like screaming and lights and maybe a guy on fire.

846
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,100
And I can't figure out what he's not in most of the show.

847
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:36,100
And then we found out afterwards that he was like so basically the show we saw he showed up towards the end.

848
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,100
He showed up to be introduced it.

849
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:47,100
Then it's this like kind of really half assed like play about his life that wasn't even it wasn't funny like he wanted to be.

850
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:53,100
It was just like this kind of like scary, scary, but like lazy, like no actual impressive physical feats.

851
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:57,100
The only impressive was like a guy came out and did card magic and he was like very good.

852
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:04,100
This big like muscle bound guy, which is had like making thousands of cards appears like that was incredible.

853
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:11,100
A guy did like a Houdini water torture escape and like was just like trying to get out of this box of water for like three and a half minutes or something.

854
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,100
I was like, oh yeah, he looks like he could die.

855
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,100
Yes.

856
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:20,100
And and but he Chris tries to keep a presence in it regardless.

857
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,100
You hear his voice.

858
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,100
You hear his voice.

859
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:26,100
And in that part, he says like this guy's about to hold his breath.

860
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:29,100
Please do it along with him.

861
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:33,100
Like in solidarity.

862
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,100
You're wait, what's the what's the quote?

863
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,100
You're oh, do it.

864
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,100
Please.

865
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:43,100
You don't have to bet your life along with it.

866
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,100
He does.

867
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:49,100
So you're encouraged to hold your breath along with the tank guy.

868
00:40:49,100 --> 00:41:03,100
And I was going to say I did find again the Los Angeles or Las Vegas Review Journal kind of gave a definitive answer after the show closed of Chris Angel's presence in the show.

869
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,100
Right.

870
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:12,100
It says Angel himself did not appear in the production other than in voiceover after performing the goth magic character Christos.

871
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:18,100
That's Christos with an X in the first few shows, which by the time we saw the first few shows,

872
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:22,100
by the time we saw it, he shows up at the end and does a trick.

873
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:32,100
But then we read a review saying that Christos or Xristos, it's X, X, R, I am with an X at the beginning.

874
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:36,100
They were like Christos is like devilish, you know, Joker character.

875
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:42,100
But when we saw it, he clearly was just too lazy to put on the Christos makeup because he just showed up, did some tricks and left.

876
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:47,100
And then we found a clip of him on a morning show in Vegas talking about he said like,

877
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,100
that's right, I'm currently in the show.

878
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:56,100
We're like, what he's planning on just like fully like this was so fully what we expected to see like his opus.

879
00:41:56,100 --> 00:42:02,100
And it was so much just like a cash grab that he thought it was like a Larry Sanders kind of thing.

880
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:05,100
He thought he could just like a Hank something Hank would do.

881
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:08,100
Like he would put his name on something like these idiots.

882
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,100
The first night.

883
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:13,100
And like he and then he's like, I'll phase myself out.

884
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:17,100
And he just really overestimated the amount that his name above a banner.

885
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:25,100
If you give people a bad show and so and the other part of the show that was massive was the comedy portion of this guy, Mike Hammer.

886
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,100
And look, everyone look, we're all living our lives.

887
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:29,100
I don't want to shit on everybody.

888
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:33,100
But like it wasn't, you know, our cup of tea.

889
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:36,100
It wasn't the kind of comedy that we like.

890
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:41,100
No, it was a kind of comedy that involved bringing up audience members of certain.

891
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,100
That's what he did.

892
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:45,100
And then we found a clip of him on his Instagram doing the exact same thing.

893
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,100
It doesn't matter what they said their name was.

894
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,100
He would just make a sound.

895
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:54,100
And it was just like full racism.

896
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,100
Yeah, yeah.

897
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,100
Just watch.

898
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,100
Just like, what the fuck is this?

899
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:02,100
It's like a half an hour of racism or being like a pig towards women.

900
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:07,100
And that was just like, oh, this is like so it's like it was just boring.

901
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:09,100
And then, yeah, the show sucked.

902
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:10,100
It was really it was terrible.

903
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,100
It's really bad.

904
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:16,100
Yes, it's so he's clearly trying to build this like where where do I go from here?

905
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:23,100
Where do I I've got my nightly show, but I'm getting bored with it and I would like to make some more money.

906
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:28,100
So could I attach my name to another thing?

907
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:33,100
There's a question of if I'll be maybe I'll be in it and I'll certainly be a presence in the voiceover.

908
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,100
So you're getting the Chris Angel vibe.

909
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:44,100
But after and then we'll get the reviews that I'm sure will be great reviews after that first month where I am in it kind of for 15 minutes.

910
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:50,100
And then we will phase out even that 15 minutes and I will not be in it at all.

911
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,100
He thought this plan would work.

912
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:56,100
I mean, variety shows, I guess, work in Vegas, but it was like very expensive.

913
00:43:56,100 --> 00:44:02,100
And and the Cirque du Soleil element, you go to like you go to like that show, Ka, or like the state.

914
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,100
Have you ever seen that?

915
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:08,100
It's like the craziest thing you've ever seen, like the whole the whole stage moves like 360 degrees.

916
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:09,100
It's like mind blowing.

917
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,100
It's almost vertical.

918
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,100
It kills people.

919
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,100
It's like an incredible show.

920
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:19,100
And and this had it's just like people like kind of spinning around.

921
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:22,100
There was nothing physically impressive that you would see in a Cirque du Soleil show.

922
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:30,100
The magic. Yeah, there were like two impressive magic tricks, not by Chris Angel, and then like 40 minutes of shitty comedy.

923
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,100
So much.

924
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:34,100
And just like comedy pseudo magic.

925
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:36,100
But they're not really mostly comedy.

926
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:42,100
And by comedy, we mean questioning the last names of people who are different than him.

927
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:47,100
But there was one truly wonderful bit in the show that we haven't talked about yet.

928
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,100
Well, let me look.

929
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:53,100
Before we get to that, just to build to that, although I think I've alluded to it on the show before.

930
00:44:53,100 --> 00:45:00,100
But the you talk about there wasn't anything impressive, like a big Cirque stage that that rotated and everything.

931
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:05,100
Jason, you're forgetting about the house, the big house.

932
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:07,100
You remember the big house, right?

933
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:10,100
That's lived with you since April 20, 20, when we saw it.

934
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:14,100
Look, I've I've forgotten a lot of this show.

935
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:18,100
Well, you're going to wonder how you could have missed this big house.

936
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:26,100
But when I show you this video where Chris Angel is on his Instagram, Chris Angel is next to a house that's almost as tall as him.

937
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,100
Wait, was that in the show?

938
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:30,100
It was. And I barely I faintly remember this.

939
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:33,100
But wait, listen to how he builds this thing up.

940
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:42,100
And the caption is my new house cost over one million dollars, but it can do what no house in the world can.

941
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:49,100
Technological piece of magic or illusion in the history of my art.

942
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:52,100
There's nothing even close to it.

943
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:55,100
He's lying over a million dollars.

944
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:59,100
Find out why. Check out a mystica coming to Planet Hollywood.

945
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,100
What did it do?

946
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,100
I don't remember. No, he's lying.

947
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:05,100
I remember the house.

948
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:10,100
I remember the house being rolled out and maybe something was like projected onto it.

949
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:13,100
And I found another video where it seems to like split open.

950
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,100
I think it opened.

951
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:16,100
That's like that's very what came out of it.

952
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:17,100
Any Broadway show.

953
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:22,100
There was just like there was like a desk and then an actor came and sat at the desk.

954
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:24,100
Find out what was in the house.

955
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,100
There was nothing impressive or memorable.

956
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:31,100
There isn't for him to claim that is the most impressive thing in the history of his art.

957
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:34,100
And to stack that we've got drag on.

958
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:36,100
You got your let. Yeah, that's just a pure lie.

959
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:39,100
Do you think he's going to listen to this?

960
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:44,100
Will he just do to like a lack of Christ angel?

961
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,100
What how do we fit?

962
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:50,100
Well, we all have we if we have his ear, what would we like to say?

963
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:53,100
Well, you can hear it in the recording that I'll play in a little while.

964
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:55,100
Oh, you get that. You talk to him.

965
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:57,100
So you're not proud of it.

966
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:59,100
It looks like a child's playhouse.

967
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:00,100
Uh huh.

968
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:05,100
Like where I grew up, if there were was like the outskirts of a hurricane pass through,

969
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:10,100
you would go outside afterwards and they're like, oh, playhouse is gone.

970
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:14,100
Like that doesn't look like a thing that would cost a million dollars.

971
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,100
I don't know how I did.

972
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,100
And I didn't remember it in the least.

973
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:20,100
It looks like a doghouse for a Saint Bernard.

974
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:22,100
Yeah. It's just like a big doghouse.

975
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:24,100
How could you possibly spend a million dollars?

976
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:25,100
It's a doghouse. Yeah.

977
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:27,100
And I think it collapsed on stage.

978
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:31,100
I think so. I think the roof like maybe it didn't work the night we saw it.

979
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:33,100
It might not. Was it part of the tornado bit?

980
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,100
I don't know.

981
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:37,100
Oh, maybe like in like Wizard of Oz or something.

982
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:41,100
It wasn't anything that I'm sure you could talk to any of us who were on that trip.

983
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:43,100
No one can recall what.

984
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:45,100
So what did you think of the house?

985
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:47,100
All of us blank. Was there a house?

986
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:51,100
It didn't. The house didn't land, but something else did.

987
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:54,100
You're right. I talked about this briefly on the on the second gate,

988
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:57,100
but let's actually let's hear it from your perspective, Jason.

989
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:59,100
I'm trying to remember the set above it.

990
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:03,100
At one point he does a memorial to his dad because that's always part of shows like this.

991
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:08,100
And then I think he implies that his dad, this was like a tribute to him or something.

992
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,100
I just wrote a note of that.

993
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:13,100
I was going through our like iMessage thread trying to piece together what this show was.

994
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:14,100
Yeah.

995
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:24,100
And I think the dad deaths segues into he talks about the like the great tornado that hit Las Vegas and then simulates.

996
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,100
Las Vegas? Yes.

997
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:27,100
Is that real?

998
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:30,100
There was one in like twenty nineteen years. Someone posted on the thread.

999
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:31,100
That reasons?

1000
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:32,100
Yeah.

1001
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:33,100
That's your duster.

1002
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:38,100
Like anyway, he creates a tornado in the theater.

1003
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:43,100
They wheel out what three giant fans on stage that are like twenty feet tall.

1004
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:46,100
Taller than a house. Taller than a million dollar house.

1005
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:49,100
And they just turn them on and they just create a tornado inside it,

1006
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:54,100
which means they are just blasting garbage like into your mouth.

1007
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:56,100
So much trash.

1008
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,100
Just garbage starts flying.

1009
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,100
Just more trash than air in front of you.

1010
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:01,100
Just crumbled paper and trash and confetti.

1011
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:03,100
Just flying around this whole place.

1012
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:05,100
And we were all like, wow, this is actually pretty cool.

1013
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:09,100
And then it's like, and then it keeps going for like what felt like fifteen minutes.

1014
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:12,100
So we're all just like screaming, laughing because this thing doesn't stop.

1015
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:13,100
Nothing else is happening.

1016
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:15,100
And it's just like flying around going everywhere.

1017
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:17,100
And it's like really like we had we had drinks.

1018
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:20,100
They were going into our drinks. They were going into our mouths.

1019
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:24,100
If you and Eva had not gotten to a glass of wine, maybe it had a couple sips.

1020
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:28,100
And then just like now it's all just like literal toilet paper.

1021
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:32,100
It's just I don't know. I'm not going to ask if it's recycled or not.

1022
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,100
But either we even clean toilet paper.

1023
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:36,100
I don't want to get it in my beverage.

1024
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:38,100
Toilet paper, paper towel, confetti, cardboard.

1025
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,100
Yeah, just like hitting you in the face.

1026
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:43,100
It's just like a big roll. It's like something big.

1027
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:45,100
You would say ow once in a while.

1028
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:47,100
Yeah, it was so funny.

1029
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:49,100
We were all just looking at each other like we couldn't believe it was real.

1030
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:51,100
And that's how we closed the show.

1031
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:53,100
I think you just they do an encore of the trash tornado.

1032
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:55,100
They just do it again.

1033
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:58,100
They did the and now for the ending the middle again.

1034
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:02,100
I think because it's all on the floor already.

1035
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:06,100
And the fans just whip it right back up and spin it around again.

1036
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:10,100
And it was on the you remember it was on the floor at the beginning of the show because they don't.

1037
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:12,100
I think they don't clean the theater.

1038
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:14,100
So that's where the garbage starts. It starts on the floor.

1039
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:16,100
So you're walking into a theater full of garbage.

1040
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,100
It's a spoiler.

1041
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:20,100
It's a spoiler on the floor.

1042
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,100
This trash is from my dreams. You'll see.

1043
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:24,100
Oh, it was so good, though.

1044
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:26,100
I mean, I would have, you know, and that's when they said that.

1045
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:28,100
So the show abruptly closed like a few months after.

1046
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:31,100
Yeah, we see it drag going drops dead.

1047
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:33,100
The show closes and they lie.

1048
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:36,100
Like everything with Chris Angel is just a lie.

1049
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:40,100
And he's like, we're closing it so we can get ready for a big European tour.

1050
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:43,100
It's like there's no way they can travel those garbage fans.

1051
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:46,100
There's they wouldn't fit on an aircraft carrier.

1052
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:52,100
So the talent of the show really is just ownership of giant fans.

1053
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:54,100
That's what he's really displaying.

1054
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:56,100
I bought these or at least them.

1055
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,100
I don't know.

1056
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:00,100
Oh, the other thing, another detail he does.

1057
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:04,100
He saws a woman in half his female sidekick with a giant saw.

1058
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:05,100
You remember this, Scott?

1059
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:11,100
And then he goes, he tells the crowd, I go through a lot of women, but I always keep the lower part.

1060
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:16,100
And we're all like, oh, do I have sex with a pair of legs in a vagina?

1061
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:19,100
It's like, hey, fellas, isn't that what we all want?

1062
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:23,100
Get rid of that part that talks and laughs and loves.

1063
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:29,100
We found out in a review that they said this joke has survived like for Chris Angel show.

1064
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:33,100
Somehow I didn't remember it or see it before, but like he loves that joke so much.

1065
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:36,100
He's been doing it for like 15 or 20 years.

1066
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:41,100
You also, when you were on previously on the Kblip episode, you brought up a joke.

1067
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:48,100
This was before we had seen the show and you brought up a joke where he like, it was just like the width of something that's going to get cut through or a blade or something.

1068
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:52,100
And like three inches, three inches.

1069
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,100
And he did exactly that in this.

1070
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:59,100
Yes, it was always he brings a guy up from the audience and he's like, how thick do you think that is?

1071
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:00,100
And the guy's like, I don't know, three inches.

1072
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,100
And he's like, three inches.

1073
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:05,100
I bet you've said that before.

1074
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:07,100
Just like bring up a guy to humiliate him.

1075
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:08,100
Say yes.

1076
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:10,100
The premise is that he said it.

1077
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:12,100
He said this like three inches.

1078
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:13,100
Okay.

1079
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:14,100
Do you want to do this or not?

1080
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:15,100
Yes, it's hard.

1081
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:17,100
I'm sorry.

1082
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:19,100
Don't make me say it out loud.

1083
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:21,100
How did those jokes do in the room?

1084
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:22,100
Can I ask?

1085
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,100
Nothing did well.

1086
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:24,100
No one was laughing.

1087
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:27,100
I mean, no, my camera, my camera eats shit.

1088
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:28,100
Eat shit.

1089
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:29,100
It does terrible.

1090
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:30,100
That was the only thing we saw.

1091
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:35,100
I would check the like tickets, like the seating chart every night and see like no one's going to the show.

1092
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:40,100
And when we were there, like, yeah, there were over a thousand empty seats, I think.

1093
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:41,100
Right.

1094
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:42,100
Yeah.

1095
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:43,100
Yeah.

1096
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:48,100
Entire areas that you know, you could they were also starting to give away tickets completely for free.

1097
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:50,100
They're just like, how do we get bodies into this?

1098
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:59,100
We was not free for us because Jason, you had the determination to meet him because he was offering this for anyone who bought a certain.

1099
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:01,100
Who bought a certain level of ticket.

1100
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:02,100
Oh, yeah.

1101
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:04,100
So they said like, because there are more people there.

1102
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:08,100
We looked right before the show started and it was still completely empty besides our row.

1103
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:10,100
And then we went there and there were like a few hundred people there.

1104
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:15,100
And then you had a meet and greet after the show where if you bought a ticket, you meet Chris Angel.

1105
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:17,100
And then we get online with like a few hundred people.

1106
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:24,100
And then someone's like, this line is only for if you paid for tickets and like a hundred people leave.

1107
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:28,100
It's like, oh, yeah, everyone here is just comped to like, like they're just like handing out tickets.

1108
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:33,100
They're just like handing out tickets in the casino or, you know, beforehand or like half the place like taxi drivers.

1109
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:36,100
They're just like, please come, come be body.

1110
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:37,100
See the show.

1111
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:42,100
As soon as we saw the ticket prices, I slash them 25 percent.

1112
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:45,100
But so we did. OK, so we did that meet and greet.

1113
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,100
Yes.

1114
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:49,100
And we waited to meet him and you get a picture.

1115
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:52,100
And I was wrecked.

1116
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:57,100
And I was somebody handed me a drink that they decided they didn't want.

1117
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:01,100
And I was going to wrap it up because I did get my drink down before all the toilet paper went into it.

1118
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:06,100
And by the end of the line, by the time we got to him, I was definitely like, oh, boy.

1119
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:09,100
And now I get to meet Chris Angel. Whoa.

1120
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:17,100
And I also I was so just like blown away by the thing and in the spirit of it and just laughing so hard.

1121
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:25,100
And the sheer volume of trash on the floor was so crazy that I and I'm sorry if I embarrassed you or anyone.

1122
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:27,100
I was whether if you noticed or cared.

1123
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:33,100
But I just like took a lot of the long strings of toilet paper and just wore it like so many scarves.

1124
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:40,100
And I had like draping down from almost like, you know, like like the way Chris would dress with a bunch of like danglies and spiderwebs.

1125
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:46,100
So I'm draped in trash and drunk as we step up to actually meet Chris.

1126
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:49,100
So we go up to meet him. So I was recording the audio.

1127
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:53,100
I do have a clip. I weighed whether or not to play this.

1128
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:56,100
It's very embarrassing. It's extremely intimate.

1129
00:54:56,100 --> 00:55:01,100
This is me very drunkenly like gushing to Chris Angel.

1130
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:05,100
It was magical to watch because I was like, who's going to do the talking here?

1131
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:08,100
Not realizing you would do 100 percent.

1132
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:16,100
I went in so hard and also was not shy about my opinion of Mike Hammer and his comedy.

1133
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:22,100
I was like, I was trying to save the show. I was trying to make the show something better, something more entertaining.

1134
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:25,100
So this is a let's see if let's see.

1135
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:54,100
So much paper and plastic in my mouth.

1136
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:56,100
It was the most I've ever had.

1137
00:55:56,100 --> 00:56:01,100
It was so much paper in my mouth.

1138
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:05,100
I really, I really love this so much.

1139
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:08,100
I'm so like, I'm like just.

1140
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:11,100
That's why we're here. We will. We will. We love you.

1141
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:15,100
Totally immersive. More of your life.

1142
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:18,100
Then Tom Sharp, like he directed Borat.

1143
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:20,100
Like he just says that as we're walking away.

1144
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:21,100
And he said what?

1145
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:23,100
He's like, oh, OK.

1146
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:28,100
Like I think Tom was like, just like this is not like a mentally disabled guy.

1147
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:33,100
I know you might think that from how he's just telling you how much he loves you.

1148
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:35,100
I thought it was very constructive.

1149
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:38,100
I thought it was very kind and complimentary.

1150
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:42,100
I was trying to help. But it's definitely embarrassing to listen.

1151
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:45,100
I love you. You're incredible. Your life is incredible.

1152
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:48,100
Your life is incredible. I remember that in the moment.

1153
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:53,100
You know what? My metaphor for it, you know what it felt like to me was like,

1154
00:56:53,100 --> 00:57:00,100
you know, in Taken when Liam Neeson's on the phone and his daughter is going to get taken

1155
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:05,100
and he says, just shout anything you see, just like until you're out of the room,

1156
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:07,100
say anything you see about who's taking you.

1157
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:12,100
And that's how I've that's how that interaction seemed to me was that you were like,

1158
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:14,100
I know I'm only going to have 30 seconds here.

1159
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:19,100
And if I could get any of my real thoughts into his brain and register them.

1160
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:25,100
So I'm just going to fill the air with opinions from second one to second 30 and shout them all.

1161
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:27,100
And maybe one will actually impact. You know what?

1162
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:30,100
What I wasn't counting on was how phoned in the show is.

1163
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:33,100
And that is ultimately, and I'm sorry if you're listening, Chris,

1164
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:38,100
but I do think he's a lazy man and I don't I don't think he really tried.

1165
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:43,100
And what I was hoping for is like the Chris Angel like masterpiece,

1166
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:45,100
like really trying to be like this is what's moving to me.

1167
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:49,100
This is my life. This is like how I want to be remembered.

1168
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:53,100
And so to see it that night and see how phoned in it was and just like a bunch of,

1169
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:57,100
you know, filler basically it's and so much bad comedy.

1170
00:57:57,100 --> 00:58:02,100
And then, of course, we go through his Instagram later and see like Mike Hammer like there,

1171
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:06,100
besides Gary Oldman, I think is his like best friend in the world.

1172
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:08,100
They comment on each other's posts constantly.

1173
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:15,100
So I was like, I definitely wasn't winning any any fan like no angel by saying,

1174
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:17,100
oh, you got to cut that Mike Hammer guy. He sucks.

1175
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:22,100
He's not funny. Oldman sucks. That movie, the Churchill movie is boring.

1176
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:26,100
But I'm letting him do interviews. Cut him from your life.

1177
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:30,100
A few months later, he posted due to recent unforeseen events,

1178
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:35,100
a mystica is being converted to a touring show for international locations.

1179
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:39,100
Chris Angel will continue to feature and promote the production on his new television series,

1180
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:45,100
Chris Angels Magic with the Stars, which was a show that he he did.

1181
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:49,100
So basically they're like, look, we already filmed the show.

1182
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:52,100
He's going to be talking about it in every episode.

1183
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:56,100
But the show is closing because no one is seeing it.

1184
00:58:56,100 --> 00:59:03,100
The timeline is really insane of just what befell Chris Angel in this in this stretch of time.

1185
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:07,100
Show only opens in March. We saw it in April.

1186
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:14,100
September 30th, Dragon dies, which so funny to have like just the way this evolves.

1187
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:17,100
We're like, have you heard of Franco Dragon? Why?

1188
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:22,100
No, I have not. Suddenly we're on a text thread and I'm talking about Dragon every day.

1189
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:25,100
Wow, Dragon and Dragon's part of it. The legend Dragon.

1190
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:29,100
And then we're there. Dragon is here. Dragon is in front of me.

1191
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:32,100
Dragon is in front of me. Viva Dragon.

1192
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:41,100
Several months later, Dragon is dead from zero presence in my life at the beginning of twenty twenty two to deceased at the end.

1193
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:47,100
I always just this morning I watched a video and Scott, I sent it to you.

1194
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:49,100
It's like four or five minutes.

1195
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:57,100
It's from a channel on YouTube with a very generic name like I Hollywood TV.

1196
00:59:57,100 --> 01:00:11,100
Chris talking up a mystic so hard and he's like so I said it was very Trumpy because he's just talking such a big game and he's like there's seventy five illusion.

1197
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:14,100
Some video. I don't think there were three illusions.

1198
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:24,100
Yeah. Yeah. Maybe that was his trailer on his way because he has his own account with very intense trailers plugging his shows.

1199
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:32,100
And it was just so odd compared to what I knew your guys is experience was big fans and been racist comedy.

1200
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:34,100
And then we left. Yeah. Yeah.

1201
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:37,100
Garbage in your drinks. He was on this morning show.

1202
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:40,100
And when he well, OK, you heard how we describe the show.

1203
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:42,100
Now here's him before people had seen it.

1204
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:45,100
It's my story of how I became Chris Angel.

1205
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,100
But it's really everyone's story.

1206
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:50,100
It's the first spectacle after covid.

1207
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:52,100
We're bringing back optimism.

1208
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:55,100
It's the purest form of magic.

1209
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:57,100
The magic of emotion.

1210
01:00:57,100 --> 01:01:02,100
This is how he is building what we've just described as a grab bag hit or miss variety show.

1211
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:07,100
Yeah. Very big on saying it was the first big new show back after covid.

1212
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:12,100
You know, there's video of me walking down Las Vegas Boulevard, not a car in sight.

1213
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:16,100
And you can see a bus go through the background.

1214
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:18,100
And he's like, it was so weird.

1215
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:20,100
It's not a car.

1216
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:26,100
You know, but the TV show, The Magic with the Stars.

1217
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:29,100
Do you know the detail about that?

1218
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:32,100
Well, here I was going to say in the timeline.

1219
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:34,100
OK, so so September 30th, Dragon dies.

1220
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:38,100
October 14th, some headlines for Magic with the Stars.

1221
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:40,100
Is this what you were going to bring up?

1222
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:45,100
Just two weeks after his like is the guy who shepherded his show.

1223
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:48,100
Then like, all right, I guess I'll focus on my TV show.

1224
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:55,100
And then again, the Los Las Vegas Review Journal in published reports, R&B star

1225
01:01:55,100 --> 01:02:04,100
genuine was left gasping and lost consciousness after attempting a water escape routine,

1226
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:09,100
proving there is high risk on and off stage in Angel's empire.

1227
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:13,100
So he almost after his partner dies.

1228
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:20,100
Then I contend that almost certainly faked to try to get some press for the show.

1229
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:22,100
I hadn't thought of it at first.

1230
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:24,100
And then someone was like, there's no way.

1231
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:28,100
No, like, I think, yeah, that sounds like we got to get people writing about this.

1232
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:31,100
Let's what if I almost killed genuine?

1233
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:34,100
Are you saying do you think genuine was in on it or is he's like,

1234
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:37,100
we'll we'll leave him hanging for a couple of minutes.

1235
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:40,100
He locked the tank.

1236
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:44,100
Wait for it. Wait, when? Not till I give the signal.

1237
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:46,100
Sorry, genuine.

1238
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:50,100
You'll see it. It's going to get it's going to get butts in the seats that you show.

1239
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:53,100
It's hard to say because magic is like professional wrestling.

1240
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:59,100
It comes from the lineage of carnies where it's just like, oh, this could be amazing

1241
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:01,100
or it could be amazing. And you might also be lying.

1242
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:04,100
It just might also be a lot of lies.

1243
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:06,100
Wait, and when was the blip fire?

1244
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:09,100
So OK, so September 30th, I go and dies October 14th.

1245
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:12,100
Genuine almost dies October 16th.

1246
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:15,100
The final of Mystica is blamed on the death of Dragon.

1247
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:18,100
But also it was not nobody was ever there.

1248
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:23,100
Then I think early November reports of arson at his restaurant.

1249
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:27,100
Kaplip Kaplip almost burns down as an article pointed out an event

1250
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:30,100
that was oddly left unreported by the media.

1251
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:33,100
I think we're all still confused. We did all episode about it.

1252
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:38,100
I think we're still confused about the details of the Kaplip arson.

1253
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:42,100
I think Chris set his restaurant on fire to try to burn it down.

1254
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:45,100
Seem and keeping.

1255
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:50,100
And as typical with everything he does, it was like done incompetently and lazily.

1256
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:51,100
And it didn't work.

1257
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:56,100
The guy can't even like get his shit together, do a proper insurance scam.

1258
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:59,100
I do fire stuff all the time. We got a guy in the show.

1259
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:03,100
He's going to run through on fire. It's going to burn the restaurant.

1260
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:07,100
They just like one one wall got singed on the outside and they put it out.

1261
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:08,100
Damn.

1262
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:13,100
He didn't count on how good the Overton Fire Department.

1263
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:14,100
Neighbor runs out.

1264
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:17,100
Is everything OK? Should I call it? No, no, it's fine.

1265
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:21,100
Oh, Wilhand. No, it's it's probably better if it burns.

1266
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:25,100
Honestly, this place is ancient. You'll be glad it's gone.

1267
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:27,100
He's trying to tell the firefighters. No, it's OK.

1268
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:30,100
Don't worry about it. It'll be fine.

1269
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:33,100
So you're probably more needed somewhere else.

1270
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:37,100
The great city of Overton is probably someone having a heart attack.

1271
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:40,100
Go save class. Circle back.

1272
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:42,100
Oh, my cat's in a tree a block away.

1273
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:44,100
I can hear it. Do you hear it?

1274
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:47,100
Get my kitty out of the tree. Not the restaurant. I don't care.

1275
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:53,100
I'm just remembering now. Wasn't a mistake a part of some covid relief money scam?

1276
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:55,100
Well, I got all that too.

1277
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:58,100
Sorry, Scott, we don't mean to interrupt you.

1278
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:00,100
No, no, no. Things come back to us.

1279
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:03,100
We made such a mistake not getting the covid money for this podcast.

1280
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:05,100
I really think we could have done it.

1281
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:10,100
I think PPP loans are like the most successful scam in the history of the country.

1282
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:12,100
We should have done it. And we didn't. Yes.

1283
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:14,100
I am mad about it. Kind of legitimately upset with us.

1284
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:17,100
OK, wait, Scott. OK, you're ahead of me on this.

1285
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:20,100
The number I had forgotten.

1286
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:22,100
The number. Well, do I build it up?

1287
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:25,100
Do I build it up? OK, all right, I'll do this.

1288
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:30,100
Loans given to his company Magic Revolution LLC.

1289
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:33,100
Six point six million dollars.

1290
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:35,100
I'm reading 11 million on that.

1291
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:41,100
Well, you see, that is filled in by the four point three million given to Angel Productions Worldwide Inc.

1292
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:44,100
OK, so that's what this was. So when you add them together, 11 million.

1293
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:48,100
OK, so I forgot this aspect of it and it makes everything click into place.

1294
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:51,100
Is that he had this name he thought of when he was 13.

1295
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:54,100
Covid happened and he's like the government's giving it drag.

1296
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:56,100
Go and the government's got they split the money.

1297
01:05:56,100 --> 01:06:01,100
Dragone has a you look at his wiki, a massive history of tax fraud allegations.

1298
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:05,100
Yes, a huge scandal in 2012.

1299
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:08,100
Scammers who were like Chris Angel's like, give us the late show.

1300
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:10,100
Get 11 million dollars.

1301
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:15,100
Put together a show for a few hundred thousand dollars and the show will be disaster enclosed.

1302
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:19,100
And they fucking kept the money and then Dragone was probably going to spill any fucking killed him.

1303
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:25,100
Allegedly, allegedly, allegedly, allegedly for everyone in the room.

1304
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:27,100
Chris, it is getting too hot.

1305
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:29,100
That's really good about this.

1306
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:30,100
Shut up, Dragone.

1307
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:32,100
I'm going to clear my head in Egypt for a little while.

1308
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:34,100
Yes, you do that.

1309
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:36,100
I got you a trip to Egypt, Dragone.

1310
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:37,100
He suggested it.

1311
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:39,100
Why don't you go take a nice, relaxing trip?

1312
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:42,100
You fucking killed him and then closed the show.

1313
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:44,100
Oh my God, I have no doubt in my mind.

1314
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:47,100
It is weighing on me so much, Chris.

1315
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:50,100
I'm not like you with your magic and your secrets.

1316
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:51,100
I have to tell what my secrets are.

1317
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:53,100
Dragone, get in the big box.

1318
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:54,100
I want to show you a new trick.

1319
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:55,100
Get in the big box.

1320
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:56,100
I have an ass been there.

1321
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:58,100
I've always wanted to show you.

1322
01:06:58,100 --> 01:06:59,100
That was the other thing.

1323
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:01,100
He auctioned off all of his tricks like a few years ago.

1324
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:02,100
Do you remember that?

1325
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:03,100
Yeah, right.

1326
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:04,100
He sold everything.

1327
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:07,100
He sold all his wires and big cages.

1328
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:09,100
OK, this was a COVID relief scam.

1329
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:11,100
That's what a Mystica was.

1330
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:13,100
I can't believe we forgot that part of it.

1331
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:18,100
Wait, because a Mystica, the subtitle was like the mystery revealed, right?

1332
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:21,100
It was called a Mystica, the secret revealed.

1333
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:23,100
That was the full name of the show.

1334
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:25,100
It's still listed as that on chrisangel.com.

1335
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:28,100
They forgot to take down the page on chrisangel.com.

1336
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:31,100
It still says get your tickets now with the official trailer.

1337
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:36,100
And the secret revealed, yeah, the secret is that it was a COVID scam.

1338
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:42,100
I think there's never been an episode that would make one person more furious.

1339
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:44,100
Maybe of any podcast.

1340
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:49,100
You know what he might, I mean, because I know I met this magician Harrison Greenbaum,

1341
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:54,100
a really talented guy, funny guy who does the show at New York, New York.

1342
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:58,100
And he did that fake kablit menu website.

1343
01:07:58,100 --> 01:07:59,100
Oh, yeah.

1344
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:02,100
And Chris's lawyers pounced on him.

1345
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:06,100
So let me know if you guys get any emails.

1346
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:07,100
Yeah, sure.

1347
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:09,100
Well, you might know before us.

1348
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:11,100
You've been worth cutting.

1349
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:12,100
I might start with you.

1350
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:14,100
No, everything I say is satirical, obviously.

1351
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:16,100
This is a comedy podcast.

1352
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:19,100
It's an important comedy podcast about theme parks.

1353
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:22,100
And that's where all we make up crazy make-em-ups.

1354
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:24,100
There's stuff that we don't think.

1355
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:30,100
The cold open of this episode is just one of us saying allegedly dozens of times.

1356
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:32,100
Ugliness, satire.

1357
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:35,100
We just need to spray allegedlys all over this episode,

1358
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:41,100
like so many bits of trash being spewed out by giant fans.

1359
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:44,100
A hurricane of allegedlys.

1360
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:46,100
He 100% killed him.

1361
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:49,100
Okay.

1362
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:53,100
Only you with the poor amount of money here.

1363
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:58,100
You know Jason's uncomfortable if he brings up the guest's money.

1364
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:00,100
Not the first time.

1365
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:03,100
He did Borat.

1366
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:05,100
We all know Borat.

1367
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:07,100
We all love Borat.

1368
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:08,100
Oh my god.

1369
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:12,100
This has a good arc to it that we did solve the mystery of the Mystica.

1370
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:14,100
What is the mystery?

1371
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:15,100
Solve it.

1372
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:16,100
It might take you months.

1373
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:18,100
You might have to do a podcast about it.

1374
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:20,100
He might be proud of us for figuring it out.

1375
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:21,100
Yeah.

1376
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:22,100
Because we figured out the mystery.

1377
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:24,100
Boys, you did it.

1378
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:29,100
So many fools never learned, never figured out the truth, secrets.

1379
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:31,100
It was like the producers though.

1380
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:32,100
Yeah.

1381
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:37,100
But with some new tricks that the producers themselves didn't figure out.

1382
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:40,100
There's so many scams around this time.

1383
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:42,100
This is just one of the most high profile ones.

1384
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:44,100
There was another guy, this is lower scale,

1385
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:47,100
but there was a comedy hypnotist named Marc Savard.

1386
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:53,100
He got $300,000 presumably to keep his show open.

1387
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:54,100
That's the idea of the loans.

1388
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:57,100
Now you have to keep working and keep paying people.

1389
01:09:57,100 --> 01:10:02,100
As soon as he got it, he said, well, due to mask mandates, we're closing.

1390
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:05,100
We got it, these masks.

1391
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:07,100
But why?

1392
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:09,100
I'm with you, Mike.

1393
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:14,100
I think everyone listening should be upset that you didn't get in on the loans too.

1394
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:16,100
I assume that people listening didn't get in on the loans.

1395
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:17,100
Most of them.

1396
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:19,100
The people who did are laughing and laughing at us.

1397
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:20,100
Us the fools.

1398
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:21,100
Of course.

1399
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:23,100
It's a sexual business.

1400
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:25,100
It's like registered.

1401
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:27,100
That's right.

1402
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:29,100
Guests to pay.

1403
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:34,100
Yes, even though COVID did not impact the production of the show in almost any way.

1404
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:37,100
There was a half second delay when we would make a joke

1405
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:39,100
and not know if the other thought it was funny.

1406
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:42,100
There would be all these times where we'd go, no, no, no, you go.

1407
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:45,100
I'd have to cut those out when I was editing.

1408
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:47,100
That's worth $100,000.

1409
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:50,100
You deserve $100,000 for your editing suffering.

1410
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:55,100
Well, look, when Trump gets back in, we'll retroactively do it.

1411
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:57,100
Yeah, when the next one.

1412
01:10:57,100 --> 01:10:59,100
The new round.

1413
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:01,100
That's it.

1414
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:03,100
We cracked the mystery.

1415
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:06,100
Any final observations about this thing?

1416
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:08,100
Is it possible to run this through?

1417
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:15,100
I've half-assedly tried to do the rules of Blackjack with the things that we've talked about.

1418
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:17,100
What should these things have done?

1419
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:21,100
Should they have hit or stood or doubled down or cashed out?

1420
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:25,100
What should have happened to Chris?

1421
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:27,100
Did he not do enough?

1422
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:29,100
Should he have done a third show?

1423
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:31,100
Is that the problem?

1424
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:33,100
I think he did cash out.

1425
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:35,100
I think he did the ultimate cash out.

1426
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:37,100
We were expecting too much of him, I think.

1427
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:39,100
His heart's not in it.

1428
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:41,100
I think he's a businessman.

1429
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:43,100
He's just in it to grab cash.

1430
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:50,100
And he grabbed cash while we all ate trash.

1431
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:52,100
There you go.

1432
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:55,100
Yeah, for us, it was a trash grab.

1433
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:57,100
And I did.

1434
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:59,100
I wore it.

1435
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:01,100
I proudly wore it.

1436
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:03,100
And I had a good time doing it.

1437
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:05,100
I wouldn't have done it without you.

1438
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:07,100
Jason, thank you for being the lightning rod that got me to a Mystica.

1439
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:09,100
Thank you.

1440
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:11,100
To a magical evening.

1441
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:17,100
And we found the underground house that was also about cryonics.

1442
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:19,100
That was a very strange experience.

1443
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:23,100
Yeah, there was a whole other weird scheme being run.

1444
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:25,100
Whatever the underground house is.

1445
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:27,100
Do these places find you or do you find them?

1446
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:29,100
I don't know. I just keep my eyes out for stuff.

1447
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:31,100
We found out there was an underground house in Las Vegas.

1448
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:33,100
Wait a second.

1449
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:37,100
In 2016, it was listed at $48 million.

1450
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:39,100
The cryonics house?

1451
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:41,100
No, this is a different one.

1452
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:43,100
Okay.

1453
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:47,100
Listener, if you want to know what we're talking about, there's a really easy and fun way,

1454
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:53,100
which is look up the Imagine Dragons music video called, I believe, Monday.

1455
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:55,100
Watch this music video.

1456
01:12:55,100 --> 01:13:03,100
And this was entirely filmed in this bizarre underground house that's meant to be an indoor-outdoor house,

1457
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:07,100
except it's all in a bunker so that it's meant to survive an apocalypse.

1458
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:09,100
We were at a place where this was filmed.

1459
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:11,100
Undergroundhouse.Vegas.

1460
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:13,100
And that's the house's official website.

1461
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:19,100
And yeah, it was built as a bunker, but I don't think it had any kind of nuclear bunker qualities.

1462
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:21,100
It's just underground.

1463
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:23,100
And I had no plan that you could live there.

1464
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:25,100
So it couldn't survive?

1465
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:29,100
No, I think it has a ventilation system so you can breathe air.

1466
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:31,100
But if there was a nuke, you would just die pretty quick.

1467
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:33,100
I think you could survive.

1468
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:35,100
There's like 16 hours of air that you would live on.

1469
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:39,100
So everybody in the underground house would get a lot of phone calls like,

1470
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:41,100
hey, you got any room in there?

1471
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:45,100
And then lots of people rush down and then just die two seconds after everybody.

1472
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:47,100
I bet it's still for sale.

1473
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:50,100
It's 3970 Spencer Street, Vegas.

1474
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:54,100
It is still currently listed at $5.9 million.

1475
01:13:54,100 --> 01:14:01,100
And if you look at the listing history, yeah, it's been on Zillow 188 days, but we went more than that ago.

1476
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:07,100
So I think it's probably taken off and put back with a different price a few times.

1477
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:09,100
And it was built in the 60s.

1478
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:11,100
It's really cool.

1479
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:15,100
Oh yeah, it was listed in 2019 for $18 million.

1480
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:17,100
It's weird though.

1481
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:19,100
It's a weird house.

1482
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:21,100
You never want to live there.

1483
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:23,100
You'd go insane living there.

1484
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:25,100
It's cool to walk around.

1485
01:14:25,100 --> 01:14:27,100
It was run by a guy who was like a big cryonics guy.

1486
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:32,100
He went into the room and he talked about how his body was going to be in there for like 40,000 years and whatever.

1487
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:35,100
It felt kind of like Sex House kind of vibes.

1488
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:36,100
It felt like...

1489
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:38,100
Yeah, there were like poles.

1490
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:40,100
I think you could rent it for parties.

1491
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:43,100
It was like a club random with a cryonics chamber.

1492
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:45,100
Bill wishes.

1493
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:47,100
Easy, easy, don't get too excited.

1494
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:49,100
They weren't doing tours.

1495
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:54,100
So another, I'll give you another little scoop, a little confession here.

1496
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:57,100
We had to pretend that we were interested in buying it.

1497
01:14:57,100 --> 01:15:02,100
And so I emailed the realtor and was like, hey, you think you could get us on a tour of this underground house?

1498
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:03,100
Yeah, do you want to buy it?

1499
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:05,100
I was like, yes.

1500
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:07,100
And so, you know, we can't afford that.

1501
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:13,100
We had to pool like the finances from like a bunch of us on the trip and send financial statements and be like...

1502
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:15,100
And I said, yeah, we're from a company.

1503
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:19,100
I'll read what I texted the thread for our backstory when we were heading over.

1504
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:25,100
We are from a yet to be announced venture considering buying property as a Vegas headquarters.

1505
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:30,100
We're working mostly on metaverse focused ventures with an AI machine learning bent.

1506
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:35,100
As we gear up, we're also launching a vertical and streaming production.

1507
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:38,100
So I was like, everyone remember this is what we're doing.

1508
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:40,100
I don't think I remember there was an AI.

1509
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:42,100
This is well, this is 2022.

1510
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:44,100
A little head of the curve.

1511
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:50,100
And so the guy gave us a tour, but I think he could kind of see through us that we just wanted to check out the underground house.

1512
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:53,100
But you can do that with any realtor, even mansions.

1513
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:56,100
You just have to convince them that you could afford a down payment.

1514
01:15:56,100 --> 01:16:01,100
So between like four of us, we showed if we had a, you know, showed your Eva one of them.

1515
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:04,100
You showed your real financial information.

1516
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:07,100
That was the only way that they would let us in.

1517
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:10,100
Sound like IMDb's and stuff.

1518
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:13,100
And then this guy's other business, he was very sweet guy and showed us around.

1519
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:16,100
And then he had, he sold this money.

1520
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:19,100
Do you remember he sold money with gold in the money?

1521
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:21,100
He's like, this money will never lose value.

1522
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:25,100
He sold gold embedded his own cash.

1523
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:27,100
He made it.

1524
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:33,100
It's not like a U.S. currency that he just like, no, it's like, I mean, I don't know if it has his picture instead of a president.

1525
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:38,100
But basically it's like, he's like, this is money that cannot lose value because there's gold in the money.

1526
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:39,100
Okay.

1527
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:40,100
Can I hold the money?

1528
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:41,100
It's called.

1529
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:42,100
Sure you can.

1530
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:44,100
Goldback maybe.

1531
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:45,100
Is this it?

1532
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:46,100
What?

1533
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:47,100
Are goldbacks legal?

1534
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:49,100
I think this is it.

1535
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:54,100
They are not accepted as legal tender by the federal government.

1536
01:16:54,100 --> 01:17:04,100
Goldback has a Wikipedia page and check out Goldback if you want to, you know, survive in our coming apocalypsy kind of world that we're going to be entering pretty soon.

1537
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:06,100
Listeners, here's your hot tip.

1538
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:08,100
Get all your money into goldbacks.

1539
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:09,100
In the goldbacks.

1540
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:21,100
And if like a bunch, you know, hey, if a bunch of listeners met and got along at the Groove Blender and decided we get along great, we all like to live in Las Vegas forever together, then just send all your information to the underground house.

1541
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:23,100
Go to the website.

1542
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:24,100
And I love the idea.

1543
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:26,100
Just invite us over once in a while.

1544
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:31,100
Let us come party at the house that a dozen fans all share together.

1545
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:34,100
With waist high stacks of goldbacks.

1546
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:35,100
Yeah.

1547
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:37,100
We promise we won't take your gold back.

1548
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:38,100
Uncle Scrooge diving into the goldbacks.

1549
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:44,100
They said one Vegas goldback is worth $3.75 at the end of 2021.

1550
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:45,100
So that's not too bad.

1551
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:46,100
Okay.

1552
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:47,100
They've been appreciating.

1553
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:48,100
Geez.

1554
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:49,100
Okay.

1555
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:50,100
Well, hot tip.

1556
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:51,100
Oh, now it's worth four bucks.

1557
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:52,100
Hey, shit.

1558
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:53,100
Is that just while we've been recording?

1559
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:54,100
The world's first.

1560
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:57,100
In the episodes so we can survive goldbacks.

1561
01:17:57,100 --> 01:18:04,100
Just check out goldback.com, the world's first physical interchangeable gold money that is designed to accommodate even small transactions.

1562
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:07,100
How's the website look reputable?

1563
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:08,100
Definitely.

1564
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:10,100
I'm going to put all my money in goldbacks.

1565
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:11,100
Okay.

1566
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:12,100
Okay.

1567
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:13,100
Well, then I'll see here.

1568
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:17,100
I'll start winding it down while you while you get out your wallet and start and make your first gold back.

1569
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:18,100
This is great.

1570
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:20,100
I'm a certified wallet inspector.

1571
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:23,100
So I'll start the process.

1572
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:31,100
But for now, I'm so glad we caught you before you became a goldback millionaire.

1573
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:35,100
Jason Warner, you survived podcast the right in city nights.

1574
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:37,100
Thank you for closing it out with us.

1575
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:40,100
We couldn't do this, especially this month without you.

1576
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:41,100
Thank you guys.

1577
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:42,100
What a always a pleasure.

1578
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:50,100
Happy to come over and shit talk and burn bridges, criminal, make enemies and criminal anger.

1579
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:59,100
People who have been litigious against people, you know, I mean, Chris, like you think there's a possibility that Chris Angel hasn't killed people.

1580
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:04,100
Well, we'll all be the first to find out if I die.

1581
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:07,100
This will be crazy to listen to if I die mysteriously.

1582
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:12,100
And weirdly, they know what was so well, we dedicate the series to Jason Walters memory.

1583
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:15,100
At a certain point, I just wouldn't be able to buy a ticket to his show.

1584
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:16,100
I've been thrown out of there.

1585
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:19,100
I've harassed him.

1586
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:23,100
You yelled a bunch of stuff at him while meeting him.

1587
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:24,100
Life is incredible.

1588
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:29,100
You said your life is incredible in a way that he could maybe question.

1589
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:38,100
I also like remember I said this on the show, too, that he's like we we said we all went to Kiblipp when he was like, oh, come on.

1590
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:40,100
We went your arrest. That is a commitment.

1591
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:41,100
We all live in Los Angeles.

1592
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:44,100
We flew into this town, drove an hour more in an hour.

1593
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:49,100
That's based on the lie that's on your website that says 45 minutes bullshit.

1594
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:51,100
We did the drive. That's our 15 minimum.

1595
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:57,100
We all did it and then and came and what three of us are wearing the shirts and your response is.

1596
01:19:57,100 --> 01:20:02,100
There's more shirts in the hotel rooms, too, because you brought us.

1597
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:05,100
I mean, you could just like eyeballing security.

1598
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:11,100
He was dripping with disdain at the indignity of having to meet fans because the show was not selling tickets.

1599
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:14,100
Like this was not what he wanted to be doing.

1600
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:17,100
Look, the hogs are going to get me.

1601
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:18,100
This is what it will also.

1602
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:20,100
You know, one more thing before I write it down.

1603
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:35,100
Do you remember how I don't know what order to present this in that you you say that he phoned it in and yet the stress seemed very high with him because he's trying to mount this show because we all went out to dinner at the nice restaurant next to the theater.

1604
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:42,100
And then we were so I think I went to the bathroom and then I came back like I'd seen a ghost but better than a ghost.

1605
01:20:42,100 --> 01:20:44,100
I was like this part of the story.

1606
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:45,100
There's a little room.

1607
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:51,100
It's like the private dining room and the walls are lined with nice bottles of wine and he is in there.

1608
01:20:51,100 --> 01:20:57,100
It's him and he it looks like he's got like a bunch of papers out like as if he's doing his taxes.

1609
01:20:57,100 --> 01:21:03,100
He had a bunch of receipts out and he had little glasses on like what Homer wears when he's dealing with business.

1610
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:04,100
Little half glasses.

1611
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:05,100
Hmm.

1612
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:10,100
And and then and I think you then tried to tap on the glass.

1613
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:13,100
Yeah, I tried to get his attention.

1614
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:17,100
I tried to talk to the guard and I was like, hey, oh, hey, we're seeing him.

1615
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:18,100
We're here to see the show.

1616
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:21,100
I was like, yeah, he's not talking to you.

1617
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:23,100
Mr. Angel is a busy man.

1618
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:25,100
Mr. Angel is a busy man.

1619
01:21:25,100 --> 01:21:31,100
So you escorted out of the theater, escorted out of a Ruth's dress.

1620
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:38,100
But then there on it, I was going through Instagrams from this era and there is a photo of exactly what we saw.

1621
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:43,100
A view of him in the little wine room with the half glass looking so stressed out.

1622
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:45,100
And here is the caption.

1623
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:51,100
My life, a tortured creator striving to turn imagination into reality.

1624
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:58,100
Months of creative challenges focused on achieving that one incredible moment that makes it all worthwhile.

1625
01:21:58,100 --> 01:22:05,100
Then in the blink of an eye, I'm back to the monster I created and have become a slave to.

1626
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:11,100
I mean, the incredible moment is checking his account balance to see like the covid money came through.

1627
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:13,100
That's the moment it made it worthwhile.

1628
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:15,100
And the stress is definitely like, what do you mean?

1629
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:24,100
I got to pay the dancers like as like the money that he's like trying to like scam is getting less and less with how expensive the show is like it's fucking garbage.

1630
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:25,100
How much could it cost?

1631
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:27,100
Well, it's like a whole theater full of paper.

1632
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:29,100
You're going to need like a thousand bucks a night.

1633
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:31,100
It's trash.

1634
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:32,100
You reuse it.

1635
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:34,100
Go to the dumpsters.

1636
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:36,100
It's what they deserve.

1637
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:38,100
Well, it gets in people's mouths, Chris.

1638
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:40,100
It's got to be clean trash.

1639
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:41,100
Little clean.

1640
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:44,100
Ah, they must have clean trash in my mouth.

1641
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:47,100
These demanding sons of bitches.

1642
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:50,100
What do you mean the syringes in the dumpster?

1643
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:52,100
People get stuck with syringes.

1644
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:53,100
People probably use them.

1645
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:55,100
There's no liquid of any kind in the syringes anymore.

1646
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:58,100
There might be nice stuff in the syringes.

1647
01:22:58,100 --> 01:22:59,100
Get some high.

1648
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:00,100
They're probably all junkies.

1649
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:03,100
All these people are going to look like the end of the movie Beethoven.

1650
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:04,100
That's what I think.

1651
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:05,100
Dragon.

1652
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:08,100
The show was meant to tank and close.

1653
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:11,100
Actually, when you go on Ticketmaster, you would go on.

1654
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:14,100
And if you search Chris Angel, a mystical would not show up.

1655
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:17,100
He did not put his name in the title of the listing.

1656
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:23,100
So even if you're a huge Chris Angel fan and we're going to Vegas, you couldn't even search and find that show.

1657
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:28,100
So I think what probably happened is he was just like, we won't spend any money on it.

1658
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:33,100
It'll close and move on and then we'll keep the money.

1659
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:36,100
And Dragon was probably like, Chris, we can turn this around.

1660
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:38,100
We can make this better, Chris.

1661
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:41,100
And the Dragon magic, it's in me.

1662
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:42,100
I can do this.

1663
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:44,100
And that's why he had to pay the price.

1664
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:50,100
Which could have been the price of a meal or a gold back transaction.

1665
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:51,100
We don't know.

1666
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:53,100
Jason has not fully defined what the price was.

1667
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:59,100
Do you think any time like one of his employees is giving him trouble, he's like, you look stressed.

1668
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:01,100
Maybe you need a trip to Cairo.

1669
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:04,100
He's like, OK, I'm backing off, Chris.

1670
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:05,100
Forget it, Chris. I'm fine.

1671
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:06,100
I'm fine.

1672
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:07,100
I know this really nice spa.

1673
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:12,100
There's a great Jacuzzi you can get in with a lid that closes on top of it.

1674
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:14,100
Genuine knows all about that one.

1675
01:24:16,100 --> 01:24:18,100
Genuine almost took a trip to Cairo.

1676
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:21,100
All right. You survived you long ago.

1677
01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:23,100
So let me now say, well, let me ask.

1678
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:28,100
I'm never sure when I make this offer, but let's exit through the gift shop.

1679
01:24:28,100 --> 01:24:29,100
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

1680
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:32,100
No, we're striking.

1681
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:33,100
Yeah, nothing right now.

1682
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:34,100
That's right. You can't. Yes.

1683
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:35,100
I'm not plugging.

1684
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:37,100
I'm not. No, I have nothing coming out right now.

1685
01:24:37,100 --> 01:24:38,100
Everything's coming out.

1686
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:39,100
Unless New York Times.

1687
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:40,100
I don't know if you.

1688
01:24:40,100 --> 01:24:41,100
Oh, when does this episode come out?

1689
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:43,100
Soon. It might be out.

1690
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:48,100
Oh, well, I've heard August 20th, New York Times.

1691
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:55,100
There's going to be a mention of my animatronic robot, Dale, that I built and have been performing within Los Angeles.

1692
01:24:55,100 --> 01:24:56,100
Yes.

1693
01:24:56,100 --> 01:24:58,100
You could probably do a whole episode on that.

1694
01:24:58,100 --> 01:25:03,100
Jason, if there's any if there is any possible Dale interaction, if we could have him, if we could.

1695
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:07,100
I don't want to go supposing because Dale is a mindblower.

1696
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:11,100
Dale is more mind blowing than even Chris Angel's incredible house.

1697
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:12,100
It really is genuine.

1698
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:16,100
You have like you really have like created something pretty unreal.

1699
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:18,100
Better than anything Disney's done lately.

1700
01:25:18,100 --> 01:25:19,100
Yeah, I agree.

1701
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:21,100
Being that Disney's not doing anything lately.

1702
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:27,100
So yeah, read about Jason's animatronic cowboy in the New York Times.

1703
01:25:27,100 --> 01:25:29,100
I'm so psyched about this.

1704
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:30,100
Hopefully. Fingers crossed.

1705
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:31,100
Maybe it'll get cut.

1706
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:33,100
But yeah, check it out.

1707
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:34,100
Geez, great.

1708
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:36,100
Well, congrats and thanks for closing out the series with us.

1709
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:38,100
So happy to have you.

1710
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:43,100
As for us, we really hope you have enjoyed podcast the ride Sin City Nights.

1711
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:47,100
For anybody who came out to the Groove Blender, thank you so much.

1712
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:51,100
Hope you've enjoyed kind of getting off of your regularly scheduled theme park programming.

1713
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:52,100
We've really loved it.

1714
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:59,100
If you want to do this again, if we should do a Sin City Nights to raise your voice, I don't know to who to us.

1715
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:02,100
It's not like you have to tell forever dog to let us know.

1716
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:03,100
I don't know.

1717
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:04,100
It's up to us.

1718
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:05,100
Right to the Las Vegas press.

1719
01:26:05,100 --> 01:26:07,100
Let them know to give us good reviews.

1720
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:10,100
And if we see an article, then we'll do another one of these.

1721
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:12,100
But I hope so because there's so much Vegas.

1722
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:14,100
I think we left on the table.

1723
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:16,100
And I'd love to do more.

1724
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:18,100
Thank you, Mike, for the Sin City Nights theme.

1725
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:19,100
It's a banger.

1726
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:20,100
Thank you, Aaron, for the logo.

1727
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:21,100
It's wonderful.

1728
01:26:21,100 --> 01:26:29,100
We now, after all this stuff, after a bunch of mega episodes, we're going to take a summer break, at least two weeks, on the main feed.

1729
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:36,100
But the party keeps going on the Patreon, as always.

1730
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:37,100
So bonus episodes are there.

1731
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:41,100
Podcasts are at the second gate or on the VIP tier Club 3.

1732
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:44,100
All of that at patreon.com slash podcast the ride.

1733
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:47,100
But for now, the Sin City Nights are over.

1734
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:52,100
The dawn is coming across the breaking across the horizon.

1735
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:57,100
And I guess we go back to mostly Anaheim and Orlando days.

1736
01:26:57,100 --> 01:26:58,100
Yeah.

1737
01:26:58,100 --> 01:26:59,100
Mostly.

1738
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:01,100
But, you know, sometimes.

1739
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:03,100
Talk about a lot of fucking other bullshit, too.

1740
01:27:03,100 --> 01:27:04,100
Yeah.

1741
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:05,100
Yeah, mostly Aerosmith.

1742
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:07,100
It's like Hop in the Grave.

1743
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:08,100
Oh, yeah.

1744
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:09,100
Bye, Jason.

1745
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:10,100
All right.

1746
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:13,100
And now for Jason's trip to Cairo.

1747
01:27:13,100 --> 01:27:14,100
Forever.

1748
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:15,100
Dog.

1749
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:22,100
