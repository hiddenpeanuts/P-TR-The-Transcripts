1
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,900
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,820
Hello, this is podcast the ride host Jason Chardon.

3
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,420
If you're a regular second gate listener, hello and welcome home.

4
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,900
If you're new to the second gate, welcome to the show.

5
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,600
We want to assure you that your entertainment is our top priority.

6
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,680
Not only on our world class theme park episodes, but all our episodes.

7
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,680
From the ones about made for TV movies that haunt us,

8
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,780
to the ones about hyper rich unpleasant men that also haunt us.

9
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:55,560
We're glad that you're here and hope that you enjoy your second gate experience.

10
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:56,880
Wow.

11
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,180
Thank you.

12
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:58,500
Yes.

13
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,600
With real buddy energy.

14
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,540
Buddy, I got the buddy vibe.

15
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,780
Buddy, what's the Riz?

16
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,380
Yeah, I got the buddy Riz.

17
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,780
I got that buddy Dyer Riz.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,020
Buddy Dyer, not buddy Dwyer.

19
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,460
Oh yeah, Matt Cardona texted me a correction on that too.

20
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:14,800
Sure.

21
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:21,760
My brain just auto completing infamous corrupt Pennsylvania official Barbara Dwyer.

22
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,200
Look, this is okay.

23
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,660
Just to order things.

24
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,560
This is an episode about the Orlando airport tram.

25
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,300
But since we're here already, yes.

26
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,320
Scott Caron or Mike Carlson.

27
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:33,600
Jason, not Sheridan, hi.

28
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:41,100
Yes, part of this was something that fueled me wanting to turn it from episode joke to actual episode.

29
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,560
Quickly was to get ahead of this.

30
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:49,560
That yes, you get on the tram, the little ride that you go on at the Orlando airport,

31
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,300
to get you to the main terminal.

32
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,620
And there's this message, this delightfully stiff message from Orlando mayor Buddy Dyer.

33
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:05,540
And when it came up in an episode a month or so ago, all of us unilaterally said, I think we said buddy,

34
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,540
but we made it Buddy Dwyer.

35
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,140
Dwyer.

36
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,600
And Bud Dwyer is the corrupt Pennsylvania.

37
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,400
Treasurer.

38
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,600
Treasurer who was about to go to jail for bribery for a long time.

39
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,720
For a lot of bribery.

40
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,440
No, no, a lot of different charges against him.

41
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,720
And for like 55 years.

42
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:37,520
And he took care of that by holding a weird scattered press conference where then he pulled a gun out of a bag and shot himself.

43
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,800
And this is the note we're opening 2024 on.

44
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,600
Happy New Year.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,020
But it is really funny that we put that out there for Ed said it like because nobody look,

46
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,520
there's mistakes worth getting mad about.

47
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,680
I don't think anyone was mad at us.

48
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,200
This is the easiest confusion.

49
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,520
It's so strange that there's two politicians, that there's Buddy Dyer and Bud Dwyer.

50
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,000
Yes.

51
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:10,520
But I guess the mix up is gets funny in that Buddy Dyer seems like a very pleasant, well liked politician.

52
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,120
Yes.

53
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,040
Bud Dwyer, a guy who encounters.

54
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,200
Kind of infamous.

55
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,720
Things just played out very strangely.

56
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:26,800
And it was weird what he made people see happen on live television in some cases.

57
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,800
That's one of the strangest things ever.

58
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,280
But we wanted to get ahead of that.

59
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,160
Because we love this thing.

60
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,380
We love that you get a little ride when you land in Orlando.

61
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:39,100
You do not hear a welcome message from.

62
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,540
Or Bud Dwyer.

63
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:45,560
Yes, from a corrupt politician who shot himself on live television, Bud Dwyer.

64
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:49,620
I did have when that came up before, I did have the like, man, it's weird.

65
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,740
There's another politician named Buddy Dwyer.

66
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,440
That's weird.

67
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,860
He wasn't Buddy.

68
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,600
He wasn't Buddy.

69
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,140
Bud is like, that shows you maybe.

70
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,940
That shows you there's not the friendliness that Buddy has.

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,940
He wasn't your buddy.

72
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,320
He was doing bad stuff.

73
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,680
And then he scarred a lot of people with his act on television.

74
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,640
But I think it's good to know.

75
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:21,720
Like, if you're worried about if you're if you're now withholding booking an Orlando vacation for yourself, there isn't a message from him.

76
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,820
You don't get a message recorded.

77
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,380
And when did that happen?

78
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,020
The late 80s.

79
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:34,580
You don't get a message recorded in like 87 from a guy saying, all right, if you're hearing this, it's all over for Bud.

80
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:41,920
But my final wish was to do the narration for the Orlando airport tram.

81
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,720
It was it's in my will.

82
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,340
I handed that to somebody at the press conference.

83
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:53,460
If my plan goes, it's in the future for me, I'm going to hand it to somebody at the press conference and then I'm going to do some other stuff.

84
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,040
They had to do it.

85
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,740
It's a legally binding document.

86
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,680
I don't know what it is.

87
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,780
I'm just I love I love Orlando.

88
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:01,860
I love that.

89
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,900
You know, it's I'm not going to get to see it, but I'm really looking forward to Maelstrom.

90
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,340
It looks like a lot of fun.

91
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,640
I'm going to see the trolls.

92
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,480
I wish I could.

93
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,060
But there's unfortunately things haven't worked out.

94
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,660
I'm a teacup guy.

95
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,460
I like their small world, even though it's indoors.

96
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,180
The facade isn't as fun.

97
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:27,280
But anyways, I'll tell you, the whole world is going to be the happiest place on earth once old Bud's gone.

98
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:34,720
You know, a part of it was I don't know that I know that I've seen that many dyers.

99
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,480
Dwyer, I feel like is more common name.

100
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,060
Yeah.

101
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,360
So I think I was reading my notes and I was like, oh, it can't be dire.

102
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,560
It must be Dwyer.

103
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:45,100
Mm hmm.

104
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,720
You know, it's really there to remember this.

105
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,120
You have to do the opposite.

106
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:57,120
But Buddy Dyer, the friendly mayor of Orlando, did not get himself into a dire situation.

107
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,160
No.

108
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,040
His corruption.

109
00:05:59,180 --> 00:05:59,560
Right.

110
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,380
Nor nor has he been a dire on television either.

111
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,320
So you have to you have to you got to flip them to remember.

112
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:16,320
So if that how just do the opposite of what you're because I it seems so likely that one of us will still trip up at some point.

113
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:16,940
It's possible.

114
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:24,920
Yeah, one of us will it'll become a pepo pepo maybe it'll be another one of those where I think now it's now I've thought about it too much.

115
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:25,320
Yeah.

116
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,820
It causes the mistake.

117
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,340
Right.

118
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:28,760
Right.

119
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,180
Yeah.

120
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:29,820
Yeah.

121
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,540
So anyways, there's that.

122
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,080
Well, we've cleared that out of the way.

123
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,520
Yeah.

124
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,080
That that aspect of it.

125
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,760
And now we can talk a little about, hey, you know what?

126
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,380
I thought this is a cool way to do it.

127
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:49,700
If this is the first episode of the second gate of twenty twenty four, the first episode is the first ride.

128
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,860
It's your first ride.

129
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,320
Oh, yeah.

130
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,420
First ride and your last if you're flying out of Orlando.

131
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,180
Mm hmm.

132
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,760
Your last ride, much like old Bud.

133
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,820
Oh, God.

134
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,660
This is going to be impossible to avoid.

135
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,240
At least we get out of the top now.

136
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,260
It should have been at the end.

137
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,260
Possibly.

138
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:13,120
Well, we started things on quite a note here.

139
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:18,540
But yes, look, it's it's a it's a really nice thing that you get.

140
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,380
And if you don't know, I mean, this is like a thing you for sure know if you fly into Orlando.

141
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:36,060
Maybe you haven't experienced it if you're a native or if you drive, if you've always driven in for your trips, then you have not experienced the fun little tram.

142
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:42,160
But basically, it's it's a layout of an airport, Orlando International Airport, MCO.

143
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:49,280
It's you know, main terminal is separate from the technical term airsides.

144
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,100
You got it.

145
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,040
You got to take the trams back and forth from the airsides.

146
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:53,940
That's where we are.

147
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,160
Are where you actually depart from.

148
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:01,680
But I think, you know, it's nice on the way out, but it's especially nice on the way in the land.

149
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,860
And to build up your excitement for a vacation that's going to be full of rides.

150
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,320
You get a fun little train ride right at the right at the top of your visit.

151
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,800
I think this is something we've all always enjoyed about Orlando vacation.

152
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,520
How could you not enjoy this?

153
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:22,540
I would think maybe if you really didn't have an affection for Monorails or Disney at all, maybe then it's like, just put me right at the gate.

154
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,940
Let me get right to the taxi.

155
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,380
But still, I think it's such a nice surprise if it's your first time.

156
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,300
Well, and you know what?

157
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:29,660
Yeah.

158
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,860
Get me right to the gate.

159
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,280
Sure.

160
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:40,140
But I find that like I was in analyzing what do I like about this little ride so much?

161
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:48,260
Part of it, I think, is look, the best flight, the most comfortable flight is still not a ton of fun.

162
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,000
There's hassle.

163
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:52,120
And then you land and immediately anticipate hassle.

164
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,320
You got to go deal with baggage.

165
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,740
You got to figure out how you're getting here or there.

166
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,140
You might be waiting or depending on the crash, especially like landing in L.

167
00:08:59,140 --> 00:08:59,320
A.

168
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,200
is horrible.

169
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,440
It's like such a zoo around there.

170
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,840
You know, so like L.

171
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:04,980
A.

172
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,140
X.

173
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:08,720
is a place where you land and then there's not a train that they make you get on.

174
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:14,560
But I almost wish there was because I feel like there's so much more hassle and unpleasantry.

175
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,760
It's like dirty there.

176
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,060
It's smart and angry in the air.

177
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:28,860
But like before you deal with anything, when you land in Orlando, you get this really pleasant little trip with depending on time of year,

178
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,820
maybe a nice little view of some trees, some Florida palm trees.

179
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,300
I think you get water.

180
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:42,480
I think you see a little lake or something, depending on which air side you're going back and forth from.

181
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,820
Maybe a gator or two.

182
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:44,900
You think so?

183
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,220
Have you ever seen a gator?

184
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:50,020
I've seen gators like landing or like when I was on the monorail.

185
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:50,980
You saw a gator land.

186
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,040
Oh, you and you landed.

187
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,620
You saw a gator on the monorail.

188
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,160
The gator wasn't landing somehow.

189
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,880
No, no.

190
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:03,320
I mean, like when the plane's about to land, if you look down, you can see gators.

191
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,800
I've seen a gator sunning itself.

192
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,580
Really?

193
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,440
But I think from the monorail too, I've seen them.

194
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,300
You've seen gators?

195
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:15,700
From the distance on the islands or whatever.

196
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,500
Hi, Jason.

197
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,060
Welcome to Orlando.

198
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,100
Check out my cousins at Gatorland.

199
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,760
Are you sure it wasn't a billboard for Gatorland?

200
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,760
I'm not sure.

201
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,800
No, I'm not.

202
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,980
Because they may be realistic looking.

203
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,320
You see this big, if you look close for it when you're landing, you see a big smiling gator.

204
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,320
He's got a top hat on.

205
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,120
Sunglasses.

206
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,260
Sunglasses and a top hat.

207
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,680
The Orlando outfit.

208
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,700
Now let me hang on.

209
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:51,180
I don't want to get into arguments and semantics here, but I ran into an article or something.

210
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:56,100
There's literature out there that is very clear about a particular point.

211
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,340
If you're a stickler about transportation, transportation titles, this is not a monorail.

212
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,100
It is not.

213
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,320
You could call it a number of things.

214
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,580
I'm not even sure what to call it for the episode.

215
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,420
It could be tram.

216
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,860
It could be people movers.

217
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,480
Automated people movers.

218
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,060
Automated people movers.

219
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:18,040
And then you can look up a number of cities have done this to revitalize downtown areas.

220
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:27,620
Vegas has the official, they call it the monorail, but I think it's an automated people mover, the one that you board at MGM that goes all the way to North Strip.

221
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:35,920
But then there's the people movers between, there's a number of them between a bunch of the MGM hotels on the other side of the Strip.

222
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,420
Sure.

223
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:36,780
Yeah.

224
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,580
And the distinction with a monorail is the track.

225
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:40,420
Yeah.

226
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,420
Because it's not, it isn't mono.

227
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:43,900
Right.

228
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,660
There are trains, there's two sides of it.

229
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:52,960
So by virtue of it being a track that can fit two trains, it is a duo rail.

230
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,100
I don't think that's a term, but it'd be a better, a closer term than monorail.

231
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,540
And usually a pilot.

232
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,600
A pilot is in a monorail?

233
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,860
In a monorail, yeah.

234
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,840
And this is automated?

235
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:05,540
Yes.

236
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,540
That's interesting.

237
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,280
I guess maybe I didn't know that.

238
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:28,380
Because I guess I've been on it and kind of typically had the opportunity to get a front row view or a back row view where it's just glass back there and you can just look at track and be at the front of the tail of it.

239
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,220
And I guess if somebody was on it, you wouldn't be able to do that.

240
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,320
What is that?

241
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,360
That's not a monorail.

242
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,560
That's got a couple tracks.

243
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,620
Is that just a train?

244
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,720
Maybe that's just a train, but it's elevated.

245
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,540
Because I guess it could be an elevated train.

246
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,480
They call it the L in Chicago.

247
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,780
The train can go up and down.

248
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,920
But it's still, it's interesting.

249
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:57,620
Monorail is just like it has to have a thin track with no other track, like just one of them.

250
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:58,980
I think so.

251
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,660
At least there's that.

252
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,080
I don't know definition beyond that.

253
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:09,820
I mean, my information…

254
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,820
I'm sure there's automated, there must be an automated monorail out there somewhere.

255
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,480
It seems like that would have to be possible.

256
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:20,900
My information on monorails, of course, comes from the loop in Disney World and then the Simpsons episode.

257
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,480
And Homer is like the monorail conductor.

258
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,300
So there has to be a pilot there, essentially.

259
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,240
Yeah, there's gotta be a guy in a big fancy cape.

260
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:33,960
And you have to watch out for the wires getting chewed up by a possum.

261
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,280
A possum family lives in there.

262
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,080
I've heard Conan talk about this a lot.

263
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,140
Where he's like, we were making fun of the monorail.

264
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,880
Obviously it was a joke because the town didn't need a monorail.

265
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,080
But I never got that.

266
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,260
I was like, that's cool.

267
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,340
Monorail is cool.

268
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,540
Yes, yeah, yeah.

269
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,660
I never got that they thought that…

270
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:48,580
You're right.

271
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,860
For Disney kids, they're like, I want a monorail in my town.

272
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:52,760
Hell yeah.

273
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:57,120
I think I got it that it was superfluous because the town was small.

274
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,300
But the idea that the monorail was silly itself, I never registered that.

275
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,800
You've got to be of two minds here.

276
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:09,680
I'm sure there are places, the airports among them, where monorails are efficient and help.

277
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,340
And help with smog and mass transportation.

278
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:24,300
But I wonder, what is the reality in the world of Lyle Landley type situations where it's kind of a boondoggle and a waste of money.

279
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,320
You don't actually need the monorail.

280
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,380
Well, and it's, from what I understand, it is expensive.

281
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,580
And people were thinking that was going to take off when Disney started using them.

282
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,620
But it didn't.

283
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,700
It didn't really.

284
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:45,740
Well, that's what I think that's what I've read the reason they never expanded the monorail further in Disney World is because it's so expensive.

285
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:54,520
Like the Skyliner urban gondola system is much, much cheaper than building miles and miles of monorail track.

286
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,660
Yeah, but I still like monorails better.

287
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:57,520
Yeah.

288
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:58,560
Yeah.

289
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,540
That's a tough.

290
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,380
I guess I do stylistically.

291
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:09,980
But there's a there's a real, God, that might be a tie for me in Disney World at this point.

292
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,180
I do like the Skyliner.

293
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:11,960
I do like it.

294
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,520
I'm scared of it, though, but I do it.

295
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,060
I do it.

296
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:14,740
I'll do it.

297
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,680
I didn't do it last time.

298
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,540
Did you do it last time?

299
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,280
I don't think I was ever in a place where it made sense to do the Skyliner.

300
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:20,720
Yeah.

301
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,940
Did you do it last time?

302
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,380
I didn't.

303
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:24,560
I.

304
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,160
Yeah, it didn't really make sense.

305
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:37,440
You really got to be in the southern part of the property if you're, you know, because we mainly did.

306
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,260
I only did Epcot and Magic Kingdom, so it's more efficient.

307
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,340
It's more efficient than monorails.

308
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,460
It's real fast.

309
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:45,260
Yeah.

310
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,120
So I get it.

311
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:55,680
So honestly, that they have recently done a big new transportation system that feels like the most hopeful, futuristic Disney World move.

312
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,600
That they're building something that can get you somewhere fast.

313
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,020
Yeah.

314
00:15:59,020 --> 00:15:59,420
Yeah.

315
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:04,540
Because like we said, you're talking about how there's the dream of these kinds of transit.

316
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:10,760
And that was, I feel like, a big thing of Disney World 70s, 80s is, you know, we got people movers and we got monorails.

317
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,160
And these are things that your city will have soon.

318
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,900
And we even build these things for.

319
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,460
We have one in the Houston airport.

320
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,980
And now that is bad, seemingly the Houston one.

321
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,420
There aren't other ones.

322
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,060
There's this is a people mover.

323
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:30,500
Orlando thinks they call people mover, but it's unaffiliated with the Disney type of people.

324
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,900
They didn't build this or anything.

325
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,320
There is a connection.

326
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,080
There's a loose connection.

327
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:42,160
So these different airside to different legs were built at different times.

328
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,920
The first two came along in 81 and then 90 and then 2000, then 2017.

329
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:59,260
Some of the legs of this people mover use Bombardier CX 100 vehicles.

330
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:10,260
Bombardier is the company that bought the Walt Widd people mover division when they sold off the people mover part.

331
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:14,720
So there might be a little hint.

332
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:23,720
There's probably like a hinge that wed or a hinge or like a certain nut and bolt.

333
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:26,560
It's like, well, that actually imagineering came up with that.

334
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,260
What's the Mickey year?

335
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:28,520
Yeah.

336
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,460
Yeah.

337
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:30,540
Yeah.

338
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,540
So it's clunky.

339
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,400
It actually hurts the train.

340
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,000
Right.

341
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,460
It looks great.

342
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,520
It's so cute.

343
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,640
A lot of the some of the other tracks are Mitsubishi vehicles.

344
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,960
Westinghouse, I think I saw, was the original installer of a lot of this.

345
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:47,840
Yes.

346
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,000
Some of them.

347
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,640
OK, I think there's five tracks all told.

348
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,160
And at least two of them are older.

349
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,800
They're 80s models that still work pretty good.

350
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,540
So they they stay out there.

351
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:09,120
And then two of them got replaced by Mitsubishi crystal movers.

352
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,420
That's a nice one.

353
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:11,880
Right.

354
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,180
Like that's this.

355
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:13,740
I'm not sure.

356
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,160
I think you could be right.

357
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,960
Because that looks that one looks newer and a lot of the photos look old.

358
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:19,500
Yeah.

359
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:19,700
Yeah.

360
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:28,500
Well, I think if you don't have that, like the kind of 80s angular shape, that might be a clue of which got put in when.

361
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,120
Now there was a thing.

362
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,840
I don't know when this was a couple of years ago.

363
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:44,160
There was a day where the nightmare occurred, where the people movers broke down and people had to move themselves.

364
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,820
The people had to be their own movers and walk back and forth.

365
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,900
And there's there's photos where it looks like chaos, although it also sounds like the walk isn't like that long, really.

366
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,600
So you described as a nightmare on like I wasn't there.

367
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:56,920
I don't know.

368
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,420
Maybe it's truly horrible.

369
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:04,100
But you might think, oh, well, those junky old 80s ones probably shit the bed finally.

370
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:04,580
Right.

371
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:05,180
No, no, no.

372
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,460
It was the newer ones.

373
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:10,980
It was the newer ones that blew the crystal movers fucked up.

374
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,360
That's such a great name, though.

375
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,180
So good.

376
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:13,340
Yeah.

377
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:13,600
I know.

378
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,860
All this crystal movers.

379
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,880
So it's so really good.

380
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:17,440
Yeah.

381
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:17,940
Yeah.

382
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,800
But that was no, that feels like cool.

383
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,360
That feels like Tokyo future.

384
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:21,900
Yeah.

385
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:28,820
I think there are some I think practically some of Tokyo public transit is Mitsubishi crystal movers.

386
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,940
Yeah, that makes sense.

387
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,280
So they're great.

388
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,520
But they cost 90 million dollars.

389
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,800
I think today I think that redo what?

390
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,280
That's like 2017 or so.

391
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:48,640
So that kind of soon after that, they broke one day and blew up the efficiency of the airport was probably not great for anyone involved.

392
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,440
It doesn't look good.

393
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:54,340
But hey, mostly I would say this system is very efficient.

394
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,920
I've never had trouble.

395
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,240
I always get right on.

396
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,020
I'm waiting.

397
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:58,620
Yeah.

398
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,040
And there I think they're nice.

399
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,020
I think I don't know which ones I've been on.

400
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:07,020
I couldn't tell you if like I tend to be I'm always on the CX 100s.

401
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,780
I have no idea.

402
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,980
But any of them that I get on clean, comfortable, nice to be.

403
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:26,760
It doesn't feel like kind of junkie depressing airport, you know, internal like I don't get I get on I get on this little ride and I don't feel the bummer that I feel that most airports.

404
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,860
Yeah, I completely agree.

405
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:32,660
I think that I think definitely not waiting a lot.

406
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,120
A long time is a big part of it, too.

407
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,240
Yeah, is that like it feels like within five minutes, maybe less.

408
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:43,380
Maybe that's I'm misremembering, but maybe less like I'm right on it.

409
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,060
It's moving.

410
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:54,100
It doesn't it's like a perfect amount of time or walking from the gate to there doesn't feel like you're walking forever because that's a whole thing as well.

411
00:20:54,500 --> 00:21:00,320
It's like there's stuff in like O'Hare in Chicago where like they have that cool 80s like moving walkway.

412
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,260
Sometimes you get with all the colors, you know, I'm talking about.

413
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,100
That's in the in the puff daddy.

414
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,360
I'll be missing you video.

415
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,200
Yeah, he does his dance of mourning for his friend.

416
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:08,860
Of course.

417
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,620
But like that feels like you got to walk a ways to get to it.

418
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,560
This one feels like you're almost like right in my mind.

419
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,080
You like walk right to the monorail.

420
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,240
It shows up.

421
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,720
I wish there was a like a pilot goes, hello, Mr.

422
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,160
Carlson and like waves you in like that's how it feels.

423
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,980
It feels fast and convenient.

424
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,820
And then you're on the little trip and then you're on your way.

425
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:37,640
It's really clear in terms of I don't remember which is which, but it's either there's like you could be there's this there's the center.

426
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:42,360
I feel like you board from the center and get off from the other sides.

427
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:47,840
So it's always really clear where you're never like fighting with people coming the other way.

428
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,220
It's none of that subway kind of gridlock.

429
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,020
Everybody bump into each other.

430
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,600
Like the directions are extremely clear.

431
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:59,420
Yeah, and now X also feels like a long walk to the gate or to the baggage pickup.

432
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,580
There's supposedly a people mover coming down like X.

433
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:08,400
Well, from like in twenty thirty satellite parking thing is coming in ten years.

434
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,900
Yes, like the Vegas train, which I have some things to talk about with that.

435
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,900
But it's got a it's got a bunch of money for that.

436
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,260
Yes.

437
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:16,880
Speed rail.

438
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,900
Let me say this real quick and then we'll talk about high speed rail for a second.

439
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,080
Walking.

440
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:26,940
So then it's like you get off the monorail or excuse me, the people mover in Orlando and you go down.

441
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:34,240
And I was shocked, even though I knew this, that the Mickey's Magic, excuse me, Mickey's Magical Express was gone.

442
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,420
That section of the airport now has been turned into like a regular busses like area.

443
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:47,740
And you know, did you see this when you were there, too, because it's like in the corner of the like area where you leave and go and find a taxi or a ride share.

444
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:53,560
And Mickey's Magical Express is a bus specifically for Disney World Hotels that was free.

445
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,700
Was it like if you were staying there?

446
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,300
That's a big perk that they caught during or shape error.

447
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:00,940
Yes.

448
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,300
Now, would Iger have done it or was he planning to?

449
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:03,800
We don't know.

450
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,320
Probably.

451
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,520
But yeah, I went down.

452
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:16,120
So that was like that added to the feeling of like you're being whisked to your destination where it was like off the plane, onto the people mover.

453
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:25,680
You go down some stairs and then Mickey's on the bus and you get right onto the Mickey bus and it felt like you were just being like like picked up and carried by a Disney God.

454
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,600
They got your bags too.

455
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,400
Yes, they could.

456
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,460
If you tagged them.

457
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,000
If you tagged them the right way, they would just put them right on the bus.

458
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,140
You didn't have to even.

459
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,800
So like you would get right in this line.

460
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,640
I never did it.

461
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,200
I never did the express.

462
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:41,260
That's interesting because we did it the last, I guess I did it the last time or maybe two times ago.

463
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,080
I forget.

464
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:48,800
But yeah, so that was the only thing where I was like, oh, the last part of the like ease is gone.

465
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:49,560
Oh, sure.

466
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,780
Last chunk of the ease of MCO.

467
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,560
If you're going to Disney.

468
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,480
Yeah, obviously we were staying universal, so I wouldn't have done it anyway.

469
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:01,920
But still the system, though, and the airport, this is a pretty solid airport regardless.

470
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,560
I feel like.

471
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,040
Oh, yeah.

472
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:03,260
Yeah.

473
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,680
And this is not an airport that I'm bummed out to be.

474
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,580
I feel I guess security kind of bad.

475
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,900
You can get real stuck there.

476
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,200
Yeah.

477
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,660
But there's so many that the atrium, like the hotel that overlooks the.

478
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:13,920
Yeah.

479
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:20,080
The atrium is really nice and just like good little thing to look at while you're bored in security.

480
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:24,580
There's a Romano's Macaroni Grill, an old Sheridan family favorite.

481
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,500
It is.

482
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,920
I used to love Romano's Macaroni Grill.

483
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,180
You can see it from the plane.

484
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,960
But I've never been in the Orlando airport.

485
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,120
I just looked at it longingly.

486
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,040
Sure it's great.

487
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,820
Sure, it's awesome.

488
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,400
We'll review it next time.

489
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:45,920
They got the butcher paper, the waiter writes their name on your tablecloth and clown.

490
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,800
And then if you get a drink, they like they keep a tally.

491
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,580
But it's not like Dick's last resort.

492
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,940
They don't insult you or anything.

493
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:53,820
No, no.

494
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,160
OK.

495
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:54,780
The opposite.

496
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,200
They make you feel good.

497
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,160
Treat you like a king.

498
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:58,280
I don't know.

499
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,680
I haven't been to one of those, I think since I was 16.

500
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,920
I don't know if I've ever been to one of those.

501
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,200
I don't know these perks.

502
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,800
Romano's experience.

503
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,600
Real quick about the high speed rail.

504
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,240
And correct me if I'm wrong.

505
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,660
They just gave all this money to high speed rail.

506
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,840
They've been talking about this forever.

507
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,700
LA to Vegas, so quick.

508
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,080
It's going to be two hours, they say.

509
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,620
This is a new, this is in the last year or so.

510
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,700
There's a new like, train plan.

511
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,040
They just approved the money for it.

512
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,260
They've been talking about it for years.

513
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:27,700
Yeah.

514
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:31,480
To finally like make this a quick trip to Vegas.

515
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:38,580
My understanding is that you have to take a different train to Rancho Cucamonga.

516
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:38,980
Yes.

517
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,780
And then take the high speed rail to Vegas.

518
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,100
Yeah, Rancho Cucamonga is the LA departure point.

519
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:48,700
So you take 40, like a 45 minute train to Rancho.

520
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,160
If you don't live here, that's far.

521
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,020
That's not a place we ever are.

522
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:52,180
Yeah.

523
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,700
And then it's two hours by high speed rail.

524
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,840
And so then it's like the whole trip is two hours, 45 minutes.

525
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,800
And I'm like, well, if you leave at the right time, it's like four hours.

526
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,860
And then you have your car.

527
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,400
Yeah.

528
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,180
That's not so attractive to me.

529
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,100
Not really.

530
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,380
I didn't know that aspect.

531
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:07,800
Yeah.

532
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:13,780
Cause when they go, oh, it's two hours can be, I'm like, all right, well, that's like half the time and kind of the same amount of time.

533
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:20,240
If you take a flight, cause you got to get there a little early and there's some leaving like, so, okay, that's, that's not so bad.

534
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:25,300
But then you attack on an extra 45 minutes and you're like, well, I could just drive.

535
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,600
It's only an extra hour.

536
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:32,900
And then, then you don't have to deal with like, I don't know, maybe the train is late, like stuff like that.

537
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:33,820
So, I don't know.

538
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,960
Well, it's great if you're in Rancho Cucamonga.

539
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,520
This is a big of a boon to Cucamonga.

540
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,500
Yeah, that's true.

541
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,380
Could ever be.

542
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:41,880
That's true.

543
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,780
So I was like, oh, well, that's less fun.

544
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:49,800
Like if it was a 30 minute high speed rail train from Rancho, then that's a different situation.

545
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,640
Anyway, I was let down by that.

546
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,440
Maybe that's wrong.

547
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,380
Maybe I'm, I'm being annoying.

548
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,620
Mike's not impressed.

549
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,820
Have you done other airport?

550
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,900
Has anyone ever been?

551
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,820
Have you been to Dallas Fort Worth?

552
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:01,460
Yes.

553
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,980
And done their Mon, their Monorail is so large.

554
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,720
That airport is so big.

555
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,720
Like, I don't remember it at all.

556
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,460
I know I've been there.

557
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:17,120
It's the sort of thing where it's like, oh, I, I, my plane arrived at B and I, I have to get to terminal C for connection.

558
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,060
You can walk it.

559
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,540
It's not advisable.

560
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,260
Yeah.

561
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:27,080
It's just that it's like a hub for at least one or two airlines.

562
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,660
So there's a big international connection.

563
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,140
Yeah.

564
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:35,400
So there is a Monorail for it or a people mover for it.

565
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:44,500
The smaller version is Newark Airport in New Jersey where you don't go through security till you're at your terminal.

566
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:48,940
But there's a Monorail you can just get on to go between terminals.

567
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:55,660
And then it also goes to an Amtrak station that is only accessible by train.

568
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,660
It's only accessible by trains or the airport Monorail.

569
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:00,460
Okay.

570
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,740
And you like these?

571
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,480
Wait, wait, wait.

572
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,060
So where do you, what's your review on that?

573
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:11,080
The Dallas one, I've just like killed time riding around before the Newark one was convenient.

574
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,860
So you've ridden that purely as a ride.

575
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,060
For fun.

576
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,180
Or like to get to the Chili's too or something.

577
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:17,740
Yeah.

578
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:28,200
Newark worked out because I went to a wedding in Staten Island once and I'm like, well, I need to get a train down to Pennsylvania to see my family.

579
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:41,160
So the easiest thing was to take the hotel shuttle back to the airport and then get on the tram and take it to the Amtrak station that I bought a ticket for.

580
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:48,220
And so look, my dream multiple modes of transit, but it was a little confusing.

581
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:48,860
Yeah.

582
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,580
Because I'm like, this is still easier than renting a car in New Jersey.

583
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,180
Can you answer a question for me?

584
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,520
I got, when we went to New York, I took the Long Island Railroad into the city.

585
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:02,440
Did I take another train from the airport to get to that or did I walk?

586
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,320
I can't remember.

587
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,080
Where?

588
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,440
Why would we know that?

589
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,640
Because Jason is the guy, I'm not asking you necessarily, I'm asking Jason.

590
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,500
But how does Jason know what you did or didn't do?

591
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:19,240
The Long Island Railroad goes to the sub, did you take the Amtrak Air Tram from Queens?

592
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,400
I don't know.

593
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:20,900
Okay.

594
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:21,860
I can't remember.

595
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:22,520
I'm trying to remember.

596
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,360
What happened here?

597
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:26,900
You asked Jason a question about what you did and Jason wasn't there.

598
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,560
He doesn't know.

599
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,300
And he asked you one follow up and you said, I don't know.

600
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:30,960
I don't know.

601
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,600
What was the point of this line of questioning?

602
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:37,480
His point of, I was trying to figure out, did I take any sort of people mover to get to the Long Island Railroad to get into the city?

603
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,620
How you got to the Long Island Railroad.

604
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,160
I don't know either.

605
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,680
This is what I'm asking you.

606
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,980
I can't remember.

607
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,400
Only what I think the most likely person to know this has to be you.

608
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,200
But it's not.

609
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,740
We're going to have to go into security.

610
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:54,980
I think Jason knows more than I do about what I did even though he's confused too.

611
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,860
I don't remember.

612
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:57,620
I'm not sure.

613
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:05,100
I took once, I think I flew into JFK and then took the Air Tram to Queens.

614
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,240
Yeah, but what did Mike do?

615
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,420
I don't know.

616
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,480
I don't know.

617
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,220
I'm just trying to remember.

618
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,780
Keep in mind the order of things.

619
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:15,020
Mike, you remember everything Jason's ever done.

620
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,760
Jason doesn't remember anything you've ever done.

621
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:20,300
And maybe a lot of what you yourself, Jason, have done.

622
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,780
So you took a plane.

623
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,680
Somehow you ended up at East Egg or West Egg from the Great Gatsby.

624
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,540
And then you got on the Long Island Railroad to get into the city.

625
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:30,980
All right.

626
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,100
I'm going to apply that memory.

627
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,980
I'm going to try to absorb that memory now.

628
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:37,200
And from now on, that'll be what I know that I did last time.

629
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,460
I just I'll look into it later.

630
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,440
Jason retrace my steps.

631
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,060
But I just mean if he was familiar with JFK more, he would know.

632
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,640
Somebody out there tell me.

633
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,280
OK, maybe Jason doesn't know, but somebody out there tell me what I did.

634
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,260
Somebody explain to me how I got there.

635
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,640
Say the specifics again.

636
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:02,400
I flew in JFK and I didn't take like a lift or anything into Manhattan.

637
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:07,720
I went to the Long Island Railroad, which is kind of in my mind, it was a little bit of a trek.

638
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:12,660
But I can't remember if I took a train or something to get to that place.

639
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,620
I think I did.

640
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:16,880
I think somebody conked you on the back of the head, put you in a bag.

641
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,600
They were going to steal your money and then drown you in a river.

642
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,840
And then you didn't like have enough cash on you.

643
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:22,780
They ran away.

644
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,740
It just wasn't worth it.

645
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:28,160
Ultimately, so they like, they let you drop off at the Long Island Expressway.

646
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,680
They'll wake up.

647
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,020
You won't know any of it happened.

648
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:34,380
That could have happened, too, if somebody somebody needs to explain that.

649
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,500
That's what happened to me.

650
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:41,480
My memory years ago once, I think I went JFK AirTran to Queens from Queens.

651
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,440
You can grab the subway into Manhattan.

652
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,660
OK, well, I don't know.

653
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:47,800
I don't know.

654
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,420
We'll see.

655
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:51,100
We'll find out when someone tells me what I did.

656
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,240
Somebody has to know.

657
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,540
Somebody has to know.

658
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,120
Somebody fill in.

659
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:59,480
Somebody help with Mike's mimento situation.

660
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:03,580
You didn't tattoo it on you, so you have no way of knowing.

661
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:09,080
If somebody knows how to hack into my iPhone, iPhone knows where we are at all times.

662
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:14,720
So if somebody could hack into the iPhone, they could know the coordinates of where I've been for the whole time I've owned an iPhone.

663
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,740
Can't you can't you find your own program that traces your own steps?

664
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,860
I don't know how to do it.

665
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,240
Somebody else is going to have to show me how to do it.

666
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,200
Jason program.

667
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,960
Jason, do you know how to find an app that retraces Mike's steps?

668
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:31,040
Do you have the Dark Knight technology with the phones where everything becomes a radar?

669
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,540
Jason, become a Lucius.

670
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,120
What's his name?

671
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:34,880
Lucius Fox.

672
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,620
Lucius Fox.

673
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,940
Be Mike's Lucius Fox.

674
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:37,480
Yes.

675
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,580
So, yes, somebody is going to have to help me out here.

676
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:44,560
Well, I know if you're flying into Philadelphia, you can grab the R1.

677
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,860
That'll take 30th Street Station downtown.

678
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,760
That's big hub.

679
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,300
You can get anywhere from there.

680
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,600
OK, maybe I did that.

681
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:52,680
Yeah, maybe you did.

682
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,440
Did I fly into Philadelphia?

683
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,300
You ended up on SEPTA Regional Rail somehow and then you got to your hotel.

684
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,200
It's possible.

685
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,660
I believe it because I don't know what happened.

686
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:02,640
I don't remember.

687
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,020
So sorry.

688
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,680
Now we're discovering we're kicking off the year with Mike's decaying.

689
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:10,780
Mike's decaying memory.

690
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,160
I don't like to fly.

691
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:12,960
I blocked it out.

692
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:13,880
I block out flying.

693
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,260
I don't remember these flights.

694
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:20,320
Hey, to bring back to Orlando, a brief history lesson of the Orlando Airport.

695
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,240
Originally McCoy Air Force Base.

696
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:28,280
That's where the MCO three letter airport code comes from.

697
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:28,720
Yes.

698
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,800
Closed in 1974 and then Orlando bought the land.

699
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:40,380
It was the McCoy Air Force Base was Orlando's largest employer until Disney World came on the scene.

700
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,240
And so that so it was huge.

701
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:48,220
It's named for Colonel Michael McCoy, who died during a practice demonstration

702
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:52,140
flying a plane in a crash that killed three people and one cow.

703
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,380
Oh, wow.

704
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,480
I know that him dying isn't funny.

705
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:58,800
But when I got to the step that one cow was killed.

706
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,220
And one cow is yeah.

707
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:05,200
If it was just like a cow and three men were killed, would that be less funny?

708
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:06,920
What are the rules here?

709
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,520
Like is it because you ended with the cow?

710
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,420
Maybe they ended with the cow?

711
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,260
I think it has to be that way.

712
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,960
AP style guide says you have to end with the cow.

713
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:17,640
It's disrespectful to the men, I'd say, to put them after the cow.

714
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,880
But that would be the importance.

715
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,460
I guess, yeah, you have to lead with the important thing.

716
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,800
Unless that who knows?

717
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,980
I don't know how important that cow was.

718
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,420
I don't know how great the cow was.

719
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:29,820
Was it some prize winning cut?

720
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,240
What?

721
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,120
What did you do?

722
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:33,020
My Apple Watch just turned on.

723
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:33,760
Oh, okay.

724
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:35,940
Deal Vibes.

725
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,540
Alert from Deal Vibes.

726
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,660
You've ignored Deal Vibes for 10 minutes.

727
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,560
My Apple Watch said, I'm not sure I understand.

728
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:49,060
Maybe the Apple Watch thought I was asking it about what happened to me in New York.

729
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:53,340
Apple Watch, how important was the cow that died in the McCoy crash?

730
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,260
It was Mini Moo, a quite famous cow.

731
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,200
Oh no, Mini Moo died.

732
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,140
Mini Moo got murked in friendly fire.

733
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,940
The day they set Mini Moo free, it was killed by a plane immediately.

734
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:11,660
No, the Colonel who McCoy is, it was all named after, I think, was he knew he was going down

735
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:16,300
and he avoided a city where he would have crashed into a lot of people.

736
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:27,200
But anyway, this Air Force Base, from the 60s till 75, it was a combo.

737
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:30,720
It was an Air Force Base, but they also ran commercial flights.

738
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:36,460
Then in 75, Disney World's getting so much traffic, they're like, well, let's just switch it over entirely.

739
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:45,500
Some of the awkwardness of early 70s travel to Orlando came from the Disney situation,

740
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:53,160
which is that back then, Walt announces this Florida project and Progress City.

741
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,800
There's going to be all this transportation stuff going on.

742
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:59,560
That's what we're seeking to prove is efficient transportation.

743
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:02,580
So, there's going to be all the people movers and monorails and stuff,

744
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:05,720
and that's all going to connect to our airport that we will be building.

745
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,420
The Disney airport.

746
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:12,260
So, for a while, Orlando is like, okay, so we'll hold off on…

747
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:15,020
They had airports, but just kind of smaller.

748
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,260
And they're like, well, I guess we'll wait for Walt to handle that.

749
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:23,880
And then Walt passed away, and then the plans became not a weird futuristic city,

750
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,260
but theme park and some hotels.

751
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:30,840
And they thought, well, maybe we need to figure out that whole airport thing then.

752
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,160
Thus, McCoy MCO becomes what it is today.

753
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,580
But as part of that, maybe you ran into some of this, Jason.

754
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,060
I'd never heard of this in my life.

755
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:47,820
I didn't know that they did in the early 70s, maybe even longer than that, you might say.

756
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:52,320
Disney World had something that they did refer to as the Walt Disney World Airport.

757
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,780
Is this familiar to either of you?

758
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,080
I actually didn't see this.

759
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:00,480
So, I think initially the Lake Buena Vista Airport then changed to Walt Disney World Airport.

760
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,360
And this is technically running through the 80s.

761
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,320
And what this was, was a way…

762
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,980
They called it a STOL port.

763
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:14,260
That stands for Short Takeoff and Landing.

764
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,680
So, the idea was you fly into Orlando or even a nearby city,

765
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,000
and then you maybe…

766
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:25,280
Do you want to take a real little plane that just gets you right up to the hotels?

767
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:31,780
So, with that short takeoff and landing airport, that dresses up.

768
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,160
This is no airport.

769
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,120
What this was was a landing strip.

770
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,460
And it's there today.

771
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:41,180
It's really close to the Ticket and Transportation Center.

772
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,640
It's in that whole zone.

773
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:47,480
So, you get to Disney World in 71, 72,

774
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:53,060
you could take a little plane that essentially gets you right to the Contemporary or the Polynesian.

775
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:57,020
You just like then you're steps away and you're right there.

776
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:01,820
You would have had to take a tiny plane from something called Shawnee Airlines.

777
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:06,880
Shawnee, spelled like Pawnee, rhymes with Pawnee.

778
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:14,100
But this didn't last for very long because Shawnee Airlines shut down in December 72

779
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:17,940
due to rising debt and lack of passenger interest.

780
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:18,680
Yeah.

781
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:22,300
Good reason to close down your little podunk airline, I guess.

782
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,820
Wow, there's this Disney airstrip.

783
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:28,520
That's weird.

784
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:33,380
And you could still use that through the 70s.

785
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:39,900
I believe it was used not for, I don't remember if it was George Bush or George W.

786
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,160
Bush,

787
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:44,360
but one of the presidents, their prep team,

788
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,060
the secrets of the whole operation that has to travel with a president,

789
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:52,940
like use this to get all their stuff in order for a presidential visit.

790
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:58,020
But now the road's still there and they just like store a bunch of stuff on it.

791
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,860
On the landing strip?

792
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:00,300
Yeah.

793
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:06,900
So I think since at least like 2008, you could not land a plane there if you wanted to.

794
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:14,000
So they said they store like Ohana meat there that's going to go into the restaurant later or something?

795
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:14,600
Possibly.

796
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,300
Maybe not the meat.

797
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:23,480
Maybe it's where, remember that big, the weird steampunk but future dinosaur like.

798
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,360
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

799
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:25,720
Terraric X.

800
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,900
From the Epcot show.

801
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,060
Yeah, what was it called?

802
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,320
Yeah, that's where that is.

803
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:33,420
That's where anything that they don't, they don't want to use anymore.

804
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,440
Right, decay, everything that's decaying.

805
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,140
Or yeah, the botanicus is there for some reason from Hollywood.

806
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,580
Yeah, we'll take it out of your hands.

807
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,360
We got the room.

808
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,140
Yeah, every day all the trolls.

809
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:47,220
Any, it's a, now it's a graveyard of old animatronics.

810
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:47,840
Right.

811
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:51,140
All the old Johns from Carousel of Progress.

812
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,020
They're just made.

813
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,760
They wire Johns, yes.

814
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,100
They babble at each other.

815
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:05,020
It's storage now, it used to mostly be Card Walker flying in on that Shawnee airline and he would say like fly for Milano Airport.

816
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:10,460
It's enough time for one seven and seven and then I roll out of the plane.

817
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,600
That sounds good.

818
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:16,440
So the character of Card Walker is a guy who likes to have one drink.

819
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,920
I just have one drink, it's a short flight.

820
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,000
In the air, in the air.

821
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:26,020
So okay, so you would get to MCO and then you, or you would get to the airport and you would get.

822
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:28,360
There are a few places I think that would service this.

823
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,140
Yeah, yeah, that's what I corrected myself.

824
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:32,640
And then you would take what, an eight minute flight?

825
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,320
Something like that.

826
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:33,840
Probably.

827
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:34,800
Uh huh.

828
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:40,960
And then you're right there, you could not be closer to, you could have, technically I think you could, especially to Polynesian.

829
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,740
You're just right there.

830
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,620
And how much of today's money would that cost I wonder?

831
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,540
I don't know.

832
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,540
Because it seems.

833
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:56,220
Maybe not a lot because it was, because Shawnee's, Shawnee's planes were made out of cotton, they were like tightly packed cotton.

834
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:58,740
Right.

835
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:10,180
I went to North Carolina earlier this year and we had a connect, we flew into Raleigh Dorm and then flew into the very tiny Asheville Airport.

836
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,060
Yeah.

837
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:14,620
It's pretty much like the Burbank Airport, it's like one terminal or something.

838
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:23,260
And for whatever reason there was a misprint on the ticket, the ticket said it'll be about a 15 minute flight.

839
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:31,120
And then when we get on the plane, the pilot's like, well, thank you for joining us, Raleigh Dorm to Asheville.

840
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,660
This course does 17 minute flight.

841
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,140
And I was like, what did he say?

842
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,540
And I was like, that can't be right.

843
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:45,140
And then sure enough, yeah, it was about 15 minutes to go from the east side of the state to the middle of the state.

844
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,020
Yeah.

845
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:48,620
Vegas flight is like 30 to 45 minutes.

846
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,520
Something like that.

847
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:49,960
Yeah.

848
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:50,820
15's not enough.

849
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,640
You can't even get, you can't get beverage service.

850
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,740
Maybe they serve two in cans.

851
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:55,460
What is it called?

852
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,220
We're going to launch Canada Drys because we have to.

853
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:04,740
We're going to give you not the fancy canned cocktails, we're going to give you the disgusting canned cocktails.

854
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,700
We're just going to roll them down the middle of the aisle too.

855
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,720
Catch it, grab it.

856
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,500
Did they do any, they didn't do any drinks?

857
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,580
They didn't do any service.

858
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:14,560
By the time you ascend.

859
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,220
Do a couple loops, I want a drink.

860
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,060
By the time you're up, you're going down.

861
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,220
They don't even probably reach full, full soaring height.

862
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,220
Yeah.

863
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:23,760
Yeah.

864
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:26,320
Here's a picture of this too, as proof.

865
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:26,640
Look at that.

866
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,200
Oh, there it is, yeah.

867
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:29,540
That looks totally unfamiliar to me, but there it is.

868
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,380
That's in 71.

869
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,140
And location wise, the contemporary is right there.

870
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,560
Contemporary Magic Kingdom.

871
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,020
Yeah, and still there technically.

872
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,580
But here's the weirdest thing about this.

873
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:52,700
I can't believe, in all the Disney World arcania, I can't believe I've never run across this before, that this was no, sure it's a very short runway, 2,000 feet long.

874
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,280
Sounds boring, right?

875
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,280
Not even an airport.

876
00:42:55,840 --> 00:43:03,200
Ah, ah, ah, the Disney magic is all over this runway because it is the world's only singing runway.

877
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:11,240
Apparently, grooves edged into the blacktop played the tune of When You Wish Upon a Star.

878
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:11,860
Wow.

879
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:12,900
Get out of here.

880
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,760
Yeah, what do you mean?

881
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:15,220
What?

882
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,260
What are you talking about?

883
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,380
How does that work?

884
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,980
Is there proof of that?

885
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:19,740
There's not.

886
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,000
It's in a couple articles.

887
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,520
That information is out there.

888
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,460
And it's even on like, it's written up on like Atlas Obscura.

889
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:34,700
Like that's an interesting oddity enough that there was, regardless of Disney context or not, that there was a singing, a musical runway.

890
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,860
But for who?

891
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:39,520
Planes are loud.

892
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:40,280
How?

893
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:43,600
This would have to be deafening to play.

894
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,860
Nothing's louder than a landing plane also.

895
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:55,480
Like where did this, was this piped into like, it was piped into your clock radios in the contemporary.

896
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:05,340
The music, you can't hear it nearby, but if you're on a long wire that goes to the hotel next door, that's piped in there, they use it as wake up calls for people.

897
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:08,060
It must sound like someone's screaming the song.

898
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:08,840
Yeah.

899
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,180
It's really metallic.

900
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:13,840
Yeah, yeah.

901
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:17,240
Just horrible squealing, rubber squeaking and squealing.

902
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:24,780
It's caused tinnitus in anybody who, if you were unlucky enough to hear it, you still shake today.

903
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:28,560
You're off balance because it ruins your ear drums.

904
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,880
Permanent inner ear problem.

905
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,360
Have you heard the, what are they called on a ship?

906
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,440
I don't want to say a horn, but like on a cruise ship when they're like docking.

907
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,640
The Disney ones do that.

908
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:40,700
The Disney ones do.

909
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,220
It sounds like hell.

910
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:44,980
That's close.

911
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:46,820
It's so long.

912
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,540
It's a big chunk of when you wish about a star.

913
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,060
Do they play more of the song?

914
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,140
I wonder if this, I wonder how long this went.

915
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:58,260
Strangely, weirdly, they play the whole thing really fast, including the bridge.

916
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,580
Fade is come.

917
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,660
They get to the bridge.

918
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:10,100
I wish every airport had their own song that would play when the wheels touch down on the runway.

919
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:11,460
Just on a local, yes.

920
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:13,920
If you're in Huntsville and it's sweet home Alabama.

921
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,080
I love LA here.

922
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,540
Sweet home Chicago, the Blues Brothers or Dan Aykroyd's version.

923
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:26,200
Not when the Blues Brothers like in the 90s, some of the 90s live version.

924
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:30,960
If you want to hear Dan Aykroyd's voice, they have to hook it up to be like, it has to be a voice sampled.

925
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,460
Mostly these were instrumental, I would think.

926
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,840
That'd be a good way to set Chicago apart.

927
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:41,420
And then the people who clap when the plane lands can clap along to something.

928
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,360
Yeah, you'll be able to hear it.

929
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:45,800
Finally do the breaks.

930
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:47,200
The sound of those breaks.

931
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:49,340
I just don't understand.

932
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,460
It sounds fake to me.

933
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,460
How could this, maybe that's the kind of thing.

934
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:54,100
Let's just say that that happens.

935
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:57,480
And then if you're ever there, like what happened to the singing runway?

936
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,440
Oh, you just couldn't hear it.

937
00:45:58,500 --> 00:45:58,920
I was playing.

938
00:45:59,300 --> 00:45:59,640
Yeah.

939
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,540
Is there a Jim Hill article about this?

940
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:02,380
Probably like not.

941
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:03,260
I don't know.

942
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:04,300
Worth a check.

943
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:05,260
Worth a check.

944
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:06,380
Weird.

945
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:07,660
That is really weird.

946
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:08,140
Why?

947
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,860
And could you still do it today?

948
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:20,640
If you drop a heavy crate of broken, all the innards of the Yeti that they stripped out

949
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:21,880
because it's never going to move.

950
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:26,680
If you put a bunch of metallic Yeti innards, a big crate of it, onto the singing runway,

951
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:28,780
would it land with a dong?

952
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:30,080
Would it make a note?

953
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,000
Well, you'd have to drag along.

954
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,920
It sounds like that's what it was when the wheels would do it.

955
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:41,300
So you'd have to like take your rental car and drive it on the runway

956
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:44,920
and then have somebody listen while the rental car.

957
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:51,020
Let's see if we can go on a little wild ride, a little madcap expedite.

958
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:55,620
Can we just go into the ticket and transportation center, whoop, swing around,

959
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:59,980
look at this picture, see if we can find the singing runway, roll the windows down,

960
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,960
see how fast that, let's get that baby singing.

961
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:07,780
Has there been a backpack or an explorer guy that's even gone over to this runway?

962
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:13,480
Because obviously River Country is a target for that and other places that are closed.

963
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,700
You maybe get a guy on a hoverboard or something.

964
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,320
Is a hoverboard heavy enough to activate it?

965
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:17,860
Would it trigger?

966
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:21,100
Yeah, hoverboard technology-wise, depends what kind.

967
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:24,460
Well, then you need 50 backpack guys at the same time.

968
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:26,120
Yeah, that's true.

969
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,360
All lined up perfectly.

970
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:29,720
We salute you backpack guys.

971
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:33,920
If 50 backpack guys all did sort of a race on the runway,

972
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:38,120
would they all be triggering their own When You Wish Upon a Star,

973
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:44,120
so it would all be out of sync because each one as they ran along would be at a different pace.

974
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:45,840
So the song would be at a different spot.

975
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:49,280
It'd sound like you're throwing five pianos out a window.

976
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:52,560
Yeah, that seems like that would be the case,

977
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:56,860
unless you have to have such a tremendous amount of force to trigger it.

978
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:02,600
Well, and then all their metal wallets are falling out of the pockets and just clanging along.

979
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,260
All of their Kickstarter metal wallets.

980
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:11,780
Because of all their expedition, they need to have something that's going to hold up to the elements.

981
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:12,960
It's an everyday carry.

982
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,180
You need your everyday carry.

983
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:17,000
I'm assuming that's what you mean, right?

984
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,860
Yeah, you need your tactical wallet, your tactical pen, your tactical backpack.

985
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,500
To stand up to the elements.

986
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,940
Yeah, the worst sunglasses you've ever seen.

987
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:26,600
It seems like you could think like them a little bit.

988
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:27,760
You could do this, I think.

989
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:28,400
Oh, sure.

990
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:35,260
Yeah, so I'm going to look and see if anybody's discovered the old runway.

991
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,740
Because that seems like a cool place to look around.

992
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:46,280
Is it heavily guarded because it's considered airline?

993
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:47,500
Airspace?

994
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:48,620
Airspace, yeah.

995
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,300
You mean because you think there's people there to prevent a plane from landing?

996
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,080
Like if there's a couple crates moving.

997
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:57,340
Like somebody's just down there going, no, don't land here.

998
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:03,680
Is it just because it's infrastructure, because it's air infrastructure, there's heavily armed guards?

999
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:05,000
That's a good question.

1000
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:11,060
Look, if they didn't have people to stop backpack guys from just wandering around wonders of life.

1001
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:12,000
Yeah, I know.

1002
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:12,960
Yeah, exactly.

1003
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:14,420
Why would it be just an open runway?

1004
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,400
This seems like Disney Worldwide.

1005
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:17,920
You can kind of go wherever you want.

1006
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:18,920
It really does.

1007
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,360
It really seems like it's not that hard to go to different places.

1008
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:29,080
And this again, obviously there's storage there now in some capacity, but this is just a street basically.

1009
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:30,540
So I wonder.

1010
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:34,300
Now we know also, this is old news at this point, but we've never really talked about it.

1011
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:46,420
Now we know that if you feel like running around nude on It's a Small World, you can get a good five minutes of exploring before anything happens.

1012
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:55,700
And you get a little hand carried walk through the park with only Disney's modesty flags covering up your button balls.

1013
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:56,600
That's right.

1014
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:02,800
Yes, that is a question I think I asked early on in this podcast is how far could you get?

1015
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:03,020
Nude?

1016
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:04,200
Not nude.

1017
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,860
I don't know if I said nude, but how far could you get?

1018
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:07,940
That's where he messed up.

1019
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:10,780
I think the nudity made it like it put the heat on.

1020
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:12,540
Because yeah, you could have gone another 10 minutes.

1021
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:14,500
You're talking about this guy at Disneyland who.

1022
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:15,280
I think so.

1023
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:20,500
I think the only reason he made it as far as he did is that he was in his creepy black shorts for a while.

1024
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:22,520
Before the actual nudity began.

1025
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:25,120
Also let me just say the bod on that guy.

1026
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:26,760
That guy was fucking cut.

1027
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,060
He was?

1028
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:29,340
He was in good shape.

1029
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:29,840
Yeah.

1030
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:35,600
Less in less good shape when all the Disney cards kicked the shit out of him.

1031
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:37,720
Did he get beat up?

1032
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:38,500
Did they beat him up?

1033
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:39,820
That's not out there.

1034
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:40,820
I don't know.

1035
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:43,620
That's not on an iPhone video or something?

1036
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:48,840
They subdued him so they could carry him out like a couch.

1037
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:52,280
There was like a bunch of them carrying him.

1038
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:56,000
They conked him on the back of the head and shoved him on the Long Island Expressway.

1039
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:57,940
Long Island.

1040
00:50:58,760 --> 00:50:59,220
Yes.

1041
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:00,360
Railroad.

1042
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:02,000
Not the Long Island Expressway.

1043
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:11,360
It always feels like anytime there's any incident in the park, it feels like the guards are located maybe at the Disneyland Hotel and they walk to whatever is going on.

1044
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:14,220
It feels like that's how long it takes something to like…

1045
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,140
Alright we got another nude guy.

1046
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:21,300
Well Jerry, could you move a little faster?

1047
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:22,720
I can't.

1048
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:25,860
Which one of you guys knows how the phones work?

1049
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,620
Can you put in a mobile for the Starbucks?

1050
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:29,860
I gotta carry a kid again.

1051
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:34,400
They switched their wide brim hat to an even bigger wide brim hat.

1052
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,500
It's like okay, emergency protocol.

1053
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:46,220
It just feels like it takes so long because in my mind and the way people try to act like you know what, there's all this security everywhere and they're secret and they got the clothes on.

1054
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:48,360
You'll be gained immediately away as soon as you…

1055
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:53,980
And they're so on top of everything and it feels like anytime anything weird happens it's like people checking their watch like, eh, this naked guy's been really…

1056
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:55,420
he's been naked for a while here.

1057
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:59,520
He is like, he is having a full bath in the Taj Mahal.

1058
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:06,000
Sorry, I had to totally empty up some parents' backpacks.

1059
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,840
I had to take everything out even though they seemed right on the edge.

1060
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:20,600
By the way, Alice Obscura says the airstrip still exists but the set of musical grooves was removed in 2008 and can no longer be experienced.

1061
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:20,660
What?

1062
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:22,040
Yeah, so they took out the only interesting thing.

1063
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:22,940
They took out the grooves.

1064
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:24,480
How do you take out grooves?

1065
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,160
I don't know.

1066
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,220
Yeah, and what were they?

1067
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,420
Why would you do that?

1068
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:28,600
They had the time to do that.

1069
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:30,280
They won't do anything.

1070
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:34,220
There's whole parts of the actual parks that they won't touch.

1071
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:35,940
Is River Country still standing?

1072
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:37,240
Or no, did they demolish that?

1073
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:37,840
I don't know.

1074
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:37,840
I know.

1075
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:43,640
I was rotting forever but I can't remember if they finally did destroy it.

1076
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:45,980
But yeah, that's sad forever.

1077
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:56,100
Discovery Island, at this point, the lost animals, the vultures of Discovery Island have learned to speak like Planet of the Apes.

1078
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,040
If you made it over there now, they'd say, who goes there?

1079
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,200
Lock him up!

1080
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:05,120
A human has breached our island.

1081
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,980
They've developed their own government there.

1082
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:09,440
It works better than ours.

1083
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:13,200
It's fair, it's not a police state.

1084
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:15,580
Everybody has all the vultures, they all have what they need.

1085
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:19,460
DeSantis tried to take over that vulture government too, but actually that didn't work.

1086
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,000
They were really smart about it.

1087
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,280
The man who camped here for a few days taught us words.

1088
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:31,800
The man who camped here in 2020.

1089
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:37,720
When DeSantis is out of office, then he'll run for governor of Vulture Island.

1090
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:40,080
I don't think he's going to do well.

1091
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,780
Well, I'm not literally a vulture.

1092
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:44,300
I know your ways.

1093
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:46,000
I can think like one.

1094
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:48,040
And the vulture's like, this guy creeps me out!

1095
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:52,340
The true vultures are the socialists who've worn down this country.

1096
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:52,800
Silence!

1097
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:55,500
We know you are wearing tall shoes.

1098
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,920
They should not bend that way.

1099
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:01,240
When you laugh, it is highly unnatural.

1100
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:06,420
Is there no one who can give you proper media training?

1101
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:12,660
Why didn't you just go to JCPenney's if you were going to be on the national stage like this?

1102
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:14,720
Buy normal shoes, you weird man!

1103
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:25,000
Let's shift course a little bit and talk about the character who appears on the ride.

1104
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:33,640
If the Orlando airport people mover is a ride, you get an appearance from Friendly Figure.

1105
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:38,840
I was very delighted when this came up in an episode before this episode.

1106
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:50,340
Even though we got the name wrong, it felt really good to just acknowledge this common Orlando experience of hearing Buddy Dyer welcome you to the city.

1107
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:58,660
I've recognized it as something, but as soon as you think about it, it's like, wow, it really is part of going there.

1108
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:01,520
You get welcomed by this guy.

1109
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:05,360
You did kind of an amended version of his welcome message.

1110
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,600
It's another one of those things.

1111
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:14,860
I didn't know there was any amount of cults or recognition of this thing.

1112
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:24,480
But if you look on Orlando reddits, I saw one where somebody just tossed out the first line and then comment after comment just filled it in bit by bit.

1113
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,540
They all just built it together.

1114
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:33,960
This is one of those things that people really know, although the copy has changed from time to time.

1115
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:37,540
I can read one that I have here.

1116
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:42,940
I mean, this feels like kind of the base, but I think they have changed here and there.

1117
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:45,420
But let me give this one a go.

1118
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,280
Hello, this is Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer.

1119
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:51,720
If you're a resident of central Florida, I want to welcome you home.

1120
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,200
If you're one of our 68 million visitors, welcome to the city beautiful.

1121
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,800
I feel like that I've never he speaks so fast.

1122
00:55:58,800 --> 00:55:59,940
You can't hear that well.

1123
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:05,140
I never really thought about the city beautiful, which what do you think?

1124
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:05,980
What do you think of that?

1125
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:09,460
We've been we haven't we maybe haven't been in downtown Orlando too much.

1126
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:10,400
We did a show there.

1127
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,220
It was it's kind of closer than I get.

1128
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:22,020
The woods is I guess sometimes you're driving around Orlando like it's pretty like I I went to my first Waffle House on this trip.

1129
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:23,100
Oh, yeah.

1130
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:24,960
Your first Waffle House ever.

1131
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:25,640
Okay.

1132
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:26,260
Yes.

1133
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,420
Would be would have been mine too.

1134
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:28,320
I don't think I've been to a lot.

1135
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:29,620
Yeah, I had never been.

1136
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:30,540
So I stopped.

1137
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,600
So I was I was doing a little more driving around.

1138
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:34,500
I guess I rented a car.

1139
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:37,420
I drove around a little bit in Orlando, which I don't normally do.

1140
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:45,040
And I didn't go so many places, but I don't know that beautiful described a lot of it.

1141
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,500
Some some some.

1142
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:48,460
Right.

1143
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:55,240
I went to after our live shows, I went to the McDonald's on I Drive, which has the already know you went there.

1144
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:57,720
The world's largest, the crazy one, the crazy one.

1145
00:56:57,740 --> 00:56:59,180
It's less crazy than it used to be.

1146
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:02,460
But a lot of people from the Electric Daisy Carnival were there.

1147
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:06,280
So there were people like half nude standing in line.

1148
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:12,060
They had blocked off the second floor where Mack tonight was was not able to go up there.

1149
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:13,740
We heard him playing.

1150
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:14,360
Really?

1151
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:14,800
Yeah.

1152
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:18,380
You could hear Mack singing, but we were not allowed up there.

1153
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:21,680
You mean by we you mean you and the Daisy Carnival people?

1154
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,660
No, my friend Dave was with me.

1155
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:24,120
Oh, OK.

1156
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:24,440
OK.

1157
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:24,640
Yeah.

1158
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:24,880
Sorry.

1159
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:25,380
Sorry.

1160
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:30,320
Me and 15, 21 year olds.

1161
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:30,960
Yeah.

1162
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:34,020
What was the half of their wardrobe that wasn't nude?

1163
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:35,720
Bellies.

1164
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:38,100
A lot of bellies, I think, were showing.

1165
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:39,980
But then what are they wearing?

1166
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:42,520
Is that in like fuzzy boots?

1167
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:43,720
Yeah, fuzzy.

1168
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:44,780
There were some fuzzy boots.

1169
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:47,060
I think there were like bathing suit tops.

1170
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:49,860
Everyone had their own thing going on.

1171
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:51,440
It was three a.

1172
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:51,620
m.

1173
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:52,840
I have to stress.

1174
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:53,280
Oh, yeah.

1175
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:53,540
Right.

1176
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:55,200
Because it was late or two a.

1177
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:55,280
m.

1178
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:55,840
Maybe it was two a.

1179
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:55,900
m.

1180
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:57,400
That one stays open that late, though.

1181
00:57:57,900 --> 00:57:58,100
That crazy McDonald's.

1182
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,240
I think it might be 24 hours.

1183
00:57:59,280 --> 00:57:59,640
Wow.

1184
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:04,880
And then I had I ordered a thing of pasta and a Philly cheesesteak.

1185
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:06,800
They still have the other stick.

1186
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:09,740
Because I remember when I went and like it was blowing my mind.

1187
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:13,240
There's like there's a deli menu here and then ice cream.

1188
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,840
It's a really weird McDonald's.

1189
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,080
It's a really weird McDonald's.

1190
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:18,340
And some of the stuff they didn't have that late.

1191
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:22,840
But I was I was like, oh, I can order pasta and a Philly cheesesteak.

1192
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:23,940
I hadn't eaten dinner.

1193
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:24,940
How very hungry.

1194
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:26,660
They were both pretty good.

1195
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:27,460
Wow.

1196
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,940
Like, I mean, not amazing, but pretty good.

1197
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:30,560
Geez.

1198
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,780
I ate them in the hotel room alone.

1199
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:33,700
Wow.

1200
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:34,480
So I brought them back.

1201
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:36,060
Yeah.

1202
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,520
Well, the hotel wasn't too far.

1203
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:38,940
So it wasn't so bad.

1204
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:39,540
That's true.

1205
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:43,480
But yeah, this used to have when you before you went in, when you went in the door,

1206
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:48,060
there was like an old fiber optic kind of sign that said, prepare to be dazzled.

1207
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:50,060
And I was so obsessed with that.

1208
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:54,620
And then several years later, I made my show Moonbeam City and the main character is named Dazzle.

1209
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:54,960
Right.

1210
00:58:54,960 --> 00:59:00,640
So in one scene before he was going to have sex with somebody, he said, prepare to be dazzled.

1211
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:05,460
And it was always a reference or a nod to the world's largest.

1212
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,540
Did anyone catch that?

1213
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:08,540
Did anyone know that?

1214
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:13,060
So many Internet sleuths like obvious a little bit hack, don't you think?

1215
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:17,840
I think we've seen enough Orlando World's Largest McDonald's references on television.

1216
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:22,100
Philly cheesesteak meal and choose your topping pasta and sauce.

1217
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,580
That's the that's the order.

1218
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:24,560
What did you choose?

1219
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:31,240
I chose macaroni with a no, that's not macaroni.

1220
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:32,080
That's what is that?

1221
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:33,260
Have a topi.

1222
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:33,680
What?

1223
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:34,860
Cabotopi.

1224
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:35,460
Cavatopi.

1225
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:35,800
It is.

1226
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:36,620
Yeah, Jason's right.

1227
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:38,320
Cavatopi.

1228
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:42,140
Cavatopi and a bolognese sauce is what I chose.

1229
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:42,960
I don't remember.

1230
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:44,500
I'm see Jason knows what I'm doing.

1231
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:45,960
He knows what I ordered.

1232
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:48,340
But he that's why I'm asking him where I went.

1233
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,780
And have a topi is I've never heard of cavatopi.

1234
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:55,000
It looks like macaroni, but it's longer and it's got ridges or whatever on it.

1235
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:57,100
And then the Philly cheesesteak here.

1236
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:00,120
And they were both pretty good for a lot of beef.

1237
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:02,480
Bolognese and a Philly cheesesteak.

1238
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,980
I burned a lot of calories doing live entertainment though.

1239
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:08,400
So I needed to fill up Mike's big beef night.

1240
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,560
And I was going to be a Magic Kingdom in a matter of hours.

1241
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:12,940
Oh, yeah.

1242
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:14,420
I didn't know you were doing that.

1243
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:16,180
I was I was up so late.

1244
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:18,740
I was trying to go and wake up for a virtual queue.

1245
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:25,060
That was the next morning after the live show was the only morning where I felt like, oh, no, I don't know if I can move.

1246
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:29,740
I like the rest of the trip I was very tired, but I was able to like rally pretty quickly.

1247
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:33,180
Live shows, eating that food, staying up too late.

1248
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,960
I was like, I don't know if I'm getting out of Orlando today.

1249
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:39,780
There was never rest in that trip for us.

1250
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:40,640
No, no, no, no.

1251
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:41,700
So, yeah.

1252
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,800
So but but I saw I went back.

1253
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:47,780
I remember I woke up at like seven thirty and I was like, I feel like I'm going to die.

1254
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:51,040
And then I slept another hour badly.

1255
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:56,640
And then I was like, well, I feel like I'm going to die, but I better get to Tron.

1256
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:58,440
That's what it's all about.

1257
01:00:58,440 --> 01:00:59,620
I better go to Tron.

1258
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:00,720
Pushing your body to the limit.

1259
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:02,020
Get to the game grid.

1260
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:09,720
I haven't talked on in an episode about my ride back to the airport, have I?

1261
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:10,620
I don't think so.

1262
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:11,940
OK, really quick.

1263
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:13,680
Just in thinking about the city, beautiful.

1264
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:18,900
I'm contrasting that with this experience I had where I loved my driver.

1265
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:25,660
This guy was so clutch and was doing like he was overriding where the, you know, ways or whatever was telling him to go.

1266
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:27,780
And I think I got to the airport on time because of him.

1267
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:28,140
Yeah.

1268
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:34,920
And he was this funny character, this very this odd Orlando character who had he was wearing a sleeveless shirt.

1269
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:41,280
So I had in a in the back, I had a perfect view of his gigantic back tattoo of Ted of the Teddy Bear.

1270
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:41,580
Really?

1271
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:42,180
Yes.

1272
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:43,280
Wow.

1273
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:44,040
Ted.

1274
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:47,940
Which I asked him about it and he was like, I had that before that became a thing.

1275
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:49,100
Everybody's now.

1276
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:51,820
Right after I did that, everybody's doing Ted tattoos.

1277
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,280
But I was first to do Ted tattoo.

1278
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:54,200
Wow.

1279
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:57,360
He thought he was like like on the cusp of a trend.

1280
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:07,820
But he was giving me all this like funny Orlando real talk, including that we passed by Hooters in Lake Pointe-A-Viste where I'd been several years prior for this bachelor party.

1281
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:09,520
He's like, see that Hooters?

1282
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:12,660
They found they found dead body in the lake outside that Hooters.

1283
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:15,420
Whoa.

1284
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:16,260
I've been there.

1285
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:17,480
I've been to that one.

1286
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:20,540
And like I didn't think he was lying.

1287
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:21,440
I took his word for it.

1288
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:25,260
But I didn't know if this was like local lore and if that's just something he heard.

1289
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:28,100
But then I looked it up and that's a story you can find in the news.

1290
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:29,780
They found a body in the.

1291
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:33,860
So that's where I'm like, lakes everywhere.

1292
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:38,220
Good potential for bodies floating in the lakes.

1293
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:38,700
That's good.

1294
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:39,300
That's good.

1295
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:41,400
But I boy, that was a fun ride though.

1296
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:41,900
I loved.

1297
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:43,660
I couldn't make a Ted tattoo guy.

1298
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:48,040
I feel like if I could like ask for him in future trips, I would.

1299
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:51,000
I think I would pre book this guy with the Ted tattoo.

1300
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:51,500
He was great.

1301
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:54,880
I think he's got some good Orlando Lyft drivers too.

1302
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:59,900
Disney guy who is like the like sweet like sweetest guy driving us around.

1303
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,200
I think we mentioned him maybe in an episode a couple years ago.

1304
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:06,360
But like I feel like there's there the characters are strong.

1305
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:07,000
Yeah.

1306
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:07,440
Oftentimes.

1307
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:12,920
That's another like well like getting in a in a tram where Buddy Dyer is talking to you.

1308
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:14,720
What do you want in Orlando?

1309
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:17,580
You want interesting rides with interesting characters?

1310
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:20,500
And I guess you get them wherever you go.

1311
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:21,520
Be it ride, sure.

1312
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:29,120
Well, yeah, you get all the old employees from Orlando, the tour guides from Orlando's former second biggest employer.

1313
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:32,660
It used to be number one was the McCoy Air Force Base.

1314
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:36,340
And of course, number two was Big Ronnie's fan boat tours.

1315
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:41,740
And they all have gone on to different gigs when that company shuttered.

1316
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:42,460
Is that real?

1317
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:43,220
Big Ronnie?

1318
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:43,760
It's not.

1319
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:45,040
I thought maybe.

1320
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:47,180
I was just pulling out the deepest.

1321
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:49,840
I didn't know you were joking necessarily.

1322
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:53,260
I well, that's how you got to New York.

1323
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:55,300
You got on one of Big Ronnie's fan boats.

1324
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:55,920
Don't you remember?

1325
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:02,260
I now I'm remembering now that I did take Big Ronnie's fan boat to get to the Long Island Railroad.

1326
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,620
Thank you for jogging my memory.

1327
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,500
I got FFY United at some point.

1328
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:09,440
Ronnie sold out.

1329
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:12,180
Ronnie, you want to take the cash.

1330
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:15,180
Let me keep reading his buddy's welcome message.

1331
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:24,840
You probably know Orlando for its world class theme parks and attractions, but you may not know the other half of it from our professional sports, high tech and emerging medical industries to our vibrant arts community.

1332
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:26,300
There is something for everyone.

1333
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:27,480
Enjoy your visit.

1334
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:28,620
Nice.

1335
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,720
And he's highlighting it's not just theme parks.

1336
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:32,280
There's a lot going on here.

1337
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:40,560
And that seems like an area of passion for him is that, you know, he's been reelected a number of times.

1338
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:43,120
He's been the mayor since 2003.

1339
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:44,000
Yeah, for a while.

1340
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:47,100
Just just got reelected to his sixth and final term.

1341
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:50,020
He said it will be the last, but they voted him in anyway.

1342
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:52,580
He said, I think I've got a little bit more I want to do.

1343
01:04:52,580 --> 01:05:02,540
People seem to really like Buddy Dyer, Democrat, well liked politician within a state with obviously this governor's sucks ass.

1344
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:05,880
So so that that's nice.

1345
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:07,940
I get a good feeling from this guy.

1346
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,220
I think what I just read was a little bit out of date.

1347
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:14,880
He got he this guy shows up and does new ones.

1348
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:18,580
He updates this thing, I think, a lot when he gets the chance.

1349
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:28,100
And here now, a video of great Buddy Dyer himself, a peek behind the scenes as he recorded his new message for twenty twenty two.

1350
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:29,840
Hello, this Orlando mayor, Buddy Dyer.

1351
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:32,120
If you're a resident, welcome home.

1352
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:35,820
If you're one of our nearly 70 million visitors, welcome to the city.

1353
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:36,340
Beautiful.

1354
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:40,280
Here, imagination becomes reality at our theme parks and attractions.

1355
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:46,540
Authentic experiences are found in our art scene, sporting events and small business districts in Orlando.

1356
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:48,380
There's something for everyone.

1357
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:53,760
We hope you enjoy your visit and everything that makes Orlando unbelievably real.

1358
01:05:54,620 --> 01:06:04,440
What do you think now that you've does does somehow that take away as as as it might for people who see us who mainly know our voices?

1359
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:08,700
People might find a disconnect or are somewhat disappointed by how we look in person.

1360
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:09,220
Yeah, I know.

1361
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:11,680
That's what they have been like.

1362
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:14,940
How do we feel now that we've seen Buddy?

1363
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:17,040
I like it, actually.

1364
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:17,620
I like it.

1365
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:19,340
I'm happy with the way he looks.

1366
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:24,040
I'm happy to see that he's looking he he's like wearing like almost like a bowling shirt or something.

1367
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:27,060
He's wearing a nice red bowling shirt.

1368
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:27,420
Yeah.

1369
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:30,860
And you might see a little bit of white text on the ball.

1370
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:33,420
Yeah, it says Mayor Buddy Dyer.

1371
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:34,360
Wow.

1372
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:41,600
And I've seen multiple clips of the sky in which he is always wearing a bowling shirt that says Mayor Buddy Dyer on it.

1373
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:42,200
Nice.

1374
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:42,920
Yeah.

1375
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:44,160
Can we get Jason that shirt?

1376
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:45,080
Oh, cool.

1377
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:46,380
Oh, man.

1378
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:49,000
That's the ultimate theme park.

1379
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:56,700
That is like if you like sometimes I'm like, how do you go deeper in like 23 type cosplay then because people go so deep.

1380
01:06:56,900 --> 01:07:02,360
You know, people being like the guy from the Maelstrom mural or Drew Carey fanning the maps out.

1381
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:03,440
I'm like, how do you go deep?

1382
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:09,240
I think being Mayor Buddy Dyer with that shirt, with the red shirt, with the embroidery.

1383
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:12,600
You just put a little gray in the hair, I think, and then you're fully.

1384
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:13,360
Oh, sure.

1385
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:14,580
I think you pass this buddy.

1386
01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:15,300
Yeah.

1387
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:15,580
Yeah.

1388
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:17,440
Hey, I wish I had found that video.

1389
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:28,940
I kept watching rewinding YouTube videos of someone on the tram so I could transcribe his thing and then convert it to podcast the ride specifics.

1390
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:30,060
Yeah.

1391
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:33,040
When he says the city beauty, he says the city beautiful.

1392
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:33,900
That's the line.

1393
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:35,340
It reminds I'm real.

1394
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:38,240
Now I know what it reminds me of because I've been trying to figure it out.

1395
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:45,460
It reminds me of Captain EO when the evil queen goes, you find me beautiful.

1396
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:48,580
Yeah.

1397
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:52,120
Very beautiful, your highness, but without a key to unlock it.

1398
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:55,220
Captain EO, another great source of flat deliveries.

1399
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:55,960
Oh, yeah.

1400
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:56,200
Yeah.

1401
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:56,440
Yeah.

1402
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:58,680
Well, yeah.

1403
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:00,700
Does he do cameos, you think?

1404
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:01,540
Oh, I don't know.

1405
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:03,260
Can we get him to do the Captain EO line?

1406
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:04,380
Oh, jeez.

1407
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:06,400
It just sounds so good when you say beautiful.

1408
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:07,480
You find me beautiful.

1409
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:18,260
That is the city beautiful is one of Orlando's like, you know, it's like the Big Apple, you know, or the Windy City or Lando.

1410
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:22,760
It's like one of those except if nobody anywhere said it.

1411
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:23,340
Right.

1412
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:25,380
Well, it's on this road sign.

1413
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:27,960
It's on this side of the road.

1414
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:30,400
They're trying to make fetch happen.

1415
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:32,480
Yeah, it's more likely.

1416
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:35,040
I'm going to be more likely to think of it as the city beautiful.

1417
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:35,960
I will say it.

1418
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:40,040
I think that's the seal of the city.

1419
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:45,540
I mean, this guy, he's doing the like him taking over this role,

1420
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:52,480
him being like so proactive and I want to personally welcome people to the city in a way that they have to hear.

1421
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:52,880
Right.

1422
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:53,760
People are trying.

1423
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:57,440
This is the only way to get out of the airport is through the train.

1424
01:08:57,460 --> 01:08:57,720
Right.

1425
01:08:57,900 --> 01:08:59,180
So you've got to meet Buddy.

1426
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:00,980
I think this is great.

1427
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:02,820
I think he's a he's a strong ambassador.

1428
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:08,100
And, you know, I think they used to maybe somewhere still they might use some safety announcement.

1429
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:09,880
It used to be a guy we bring up a lot.

1430
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:16,780
Jack Wagner, the voice of Disneyland, the ultimate like please stand clear of the doors guy.

1431
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:24,540
And I mostly I would be upset in any other case of taking that guy and his classic voice out.

1432
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:28,700
And I'm just glad this isn't like who would it be?

1433
01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:30,460
Neil Patrick Harris, you know?

1434
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:31,660
So, yeah, they don't know.

1435
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:33,220
Yeah, yeah.

1436
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:33,920
Yeah.

1437
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:40,360
That would be probably like a more modern like instinct to go like what who can we get that's famous?

1438
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:43,780
It's like any modern animated movie or CGI movie.

1439
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:48,420
It's all big stars now, not voice talent like Buddy.

1440
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,340
Well, it could be some homegrown.

1441
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:52,820
I mean, DJ Khaled's from Orlando.

1442
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:54,200
Well, I wouldn't be mad at that.

1443
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,580
Joey Fatone lives there, I believe.

1444
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:57,300
OK.

1445
01:09:57,420 --> 01:09:58,080
From Orlando.

1446
01:09:58,180 --> 01:10:00,780
Is that part of the whole him suddenly being in the Disney?

1447
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:01,560
DJ Khaled?

1448
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:03,300
I think that's one of the connections.

1449
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:03,860
Yeah.

1450
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:05,080
I hope so.

1451
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:13,320
I hope it's because then I'm not in favor of him on the Monterey or on the PeopleMover if he's not an authentic Orlando resident.

1452
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:14,620
I'm seeing him.

1453
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:17,700
I'm seeing Miami is the oh, OK.

1454
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:18,160
Yeah.

1455
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:18,360
All right.

1456
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:19,520
Then I'm not in favor of it.

1457
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:20,080
Do the Miami.

1458
01:10:20,180 --> 01:10:21,480
Then he could do the Miami.

1459
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:24,100
Yeah, I can do Miami and say another one.

1460
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:24,600
I don't know.

1461
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:25,580
Fucking shit.

1462
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:26,580
He can do his stuff.

1463
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:27,600
We know your tricks.

1464
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:32,880
Billy Corgan, I would be OK with, though, if he could whisper

1465
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:38,880
or just do it in the in the middle part of zero where he's like talking.

1466
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:42,840
Emptiness is loneliness and loneliness is kindness.

1467
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:44,960
Like you do it in that specific singing voice.

1468
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:45,840
I saw the comment.

1469
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:52,680
We just did this episode about the candlelight processionals and the celebrities who do this religious service.

1470
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:53,100
Yeah.

1471
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:56,500
And I think there was some matter of fact like Billy Corgan.

1472
01:10:56,580 --> 01:10:57,980
Why isn't Billy Corgan done it?

1473
01:10:57,980 --> 01:11:04,640
And a listener said, like, doesn't have a lyric that's about like how God is empty just like me.

1474
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:06,880
God is empty just like me.

1475
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:08,880
It would be strange, I guess.

1476
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:12,120
You hear him suddenly telling the story of Christ.

1477
01:11:12,260 --> 01:11:15,900
But if you listen to the Zwan album, Zwan is very…

1478
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:17,420
As many people do frequently.

1479
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:20,340
And I, of course, recently listened to it.

1480
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,160
It is sort of religious.

1481
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:25,040
He's sort of a religious guy.

1482
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:26,820
That's what's interesting about it.

1483
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:28,300
I guess that that does add up.

1484
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:29,680
He seems like the kind of.

1485
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:30,240
Yeah.

1486
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:30,640
Yeah.

1487
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:33,740
So he's like a Disney Christian, I think.

1488
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:40,140
After all, you know, you get old and you get more Christian and you get more into the Disney parks.

1489
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:42,760
You know, when you're young.

1490
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:43,700
He can do what he wants.

1491
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:47,580
So anyways, Buddy seems well liked.

1492
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:52,220
And he has I think people think that he's done a good job.

1493
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:54,460
If you're an Orlando resident, you might tell me otherwise.

1494
01:11:54,460 --> 01:12:03,780
But from an outside perspective, it seems like especially where, you know, where there's bad politicians who engage in these culture wars and don't do their actual job.

1495
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,640
It seems like Buddy has done a good job.

1496
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:12,820
And he has the things that he mentions in his little narration, tech and medical innovations.

1497
01:12:14,060 --> 01:12:20,980
He really he seems to be very proud of like Orlando and specific Orlando communities that have made strides in that area.

1498
01:12:20,980 --> 01:12:30,340
And actually found a little speech that he gave an award to a particular Orlando community that's been doing great work in advanced or I'm sorry, automated mobility.

1499
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:36,780
Like we talk about with the people mover, like unmanned vehicles that work as public transit and can take people around.

1500
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:38,960
So here's a little speech that he gave.

1501
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:46,440
The standard for automated mobility solutions for communities statewide and across the country is being set by Lake Nona.

1502
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:51,440
This award is a testament to Lake Nona's culture of innovation and collaboration.

1503
01:12:51,780 --> 01:12:51,960
Wow.

1504
01:12:52,420 --> 01:12:56,540
So he's very this this this nice man is very proud of how certain communities.

1505
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:59,560
I didn't know there was innovation and communication.

1506
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:01,840
I guess I should rethink Lake Nona.

1507
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:07,820
You had no idea the degree of innovation and communication going on there.

1508
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:14,260
I actually think this is something that you would like because let me see.

1509
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:16,000
They have a macaroni.

1510
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:16,760
What's that?

1511
01:13:16,820 --> 01:13:17,880
Do they have a macaroni grill?

1512
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:19,620
Oh, that's something to look up.

1513
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:20,300
I don't know.

1514
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:23,800
But they do have they have a program called Move Nona.

1515
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:31,760
And there's a whole they have what they say is the largest autonomous vehicle system, a fleet in the country.

1516
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:32,960
So you get on these.

1517
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:34,340
You like your weird little transportations.

1518
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:35,720
Here's something.

1519
01:13:35,980 --> 01:13:37,520
They have these things called beeps.

1520
01:13:37,940 --> 01:13:38,720
Here's a beep.

1521
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:43,820
It's this odd little like tall bus that fits 10 people.

1522
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:44,240
Wow.

1523
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:45,680
There's one attendant on it.

1524
01:13:45,820 --> 01:13:49,780
That's somebody who doesn't drive it, but he just makes sure that the beeps move OK.

1525
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:50,140
Wow.

1526
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:54,400
And so you take if you want to move around Nona, you take you take a beep around.

1527
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:55,140
That sounds good.

1528
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,640
They look they look really nice.

1529
01:13:57,740 --> 01:13:59,480
Yeah, we I'm a fan.

1530
01:13:59,660 --> 01:14:01,760
I haven't been on a beep, but I'd like to be on a beep.

1531
01:14:01,940 --> 01:14:08,860
That seems better than the like self-driving cars in beta testing in San Francisco that keep almost killing people.

1532
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:18,060
We're like just going like most efficient merge into opposite lane merge into opposing traffic.

1533
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:19,160
You did.

1534
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:24,540
I was actually happy to see this because, yeah, I think we all associate self-driving cars with Elon and nightmares.

1535
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:29,060
But I'm like, but wait, we like our we like the Orlando Airport tram.

1536
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:30,360
There's no driver on that.

1537
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:38,420
Yeah.

1538
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:41,700
Yeah, I knew.

1539
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:43,860
Yeah, we I've heard nothing about the beeps.

1540
01:14:43,940 --> 01:14:45,380
Seems like they're successful.

1541
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:46,640
I would.

1542
01:14:46,780 --> 01:14:47,000
Yeah.

1543
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:48,300
Somebody correct us if we're wrong.

1544
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:50,040
Massive beep crash.

1545
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:52,240
Well, this is the dark side.

1546
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:58,400
Buddy Buddy Dyer when he's not recording new narrations, he's covering up the massive beep explosions.

1547
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:59,220
I know.

1548
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:03,100
That's why I control the press.

1549
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:06,700
Make sure there's nothing written about the dark side of Buddy.

1550
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:10,640
Make sure all those people are as forgotten as the cow that died in that crash.

1551
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:12,940
I was going to say you should run for governor.

1552
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:13,720
Beeps.

1553
01:15:14,060 --> 01:15:14,540
Yeah.

1554
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:17,560
Beeps keep killing cows and there's a cover up at hand.

1555
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:22,960
Yeah, I was going to say, you know, we had a lot of business CityWalk related.

1556
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:28,180
And we didn't get to do like Nona, but next time we're in Orlando, we need to do a little like Nona investigation.

1557
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:29,520
I thought about it.

1558
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:30,060
I was like, I know.

1559
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:30,660
I did too.

1560
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,280
I had the car.

1561
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:39,380
But then like I also haven't said on the show that I was and Monday contemplating going to see Pitbull on Thursday night.

1562
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:40,380
Oh, that's right.

1563
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:45,580
That was like, yes, we were you were always that was like dancing around as a possibility.

1564
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:46,840
Was he at Hard Rock Live?

1565
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:48,020
No, no, he was.

1566
01:15:48,220 --> 01:15:49,480
It was 10 minutes down the road.

1567
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:55,380
It was one of the arenas award winning arenas, world class entertainment like Pitbull.

1568
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:56,760
Orlando is your home.

1569
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:57,240
Thursday.

1570
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:57,920
I bet I could be.

1571
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:02,000
It became truly impossible by Thursday night, energy wise.

1572
01:16:02,420 --> 01:16:04,620
And for me to be able to Thursday was the death day.

1573
01:16:05,660 --> 01:16:09,840
And I was like, yeah, Monday, Tuesday, morning Wednesday.

1574
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:12,140
I was like, I think I'm going to go to see Pitbull.

1575
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:13,700
I'm going to go alone to see Pitbull.

1576
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:16,120
It was like Enrique Iglesias and Ricky Martin.

1577
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:17,800
And then I was like, this is going to be amazing.

1578
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:19,260
And then Thursday hit.

1579
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:24,920
And I was like, I don't think I'll be able to do the live shows if I go because I'm also going to go.

1580
01:16:25,140 --> 01:16:26,620
I'm going to go try to get G.

1581
01:16:26,620 --> 01:16:26,740
A.

1582
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:29,120
I'm trying to get pit and I'm going to get hammered.

1583
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:30,740
I can't do it.

1584
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:31,420
Pit for Pitbull.

1585
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:32,060
I can't.

1586
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:33,520
I was like, I can't do it.

1587
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:34,560
I went to bed early.

1588
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:36,340
In the pit with Red Bull.

1589
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:39,200
Yeah, Pit and Bull at Pitbull.

1590
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:41,960
He's got to have that rhyme in one of his songs, I think.

1591
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:44,320
But yeah, so.

1592
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:46,140
So that's Enrique and Ricky Martin.

1593
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:48,300
Yeah, this sounds great.

1594
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:49,700
It's not going to be a big party.

1595
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:56,680
But yeah, so so there were blue sky things in my mind where I was like, maybe I go like Nona, maybe I see Pitbull.

1596
01:16:56,920 --> 01:17:01,000
And then after so much city walk, I was like, I can't do anything extra.

1597
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:02,440
It killed our spirits.

1598
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:03,060
Yes.

1599
01:17:03,180 --> 01:17:03,740
Yeah, that's true.

1600
01:17:03,740 --> 01:17:04,560
It killed our ambition.

1601
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:11,000
I also have a little clip of Buddy being interviewed about his role as the.

1602
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:11,460
Oh, great.

1603
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:11,780
B.

1604
01:17:11,780 --> 01:17:12,020
O.

1605
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:12,480
guy.

1606
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:43,500
He smacks Buddy in the arm there.

1607
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:45,080
It's his greatest achievement.

1608
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:47,440
He seems he's he's very proud of it.

1609
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:47,680
Yeah.

1610
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:49,000
Happy to talk about it.

1611
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:56,320
And that, by the way, was a clip from a YouTube show called The More You Nona, a show about Lake Nona happening.

1612
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:59,120
Oh, we got to get on that show if it's still around.

1613
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:06,320
Yeah, I've heard that there's no show that's as more it's more innovative and where the host is better communication.

1614
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:10,880
We can we get can we get yeah, can we get our own show on Lake Nona's YouTube?

1615
01:18:11,980 --> 01:18:14,440
The more you know, the dirty dogs of Lake Nona.

1616
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:20,120
Yeah, I guess it could be it's it's PG 13 show Lake Nona's.

1617
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,660
Yeah, yeah, we show you not to act.

1618
01:18:22,820 --> 01:18:23,160
Uh huh.

1619
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:26,560
They're the goofus's of opposed to the gallons.

1620
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:27,020
Right.

1621
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:28,920
I was I was looking buddies.

1622
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,600
Real name is John.

1623
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:32,760
John Hugh Dyer.

1624
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:33,600
Hmm.

1625
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:36,420
Well, now I don't know how I feel about you know, like, what does he have to hide?

1626
01:18:37,220 --> 01:18:41,660
Is Buddy anyone's actual full like real name on a birth certificate or is it always a nickname?

1627
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:42,520
I don't know.

1628
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:42,720
I don't know.

1629
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:43,640
I'm sure there's some.

1630
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:47,980
What about Buddy Epson, a member of the Disney family?

1631
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:49,540
You know I love my Epson talk.

1632
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:57,380
He was a he was Frank Christian Ludolf Epson, also known as Frasso, not in several ways, not a buddy.

1633
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:59,940
Not a buddy, not a not a birth certificate buddy.

1634
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:02,480
There's got to be some birth certificate buddies.

1635
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:04,760
Oh, wait, now he's he grew.

1636
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:05,020
Wow.

1637
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:06,540
I didn't know he grew up in Orlando.

1638
01:19:06,940 --> 01:19:07,760
That's interesting.

1639
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:08,580
Buddy Epson.

1640
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:08,580
Yeah.

1641
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:09,280
Uh huh.

1642
01:19:09,420 --> 01:19:09,580
Wow.

1643
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:11,240
Graduated from Orlando High School.

1644
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:11,760
What?

1645
01:19:11,940 --> 01:19:14,360
Yeah, went to the University of Florida in Gainesville.

1646
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,320
Is that an Orlando name buddy?

1647
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:18,000
Yeah, maybe.

1648
01:19:19,060 --> 01:19:20,280
More likely to be a buddy.

1649
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:21,620
What about Buddy Guy?

1650
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:23,280
Or buddies per capita than.

1651
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:24,560
Buddy Guy.

1652
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:27,400
Do you think his name is Buddy for real?

1653
01:19:28,620 --> 01:19:29,100
Sure.

1654
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:30,780
His name is George.

1655
01:19:30,940 --> 01:19:32,120
George Guy.

1656
01:19:32,820 --> 01:19:34,280
Who's a buddy by birth?

1657
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:35,980
What about my buddy, the toy?

1658
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:37,700
Is that really his name?

1659
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:39,480
I guess his first name is My.

1660
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,380
His first name is My.

1661
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:43,100
On his first certificate.

1662
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:44,860
Famous buddies.

1663
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:46,020
Buddy Holly.

1664
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:46,700
Buddy Holly.

1665
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:47,460
What do we think?

1666
01:19:48,060 --> 01:19:49,220
Is his real name Buddy?

1667
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:49,580
I don't think so.

1668
01:19:49,740 --> 01:19:50,340
I think it is.

1669
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:51,520
It's a rock and roll nickname.

1670
01:19:51,780 --> 01:19:53,220
Charles Hardin Holly.

1671
01:19:53,940 --> 01:19:55,700
There are no real buddies.

1672
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:56,740
No real buddies.

1673
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:57,340
Famous buddies.

1674
01:19:57,340 --> 01:19:58,700
We could stop this.

1675
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:03,500
If any future children are in the fold, we could make a true buddy by birth.

1676
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:04,580
Yeah, Jason, what were you saying?

1677
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:11,440
Oh, I was going to say I had a my buddy sitting on a little chair in my childhood bedroom for years.

1678
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:13,340
That creeps me out.

1679
01:20:13,460 --> 01:20:14,540
Sitting in a little chair.

1680
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,000
Sitting in a little chair.

1681
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:19,880
Did you move him?

1682
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:22,140
Did you get him out of the chair?

1683
01:20:22,140 --> 01:20:26,780
Well, the thing was I stayed young and he started looking like shit.

1684
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:28,960
He got older and older all the time.

1685
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:30,460
Oh my God, he aged.

1686
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:31,940
Oh my God, that is.

1687
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:33,240
Your buddy, Doc.

1688
01:20:35,140 --> 01:20:43,280
Buddy, the first nature boy in wrestling, Buddy Rogers, his real name was Herman Gustav Roady Jr.

1689
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:45,140
Not a real buddy.

1690
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:50,280
As far as I can tell, country singer Buddy Jule Jr.

1691
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:52,180
is a buddy from birth.

1692
01:20:52,540 --> 01:20:52,880
Really?

1693
01:20:53,060 --> 01:20:53,380
Okay.

1694
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:53,880
Yes.

1695
01:20:53,880 --> 01:21:00,620
So that's the one who won the show Nashville Star in 2003.

1696
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:04,220
There are birth buddies.

1697
01:21:04,220 --> 01:21:05,440
There is a birth certificate buddy.

1698
01:21:05,620 --> 01:21:06,980
That is a birth certificate buddy.

1699
01:21:06,980 --> 01:21:10,640
I had an internship once.

1700
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:19,400
Some guy who was like an executive I had never met one day came in with a cardboard box of stuff.

1701
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:24,980
And he was like, we're going to build a website for Nashville Star.

1702
01:21:26,020 --> 01:21:31,920
And it's going to be there's going to be message boards and there's going to be all this stuff and you're going to head it up.

1703
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:35,920
And then I never saw him again.

1704
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:40,660
And I also finished the semester about 10 days later.

1705
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:46,800
So I don't know why he thought I was going to build a massive Nashville Star website.

1706
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,360
You think it's going to be on your shoulders?

1707
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:49,940
It's going to be on my shoulders.

1708
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:54,720
This is a for credit internship, which I would advise people.

1709
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:56,360
Opt for money.

1710
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:57,560
Don't do that.

1711
01:21:57,700 --> 01:21:59,340
Get paid folks.

1712
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:00,920
That's an interesting thing.

1713
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:06,400
Credit is our credits are used as currency in futuristic films.

1714
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:11,680
Credit is in some ways in some worlds or planets credit could be a good thing.

1715
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:13,280
These were academic credits.

1716
01:22:13,460 --> 01:22:14,960
It's just on paper.

1717
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:18,380
But in an alternate dimension perhaps.

1718
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:19,580
Wow.

1719
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:23,680
So you weren't even like, maybe just to test my metal.

1720
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:24,480
Maybe I should.

1721
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:27,140
Maybe you did it unofficially.

1722
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:28,360
I just want to see if I can.

1723
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:31,400
I just built a spec Nashville Star website.

1724
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,580
Maybe I should start a Squarespace or a Wix.

1725
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:39,360
What if I build a very elaborate Nashville Star website now?

1726
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:40,900
Yeah.

1727
01:22:41,620 --> 01:22:45,060
Then you could change your name to Jason Buddy Sheridan.

1728
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:51,220
And then you sort of are more in the Nashville scene because that feels like a kind of a southern nickname to me.

1729
01:22:51,340 --> 01:22:53,800
I wonder if the official website is out there.

1730
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:57,240
I wonder what became of the website once you dropped out of the fold.

1731
01:22:57,240 --> 01:23:02,640
I don't think it ever got very far than a Pankers box with some CDs and pronounce in it.

1732
01:23:09,980 --> 01:23:16,240
It seems like what you'd want to do is like maybe go through the web department of Warner Brothers rather than some kid.

1733
01:23:17,140 --> 01:23:17,440
Yeah.

1734
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:19,400
It's probably a better plan.

1735
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:30,900
One dipshit whose main job seems to be taking the golf cart to get six things of soup for the assistants who are not being paid very much and keep ordering soup,

1736
01:23:31,460 --> 01:23:38,440
not thinking about how will that 21 year old transport six things of soup in a golf cart?

1737
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:39,400
How'd it go?

1738
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:44,820
I don't want to say that I hope that you spilled it, but I kind of hope that you spilled it.

1739
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:45,280
No.

1740
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:48,760
Because that's your stories about food service.

1741
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:49,400
Yeah.

1742
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:51,180
Was just you spilling marinara and stuff.

1743
01:23:51,180 --> 01:23:51,600
I know.

1744
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:52,400
That's right.

1745
01:23:52,420 --> 01:23:54,160
And then cutting yourself on the meat.

1746
01:23:54,260 --> 01:23:56,160
But you were also a soup transporter.

1747
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:56,660
I was a soup transporter.

1748
01:23:56,660 --> 01:23:58,020
And that hasn't come up on the show.

1749
01:23:58,140 --> 01:24:05,950
And then on Tuesdays, if you remember your CityWalk history, there used to be a Rubio's fish tacos and those were dollar fish tacos on Tuesdays.

1750
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:06,980
You know.

1751
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:09,400
So you transported.

1752
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:17,850
I transported a lot of fish tacos and I think people ordered combos and then I had to transport fountain sodas.

1753
01:24:18,750 --> 01:24:19,310
Whoa.

1754
01:24:19,850 --> 01:24:21,110
In like little individual cups?

1755
01:24:21,430 --> 01:24:24,370
In little like, yeah, carriers in the cardboard.

1756
01:24:24,570 --> 01:24:28,190
So thankfully they sent two of us to kind of manage all this.

1757
01:24:28,810 --> 01:24:30,070
Also, we didn't need sodas.

1758
01:24:30,110 --> 01:24:31,530
It was like a production bungalow.

1759
01:24:32,030 --> 01:24:35,250
There was a refrigerator in every room filled with soda cans.

1760
01:24:35,590 --> 01:24:35,830
Yeah.

1761
01:24:36,090 --> 01:24:37,770
But they want the ice in the straw.

1762
01:24:37,770 --> 01:24:38,630
They want the ice.

1763
01:24:38,730 --> 01:24:39,550
It's the good ice.

1764
01:24:39,550 --> 01:24:42,650
It's just for the feel and the syrup with the pending.

1765
01:24:42,830 --> 01:24:44,190
It's a different taste.

1766
01:24:44,870 --> 01:24:47,250
I'm finding now some Nashville Star.

1767
01:24:47,530 --> 01:24:50,150
The website on archive.

1768
01:24:50,150 --> 01:24:51,350
org, it looks like shit.

1769
01:24:51,450 --> 01:24:53,240
I think you could have only helped it.

1770
01:24:55,050 --> 01:24:59,030
Oh, I could have built a social media website from scratch.

1771
01:25:00,330 --> 01:25:03,770
With no web design experience or coding experience.

1772
01:25:05,470 --> 01:25:09,290
I mean, it looks like they ultimately did land on an intern or something.

1773
01:25:10,690 --> 01:25:11,650
But wow.

1774
01:25:11,870 --> 01:25:12,690
Well, geez, look at that.

1775
01:25:12,850 --> 01:25:14,110
We got mythology.

1776
01:25:14,350 --> 01:25:16,230
We got Lake Nona local shows.

1777
01:25:16,310 --> 01:25:16,650
Yeah.

1778
01:25:17,450 --> 01:25:19,030
We've covered a lot of ground here.

1779
01:25:19,730 --> 01:25:24,050
Any final thoughts, closing thoughts about Orlando's first ride?

1780
01:25:24,130 --> 01:25:26,030
How about, well, let's head the other way.

1781
01:25:26,250 --> 01:25:27,470
Now we're past security.

1782
01:25:27,950 --> 01:25:31,290
We're heading back, unfortunately, to the air sides.

1783
01:25:32,090 --> 01:25:33,230
Going back to our air side.

1784
01:25:33,270 --> 01:25:34,930
Does it make you ever, is that a down side?

1785
01:25:34,950 --> 01:25:39,270
Do you feel a little sad to have to get on these trams or is it the other?

1786
01:25:39,390 --> 01:25:41,390
Do you feel like, well, one final ride?

1787
01:25:42,030 --> 01:25:44,770
Yeah, I always feel a little melancholy.

1788
01:25:45,270 --> 01:25:45,270
Yeah.

1789
01:25:45,690 --> 01:25:46,490
Vacations ending.

1790
01:25:46,790 --> 01:25:49,390
It's comforting, though, for buddies.

1791
01:25:50,570 --> 01:25:50,970
Farewell.

1792
01:25:51,650 --> 01:25:53,150
Yeah, I don't have any copy of that.

1793
01:25:53,230 --> 01:25:55,930
I don't know what he's I don't remember how he says goodbye.

1794
01:25:55,930 --> 01:25:56,030
I have an outro.

1795
01:25:56,330 --> 01:25:56,830
I have an outro.

1796
01:25:56,930 --> 01:25:58,810
When we wrap up business, I'll do the outro.

1797
01:25:58,810 --> 01:25:59,370
Oh, OK.

1798
01:25:59,430 --> 01:25:59,630
OK.

1799
01:25:59,630 --> 01:26:01,470
So that'll give us a flavor of buddies.

1800
01:26:02,470 --> 01:26:02,710
Oh, geez.

1801
01:26:02,850 --> 01:26:03,130
Great.

1802
01:26:03,370 --> 01:26:11,990
As I said, I skipped this monorail trip or this this people mover trip because I went to Gate C and took a lift from the rental car place.

1803
01:26:12,930 --> 01:26:15,430
So I skipped it and I was a little sad.

1804
01:26:15,770 --> 01:26:18,450
Now, I needed to skip it because I was running late.

1805
01:26:18,450 --> 01:26:20,150
So I was happy about that.

1806
01:26:20,370 --> 01:26:22,910
But once I got to the, oh, he's dropping me right here.

1807
01:26:22,950 --> 01:26:25,950
So I guess I'm going to have to skip the people mover ride.

1808
01:26:25,950 --> 01:26:27,830
And I was a little bit bummed out by that.

1809
01:26:28,510 --> 01:26:30,190
So I do want that extra.

1810
01:26:30,350 --> 01:26:31,970
I want that last little ride.

1811
01:26:32,150 --> 01:26:33,410
You're you're to the airport.

1812
01:26:33,410 --> 01:26:33,710
Yes.

1813
01:26:33,750 --> 01:26:35,390
Good night from Mayor.

1814
01:26:35,450 --> 01:26:35,710
Yes.

1815
01:26:35,710 --> 01:26:36,950
I had to ask for a kiss.

1816
01:26:36,950 --> 01:26:38,510
Good night from the lift driver instead.

1817
01:26:38,510 --> 01:26:41,630
So I could get a little bit of it, but it wasn't the same.

1818
01:26:42,010 --> 01:26:47,030
But at least he has the full back tattoo of million ways to die in the West.

1819
01:26:47,810 --> 01:26:49,630
I didn't know I get a shirt on.

1820
01:26:50,010 --> 01:26:51,650
So I was the first one to do this.

1821
01:26:51,830 --> 01:26:57,970
There was nobody else doing Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown specifically in that not back to the future.

1822
01:26:59,270 --> 01:27:01,590
Now, everybody's got everybody's doing it.

1823
01:27:01,590 --> 01:27:01,890
Yeah.

1824
01:27:01,910 --> 01:27:04,510
Brown from million ways to die.

1825
01:27:05,450 --> 01:27:09,810
Well, I mean, I guess we're I guess we're wrapping up and hearing our final message.

1826
01:27:09,850 --> 01:27:11,270
You know, that's the last thing I didn't say.

1827
01:27:12,010 --> 01:27:14,350
I like neat just like neon circles.

1828
01:27:14,350 --> 01:27:15,790
There's just an area.

1829
01:27:16,030 --> 01:27:16,130
Yeah.

1830
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:20,510
There's like kind of a kind of 80s in those little tubes that you you can't.

1831
01:27:20,530 --> 01:27:26,890
It's the same thing that I love about Epcot that like where I a lot of Epcot changes and updating.

1832
01:27:27,070 --> 01:27:27,530
I welcome.

1833
01:27:27,670 --> 01:27:32,090
But I always want the like the bones to be kind of blocky in 80s.

1834
01:27:32,090 --> 01:27:38,350
And even though they change the trains, there's still like an inherent kind of ladies in Epcot feel to the trams.

1835
01:27:38,350 --> 01:27:43,770
So it makes it all it's like a motif that ties a bunch of the Orlando experience together.

1836
01:27:43,890 --> 01:27:46,550
And I like that and I appreciate that.

1837
01:27:46,750 --> 01:27:48,770
Yes, that's absolutely the case.

1838
01:27:49,470 --> 01:27:49,990
And yeah, I would.

1839
01:27:50,350 --> 01:27:50,730
The crystal.

1840
01:27:50,870 --> 01:27:51,170
What is it called?

1841
01:27:51,230 --> 01:27:54,410
The crystal crystal train crystal movers.

1842
01:27:54,730 --> 01:27:55,950
Thank you.

1843
01:27:56,530 --> 01:28:01,190
Those also if it's the right picture I was looking at, like those still even give me the vibe.

1844
01:28:01,330 --> 01:28:05,170
I can tell they're newer, but that still gives me the vibe you're talking about as well.

1845
01:28:05,170 --> 01:28:05,830
So there.

1846
01:28:05,870 --> 01:28:07,150
Yeah, you can't.

1847
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:08,910
I also know that I've said crystal mover again.

1848
01:28:09,070 --> 01:28:18,170
Like that sounds like something you would call like kind of drug runners in a movie that didn't do very good research about how crystal meth is dealt.

1849
01:28:18,610 --> 01:28:19,910
We got to like stop the crystal move.

1850
01:28:19,950 --> 01:28:20,830
We've got to stop the crystal.

1851
01:28:20,870 --> 01:28:21,590
All right.

1852
01:28:22,350 --> 01:28:22,970
We call it now.

1853
01:28:22,990 --> 01:28:25,150
We call these crystal movers.

1854
01:28:25,210 --> 01:28:28,850
You got to get we're going to flood the streets with crystal movers.

1855
01:28:29,010 --> 01:28:32,850
OK, as you said that, I thought you were going to say it sounds like a stripper's name.

1856
01:28:33,690 --> 01:28:35,530
Crystal mover and coming up next.

1857
01:28:37,250 --> 01:28:37,650
Movers.

1858
01:28:38,030 --> 01:28:40,570
She'll be she'll be dancing to Pitbull.

1859
01:28:40,850 --> 01:28:47,390
And keep in mind, if you sit in the pit closest to crystal and order a Red Bull, that's half off for the next half hour.

1860
01:28:47,570 --> 01:28:48,930
Did I say I said this already, right?

1861
01:28:48,950 --> 01:28:55,330
On the show that that right there rental car places right by a cult place called Rachel's Steakhouse that was also a strip club in Orlando.

1862
01:28:55,870 --> 01:28:56,270
Wow.

1863
01:28:56,390 --> 01:28:58,410
I was like, why would you get a steak?

1864
01:28:59,010 --> 01:29:00,170
It's I think it's called Rachel's.

1865
01:29:00,190 --> 01:29:00,270
Right.

1866
01:29:00,290 --> 01:29:00,870
Are you looking it up?

1867
01:29:01,030 --> 01:29:01,430
Yeah.

1868
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:03,130
So crystal movers.

1869
01:29:03,410 --> 01:29:04,630
Lord is finest, it says.

1870
01:29:05,190 --> 01:29:06,970
Yeah, I can't say that's not true.

1871
01:29:07,190 --> 01:29:07,470
I didn't.

1872
01:29:07,610 --> 01:29:11,590
Well, unless it's on the side, it's right by where I got the rental car.

1873
01:29:11,650 --> 01:29:12,990
So I'm driving and I was like, is that a state?

1874
01:29:13,110 --> 01:29:14,370
Oh, it's a what?

1875
01:29:14,510 --> 01:29:15,530
It was very confused.

1876
01:29:15,730 --> 01:29:16,550
I didn't go in.

1877
01:29:17,210 --> 01:29:18,570
I would never go in.

1878
01:29:19,290 --> 01:29:21,770
But if I knew Crystal Movers was there, I might have gone in.

1879
01:29:21,870 --> 01:29:23,130
What kind of steakhouse is this?

1880
01:29:23,290 --> 01:29:25,890
As I peruse the website, I see not a steak in sight.

1881
01:29:25,990 --> 01:29:28,230
It's nothing but scantily clad women.

1882
01:29:28,730 --> 01:29:31,690
I mean, are the steaks look appetizing or not?

1883
01:29:31,710 --> 01:29:33,310
Your website's not telling me anything.

1884
01:29:33,550 --> 01:29:33,810
Tell Mr.

1885
01:29:33,930 --> 01:29:36,230
Morrill should go and review Rachel's.

1886
01:29:37,010 --> 01:29:40,550
And you just see strippers in the background unacknowledged.

1887
01:29:44,490 --> 01:29:45,170
I'm going to ask.

1888
01:29:45,270 --> 01:29:45,810
I'm going to ask you.

1889
01:29:45,990 --> 01:29:50,190
And then a woman's like trying to like rub his back and he's like just like brushing it away.

1890
01:29:50,310 --> 01:29:50,490
Yeah.

1891
01:29:50,690 --> 01:29:50,690
Yeah.

1892
01:29:50,690 --> 01:29:50,850
Yeah.

1893
01:29:50,850 --> 01:29:52,130
Not not interested.

1894
01:29:52,310 --> 01:29:53,150
I'm trying to focus.

1895
01:29:53,250 --> 01:29:57,230
Maybe he could do a channel like Nona specific late night show or something.

1896
01:29:57,230 --> 01:29:58,030
Not on his channel.

1897
01:29:58,210 --> 01:29:58,930
That's very G rated.

1898
01:29:59,030 --> 01:29:59,270
Mr.

1899
01:29:59,470 --> 01:30:00,410
Morrow after dark.

1900
01:30:00,450 --> 01:30:00,850
Right.

1901
01:30:02,110 --> 01:30:06,870
Well, let's let's let's wind it down here and get to the final spiel.

1902
01:30:07,370 --> 01:30:10,310
This is very fun to talk about and hopefully a fun kickoff to the year.

1903
01:30:10,590 --> 01:30:11,970

1909
01:30:36,330 --> 01:30:40,170

1911

We hope you enjoyed your second gate experience.

1918
01:31:04,050 --> 01:31:05,010
That was that was nice.

1919
01:31:05,110 --> 01:31:09,770
I would in the future, you know, since we're having trouble getting you to be the mayor of anything,

1920
01:31:10,130 --> 01:31:15,690
I feel no ego in saying if you want to declare yourself the mayor of podcast the ride, fine by me.

1921
01:31:16,390 --> 01:31:17,890
OK, that's yours.

1922
01:31:18,070 --> 01:31:18,410
That's yours.

1923
01:31:18,710 --> 01:31:24,010
Mayor Jason Buddy Sheridan or just get rid of the Jason Mayor Buddy Sheridan.

1924
01:31:24,170 --> 01:31:26,130
This is the mayor of podcast the ride.

1925
01:31:26,430 --> 01:31:27,950
Jason Buddy Sheridan.

1926
01:31:28,290 --> 01:31:29,690
So your buddy Sheridan.

1927
01:31:30,890 --> 01:31:31,550
I think it works.

1928
01:31:31,690 --> 01:31:32,450
I think it's good.

1929
01:31:32,590 --> 01:31:32,970
Wow.

1930
01:31:33,270 --> 01:31:33,470
Yeah.

1931
01:31:33,470 --> 01:31:36,770
I got a new name for 2024 Mayor Buddy.

1932
01:31:37,130 --> 01:31:38,150
You got to keep it.

1933
01:31:38,170 --> 01:31:39,310
You got to keep it different.

1934
01:31:39,810 --> 01:31:41,010
You got to keep things changing.

1935
01:31:41,010 --> 01:31:41,830
You got to keep it interesting.

1936
01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:43,350
You got to surprise people.

1937
01:31:44,150 --> 01:31:44,650
Switch it up.

1938
01:31:45,030 --> 01:31:46,730
This new year, Jason has a new name.

1939
01:31:47,250 --> 01:31:47,410
Wow.

1940
01:31:47,670 --> 01:31:48,430
Only on second gate.

1941
01:31:48,570 --> 01:31:50,050
We only call you Mayor Buddy on the second gate.

1942
01:31:50,050 --> 01:31:51,590
Yeah, that's what you're paying for.

1943
01:31:52,490 --> 01:31:53,330
Exclusive names.

1944
01:31:53,550 --> 01:31:53,850
Great.
