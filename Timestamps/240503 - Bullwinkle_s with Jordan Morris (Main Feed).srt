grown men begging people

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
half their age to see

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000

and moose hot wife fantasies

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Jordan Morris returns

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
where today's topic is about

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
to trigger a live Vince

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
McMahon meme

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'll get you guys in

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm Scott Gardner, this is Mike Carlson, there's Jason Sheridan

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
in case you all want to do this with me

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
you know what I mean

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and our guest Jordan too

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
let's jump around

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'll do a better intro

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and if I'm thinking of the same meme it is a four panel meme

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
anyway so having a fourth guy

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
that makes sense

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I will do the captions on the side

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and if you remember

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
yes it's the four panels

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and you'll see what I'm doing here

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
so today's topic

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
kids pizza restaurant

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
mostly forgotten characters from

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
the 1960s

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
red eyes

44

galaxy brain

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
that was the thought

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
process as this topic

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
was presented to us

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
here returning to the show

50
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
a friend of the show who hasn't been on in far too long

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
suggesting it, bringing this topic up

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
bowl winkles restaurant

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
slash play place

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
arcade it's one of the

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
show room

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
theatrical experience

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
fountain shows

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
dancing water show what don't they have

67
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
in some cases go karts I don't know

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
we will figure out

69
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
the full breadth of what they had

70
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and this is a topic that has been

71
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
on the podcast

72
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
the right to do list I'd say for a very long time

73
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I remember making some list of like

74
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
we're starting the second gate this could be a good one

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
it came up in a club three poll

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
at some point but with Jordan it has

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
to be main feed and you know what

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
it needed to be main feed

79
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
this has main feed written all over

80
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
yes it's a really

81
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
strong

82
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
area and a really good

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
brand I mean it's one of those

84
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
where actually last night

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Jordan we were hanging out at the same birthday party

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
after you left somebody

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
asked what are you doing on podcast the ride soon

88
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I said Jordan is coming on to talk about

89
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
bullwinkles and one person at the table

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
had no idea what I was talking about and the other

91
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
two were like whoa

92
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
wow they were they did live

93
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
they did live Vince Mcmahon's

94
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I think it really depends on what part of the country

95
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
you're in but if you were near one of these

96
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and went to one of these I think

97
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
it's a big deal yeah yeah

98
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
so a lot of Southern California locations

99
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Pacific Northwest and

100
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Canada that was those were all that was

101
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
bullwinkles country okay okay yes

102
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
and like maybe some stray

103
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
ones in like

104
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
wait I have a list of kind of the odd

105
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
where they were

106
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
yeah you know Myrtle

107
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Beach Pensacola Florida

108
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Grand Rapids Michigan

109
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
but other than that mainly

110
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
California and then

111
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Jeddah Saudi Arabia

112
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I didn't expect

113
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
don't know not even one like

114
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
not Europe not Asia

115
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
but Saudi Arabia

116
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
really weird

117
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
the strangest spottiest brand

118
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
and just as we're getting basics

119
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
out this is based

120
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
on the Rocky

121
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
and Bullwinkle world of characters

122
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
the J Ward world

123
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
of characters the show

124
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
that aired in various names

125
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
but basically Rocky and Bullwinkle

126
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
from 1959 to 1964

127
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
but this chain was mainly

128
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
an 80s

129
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
phenomenon

130
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
that went away yeah there's a commercial

131
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
for it I think this dates it pretty well

132
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
there's a commercial for it where

133
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Bullwinkle is making fax machine

134
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
jokes did you guys see this

135
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
well I have a commercial loaded up

136
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
but it's not this one I should have loaded up this one

137
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
it's like you know he's saying

138
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
it's something like the

139
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
narrator who he would always banter with in

140
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
the cartoons was saying like you know

141
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Bullwinkle just give me the fax

142
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
and then Bullwinkle says something about a fax

143
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
machine he's like okay what about this new

144
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
technology so

145
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I think this this this chain was

146
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
at its height around the time that

147
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
fax machine jokes were hot

148
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
and I think it's

149
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
that commercial or it might be another one

150
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
with a tagline as

151
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
really good food

152
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
and that's it

153
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
really good food and not even

154
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
like plus games

155
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
plus like no it just says that

156
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
and then it shows some of the ugliest

157
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
pictures of like bar

158
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
food you've ever seen

159
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
the original draft was good food

160
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
and then someone's like can we plus this up

161
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
yeah yeah like Cameron

162
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
writing the dollar sign

163
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
by aliens

164
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
James Cameron came in

165
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
wrote really we've hired James Cameron

166
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
to consult on this pizza

167
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I mean they have bumper boats you can't tell me

168
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
James Cameron doesn't love bumper boats

169
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
that's a good question yeah he oh he must

170
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
have at some time James

171
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
James we have to eat dinner

172
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
before you get I see why

173
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
boots does he have you're saying

174
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I had two bites mom I had two bites

175
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
do you think he has a

176
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
bumper boat thing on his like estate

177
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
wherever he lives I bet he has

178
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
bumpers on his submarine oh yeah

179
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
so he can bump other millionaires in their submarines

180
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
while they're exploring various

181
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
trenches making documentaries that's just a

182
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
fun thing though it's just a fun little

183
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
love tap it is of course yeah

184
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
bumper it's not aggressive

185
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
they're just a brazen

186
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
just a little bit of a brazen

187
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
one thing I do want to say

188
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I don't think we've said it yet

189
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
still around

190
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
kind of ish sort of

191
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
not fully not but you know what

192
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
more than I thought

193
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
a little more than I thought

194
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
let's let me let me throw it

195
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
to Jordan because also you can you can

196
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
speak from experience at the level of

197
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
still around sure but

198
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
personal experience

199
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
with bullwinkles why did you

200
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
bring this to the table with us yeah

201
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I loved Bullwinkle as a kid

202
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
loved the cartoons loved those old

203
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
J Ward shorts I think they

204
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
were you know rerunning in Saturday

205
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
morning TV when we were kids and

206
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
loved them loved that they were a little self-aware

207
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
he talks to the narrator he talks to the

208
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
camera I love this made me feel smart

209
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
clever

210
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
meta yeah exactly and more

211
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
than yeah yeah he was the

212
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Deadpool of his day

213
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
just as twisted as the

214
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Merc with the Mouth

215
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
what are those yeah

216
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
so yeah

217
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
and we would go to Bullwinkles it was like a

218
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
special treat I believe we went to the

219
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
oh boy we went to the Anaheim Bullwinkles

220
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I believe and it was special for a lot

221
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
of reasons I loved the animatronics

222
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
show obviously gorgeous animatronics some of my

223
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
favorite characters I think it was the first place

224
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I had waffle fries

225
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
and it was the first place I played Teenage Mutant Ninja

226
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Turtles Turtles in Time well

227
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
one of the greatest arcade games ever made

228
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
two milestones for a childhood

229
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
sure yeah yeah and then

230
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
anything else out about Turtles in Time

231
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
while Turtles in Time has the

232
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
floor because I'm not super

233
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
familiar with it actually I know that first

234
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
arcade game so much more

235
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
yes you know what actually in the arcades I

236
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
ended up playing the first one more there wasn't a good

237
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Turtles in Time cabinet near me

238
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
growing up that's my memory

239
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Turtles in Time was like a rare white

240
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
elk like you see it

241
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
every now and then like in an

242
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
arcade you didn't go to a full moon

243
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
the mist would roll in

244
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
next morning it'd be gone

245
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
staying at a hotel

246
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I feel like you know

247
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
family hotels I wonder

248
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
if it's still the same but

249
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
family hotels I was always

250
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
like alright there is an arcade

251
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
what's in here what's the scrap

252
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
bag going to be and every now and then

253
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
it would be Turtles in Time

254
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
it was hard to find in our area I don't

255
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
know why you know what Mike you couldn't

256
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
have had it all you know

257
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Sean Berg you had everything

258
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
you had every experimental restaurant

259
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
you had Caesar land

260
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
it would be unfair if you had

261
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
your way and I think it made you a

262
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
stronger kid and a stronger adult

263
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
today well thank you thank you for saying

264
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
that I do believe that

265
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I will say

266
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
screaming at Mike like you had a happy

267
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
childhood

268
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
concepts

269
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
you got to have

270
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
the McDLT before any of us

271
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
sold a hot dog at the McDonald's

272
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
it would feel

273
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I still remember what McPizza

274
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
tastes like you had it for six

275
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
months longer they I will

276
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
say what I do own is though from

277
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
the game Turtles in Time is figures of

278
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Pirate Bebop and Rocksteady

279
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
because they go back in time and they're pirates

280
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
you have those

281
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I have some

282
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Turtles in Time figures and I have the

283
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
whole collection now like on PS5

284
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
the whole Turtle collection

285
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
of all the games and the arcade games

286
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
so I've played it I've honestly played it more

287
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
recently than I have when I was younger

288
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
but it's a cool game superior to the

289
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
original I think because they traveled through time

290
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
for sure and that made it better

291
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
yes yeah yeah I agree

292
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
self explanatory

293
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
how do you top that okay well that's

294
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
all that's all major stuff

295
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
and that's I feel like I've been to

296
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
that one post

297
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
ghost bullwinkle

298
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
ization yeah because

299
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
this that's a kind of an interesting thing about

300
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
the brand is that they are

301
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
the remnants of them

302
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
are around a lot it's not like

303
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
they all closed and

304
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
just became you know

305
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
orphanages

306
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
or smelting facilities

307
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Mr. Beast's ghost kitchens

308
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
so many of like you

309
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
especially in Southern California

310
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
and kind of south of Los Angeles

311
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
if you see a

312
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
mini golf course a batting cage

313
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
these kinds of things it may well

314
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
have been a bullwinkles in the 80s

315
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
and 90s yeah I think what

316
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
happened is that most of them became boomers

317
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
or at least the one

318
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
in upland California became

319
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
boomers yeah okay

320
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
the chain where everything is

321
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
themed like a CBS procedural I don't know

322
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
where everybody

323
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
can buy a house for 30,000 bucks

324
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
gotta be something there

325
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
that's good

326
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
it's a place where you can go to be the incredibly

327
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
cocky about every decision you've ever made

328
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
right yes it's a place to go to be radicalized

329
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
by YouTube

330
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
maybe that's the one

331
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
have a few houses

332
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
have a few houses

333
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
yeah but I guess what's happening in upland

334
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
California now very exciting

335
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
they are transitioning from a boomers

336
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
back to a bullwinkle so I went

337
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
to the upland one and they are slowly

338
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
adding in the bullwinkle theming

339
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
wow because I guess the community

340
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
demanded it wow geez

341
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
yeah that's what I feel like I think I watched

342
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
like a little local news report about

343
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
that I read an article and about

344
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
how it's always

345
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
still bullwinkles to them right they

346
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
can put this boomers brand this

347
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
listeners might have a boomers near

348
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
you it's kind of a nothing

349
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
compared to if you

350
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
grew up with those characters you

351
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
see bullwinkles on a restaurant

352
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
you have your associations

353
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
with these characters and if not him then that

354
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
whole world and Peabody and Sherman

355
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
and Dudley Do-Right and all of them there's so

356
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
many things that you're you're flashing to

357
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
and then there's this oddly

358
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
generic bland boomers

359
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
branding

360
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
it's the Westfield of

361
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
mini-golf courses I don't

362
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
know what it Connets I don't

363
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
like Jason I think you were saying

364
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
before we started it's just it's

365
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
mysterious what does it mean

366
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
there's never any justification

367
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
who is Boomer you know

368
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
yes going through the website

369
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
like god damn it the theme

370
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
seems to be families enjoying themselves

371
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
like what

372
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
is there nothing weird in this sauce

373
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
that's not enough

374
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
what is it we're all part of

375
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
we're all experiencing Boomer should be a seal

376
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
with the roller blades I don't know

377
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
something yes that's all it would take

378
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
it could look like shit it could be the worst

379
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000

409
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
it's it's it's bland it's nothing

410
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I never liked any graphic design I've ever

411
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
seen from the boomers camp the facilities

412
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
themselves sure

413
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'll take any family

414
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
fun center these have been a really nice part

415
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
of having

416
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
having a child and remembering that like

417
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
oh these are four children and not you

418
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
to go to and bitch about lack

419
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
of characters yes yeah yeah yeah oh that's

420
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
right I'm watching sincere smiles

421
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
as I take a kid around an arcade

422
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
great beer tap selection

423
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
losers

424
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I did go to the upland one that is

425
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
you know in betwixt the boomers

426
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
betwixt the boomers and the bullwinkles

427
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
with a friend who brought his kids and they

428
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
had a blast they really had fun

429
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
so yeah so yeah

430
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
the power of these places you know

431
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
they they stick around for a reason kids love

432
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
them yeah yeah the um and it's cool

433
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
the community specifically held on to

434
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
bullwinkles and that it would have meant something to them

435
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
this now your trip to the upland location

436
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
is no small feat because that's like

437
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
an hour from where you live

438
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
correct something like yeah I'm a little

439
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
you know I'm in Altadena so I'm freeway close

440
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
so yeah maybe

441
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
maybe 40 minutes so not a huge

442
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
pain in the butt but decently

443
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
long did you feel

444
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
did it feel like a little

445
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
insane or a little risky are you

446
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
like what am I doing am I going

447
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
to go there and find something

448
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
rinky dink or not for

449
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
me was it I don't know was

450
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
there any worry in the transit

451
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
to bullwinkles fall a little far away Scott

452
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
tons tons of worry

453
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm glad I just said my friend who came with me

454
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Jesse Thorne who I co-host my podcast

455
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
friends you go with he came and he brought his

456
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
brought his wife and kids everybody had a great time

457
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
the kids actually knew the

458
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
bullwinkle characters and were bummed

459
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
that there wasn't more bullwinkles

460
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
characters yes because it seems like

461
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
hope for the future generations oh yeah yeah that's

462
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
well that's something I've wondered is like

463
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
because I don't I guess I

464
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
could see that this started no

465
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
oh hang on it doesn't make sense I was going to say

466
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I could see why this started going away

467
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
because the characters were

468
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
not really passed to future generations but they

469
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
made that movie they

470
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
started going extinct in 2002

471
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
but that movie where with weirdly

472
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Robert De Niro

473
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
as a character he wasn't even one of the main

474
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
characters Jason Alexander is fearless

475
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
leader fearless leader right

476
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
coded villain ah

477
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
yeah oh that's so that's why he did there's

478
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
depth here there's like you know

479
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
can I play a likable villain

480
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
a challenge like any De Niro

481
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
role would have there was a big

482
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
resurgence of all that stuff especially in the 90s

483
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
because it was everywhere and it was

484
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
cool I feel like to like it even too

485
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
but I feel like the movie

486
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
is like the nail in the coffin for

487
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
its resurgence maybe that's like

488
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
the pinnacle of like hey we're

489
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
it's going to be here forever they flew

490
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
too close to the sun yes I was so

491
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
excited I think we went to see that

492
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
movie opening weekend and I was

493
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
so disappointed by it because

494
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
in the 90s

495
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Rockin' Bo Winkle aired on both Nickelodeon

496
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
and Nick at Night

497
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
that hadn't really happened

498
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
it happened maybe once before

499
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
but like I just

500
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
thought that was so cool

501
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
and I loved those characters and then

502
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
they show up at Islands of Adventure

503
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
well that's what I was going to say is like they were so

504
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
popular that they were like

505
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
will you Dudley Do-Right is going

506
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
to be the basis for one of the big major

507
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
rides here yes there's a new

508
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
theme park in 1999

509
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
and we're putting a lot

510
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
into Dudley Do-Right he's going to have his splash

511
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
mountain here yeah it's pretty wild

512
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000

513
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
like yeah I've never heard a good

545
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
opinion about it I mean I love the characters

546
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000

Boris and Natasha movie

552
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
starring Dave Thomas. This always

553
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
confused me. I would see this VHS

554
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
case and like huh

555
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000

no it's not a cartoon. Boy

557
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I haven't thought about that probably since

558
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I was seven years old in the video store. 1992

559
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Boris and Natasha

561
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Who's Natasha? Natasha is

565
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Hot Lips from MASH

566
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
is Natasha

567
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Andrea Martin. Wait John Travolta

568
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
is in this film? Andrea Martin yeah

569
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I've not seen it

570
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Written by Mr. Julia

571
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Louis Dreyfus Brad Hall

572
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Wow John Candy's in it

573
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Wow so they're tapping

574
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
into the SCTV like

575
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
the most quality group of people and

576
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
yet this did not come to well

577
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Oh my god maybe this was just not meant

578
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
to

579
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
it was not meant to be translated

580
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
to any even half live action

581
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
maybe. This feels like a movie

582
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
that's a trick for podcast

583
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
like I'm gonna like get a copy from the

584
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
library or find it streaming on

585
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Amazon and a big net

586
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
will be put up

587
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
like it's a trap. Is somebody

588
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
trying to eliminate podcasters?

589
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
No just trying to like

590
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I don't know eliminate or

591
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
So the scheme is they planted a fake movie

592
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
from 1992 about Boris

593
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
and Natasha which they know you like

594
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
so they know okay any day now

595
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
he's coming into the library cause Jason's not paying

596
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
for that movie he's renting that for free

597
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I'm not doing that $3 right here

598
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I'm with you Jason

599
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I've

600
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
sworn up and down

601
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
how great the Burbank library's

602
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
movie collection is but also

603
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I'm looking it up. Buena Vista branch?

604
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Of course Buena Vista branch

605
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Great branch great branch

606
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I got Cobra there the other day

607
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Oh cool!

608
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Blue ray? No regular DVD

609
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It's literally a blue ray selection but how are they expected

610
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
to have a lot? I understand

611
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
They do have a lot of blue rays but

612
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I pulled up the Just Watch

613
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
page which is my

614
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
choice of

615
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
finding where stuff is streaming

616
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
and it's really only available to rent on

617
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Amazon. Oh okay

618
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
interesting. I don't

619
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
By the way I don't think this is at the

620
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
library. I mean this will

621
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
really be the test of the Burbank library

622
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
right if it has it. I just don't think this

623
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
doesn't seem like one that needs to be preserved

624
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
for future generations. They don't have any VHS

625
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
left at the library do they? I bet they did

626
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
have it on VHS that's a very good

627
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
point. Well I think they also

628
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
get a lot from the studios

629
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
from like Universal

630
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Warner Brothers I think donates a lot

631
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I see. Okay well

632
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I don't know if that's worth further

633
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
investigation. Jason

634
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
will maybe do it. I'm already on it

635
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I think it like it speaks to like how

636
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
beloved the characters were

637
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
that all of these people

638
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
said yes to these things and we haven't even mentioned

639
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
the Brendan Fraser

640
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
in Georgia the Jungle movies. These guys

641
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
are part of this averse as well

642
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Two forays

643
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
and those are like beloved movies

644
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Voice of Rocky June forays

645
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
yes but this is I'm saying

646
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
two forays by

647
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Brendan that's crazy

648
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
that's really strange. Nobody thought

649
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
were they like no I think

650
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
it helps I think he proved that he

651
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
fits in the tone. I say

652
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
do give him a second one but they were

653
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
wrong right because Dudley Do-Right is not

654
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
particularly well regarded. I think people like

655
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Georgia the Jungle they don't really like Dudley Do-Right

656
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
am I wrong? That feels right I don't feel like

657
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
anyone ever talks about Dudley Do-Right. I mean

658
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I'm a Do-Right head so

659
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
you're asking

660
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
the wrong guy I love him

661
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Is that true? Okay so you do

662
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
yeah you are into those characters

663
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
and they were present at the

664
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
restaurant. Yeah absolutely you got a

665
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Snidely Whiplash when you come in he's behind

666
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
bars it's an animatronic he's like

667
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
in the lobby before

668
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
the main show that's really nuts

669
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
that's so cool. You know I was even

670
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
stoked to see Tennessee Tuxedo and Chumlee

671
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
in the restaurant as a kid. Don Adams

672
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Don Adams very exciting

673
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I was on a path of

674
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
discovery I saw a website that was talking

675
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
about Tennessee I already don't

676
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
remember. I can't believe you've been doing the show

677
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
for this long and this is the first time Tennessee Tuxedo

678
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
and Chumlee are coming up. You're here for

679
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
PTR history

680
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
no I don't yeah despite the Don Adams

681
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
no because they were in the

682
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
animatronic band in maybe just one

683
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
of the locations and then I'm like

684
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
what's going Chumlee and

685
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
because I've never heard of Chumlee I'm like

686
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
what? Chumlee is a walrus with

687
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
human hands?

688
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
What does that mean? And he does he does the dumb

689
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
guy voice from cartoons

690
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
oh I know Chumlee

691
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
now that you do that thank you

692
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
boosts from Archie the

693
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
yeah the ones like a

694
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
bean pole and the ones where you go big

695
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
you know the ones got a hat

696
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
but they were only they were not

697
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
regularly in the band

698
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
because if we haven't said

699
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
this it's an animatronic band

700
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
a la Chuck E Cheese

701
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
but it's all of these characters

702
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
not necessarily

703
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
contained it's the whole J

704
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Wardiverse all

705
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
playing instruments all in like

706
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
it's kind of a folksy

707
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I would say that the vibe

708
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
is this like Pacific Northwest

709
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Cedar

710
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Lodge where like

711
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
totem poles would be in play

712
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
and it's a very totem pole

713
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
vibe on the stage where

714
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
all the locations

715
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
had at least

716
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
bare minimum Rocky and Bullwinkle

717
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
animatronics and

718
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
one of them's playing a jug and the

719
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
other one's playing a like a

720
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
boxy wood guitar

721
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
it's a bare jamboree vibe

722
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
it's not completely the same

723
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
vibe but it's close it's close some family

724
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
yeah kind of a kind of a

725
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
hee haw structure to the show

726
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
you know a little one

727
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
liner and now a song

728
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
kind of vaudevillie

729
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
yeah yeah so you at least got that

730
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
like if nothing else Rocky and Bullwinkle

731
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
on banjo Rocky on like a fiddle

732
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
then maybe

733
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
the band is expanding depending on

734
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
the ambition of the restaurant you might have

735
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
underdog not really said till now

736
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
on saxophone

737
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Boris and Natasha

738
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
factor in I love this

739
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
that Boris and Natasha are

740
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
the like masthead

741
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
on the top it's great sort of

742
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
like a little totem pole

743
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
so they are represented in more

744
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
of a carved in wood fashion

745
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
but they do come to life

746
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
and interject and are sort of the

747
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Statler and Waldorf

748
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
or maybe or more the

749
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
the moose

750
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
and buffalo on the wall

751
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Buff Max and

752
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Melvin

753
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Melvin yeah there you go

754
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
so you know they're

755
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
taking cues from the way Disney

756
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
is doing things but not exactly

757
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
one to one it's not a

758
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
full rip off but then I think only

759
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
in Santa Clara the first location

760
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
do you have Tennessee Tuxedo

761
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Chumlee Hoppity Hooper

762
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
who is a frog who plays the harmonica

763
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
and maybe more locations

764
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
had Tudor Turtle on the drums

765
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
not fully sure about

766
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
full Tudor

767
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
the one had Dudley

768
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
oh and big thing I'm

769
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
forgetting yes Dudley Do-Right

770
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
is like the side

771
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
stage like Big Al

772
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
and they play Big Al

773
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
similar beats to Big Al

774
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
where he's like the one

775
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
encountering problems

776
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
where his cue is wrong

777
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
or they close the curtain

778
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
on him on purpose

779
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
they play into the Dudley

780
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
bumbling

781
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
but of course underdog as

782
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
his famous saxophone

783
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
yes of course

784
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
we all remember when underdog would wail on the

785
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
sax

786
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I found this picture of him

787
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I don't know

788
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
in this picture he looks like he's

789
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
smoking a damn bong

790
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
in this picture

791
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
cause it just looks

792
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
kind of strange

793
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
you should be excited

794
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
this should be like hell yeah

795
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
look dream blunt rotation

796
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
me and underdog

797
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
and no one else

798
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
underdog

799
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Chumlee

800
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Chumlee and Tennessee

801
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Tuxedo can come too

802
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
and of course his alter ego shoeshine

803
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
boy right

804
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
that's right yeah

805
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
that was underdog Clark Kent

806
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
yeah I watched the first underdog

807
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
short because

808
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
one thing about

809
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Bullwinkles the audio of this

810
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
is strangely well preserved

811
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
on YouTube yeah I know

812
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
there are you can kind of listen

813
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
to the sketches over stills of the

814
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
restaurant yes

815
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
and yeah there's only some video

816
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
of the animatronics but yeah all this audio seems

817
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
to have been uploaded

818
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
and I'd forgotten underdog's voice

819
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
cause I feel like

820
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
in the bullwinkles audio he sounds

821
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
very droopy dog

822
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
but Wally Cox

823
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
the voice of underdog did not do

824
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
droopy dog different

825
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
it was Dawes Butler

826
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
right no no that was

827
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Huckleberry Hound sorry

828
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Dawes Butler was Huckleberry Hound

829
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
sorry I'll cut this out so

830
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
this is the good stuff

831
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
but yeah it does seem like

832
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
most of the voice actors are doing their

833
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
voices for the restaurant

834
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
it is Rocky and Bullwinkle which I think

835
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
they yeah they insisted on

836
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Jordan when you were a kid did you

837
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
where did this fall in sort of the hierarchy

838
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
of robot restaurants was this maybe your

839
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
number one or were you a Chucky guy

840
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I mean Chucky was fine we had a close

841
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Chucky you know I'm not anti

842
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Chucky but this was

843
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
a special trip this was a good report card

844
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
this was like

845
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
cousins are in town and we want to show

846
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
those cousins a good time

847
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
yeah I love this

848
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
we probably only went a handful of times

849
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
but when I

850
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
maybe it was on the way to Vegas

851
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
driving by Upland

852
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
and seeing from the freeway the like coming

853
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
soon bullwinkles just a

854
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
flood of nostalgia

855
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I'm like oh my god bullwinkles

856
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
and yeah it was really like magical

857
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I had to pull over and go to sleep

858
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
calm down just calm down

859
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
just sleep it off sleep it off

860
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
the nostalgia wave and yeah and then like

861
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
watching so there's a lot of like corporate

862
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
videos that are on YouTube for this place

863
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
like you can watch their like

864
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
kind of pitch video and like you know

865
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
taking around the basics of the yes

866
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
each bullwinkles location and yeah and I

867
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
you know and I don't want to like live in the past

868
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I know nostalgia can be toxic

869
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
but like watching the videos of this

870
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
place in the like late eighties I'm like

871
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
look what they took from us

872
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
this was beautiful

873
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
the wait staff were all dressed like Mounties

874
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I mean it's gorgeous

875
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
and it's well it's in that like

876
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
cause I just my fuzzy baby

877
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
brain first five years of my life

878
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I just remember so much pleasant

879
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
calming brown

880
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
like and I never I never went to a

881
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
bullwinkles but anywhere that I

882
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
liked anywhere that made me feel really

883
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
comfortable in the first years of my life had some

884
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
calm brown or perhaps

885
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
bricks or those like you know kind of the

886
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
orange or red bricks that malls

887
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
used to have or they kind of blandify

888
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
all the malls and then like

889
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
wood carved signs with

890
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
complementary colors to brown

891
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
and kind of like a in a reddish

892
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
orange a fiery orange

893
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
and this place I just I'm watching

894
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
this I think the same corporate video as you

895
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
and like god I would have

896
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
locked onto this place like everything I was

897
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
after in the late eighties

898
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
this this had it all aesthetically

899
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
it is such a bummer

900
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
it is so is anything close to that

901
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
like pleasing wise now is it just

902
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
from your baby brain or do you think there is

903
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
something to that it feels like there is

904
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
but maybe it's just a trick

905
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
yeah I don't know if there was anything inherent

906
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
to the two eighties

907
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
brown yeah but I

908
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
it's certainly something I'm fixated on

909
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
it's you know it's the family

910
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
ties aesthetic scheme

911
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
that's really what I musically

912
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
and visually and font wise

913
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I chase it I want them as much of that

914
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
around as possible sure

915
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
but I don't know if it actually is

916
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
superior calm at most a lot of people

917
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
might see that kind of thing and think like

918
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
stodgy out of date grandma

919
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
but cigarette staining

920
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
yeah well that's good yeah you're

921
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
right that's what happened I'm sure there was smoking

922
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
a lot in every bowling goal

923
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
probably reeked of cigarettes

924
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
they didn't even bring it up in the video

925
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
because bringing it up makes it a thing it wasn't

926
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
a thing you know it's an establishment

927
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
you smoke and yeah there was a

928
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
you know so there's the showroom for the

929
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
kids but there's also like what is it called

930
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
it is called Dudley's Den

931
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
for the parents to retreat to and it's a little

932
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
more calm

933
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
what if we kissed at Dudley's

934
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Den as the

935
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
meme goes I mean the Dudley's Den is kind

936
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
of beautiful I bet you know I bet a lot of

937
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
this was a lot of key parties got negotiated

938
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
in Dudley's Den take your nail

939
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
to Dudley's Den

940
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
this was because this was

941
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
the old Chuck E Cheese as well they had

942
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
the parents rooms right and so that's

943
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
what Dolly Dimples would play

944
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
or say hippopotamus right or the

945
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
beach bowser or the beach bowser so they did have

946
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
rooms for the parents I think

947
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
those are gone I mean they're the

948
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
rooms exist but yeah

949
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
they put more games in them

950
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
thumbs down or whatever but it doesn't feel like

951
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
catering there should be nothing in here where mom and

952
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
dad gonna go to connect

953
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I have recently started showing my daughter

954
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Chuck E Cheese videos including the new ones

955
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Chuck E and me and my friends and stuff and she does

956
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
a little of the dance and she does munch and stuff

957
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
and it's very adorable

958
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
then I will put on she's gonna get into bowling

959
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
for soup Mike and it's okay

960
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
it's okay if that starts you on the popcorn

961
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
if you don't think that's what Mike's fishing for

962
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
if that starts you on the train that's fine

963
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
another guy who does Chuck E

964
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Cheese now the bowling for soup

965
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Jared Reddick or something

966
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
don't ask us Mike

967
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I follow him

968
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I follow him on Instagram

969
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
but then I do put on some of the old stuff

970
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
see how she responds to it

971
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
and it is just for

972
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
parents that is what's interesting about it

973
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
is the new stuff is like oh you get a little funny

974
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
little joke once in a while but the old stuff is

975
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
just written for parents Chuck E is smoking

976
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
a cigar he's unnerving

977
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
he insults Jasper he calls him like a

978
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
dimwit or something there are jokes

979
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
it's just like a bunch of stuff

980
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
we're gonna do a show oh

981
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
sounds good

982
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
it actually isn't

983
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
written like Bullwinkles is

984
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Bullwinkles has the cleverness

985
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
but I guess I just mean

986
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
there's no gentleness to be like

987
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
what do kids like it's just

988
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
adult characters like behaving

989
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
badly in front of children

990
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
and then there's other

991
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
rooms more for parents

992
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
that show that I'm talking about is

993
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
for everyone for the kids there's a screening

994
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
room where they just would show the ice

995
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
store

996
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
stag films

997
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
dad could go and jack off

998
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
with his buddies

999
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
the kids could go in the ball pit

1000
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
and cry

1001
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
and cry yes yeah yeah

1002
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
of course yeah that's always part of it

1003
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
they're showing nudist documentaries at Chuck E Cheese

1004
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
naked some of the robots are naked back there

1005
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
take a gander

1006
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I like when you look

1007
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I wanna show off cause like we do our

1008
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Chuck E voice sometimes and he is an insane

1009
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
caricature but when I'm watching

1010
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I'm like it's not that far off

1011
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
he's crazy this cigar

1012
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
smoking mouse or rat is crazy

1013
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
he's a crazy drunk

1014
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
yeah he's real he's incredibly

1015
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
so it's funny though to just

1016
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
be like oh yeah they cater like everything's

1017
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
too catered to children now

1018
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
the problem today the problem is

1019
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
put it back in the bowler and the

1020
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
tucks and tails he wears they do it

1021
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
together we got it video with the pup

1022
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
the new puppets which is one of the famous Chuck E songs

1023
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
yeah George you have any idea with that

1024
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
that was rushed by they do it together we got it

1025
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
so anyway

1026
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I'm using context

1027
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
listen I can use context clues

1028
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I listen to the show I know

1029
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
it's like their big hit it's the big Chuck E hit

1030
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I'm prepared to argue about goo goo dolls if it comes to it

1031
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
together we got it is their black balloon

1032
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
but they do

1033
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
put the little puppet Chuck E

1034
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
in like a little vest and bolt

1035
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
like they do give you a little

1036
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
of the old outfit but it's not the full

1037
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
cigar or whatever

1038
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
well here let's you know

1039
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
we need to discuss your specific visit

1040
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
more Jordan but really quick I mean I figured

1041
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
this would be the episode to talk about it

1042
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
it is relevant

1043
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
that my little boy

1044
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
just turned four and

1045
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
we locked into

1046
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I think the best place to possibly

1047
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
do a birthday party which is

1048
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
the one Chuck E cheese that kept the robot

1049
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
which is in Northridge California

1050
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
it happens to be my childhood one

1051
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
which is really strange that became

1052
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
the only one that kept the robots

1053
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
and could we have done it at any

1054
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
at much closer Chuck E Cheese

1055
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
more convenience to more

1056
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Pasadena Chuck E Cheese

1057
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
yes so there are so many

1058
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
but no we chose

1059
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
robots over convenience

1060
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
and no

1061
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
regrets about that but here's how this

1062
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
played out is that

1063
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
we get there and first of all

1064
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
rope dropping a Chuck E Cheese

1065
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
is really something where we're arriving

1066
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
slightly before 10am when it opens

1067
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
to which is the start of our party

1068
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
and in doing so we are watching the

1069
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
employees be dropped off by their

1070
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
parents the employees who

1071
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
are half our age

1072
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
checking in for work and then

1073
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
yes the 17 year old

1074
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
maybe who's like the party host

1075
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
who like okay so we've got this

1076
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
and we can do lemonade for the kids and here's

1077
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
the wristbands and is there anything else you guys

1078
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
need and my

1079
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
wife's like no no no we're great

1080
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
everything's wonderful actually there is

1081
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
something there is something why is the why is

1082
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
the curtain closed

1083
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
we chose this one because it is the one with

1084
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
the robot so if you were just

1085
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
at some point if you could open the curtains

1086
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
and it took so and she's like

1087
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
oh yeah sure yeah

1088
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
but I don't think it's a request she's

1089
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
getting a lot and I

1090
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
don't think it was going to naturally

1091
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
happen without me asking for it

1092
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
so it did happen

1093
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
me and

1094
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
my same aged friends

1095
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
all lit up about

1096
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
it and no one else

1097
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
the parents my parents didn't like it

1098
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
the children did not like it

1099
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
the music was so quiet

1100
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
the clacking was twice as loud

1101
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
as the music and then the

1102
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
curtain closed after one song

1103
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
and it was clear that that was all they were prepared

1104
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
to do then I asked

1105
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
to do could we do one more

1106
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
because there were some late comers

1107
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
can we see them one more time even less

1108
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
interest from the children this time then

1109
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Michael shows up

1110
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
we were late that baby's sleep schedule was

1111
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
effed up after she came back from San Diego

1112
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
with Lindsay and so we were

1113
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
late so Scott

1114
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
says okay for the show you have to

1115
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
ask for it and he is polite enough

1116
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
to ask the 17 year old

1117
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
for the third time

1118
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
the third time in two hours

1119
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
she's a party host that's what

1120
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I know and by the way

1121
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
the great

1122
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
most friendly the most accommodating

1123
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
with all of the things that mattered

1124
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
this was the smoothest I by the way

1125
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
recommend to parents Chuck E. Cheese birthday

1126
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
is great the pizza got better

1127
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
it is a very well

1128
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
run operation the only

1129
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
sticking point was that I think we're

1130
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
the only psycho parents who've asked to see

1131
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
these robots in the recent past so

1132
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
yeah you get there late enough that we're like

1133
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
we're still there but we're clearing out and even

1134
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
the birthday boys losing patience and I'm like

1135
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
are you eating pizza at 10am?

1136
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I did

1137
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
yeah I didn't think I would

1138
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
but then like I don't know it's in front of me

1139
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
and their pizza did get better so yeah

1140
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I'm having 10.45 pizza

1141
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
why not? Being so late also it's

1142
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
a stressful thing because I'm like Lindsay you have to

1143
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
remember this is the one with the robot like I'm explaining

1144
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
like

1145
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
does she have to eat breakfast in the chair

1146
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
can't she eat it on the road

1147
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
like there are things I'm trying

1148
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
to get like

1149
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
toss a gogurt in the car seat and let's get up there

1150
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
millennial in the bedroom

1151
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
oh North

1152
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
they've announced that Northridge is the only place

1153
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
they're actually giving the robots so like there's a whole thing going on

1154
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
there and I was like oh well it's really

1155
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
too late to go but I would really like to see

1156
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
these robots

1157
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
in none of this factors

1158
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
my family or my son

1159
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
that is there's none of that in your

1160
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
let's hurry

1161
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
this is about munch let's be clear

1162
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
this is about munch well the reason it's not even coming into

1163
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
it's because like because we were just like they're

1164
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
going to leave yes

1165
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
we want to go to this but they won't be there

1166
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
if we are this late so I'm like

1167
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
yes but you understand the robots are there

1168
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
the robots are what we

1169
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
need to even if we're even if

1170
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
we show up and everyone is gone the robots

1171
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
will be there we can still watch the robots

1172
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
alone of course

1173
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
so your daughter can shift

1174
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
around and try to

1175
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
leave while you watch the robots of course

1176
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Lindsay perhaps the same

1177
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
probably she didn't

1178
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
say that to be nice to me but probably

1179
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
what Scott yeah she actually

1180
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
the party host did go back

1181
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
and fired up it's just it's run

1182
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
on a Windows XP machine

1183
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
with a floppy disk drive

1184
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
so that's how long it took

1185
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
to get started yeah that's a 20 minute

1186
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
startup and then she closed it so it had to

1187
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
happen again yeah so Scott asks

1188
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
the 17 year old and she said oh yeah

1189
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
we'll do it we'll do it she goes back there did you ask twice

1190
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
or once I think I did once

1191
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
and then I said we gotta go

1192
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
if you want it you gotta ask

1193
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
and I actually don't know how things played out

1194
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
for you and that's why I'm bringing it up on the show

1195
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
so what happened is yes again we were

1196
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
so late everybody left and we were at

1197
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Chuck E. Cheese in Northridge which is

1198
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
not the quickest place to go to no

1199
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
no no so I was like well we're here we

1200
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
let's enjoy it so

1201
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I asked her again I said oh excuse

1202
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
me is there any way

1203
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
we could see the robots she goes

1204
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
oh yeah yeah oh I forgot I'll check on her

1205
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
she says something like that and I go okay

1206
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
so we're like lingering and then like

1207
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
our my daughter wants

1208
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
to go do other things she doesn't want to sit by these

1209
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
tables she wants to go investigate where all the other kids

1210
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
are and I'm just like what I'm like

1211
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
but we're gonna miss the show if

1212
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
it starts it's gonna start any minute

1213
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
so we're lingering too long I see

1214
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
her one more time

1215
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
and I ask again and she says sort

1216
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
of the similar like a similar thing

1217
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
and at that point I go

1218
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
this is not happening

1219
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
we are not seeing the show

1220
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
so we're like walking around like

1221
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
through the games and and and my daughter's

1222
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
climbing on things and doing stuff or whatever

1223
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I'm just keep my eye on it I'm like

1224
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
the show ain't happening it's not happening

1225
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
just listen for clacking just have your

1226
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
ears open for the clacking of

1227
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
eyes opening and closing

1228
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
is like yeah

1229
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
she's like you want to ask again

1230
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I go I'm not asking the 17 year old

1231
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
again I'm too old

1232
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
to be asking again

1233
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
that's okay this is our punishment

1234
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
for being late

1235
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
so you left the Chuck E. Cheese disappointed

1236
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
the child

1237
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
at a ball not only did I leave

1238
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
the Chuck E. Cheese disappointed but I am

1239
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
85% sure that this Chuck E. Cheese

1240
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
gave my daughter her first

1241
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
awful cold of her life

1242
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
no no no

1243
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
oh no no no

1244
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
she's fine now

1245
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
it was bound to happen because we don't do

1246
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
oh you said she's been sick oh no

1247
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Mike no look I would I would only

1248
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
say it on Mike because it's funny for the

1249
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
audience I would not have put it on

1250
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
it's not your fault no you're not I know you're not

1251
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
it's not your fault we don't do too much

1252
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
she's got to go indoors someday

1253
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
right we stay out a lot we don't do

1254
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
a ton with her she's had a little mini cold

1255
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
but this was a fucking cold

1256
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
well we have now looped back

1257
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
around to a kind of cold you can only

1258
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
get from a ball pit right so funny

1259
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
that the Chuck E. Cheese is likely

1260
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
the culprit

1261
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
in less than an hour well we oh my

1262
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
well I'm sorry no no apology

1263
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I'm sorry for being so late we have

1264
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
yeah you should have been there in the hour when there wasn't

1265
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
cold going around all of the 11

1266
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
o'clock hour children were fine

1267
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
yeah of course yes one of those

1268
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
nooners showed up and

1269
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
coughed all over your daughter

1270
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
we have now looped around to why

1271
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
at least my parents did

1272
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
not like places like this

1273
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
it was actually funny being the cause

1274
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
of my parents going back

1275
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
for the first time in 35

1276
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
years and they were like

1277
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
ugh they were like shuddering

1278
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
at it were you guys no okay

1279
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
you were saying about Bullwinkles Jordan

1280
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
that this was a family like

1281
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
no we like it this is a yeah

1282
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I wonder if I was to ask my mom how she felt

1283
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
about our trips to Bullwinkles if she would be

1284
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
like oh yeah I fucking hated that place

1285
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
but yeah to me it's a fun

1286
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
family memory and I think I don't

1287
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
remember any like Bullwinkles meltdowns

1288
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
or anything like that yeah I think we had

1289
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
a good time well here's I think

1290
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
what might be

1291
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
this might be the theory

1292
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
because I think we've already discussed some things that might be more

1293
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
quality about Bullwinkles

1294
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
than Chuck E Cheese

1295
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
but when I brought it up

1296
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
last night the consensus

1297
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
was actually

1298
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
good food and actually good animatronics

1299
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
there was a sense of like it's a little

1300
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
it was actually a little more Disney

1301
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
level do you agree with that yeah I mean I think

1302
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I think that the you know you get to see

1303
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
the menus in those corporate videos

1304
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
and you know not just pizza but

1305
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
deep dish and thin crust

1306
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
salad bar that

1307
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
themed after W.D. Wright's girlfriend

1308
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
was her name Nell

1309
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Nell gets the salad bar

1310
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Nell's salad bar and they

1311
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
also say that the salad bar has

1312
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Mousselaneous dressing

1313
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
which is a good pun but it sounds

1314
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
disgusting like you know

1315
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
what's in the dressing though right it's not

1316
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I get it

1317
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
it's not just different liquids that were in this facility

1318
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
to begin with it's like

1319
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Thousand Island French and like

1320
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Catalina right

1321
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
whatever gross 90s dressing

1322
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
I do not remember what is in it

1323
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
creamy Italian the 90s

1324
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
were a big decade

1325
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
there will be a nearly empty

1326
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
bottle of oil and red wine

1327
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
vinegar that's kind

1328
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
of gross

1329
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
that same video goes

1330
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
right into a breakdown of the pizzas

1331
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000

00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
this is well wait it might announce

1333
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000

1335
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000

00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
I don't know let me

1337
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000

00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
oh you're right yes yeah hard to read but yeah you're right

1339

1340
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
this little pizza explanation

1341
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
just to keep an ear out

1342
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Bo Winkle's traditional thin crust

1343
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
pizzas are called Dudley Do Wright's

1344
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
pizza the house specials

1345
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000

1346
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
garden cash pizza

1347
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
and our unique pizza of the sea

1348
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
we need to talk for a minute about

1349
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
and I'll make it bigger for you guys to look at

1350
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
strange phrases

1351
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
to begin with mother load

1352
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
okay you know tons of toppings

1353
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I get that garden

1354
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
cash I got nothing

1355
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
on this I don't know what

1356
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
C A C H E we should say

1357
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
computer cash yeah right

1358
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
what does that mean I think

1359
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
cash is like it's like a

1360
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
it's like a stash yeah a stash

1361
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
of like vegetables I think

1362
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
vegetables I think that's what they're saying

1363
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
so like mother it just implies a lot that's what they're

1364
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
saying I think so yeah garden cash

1365
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I just I only think of that in computer

1366
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
terms and then put next to garden

1367
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
electronics and garden

1368
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
jam together a strange

1369
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
phrase is cash cash A I mean

1370
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I think about like when they talk about oh I found a weapons

1371
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
cash yeah maybe that's an RPG

1372
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
term or something and I think it just means

1373
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
to be like a that's like going

1374
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
golden eye right or something yeah

1375
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
it's like health and ammo and

1376
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
armor and vegetables and vegetables

1377
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
and veggies well garden cash

video games where you have to like put fertilizer

1380
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000

straight into the next one which is

1389
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
pizza of the sea

1390
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000

1391
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
looking pizza I up until

1392
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I trust everybody that this pizza was pretty

1393
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
good in general but

1394
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
looking at this pizza with little

1395
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
canned shrimp all over

1396
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
it the pinkest shrimps you've ever

1397
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
seen oh no no no

1398
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000

maybe somewhere today

1402
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
could pull off little shrimps I just

1403
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
don't trust this

1404
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
is 1980s

1405
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
canned shrimp pizza I'm concerned

1406
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
you and I shared a fishy pizza

1407
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
a few days ago Scott oh sure

1408
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
but anchovy

1409
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
and they had capers as

1410
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
well what if they had little

1411
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
shrimps on that pizza though is it

1412
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I'd be fine there

1413
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
yeah that was a good place yeah

1414
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
but little I'm just what you're saying that the

1415
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
you can't imagine little shrimps

1416
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
being good in the 80s I feel like I've watched

1417
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Mike eat a pizza with little

1418
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
shrimps but again today

1419
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
as long as if it's anywhere

1420
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
but City Walk fine have at it Mike

1421
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
but what's the place on Sunset

1422
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
that has that is that what I've had no I had a

1423
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
tuna pizza at that place we were

1424
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
at an Italian restaurant in Manhattan

1425
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
and I remember you just

1426
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
getting like a tuna pizza

1427
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
and it's forever stuck in my mind

1428
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
was it an Italian salad how did the tuna

1429
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
how did the tuna present it

1430
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
one day in Manhattan

1431
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I guess we were a couple times

1432
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
only once or twice

1433
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
that's why it sticks out in my mind

1434
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
what was that establishment in

1435
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Manhattan I don't remember

1436
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville

1437
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
anyway I'm

1438
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
disturbed I just don't

1439
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
but people said the food was good

1440
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I do but that has

1441
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
to be where the I'm I'm only

1442
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
doing cheese there I'm not I'm not doing pizza

1443
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
the sea I'm out on pizza the sea

1444
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
yeah I think I remember the fried chicken and specifically

1445
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
the waffle fries to me were a big a big

1446
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
memory that was a big revelation to me

1447
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
never seen that form factor of fry

1448
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
before yeah yeah

1449
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
and I think yeah maybe the fried chicken looks

1450
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
kind of good in those videos and

1451
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
it does yeah yeah I don't

1452
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
know I'm very brown you know it's a very

1453
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
it's a better way the

1454
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
more the more legitimate way that

1455
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
they used to do I feel like fried chicken was generally

1456
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
done with more care

1457
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
in the 70s and 80s right could be

1458
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
wrong I feel like the affection people

1459
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
have is probably does indicate maybe

1460
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
the food was a tier above a

1461
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Chuck E Cheese I think so

1462
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I don't think it's pure because even

1463
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
if it sure nostalgia could be blinding

1464
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
you to it but it but it's people who remember

1465
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
that the Chuck E Cheese food was

1466
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
shitty right and this was

1467
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
better I have to quickly share

1468
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
a not so good

1469
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
association about that very same one

1470
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
the Anaheim one which was shared

1471
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
to me last night

1472
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
by our pal Ryan Perez

1473
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000

you know Orange County we have a lot of like

1477
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
shared memories I don't think we knew each other as kids

1478
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
but like oh yeah we went to the same movie theaters

1479
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
a lot of the same like malls and stuff so yeah

1480
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
I wouldn't be surprised if Ryan had been to

1481
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
the same one yeah yeah I was kind of surprised

1482
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
if he had fond Bullwinkle's memories too except for

1483
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I think well I think he had been to the Anaheim one

1484
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
they had a fun time

1485
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
then they

1486
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
he was ten years old they

1487
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
went to a softball

1488
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
game for his older

1489
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
sister and she got a

1490
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
terrible injury during the game

1491
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
and they had to go straight to an

1492
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Anaheim hospital and in the

1493
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
window there was a perfect view

1494
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
of the Bullwinkles

1495
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
and he is ten years old and not

1496
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
only is he pining for well I'd rather

1497
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
be there than here he's like

1498
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
you know he doesn't understand the stakes

1499
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
he doesn't know hospitals and what's

1500
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
happening at this point he's like get a cast on the arm

1501
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
and let's get over to Bullwinkles yeah

1502
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
well that's what I thought it was more of that vibe but instead

1503
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
it was that his concern for his sister

1504
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
was so heavy he's like we're

1505
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
in a hospital that means she's gonna die

1506
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
I'm gonna lose my sister

1507
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
today and he's which did not happen

1508
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
spoiler but he's in this

1509
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
room sadly looking at the window

1510
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
and like once my half family was happy

1511
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
we had Bullwinkles and now

1512
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
we are here at Death's Door

1513
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
we will not all leave together

1514
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
as a family this is a very

1515
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
haunting memory

1516
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
innocence of childhood and now he's

1517
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
on the threshold

1518
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
as he passed into double digit age

1519
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
leaving

1520
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
childish things behind yeah isn't

1521
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
that a beautiful sad little memory

1522
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
and I do picture like

1523
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
in the way he painted it there's

1524
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
nothing in that window view except

1525
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
for that Bullwinkles there's not one

1526
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
other street light or

1527
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
gas station children frolicking with their

1528
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
alive siblings

1529
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
fun cause she didn't die

1530
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
I love you sister

1531
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
I love that you're alive mainly

1532
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
yes ah

1533
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
anyway

1534
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
yeah such a poignant little picture

1535
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
that Anaheim zone seemed

1536
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
exceedingly close to

1537
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
the fries where I got to have that video

1538
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
played for a couple days before

1539
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
it was closed so I'm looking at that

1540
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
and what you got to experience as a kid like oh man

1541
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
I wish that had been my go to

1542
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
childhood place I'm also looking at the Santa

1543
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Clara location because Santa Clara

1544
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
is the same neck of the woods as

1545
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
San Jose

1546
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Campbell where I have this

1547
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
I've had now two deliriously

1548
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
fun trips the one initially

1549
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
inspired by wanting to go to a car wash

1550
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
that looks like an old river boat

1551
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
and then I went back and had an equally fun

1552
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
time with my family at the world's

1553
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
largest Chuck E Cheese which is

1554
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
up there and I'm like this area

1555
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
had the theme park great America when it

1556
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
was good

1557
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
they had the world's largest Chuck E Cheese

1558
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
this one and then at the same

1559
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
maybe the primary

1560
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
the world's first Bullwinkles the one from

1561
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
the video which looks pristine and awesome

1562
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
and then at the same intersection

1563
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
there was one of those places

1564
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
this one was called

1565
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
pizza and pipes have we ever

1566
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
talked on the show about

1567
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
yeah I've never yes I

1568
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
know a lot of people who have very fond memories

1569
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
of pizza and pipes the pipe organ

1570
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
themed pizza restaurant

1571
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
before animatronics I can't believe you

1572
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
don't know about this I would have assumed you have a

1573
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
depth of knowledge about it

1574
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
I thought you meant pipes

1575
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
like tunnels this is the one

1576
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
that got absorbed by discovery zone

1577
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
leaps and bounds

1578
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
leaps and bounds yeah that's

1579
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
the pipe I was picturing another treasured

1580
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Schomburg thing yeah we had leaps and bounds

1581
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
and discovery zone

1582
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
and a Mickey

1583
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
cafe or whatever

1584
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
but anyways

1585
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
no

1586
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
pipes and pizza

1587
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
was like this is the

1588
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
precursor before they figured out animatronics

1589
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
your pizza entertainment was

1590
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
watching a guy play the mighty

1591
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Wurlitzer organ a giant

1592
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Wurlitzer

1593
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
that would have scored silent

1594
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
films and these are still around

1595
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
a little bit I'm so intrigued by this

1596
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
concept and that they do still

1597
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
exist where's the nearest one

1598
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I don't know I think there's one like

1599
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
in the like three

1600
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
counties surrounding us but I

1601
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
don't know for sure okay I think this

1602
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
is a tradition people have tried to keep up

1603
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
and the word the big organ feels

1604
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
so stodgy put next

1605
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
to pizza which feels like what

1606
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
you know right should be

1607
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
you know pizza and liver sorry

1608
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
pipes and liver or pipes

1609
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
and crab

1610
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
pipes and pancetta I found

1611
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
an SF gate article

1612
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
about it is was the full name

1613
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
at some point Capin's

1614
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
the Capin's galley pizza

1615
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
and pipes it might be a different one

1616
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
yeah there might be because I think there are a number

1617
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
of these I don't think it is one chain

1618
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
this many pizzerias could afford

1619
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
the mighty Wurlitzer

1620
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
organ from baseball

1621
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
games don't play it dumb Jason

1622
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
now you were the phantom of the opera that haunted

1623
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
the area

1624
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
underneath the pizza and pipes

1625
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
hey man play cool

1626
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
sorry sorry to blow up your spot

1627
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
swinging in the rafters

1628
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
sometimes stray pizza would fall into one of

1629
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
the pipes wow Bloomberg.com

1630
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
remember the dining fad of

1631
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
pizza and pipes

1632
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
I feel like am I are these the

1633
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
last moments of my life is

1634
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
this just like a funny gag

1635
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
that I am a man my brain

1636
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
the funniest gag is telling you there was a place

1637
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
called pizza and pipes right before you die

1638
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
you're on an operating

1639
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
you got hit by a car on the way over

1640
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
you're on the operating table

1641
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
pizza and Wurlitzer that's pretty funny

1642
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
that's so weird and then you go

1643
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
to the library to learn more about it and somebody

1644
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
catches you with a big net

1645
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
God catches him with a big net

1646
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
well a net is a

1647
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
what's that? God catches you with a big net

1648
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
what is death but God's net

1649
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
I was going to say

1650
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
God catches us all eventually

1651
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
you can't escape the net

1652
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
I was going to say a net a non-lethal

1653
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
weapon

1654
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
I guess if God is wielding it

1655
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
to take you to the great beyond

1656
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
he shanks you a couple times while you're in there

1657
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
stabbed you with a box cutter

1658
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
oh man what a dirty death

1659
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
God

1660
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
so he does it

1661
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
there feels like there's all these different

1662
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
historians for the different places

1663
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
like Chuck E. Cheese stuff is pretty well

1664
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
documented you can get sound files

1665
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
of all the characters and this is pretty well

1666
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
documented I wish there was one person

1667
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
that literally was like I will tell you all

1668
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
the different places in America

1669
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
you can go right now

1670
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
and there's an organ show

1671
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
there's a robot still working

1672
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
I want this comprehensive list

1673
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
of everything that's still there

1674
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
a map or a GeoCity site that's

1675
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
sure it does not have to look fancy

1676
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
I guess there is one

1677
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Bullwinkles that still has

1678
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
some of the animatronics it's in Seattle

1679
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
there's a haunted

1680
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
looking man that does a tour of it on YouTube

1681
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
and you know it's in

1682
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
the pizza room and it's just Rocky

1683
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
and Bullwinkle and then a Boris and Natasha

1684
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
above them

1685
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
and you know they're

1686
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
old the clacking is deafening

1687
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
you cannot hear what they're saying because it's

1688
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
all clacking when they blink

1689
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
also and he had to make a point of

1690
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
can you turn this on for me

1691
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
watch this video absolutely

1692
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
there is like you can see a

1693
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
frustrated stone teenager

1694
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
having to cater to this YouTuber

1695
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
one of those weirdos is here

1696
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
turn a big crank for a while

1697
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
or something it feels hard

1698
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
feels like there's a reason they don't want to do it

1699
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
the restaurant was closed that

1700
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
day too the family

1701
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
fun center and the snack bar he says

1702
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
in the video the restaurant was closed

1703
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
but they're going to open the show

1704
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
so they had to open up an entire area

1705
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
not to get back into it

1706
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
if you're going to tell me that this is where

1707
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
the residency is happening for

1708
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
as much as make believe ban

1709
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
I just couldn't believe why close

1710
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
the curtain as we all know

1711
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
the Chuck E. Cheese tradition is

1712
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
you leave them all just creepily

1713
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
blinking and shifting back and forth

1714
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
no matter what all day every day

1715
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
frozen in rigor mortis

1716
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
you know?

1717
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
if one loses an eyeball that's it

1718
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
there's no replacements for that

1719
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Five Nights at Freddy's was a big hit

1720
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
which is why it happened

1721
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
a terrible movie

1722
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
you would think these places would be having

1723
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
a resurgence because of that

1724
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
you would think that they would be returning

1725
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
robots right? I don't know

1726
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
I think it's the only thing that saved the one

1727
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
and they still seem ashamed

1728
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
by it

1729
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I was actually expecting a little more of something like

1730
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
oh it's like showcasing the fact

1731
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
that they have the robots but it is like

1732
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
don't ask us about what's behind the curtain

1733
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
I mean I personally I'm

1734
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
just glad they took out the robots before they made

1735
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
them woke right?

1736
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
I don't think I could handle

1737
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
a woke rockian

1738
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
that Chuck E. Cheese in the picture frame

1739
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
with the cigar was not woke

1740
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
he was not

1741
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
that's when comedy was existing

1742
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
that Chuck E. Cheese could drop a hard R

1743
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
nobody

1744
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
it's me just kidding

1745
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
I'm just telling

1746
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
the truth here

1747
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
the radical left won't let us do our show

1748
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I'm saying a hard

1749
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
A through Z

1750
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
I'm saying all the words

1751
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
I'm using old time

1752
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
racial slurs no one's used since the 20s

1753
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
you have to look it up in a dictionary

1754
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
just real quick I found

1755
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
a post

1756
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Jordan is sitting next to me

1757
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
and I think I can see it a little

1758
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
the Valley

1759
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
relics museum

1760
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
is a great it has a lot of old San

1761
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Fernando Valley like

1762
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
neon signs and stuff

1763
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
that's preserved and statues

1764
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
big boys you know

1765
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
so they post a picture

1766
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
oh wow a number of years ago

1767
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
and I think this is a sign

1768
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
it says pipe and pizza in recita

1769
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
and it's just captioned

1770
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
sweet woman candy

1771
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
and it's just this

1772
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
woman seated she must have been the

1773
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
organ player at a pipe and pizza

1774
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
it looks like a really cheap album cover

1775
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
but she's like zazzy

1776
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
look at her

1777
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
sparkly red dress

1778
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
for a Kristen Wiig movie

1779
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
take that to Kristen Wiig's production

1780
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
company

1781
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
I've got four words for you

1782
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
sweet woman candy

1783
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
would my hair be very

1784
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
teased?

1785
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
the most Kristen

1786
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
it's got a Palm Beach look

1787
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
or Palm Royale look like

1788
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
kids play

1789
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
1970s pizza and pipes here

1790
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Bay Area pizza chain

1791
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
wow this is wild

1792
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
I assume we had talked about it

1793
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
we maybe did I have to forget some things

1794
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
we talked about so it's possible I forgot

1795
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
70s and 80s

1796
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
craze

1797
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
in this Bloomberg story

1798
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
predating the robot technology

1799
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
they say craze too

1800
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
as if it was like the nation couldn't stop

1801
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
enjoying pizza and pipes

1802
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
it seems like everyone is driving to places where pipes are

1803
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
I think if you were like a Wurlitzer player

1804
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
you like cursed the robot

1805
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
oh so this is what people want

1806
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
I mean you know they're not

1807
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
they're not playing live you realize that

1808
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
look at their hands their hands don't even touch the instruments

1809
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
oh you like all these rock and roll songs

1810
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
nobody wants to hear camp town races anymore

1811
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
classic no one wants to hear Buffalo Gal

1812
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
well that's

1813
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Jason says this every episode

1814
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
I'd say this yeah

1815
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
that's when music was real before

1816
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Sinatra ruined it

1817
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
the Oregon man got fired from the Cincinnati Reds

1818
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
he got fired from pipes and pizza

1819
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
where it's supposed to go there's only so many

1820
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
minor leg teens that can afford an Oregon

1821
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
yeah the world going

1822
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
woke to Jason equals less pipe organs

1823
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
around every turn

1824
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
less cigarettes indoors and less pipe organs

1825
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
those were the days

1826
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
when you could say the hard R

1827
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
anytime you wanted to listen to

1828
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Little Brown Jug

1829
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
the star spangled

1830
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
banner

1831
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
we'd all stand and salute and then go back to our

1832
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
pizza bites I've said this before

1833
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
I've said it about I think Pirates of the Caribbean

1834
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
I've said it about Womp Hoppers

1835
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
I would pay $100 to $200 to smoke a

1836
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
cigarette on like Pirates while it's

1837
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
going or in Womp Hoppers

1838
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
does everybody have a dream place they would just smoke a cigarette

1839
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
if they could go back in time

1840
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
it's on my mind

1841
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
but of course it's just because it's

1842
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
right in front of me but what's the Dudley Room

1843
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
again that Dudley's

1844
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Den yeah

1845
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
I can't not say that

1846
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
put in front of me I don't smoke and I don't

1847
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
like it but I would smoke on those two places

1848
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
but I would smoke in Dudley's Den as well

1849
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
I have about four cigarettes a year and I love

1850
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
all four of them

1851
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
that's where I was for a little bit

1852
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
but go back in time and where

1853
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
would you like to smoke those for

1854
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
with current California regulations

1855
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
I would say my hotel or my

1856
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
apartment building balcony yeah

1857
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
okay that's fun but is there

1858
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
any robots

1859
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
the

1860
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
the robots

1861
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
at the Seattle location that you can see

1862
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
in this YouTube tour yeah

1863
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
I don't know where the Natasha came

1864
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
from but

1865
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
someone said

1866
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
let's have something for dad

1867
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
I see I see

1868
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
assuming that dad loves giant tits

1869
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
because this

1870
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Natasha that they have is out of

1871
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
control she's a bosomy lady

1872
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
yes like it just might be a repainted

1873
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Elvira like

1874
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
and Bullwinkle's package too

1875
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Bullwinkle you can tell he's got like a half chub

1876
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
in there

1877
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
as long as his nose yes

1878
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
the exact same shape but in his pants

1879
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
right just as thick

1880
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
hey Bullwinkle I didn't know you had three legs

1881
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
oh Bullwinkle's stupid and

1882
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
hung

1883
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
that's why I never wear shorts Rock

1884
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
no need for me to learn anything

1885
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
that's not my value

1886
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
to the world I haven't eaten pussy in my life

1887
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
I don't have to

1888
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
gee Rocky should still learn

1889
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
it's the only way some women can come

1890
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
which I had a better

1891
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Rocky pretty good

1892
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
that's pretty good

1893
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
we'll pitch it up in post that's what you do

1894
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
in context with Bullwinkle too

1895
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
yeah people you understand

1896
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
you have the character down

1897
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
thank you yeah

1898
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
of the audio files we've talked about

1899
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
I think my favorite

1900
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
which is I saw

1901
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
it named

1902
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
just after what the song

1903
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
the chorus is a song

1904
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
underdog sings called country is

1905
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
dumb

1906
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
did anyone watch it you were telling me about

1907
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
this already yeah

1908
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
he sings a song called country

1909
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
is like mad

1910
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
they play too much country music

1911
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
country music yeah like as a band

1912
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
because there's no chance

1913
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
for him to play his saxophone

1914
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
that's pretty clever

1915
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
so that's kind of clever yeah

1916
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
but yeah watching the old

1917
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
underdog cartoons I was like man yeah

1918
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
he really does sound like

1919
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
droopy dog and like the

1920
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
switch from shoeshine boy to

1921
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
underdog I thought

1922
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
oh but he sounds like superman

1923
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
no it is slightly

1924
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
pitched down

1925
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
but yeah country is dumb

1926
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
underdog is

1927
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
mad at country music because there's not

1928
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
enough saxophone

1929
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
it's a very good little routine

1930
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
for him that's good

1931
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
yeah I don't know

1932
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
I mean I didn't dive too much into the show scene

1933
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
I just know that like the

1934
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
animatronics do seem

1935
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
of higher quality

1936
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
seems like those ones are

1937
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
clacking around and I'm not saying that just because

1938
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
of that Natasha revelation I think

1939
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
overall even forgetting

1940
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
that no these

1941
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
bullwinkles are so charming

1942
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
I don't know just like

1943
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
and they seem like I don't know

1944
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
range of motion they look just like the cartoons

1945
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
it is not the scare

1946
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
factor that the Chuck E. Cheese ones

1947
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
admittedly have even still like

1948
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Chuck E. Cheese now is very I don't want to

1949
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
it's not like an apple store aesthetic or anything

1950
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
but it is very much a cleaner

1951
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
very bright like

1952
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
establishment but I do feel like

1953
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
it's always there's always been a weird

1954
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
vibe in a Chuck E. Cheese

1955
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
like they've never matched any sort of like

1956
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Disney feeling going into this place

1957
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
which is what they kind of want

1958
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
yes it's like always was like dim

1959
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
and weird and it smelled like

1960
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
diapers and pizza and like

1961
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
it still kind of smells like diapers

1962
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
and pizza they have like

1963
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
you know when you start

1964
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Pirates of the Caribbean there's the like

1965
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
cricket noises

1966
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
I think those are getting piped through bullwinkles

1967
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
when the band's not on you have to like

1968
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
chirping crickets

1969
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
even from the pictures and

1970
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
just a little of the audio yeah you just get

1971
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
the sense that like whether

1972
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
dad or mom can articulate it they

1973
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
feel like this is like a

1974
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
higher end establishment

1975
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
it's just it's such a massive

1976
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
build I don't know if they all

1977
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
were I don't know if Anaheim was but like

1978
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
this Santa Clara one they show

1979
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
because the Northridge Chuck E. Cheese that

1980
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
I brought you to that is just

1981
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
like a you know that's I feel

1982
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
like someday it's just going to be a Verizon store

1983
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
that is not like the biggest low ceilings

1984
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
very true do you know why they picked that

1985
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
one to house the robots the last

1986
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
robots I don't I don't actually

1987
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
it was it was among the first maybe

1988
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
they made the calculation that like

1989
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
LA hipsters are going to be the most

1990
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
likely to want to go

1991
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
to but I don't I don't actually but isn't

1992
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
it basically that they just have been decommissioning

1993
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
these things for years and years and

1994
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
that was one of the only places left and they just decided

1995
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
maybe more than you'd think

1996
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
but they I think they had they were about

1997
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
to start getting rid and there might be stray ones

1998
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
where they haven't I think there are all the

1999
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
ones okay but in my mind and maybe this is wrong

2000
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
they just looked at a list of ten places

2001
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
that still had the full band and when

2002
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
they'll say Northridge gets to keep them

2003
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
arbitrarily maybe I could be I'm sure

2004
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
there's some reasoning but close their eyes pointed

2005
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
at a map yeah doesn't feel like where do our

2006
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
neighbors not mind clacking yeah

2007
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
I'm fascinated

2008
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Chuck E. Cheese is still in business

2009
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
it must be some real estate scam or something

2010
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
like it must be like well they own the

2011
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
buildings or something but they are

2012
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
like it is working for

2013
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
no it does you know it does and they figured out

2014
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
what they want now and like my child

2015
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
has a good time despite not knowing

2016
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
any mythology and not having

2017
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
layers upon layers of

2018
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
bizarre

2019
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
maybe not natural affinity

2020
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
for half thought out mythology

2021
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
he just he likes to play

2022
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
basketball in there imagine

2023
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
that yeah family fun centers

2024
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
I think are still

2025
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
money makers yeah it just

2026
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
feels like a place that should have gone out like

2027
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
the pandemic should have taken it down right

2028
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
it feels like just something should have taken this down

2029
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
but it didn't well there could be

2030
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
I feel like JCPenney's is

2031
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
having I saw them having money

2032
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
trouble or

2033
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
other do I think JCPenney's is

2034
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
in trouble no no what I'm saying is there might be

2035
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
another wave of bankruptcies

2036
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
I feel like oh I don't think

2037
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Chuck is on the chopping block if that's what you're saying

2038
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
if Biden gets re-elected yes

2039
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
folks Penny's is gone

2040
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
where are men going to buy

2041
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
slacks

2042
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
slacks and quarter zips well the Sears is already

2043
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
back at the mall and the Burbank so

2044
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
is it is Sears

2045
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
back we've talked about it before we'll do a

2046
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
quick there's a Sears

2047
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
that all of a sudden is reopened in Burbank

2048
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
wild yes what a great

2049
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
thing to happen in Burbank ask anybody in there

2050
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
about it they don't know they don't know why it

2051
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
opened again I don't know why I work here

2052
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
article where they called Sears and said why did you open

2053
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
the store again and they said we don't really want to talk about

2054
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
it wow maybe a soft launch

2055
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
for an all new Sears

2056
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
the basic answer might just be

2057
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
like we kind of like paid for rent or

2058
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
we own the part of the bill I don't know and

2059
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
it's just not it's like we'll make a

2060
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
few dollars opening it huh

2061
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
it has its own free will now it opened

2062
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
itself back up it's possible the Sears

2063
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
opened itself back up but over here yeah

2064
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
over in Burbank yes the

2065
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Sears just opened one day again after being

2066
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
closed that's wild yeah

2067
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
so anything can anything can

2068
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
come back stay on your toes well including

2069
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Bullwinkles which the let's make sure to

2070
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
carve out some time to talk about your specific

2071
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
visit because this is not like

2072
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
you know we're not seeing animatronics again

2073
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
let's make no mistake there but there

2074
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
is like what is the extent of the

2075
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Bullwinkle feeling at this upland

2076
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
location so basically nothing

2077
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
some signage

2078
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
some like employees only

2079
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
signage where you'll see a character

2080
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
they have a mini two mini golf

2081
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
courses an outdoor and an indoor the indoor

2082
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
is weirdly fairy tale themed

2083
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
uh and

2084
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
and charmingly janky I should say if you

2085
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
like a kind of a mini golf

2086
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
course clearly painted by the teens that work

2087
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
there oh great yeah and like a big

2088
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
crescent moon hanging in there maybe I saw

2089
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
you know you might be right yeah

2090
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
okay so yeah really

2091
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
yeah fun and then a little

2092
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
arcade with a lot of

2093
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
like big versions

2094
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
of cell phone games you got a

2095
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
fruit ninja you got a

2096
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Angry Birds restaurant

2097
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
not open yet but they have a

2098
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
little on a tiny tv

2099
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
by where you get the like you

2100
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
know play cards you can

2101
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
see a

2102
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
like 3d

2103
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
kind of model

2104
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
of what it's going to look like

2105
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
I would say the 3d is lawnmower man

2106
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
quality

2107
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
PS1 cutscene

2108
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
uh and it looks like

2109
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
they're gonna add so the arcade is gonna be

2110
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
badenov's oh cool

2111
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Boris Badenov

2112
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
last name of the character and

2113
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
it looks like you know there's gonna be some maybe

2114
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
a guy in a bullwinkle suit walking around

2115
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
and this is wishful

2116
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
thinking I don't know that this is gonna happen

2117
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
probably not but one of the rooms does

2118
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
look like you can kind

2119
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
of see there's a tarp over it but you can see

2120
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
the walls and it looks lodge

2121
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
themed I have to hope that

2122
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
maybe they're trying to bring back a lodge

2123
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
and maybe it would have

2124
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
animatronics in it I don't know

2125
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
this is you know

2126
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
that's something okay at the very least

2127
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
you know if it's I mean like

2128
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Berry Tales came back at nots

2129
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
but you do at least sometimes at least

2130
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
appreciate whoever's doing

2131
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
a new version of something or trying to sneak

2132
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
in like an Epcot reference into

2133
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
a line like that is something

2134
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
you're giving me a little morsel thank you

2135
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
for that at the very least if they're just

2136
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
trying to pay homage to the old room

2137
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
at Bullwinkle's I appreciate that

2138
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
but hopefully what you're saying

2139
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
I would like it if they did

2140
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
what some other

2141
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
locations did a promotion

2142
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
an after dark promotion

2143
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
21 and up

2144
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
it's Bullwinkle's head and it says after dark

2145
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
and this just happened

2146
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
that was but days ago

2147
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
and it's like

2148
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
psychedelic poster

2149
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
drop acid at Bullwinkle's

2150
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
is that what they're

2151
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
implying do some drugs

2152
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
maybe the animatronics cuss

2153
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
you turn Dudley's dead into a chill out room

2154
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
these are strong just take half

2155
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
see how you feel

2156
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
alright just make sure to test

2157
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
the drugs you're taking

2158
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
know your dealer right Bullwinkle

2159
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
there's Narcan

2160
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
in Dudley's

2161
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
the teens have Narcan if someone OD's

2162
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
on fentanyl

2163
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
the teens at our place

2164
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
were kind of great I should say this is kind

2165
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
of just a fun you know themed

2166
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
entertainment moment

2167
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Jesse's kids loved it

2168
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
and when they were looking to you know

2169
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
cash in their tickets one of the

2170
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
kids only had 30 tickets and I think

2171
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
30 tickets all you get is candy

2172
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
kid doesn't like candy

2173
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
she wanted the samurai swords

2174
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
which were 3000 tickets

2175
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
fucking stoned

2176
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
teenager just gave her the samurai

2177
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
swords

2178
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
I think you can

2179
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
bargain with those kids

2180
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
okay okay if they're

2181
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
in a good mood

2182
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
if they're paranoid and upset

2183
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
then maybe not

2184
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
they'll like spray

2185
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
you with mace or something

2186
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
okay so

2187
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
vibes are good good teens

2188
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
good teen jobs

2189
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
so yeah I hope that whatever the redesign

2190
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
they're doing that you know hopefully

2191
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
that's a lot more theming some of the

2192
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
old Bullwinkle stuff but yeah the vibes in there were

2193
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
great everybody was having a really fun time and I

2194
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
think it'll be even more fun when it

2195
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
you know is back to its back to private

2196
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
events 21 and up there you go

2197
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
millennial crowd going looking

2198
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
for second

2199
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
spouses

2200
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
wanting to add to their

2201
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
polycule

2202
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000

2204
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
time for us

01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
it's time to look for our second spouse

2206
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
it's time to look for our second spouse

2207
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000

down

2221
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
human hands and a dumb guy voice

2222
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
on the adults night though you have to plant

2223
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
a security guard in front of that Natasha

2225
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
trying to rip her off the wall

2226
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
a sad dad who can't find

2227
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
his second spouse yeah who hasn't had

2228
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Bollie in a couple of years

2229
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
she said this was an Ilter Tarkin

2230
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
worse than Natasha

2231
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
when's Natasha losing that top

2232
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
I've been

2233
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
tipping her I wanted to buy her a nice

2234
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
meal I was told the food was really

2235
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
good I thought she'd like that

2236
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
I bought her Klondike fried

2237
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
chicken

2238
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
I paid her $500

2239
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
for a private dance

2240
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
she just stood there

2241
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
I got a cache of vegetables over here

2242
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
she implied they would be touching

2243
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
I hope they can restore the feeling that's all

2244
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
I hope yeah yeah yes no this is

2245
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
clearly this is the vibe

2246
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
of this establishment

2247
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
turn to Bullwinkles feel something

2248
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
feel something Bullwinkles

2249
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
well I break from the numbness

2250
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
I feel like we

2251
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
said it all I mean toss in anything

2252
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
on the way out the door but otherwise

2253
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
there was some crossover from

2254
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Chuck E Cheese actually sorry my phone went

2255
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
gone but they used a voice talent

2256
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
that did oh yeah

2257
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
that is the real voices and also you know what's

2258
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
cool is that Snidely Whiplash and

2259
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
I think maybe other characters were Cory

2260
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Burton who is has

2261
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
universally taken over as Snidely

2262
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Whiplash like in the new shorts

2263
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
or any new iterations of

2264
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
it in Dudley Dewright's Ripsaw

2265
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Falls the voice of the Disney

2266
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
parking lot tram is like

2267
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
in this and many other media like

2268
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
taking over the old Hans

2269
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Conreid characters I believe

2270
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Helen Henny's voice is also

2271
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
she did voices here you know

2272
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
I just want to say it felt good for an episode where we've

2273
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
talked about Cumming several times it felt good

2274
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
to get back onto our solid

2275
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
ground of saying the name Hans Conreid

2276
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
and Helen Henny

2277
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
now we're back

2278
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
some nice names

2279
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
so somebody who was like wagging

2280
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
their finger at the show up in tone all goes well

2281
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
now I like it now I like what they're

2282
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
saying again and the voice actor of

2283
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
of Cumley is oh shit no

2284
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
they're writing their letters again

2285
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
they're taking pens and paper

2286
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
to express their disapproval

2287
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,000
I thought this was a clean show

2288
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
they say they're good boys

2289
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
I have a name as well the guy

2290
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
who started this David L. Brown

2291
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
at some point he got the license

2292
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
and he toured

2293
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
a stage show called Bullwinkle's

2294
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Call of the Wild show

2295
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
which included an

2296
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
original character Bullwinkle's

2297
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
girlfriend Moonbeam

2298
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
I have not been able

2299
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
to find anything on the original

2300
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
character Bullwinkle's

2301
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
girlfriend Moonbeam so

2302
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
if there are any Moonbeam heads out there

2303
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
you haven't even found a photo of Moonbeam

2304
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
you've been searching

2305
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
I've been searching

2306
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
you went to the library to look

2307
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
I got the microfiche

2308
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
I got the microfiche

2309
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
I got my keys out of the ball

2310
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
at Bullwinkle's

2311
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
you accidentally called it garden cash but then you

2312
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
oh wait no microfiche

2313
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
maybe my

2314
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
guess knowing that and knowing the time period

2315
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
I wonder if she was supposed to be like a hippie

2316
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
I think she was probably a little hippie hippie

2317
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
it just seems like Jason

2318
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
you're going to find Moonbeam one of these days

2319
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
one of these days

2320
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
searching for Moonbeam

2321
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
this is your six part investigative

2322
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
podcast

2323
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
what did she look like?

2324
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
how did it work?

2325
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
knowing what Bullwinkle's packing

2326
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
how could any human woman

2327
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
have possibly withstood

2328
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
even a brief lovemaking session

2329
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
with Bullwinkle

2330
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Bullwinkle's dumb and packing

2331
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
they get a fuck marry kill situation

2332
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
that's a fuck, that's not a marry or kill

2333
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
get a marry Bullwinkle

2334
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
that's why it's girlfriend not wife

2335
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
give me the other two options though

2336
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
because there's certainly other characters you would have to marry Bullwinkle over

2337
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
I'm just saying

2338
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
I think you'd marry Dudley Drew Rockie

2339
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
oh

2340
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
you guys started out

2341
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
well I didn't know how many were in the

2342
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
I don't want to kill

2343
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
I don't want to kill any of the dumb

2344
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
cartoon characters

2345
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
I don't want to marry Rockie

2346
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Rockie's so small

2347
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
it would feel weird and wrong

2348
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
I would marry Mr. Peabody

2349
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
I would marry Mr. Peabody

2350
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
he's a responsible guy

2351
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
it's a little condescending

2352
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
well sure

2353
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
you're all marrying the dog

2354
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
I guess you could marry Natasha

2355
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
you've got a perfectly stacked super spy

2356
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
right there

2357
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
who you can spend the rest of your life with

2358
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
I'm marrying the dog who travels through time

2359
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
sorry

2360
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
oh shit, oh you get a time machine out of the deal

2361
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
god damn it you were right

2362
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
I could smoke a cigarette at Wampop

2363
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
I wish I'd married the dog

2364
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Dudley's taken, this is so hard

2365
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
who are we going to marry

2366
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
they're exclusive, they'll open up eventually I'm sure

2367
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
they have to

2368
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
was it for sure a human woman

2369
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
I took a stab there

2370
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
you could be right

2371
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
but she could be a moose

2372
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
but she could be any other animal too

2373
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
a lot of great animals out there

2374
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
badger, possum, field mouse

2375
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
that's what listener

2376
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
call to action

2377
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
find a picture of moonbeam for us

2378
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
and if you can't

2379
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
make her up and put her kissing Jason in a photo

2380
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
what moonbeam do you see

2381
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
and then draw

2382
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
I'm going to get Mr. Peabody's wedding

2383
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
and then draw me trying to

2384
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
take it from Bullwinkle during our long weekend

2385
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
in Reno

2386
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
can I add

2387
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
to Jason's that Bullwinkle is standing

2388
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
by and his nose has gone

2389
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
limp because he's so

2390
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
saddened that his girlfriend has

2391
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
been taken

2392
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Bullwinkle's in the cuck chair

2393
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
so yeah

2394
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
preferably the real moonbeam

2395
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
I'd love to see what moonbeam

2396
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
looks like for real

2397
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Jane's going to kill moonbeam

2398
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
she's going to be so mad when she hears this

2399
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
who's this in your phone?

2400
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
moonbeam?

2401
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
you didn't protest enough when they

2402
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
proposed you kissing

2403
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
I don't know a cartoon skunk

2404
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
or

2405
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
in the dog house now

2406
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
it wasn't about her

2407
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
it was about wanting to cuck Bullwinkle

2408
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
don't you see honey?

2409
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
he likes it it's the only way he can get hard

2410
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
no he brings his

2411
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
snoot back to life

2412
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
tell me I could never make you come

2413
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Jason is this show

2414
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
though was it like a sesame street on ice

2415
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
like what was the actual show

2416
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
I think it was like costume characters I saw this

2417
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
too he got this license first and then

2418
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
then he had it and thought well why

2419
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
not also do a Chuck E Cheese

2420
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
well I have it but yeah it was dubbed characters

2421
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
and the dubbed characters were wrong and in fact

2422
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
the voice of Bullwinkle was the guy

2423
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
who's usually the voice of Chuck E Cheese

2424
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
in that sleazy era

2425
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
so part of the

2426
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
for them to approve the property

2427
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
to do a Chuck E Cheese out of it

2428
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
they said okay but it's got to be the real voices

2429
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
which is why they got June Foray and Bill

2430
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Scott once again

2431
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
back to this podcast

2432
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
let me be clear this is a podcast

2433
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
where we say names of deceased

2434
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
people and not where we say filthy

2435
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
words

2436
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
like the C word or the

2437
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
other C word

2438
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
I did not

2439
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
despite the

2440
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
audio files being well preserved I didn't

2441
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
find a lot on eBay or Depop

2442
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
in terms of selling I think a lot of bars

2443
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
would use the generic

2444
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
name Bullwinkles too

2445
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
yes I saw a lot of bars on like Yelp and stuff

2446
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
a lot of matchbooks and stuff it could be matchbooks

2447
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
from these restaurants

2448
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Bullwinkles also like in the early

2449
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
90's again coming back around

2450
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
had a promotional

2451
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
tie in at Taco Bell

2452
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
so there's some

2453
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Bullwinkle paper products and toys

2454
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
I think from that era

2455
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
okay how much

2456
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
expensive?

2457
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
I don't think too expensive

2458
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
I don't think those are holy grails for toy

2459
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
collectors I could be wrong the Taco Bell

2460
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Bullwinkle stuff I just got a picture of

2461
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Bullwinkle with a bullhorn telling

2462
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
gotta leave folks

2463
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
just ask for your crunch

2464
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000

gotta leave folks

2466
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
it's pretty good

2467
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
on the scale of Jason

2468
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
voices that was pretty great

2469
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
the first one or the second one

2470
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000

2471
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000

2496
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
to me it was Bullwinkle

2497
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000

2505
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
says I Bullwinkle

2506
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
is there anything you'd like to

2507
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
I'm about to get

2508
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
blown up by a big circular bomb

2509
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
hey I wrote a new

2510
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
graphic novel that is coming out

2511
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
July 16th it is called

2512
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Youth Group the artist by the great

2513
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
John McGurdy

2514
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
who's a great comics artist you might know

2515
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
from Specter and Specters and Marvel comics

2516
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
it is a YA

2517
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
horror comedy about teenage

2518
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
exorcists

2519
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
they're all in a goofy bible study group

2520
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
and they have to go out and fight demons

2521
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
in Orange County

2522
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
it's pretty

2523
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
autobiographical for something that has a lot of

2524
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
like demon fighting in it

2525
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
a lot of my childhood is in there

2526
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
I think if you were a bible study

2527
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
kid you'll find a lot of good

2528
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
hopefully familiar cringe in there

2529
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
oh that sounds up my alley

2530
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
yeah yeah

2531
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
it was a blast to make

2532
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
I think it really turned out gorgeous

2533
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
if it sounds cool to you we'd love a pre-order

2534
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000

2556
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
at the library

2557
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
call the Burbank

2558
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
library Buena Vista branch

2559
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000

2560
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000

the Dave Thomas

2564
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
yeah not in

2565
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
the system for Burbank or LA

2566
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
library

2567
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
I think you're onto something I think it might have been

2568
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
I'm sure it was on VHS

2569
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
it probably got sold during one of those friends of the library

2570
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
sales for a book in

2571
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
1997

2572
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
oh that's the big ticket item

2573
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
we can't sell it in the library

2574
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
book stores it's considered

2575
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
a carcinogen
