1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,920
Hey, it's Podcasts to Ride, the second gate.

3
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,000
We're here, we're talking about a very exciting topic.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,560
My name is Mike Carlson, Jason Sheridan here along with me.

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,960
You just jumped right into it.

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,840
I was caught off guard, all this as if I was going

7
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,200
73 miles per hour on a first drop of a hyper coaster.

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,880
And you got hit with something that was living.

9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,320
Scott Garner here as well.

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,200
Yeah, this topic is so interesting,

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,880
it'll have you saying, I can't believe

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,480
it's not the main feed.

13
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,320
Oh yeah.

14
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,800
See, cause he even endorsed,

15
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,200
I can't believe it's not butter.

16
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,160
That's what, I kind of had that in my head on the way over

17
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,040
and I didn't have a right to go when you started.

18
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,120
And maybe I shouldn't have said it at all.

19
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,440
I think it's good, I mean.

20
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,400
I think it makes you sound very professional,

21
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,240
like a newspaper reporter in 1999.

22
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,520
Oh, everyone had a field day.

23
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,360
Yeah.

24
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,720
We're talking, this was a dream come true

25
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,880
for all these writers.

26
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,080
Everyone thought they were so funny.

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,640
Just kidding, okay, okay, all right.

28
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,680
Oh no, shit, Boston Globe already said,

29
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,400
already said Dr. Goose, what else can we,

30
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,640
you already called him a bird brain.

31
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,480
Did anyone say, did anyone say he laid an egg or anything?

32
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,520
That's kind of a stretch.

33
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,520
Do goose, do geese lay eggs?

34
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,360
They have to, right?

35
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,200
The goose that laid the golden egg.

36
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,960
Yeah, of course.

37
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,000
Take a gander at Fabio's face.

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,560
That's too good, that's too clever.

39
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,600
Too much of a, I added a related topic.

40
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,280
It's funny, having had a few journalism classes in college,

41
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,200
they do kind of teach you how to write

42
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,840
that funny little, you know.

43
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,960
We've talked a little bit about this,

44
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,000
but you did some journalism in college.

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,080
I worked for the first year and a half or so of college

46
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,680
before I switched majors.

47
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,680
And that turned out to be very good foresight on my part

48
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,360
because the industry slowly dying.

49
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,800
Like newspapers slowly, they were already dying at the time.

50
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,480
You may not like comedy.

51
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,320
No.

52
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,320
You're set.

53
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,160
No.

54
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,240
As are we all.

55
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,360
I love to laugh still.

56
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,640
Laughing could never,

57
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,680
there's no way that the laughing bubble could implode.

58
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,320
You had to make calls though, right?

59
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,720
To an agent to confirm like a story in college?

60
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,720
Oh, I was a fact checker.

61
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,720
Yeah, a lot of papers use the interns as fact checkers.

62
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,920
Yeah, and at the Philadelphia weekly,

63
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,920
which is now closed, I was fact checking the horror scopes

64
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,960
because the horror scopes were a funny little mashup

65
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,960
of like tabloid gossip and horror scopes.

66
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,400
I think we've talked about this before,

67
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,320
but what did you call the agent to confirm something about?

68
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,400
Sandra Bullock's agent to confirm a question

69
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,920
about her and Jesse James.

70
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,480
And they were not happy to speak to me.

71
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,280
Oh yeah, they just gave you the general agent's number.

72
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,760
You just had to like,

73
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,080
you ended up calling an assistant of who you'd called

74
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,600
to try to get her in a movie.

75
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,880
Okay, here was the path.

76
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,000
E used to catalog who represented everyone,

77
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,840
the website for the network E.

78
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,680
Weird.

79
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,480
That got me to UTA or William Morris.

80
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,800
And then I looked up their website,

81
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,120
I called the general line.

82
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,080
They connected me to that agent's assistant.

83
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,800
The assistant connected me to the agent

84
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,680
because I said it was from the Philadelphia weekly,

85
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,720
which sounds legit.

86
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,920
It was a good paper, a word winning paper.

87
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,680
And the person was so annoyed.

88
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,160
And what I had found was the horoscope writer

89
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,280
had to use news stories from that week, the year prior.

90
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,320
So they were like going too fast

91
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,880
and pulled a year old tabloid thing.

92
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,280
Oh, and this was, you were asking like, did he cheat?

93
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,560
Did Jesse cheat?

94
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,320
I think it was before that.

95
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,760
It was so innocuous and they were so,

96
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,560
rightly so, they were rightly annoyed

97
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,920
to be speaking to this 19 year old.

98
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,320
Is Sandra still committed to her hubby

99
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,120
or are her eyes wandering?

100
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,400
The thing they hate it the most is like my stock was,

101
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,840
my stock line was like,

102
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,400
I am from the Philadelphia weekly.

103
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,720
It's a weekly newspaper in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

104
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,520
And they went, I know where Philadelphia is.

105
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,400
And I was like, okay, all right.

106
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,360
That wasn't a shot at you.

107
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,440
Philadelphia, it's a city.

108
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,400
You might've heard this building's there.

109
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,600
Those are big tall houses, basically.

110
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,880
You weren't explaining that degree of,

111
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,680
you weren't condescending.

112
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,520
No, it, I was just going by like stock,

113
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,560
like introduce yourself in this way.

114
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,680
So people don't, so you're clear.

115
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,880
So you are clear that you are from a newspaper.

116
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,440
I know where Philadelphia is.

117
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,280
I fly over it all the time.

118
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,360
So yeah.

119
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,040
Nice, this person owes you an apology.

120
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,280
I don't know who this was.

121
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,440
Ari Emanuel?

122
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,800
Maybe.

123
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,520
It would have been great if it was Ari.

124
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,560
Who was the editor in chief screaming at though?

125
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,800
Ovitz?

126
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,960
Could it be Ovitz?

127
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,200
Do you remember the name?

128
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,520
I don't remember the name.

129
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,360
Well, you would have remembered if it was Ari, right?

130
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,200
Oh yeah.

131
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,400
Okay.

132
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,680
Well, we'll have to look into who Sandra Bullock's agent was.

133
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,600
Agent in 2005?

134
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,320
Okay.

135
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,960
So if we can web.archive,

136
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,080
if we can use the Wayback Machine to go to the old E website.

137
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,280
That's very good.

138
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,280
Well, your journalism skills, yes,

139
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,400
would have come in handy in crafting the perfect pun

140
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,880
about today's topic, which now has been,

141
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,120
okay, we've teased it now a couple of times

142
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,000
on the show recently,

143
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,160
and we decided let's skip this one up in the queue.

144
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,040
Let's get to it ASAP.

145
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,920
Now this first came up on,

146
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,160
well, maybe we should just say the basics of what happened.

147
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,040
I'm sure everyone knows this,

148
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,160
but well, all right, basic facts.

149
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,520
Fabio was on a roller coaster,

150
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,280
and when he came back, his face was all bloody

151
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,680
because on the way he got hit in the face by a goose.

152
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,960
Yes.

153
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,200
Sub details.

154
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,680
This was at Busch Gardens Williamsburg.

155
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,520
Williamsburg.

156
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,720
And the first that ever came up on the podcast

157
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,840
is we did an episode about the Park Kings Island in Ohio

158
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,520
with Dave Ferguson, and he seemed pretty confident

159
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,600
that the Fabio goose incident happened there.

160
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,280
And we didn't really seem right to us,

161
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,400
and I think we debunked it maybe during the episode

162
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,400
or soon after, but I didn't know where it was necessarily.

163
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,320
We all know the image.

164
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:11,320
The image is as striking now as JFK Jr. waving goodbye

165
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,080
to his father.

166
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,880
It's an indelible image from the 20th century,

167
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,440
pretty much moon landing in that.

168
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,280
Yeah.

169
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,800
A lot, I felt like I was brushing sand off a map

170
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,240
or something in a hidden temple.

171
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,200
It's like more and more was revealed reading

172
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,800
because this is very well documented.

173
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,200
Specifically, it was Apollo's Chariot.

174
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,960
Right, it was Apollo's Chariot.

175
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,280
It was the opening of Apollo's Chariot.

176
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,880
It was the opening, the inaugural ride,

177
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,960
so first ride on this.

178
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,080
They obviously had a test ride,

179
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,920
but this was the first open

180
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,440
to the public ceremonial test ride.

181
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,320
Done, because it was themed after the Greek gods,

182
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,880
so they got an Adonis.

183
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,480
They got a Greek god looking guy.

184
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:54,480
I want to say maybe Roman because I think it's in a Rome area.

185
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,040
There's a Rome area.

186
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,280
I think it's even called Roma rapids or something.

187
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,360
Roman rap, yes.

188
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,200
Yeah, okay.

189
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,120
The wettest ride maybe in the country.

190
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,200
My mom got so wet on the Roman rapids

191
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,400
once she bought a whole new outfit

192
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,720
to change into at the gift shop at the exit.

193
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,520
It is, it's glues in my family's mind

194
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,040
is like how wet you would get on this roller coaster.

195
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,080
But I hope she didn't buy you new socks.

196
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,480
You don't want new socks.

197
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,320
I know you want a wetter water ride.

198
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,120
I think she might have been wearing open-toed shoes.

199
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,240
Socks wet, baby.

200
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,080
Yeah.

201
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,480
He was surrounded by women in white dresses, essentially,

202
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,320
like togas.

203
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,160
Yeah.

204
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,040
What would you call them?

205
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,480
They're like nymphs or.

206
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,760
I guess, I don't know.

207
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,440
Did they really flesh out the universe

208
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,800
of what they were going for?

209
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,800
They look like, I mean, it's a harem, you might say.

210
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,040
But like not dissimilar to like what's her name

211
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,600
in Hercules is dressed like.

212
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,440
Yeah.

213
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,520
I mean, really it's like the chorus in Hercules.

214
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,720
The Greek chorus, yes.

215
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,920
Or like Kid Icarus, if you imagine what he is wearing.

216
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,120
That's true.

217
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,400
I appeared once on Craig Ferguson as a Greek chorus.

218
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,240
Oh, I remember that.

219
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,000
Yeah, about a decade ago.

220
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,920
Wow.

221
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,760
Anyway.

222
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,600
You know about this.

223
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,520
I know exactly about this.

224
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,000
You know how difficult it would have been

225
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,200
if someone had gotten hurt before

226
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,640
and there was blood all over your uniform.

227
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,480
Yeah.

228
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,000
Whatever you want to call it, your drapes.

229
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,840
My drapes.

230
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,160
I know Fabio was 38 years old.

231
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,000
Okay.

232
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,840
When this happened.

233
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,680
Okay.

234
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,760
He's 6'3".

235
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,600
Yeah.

236
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,680
The people around him,

237
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,240
because of the way blood splatter occurs,

238
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,200
some of them got a little bloodied.

239
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,040
Yes.

240
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,880
A little Fabio blood.

241
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,720
Behind them.

242
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,160
Now there's a view that I don't have it handy,

243
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,320
but we'll try to tweet it.

244
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,040
There's the photos that we kind of know

245
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,840
where the car is arriving back to the station

246
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,480
and as the camera zooms,

247
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,640
oh my God, there's blood all over his face.

248
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,880
And in that view,

249
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,400
you can tell that it got on the women behind him.

250
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,640
There's another view that I hadn't seen

251
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,080
which is on a drop itself.

252
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,920
Yes.

253
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,760
It's really funny in that view,

254
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,280
seeing a full car of goddesses,

255
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,960
whatever you want to call them,

256
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,720
all dressed identically,

257
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,120
except for one guy in the third row

258
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,800
who's just a regular guy

259
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,800
and Fabio, who presumably is part of this,

260
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,880
as you said, because he resembles a god,

261
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,040
he isn't dressed in like a Herculean face.

262
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,160
He's just in like a denim shirt.

263
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,320
Not for the ride.

264
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,920
There was clearly some sort of ceremony

265
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,400
where they gave him a cape and a sword

266
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,000
and he clearly took that off.

267
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,840
Right.

268
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,000
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

269
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,200
But even still, wasn't he just wearing that over like a shirt?

270
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,200
Yeah, he was just wearing it over like slacks and a shirt.

271
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,120
There was probably more money

272
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,320
to get him into the full outfit.

273
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,320
There was probably some sort of a negotiation,

274
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,160
don't you think?

275
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,000
Yeah, I think so.

276
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,360
Obviously they wanted Arnold.

277
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,560
You think they would want Arnold

278
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,680
and it's like, well, his price, especially 99,

279
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,120
it's too, too high.

280
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,960
Yeah.

281
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,160
And it's like, okay, Fabio, there's a negotiation.

282
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,920
Well, will he wear the Hercules outfit?

283
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,760
No, he won't.

284
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,680
Well, this is how much we have to pay.

285
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,000
Will he hold a sword and a shield with his denim shirt on?

286
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,080
Yes, he will do that.

287
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,920
Okay, great.

288
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,760
We've got him.

289
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,600
I read an essay on Medium where someone was like,

290
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,560
so you have to remember that they would have had to,

291
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,160
yeah, negotiate all that.

292
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,240
They would have had to fly him in,

293
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,560
probably to this airport, get him to Williamsburg,

294
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,920
put him up, probably the embassy suites

295
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,120
is like the nicest thing in Williamsburg,

296
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,600
probably the night before so that he's,

297
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,200
you don't have to worry about getting him in the morning of,

298
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,360
you want everything to be on time.

299
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,720
It's like, and he goes through.

300
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,760
Giant production and people really stressed out.

301
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,800
Just like everything.

302
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,960
Okay, can I get you anything?

303
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,360
We have plenty of sodas all over the park,

304
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,760
t-shirts if you want.

305
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,640
Yeah, all of that and then all of that happens

306
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,720
only for this to happen.

307
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,920
All of that goes down

308
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,920
and then you get literally a freak accident.

309
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,440
Yeah, truly.

310
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,480
It's too bad he didn't bring the sword on the ride

311
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,520
because it might have been.

312
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,360
It would have saved him.

313
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,200
Defense, yeah.

314
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,520
I don't know the sharpness of the sword,

315
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,360
but if he'd somehow seen it coming

316
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,200
and gotten ahead of it

317
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,240
and could have sliced the bird in half,

318
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,080
I guess blood would still be in the equi,

319
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,320
you might've had more splatter

320
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,040
on the goddesses in the background.

321
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,480
Right, but it would have been bird blood,

322
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,240
not Fabio blood.

323
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,760
Well, do we know this?

324
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,000
Do we know that it's not bird blood?

325
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,360
Well, he did get cut.

326
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,480
So it has to be at least some of his blood.

327
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,320
Yeah.

328
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,140
Oh, that's a good point.

329
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:45,980
Yeah, I didn't really think about.

330
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:49,400
Do you have information about what blood was on?

331
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,360
Let's keep talking.

332
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,200
Okay.

333
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,040
Oh, great.

334
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,320
I'll save what I think I know.

335
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,760
All right, then maybe I didn't see.

336
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,320
We were talking about what the twist is here.

337
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,000
Local news network has all of these clips online.

338
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,960
Very well, doc.

339
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:06,960
Again, well documented by the traditional mainstream media,

340
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
including a poor rep from Six Flags who assured everyone,

341
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,040
we have other roller coasters that are in

342
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,520
or sit in or near the water

343
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,720
and no one has ever been hit by a goose in the face.

344
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,800
Like those were exact words.

345
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,680
No, we should say, but one of the reasons,

346
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,980
probably why this came up initially

347
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:34,880
was because we just covered the world's tallest roller coaster.

348
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,720
Is that right?

349
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,540
We just.

350
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,380
Kingda Ka. Kingda Ka.

351
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,220
Right.

352
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,160
The tallest, no longer fastest.

353
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,680
No longer fastest.

354
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,680
And there was a very similar incident where a guy,

355
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,360
now we've recorded this a little while ago,

356
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,160
but a kid was hit in the face by a pigeon.

357
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,640
By a pigeon.

358
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,800
That he describes as having just exploded,

359
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,640
just demolished.

360
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,840
Right.

361
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,240
I don't know how the goose fared.

362
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,640
I don't know if the goose just burst

363
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:06,640
or if it did a body fall to the ground.

364
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,520
Right.

365
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,000
Or was it just completely toast?

366
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,440
Yeah, I don't know.

367
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,960
This one I was interested,

368
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,200
well anyway, I don't know,

369
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,440
which for getting too far ahead,

370
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,280
I was interested,

371
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,320
this one actually went down a little differently

372
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,800
than I thought in reading about it.

373
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,640
So maybe you have more.

374
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,160
It was the first drop too.

375
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,000
Yes.

376
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,840
Yeah.

377
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,100
Yeah, it was on the first drop,

378
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,160
which is I think is the point of view that you can see

379
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,060
like from this one photo that I'm describing.

380
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,880
Well, maybe this is a good point to say.

381
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,720
To drop it.

382
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,560
I don't know if we have overlapping information.

383
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,760
Yeah, let's just do it.

384
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,600
Let's get to it here.

385
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,880
Jason, you mentioned that medium article.

386
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,200
This is a great article about it

387
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,360
that pointed out a couple of interesting things

388
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,760
you didn't realize,

389
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,440
including that he points out,

390
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,640
imagine if you were at this press event

391
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,160
and the coaster is new,

392
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,640
no one knows the coaster.

393
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,080
Especially there's like,

394
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,340
on one side is all photographers and videographers

395
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,600
and on the other side are children

396
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,880
who are waiting to take the second ride.

397
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,920
And imagine like,

398
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,960
I wonder what's gonna happen on this roller coaster.

399
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,360
And then it pulls back up and Fabio is covered in blood.

400
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,280
Fabio looks like Steve Austin at WrestleMania 13,

401
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,800
bleeding out in the sharpshooter from Bret Hart.

402
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,600
They call it a crimson mask.

403
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,240
Just, it's a very horrifying look.

404
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,800
Do you know what picture I'm talking about?

405
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,720
I know what you're talking.

406
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,560
Yeah, sometimes if I get like too worked up

407
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,600
about treats and eats.

408
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,440
You start bleeding from the head?

409
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,240
I start getting crimson masks when podcasting.

410
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,320
You just stress bleed from the head?

411
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,080
I leave it all on the field, brother.

412
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,200
Like this is, if you can see this, Scott,

413
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,360
here's Steve Austin.

414
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,200
Oh my.

415
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,120
Let me see it again.

416
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,040
I mean, face blood is so upsetting.

417
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,380
Face bloody, here's a better picture of it.

418
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:00,380
We shall put a side by side with Fabio and Steve Austin.

419
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:04,360
It does look like he scored his face.

420
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,440
Well, that's what you, yeah.

421
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,480
We must have talked before about blading.

422
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,600
In wrestling, you call it blading,

423
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,240
is when you take a razor blade

424
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,120
and you make a little cut on your forehead

425
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,800
in order to have that blood happen.

426
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,360
Because it's not super painful.

427
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,880
There's not a lot of nerves up there.

428
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,480
It's not too painful, but it does bleed a lot.

429
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

430
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,040
It's very theatrical.

431
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,440
It looks crazier than it feels.

432
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,760
It looks great.

433
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,200
It's gonna fucking irritate your eyes

434
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,800
if you get blood in your eyes.

435
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,600
They've made a lot of, they've really like cut way down

436
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,040
on that in WWE from just from watching

437
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,300
and it doesn't happen a lot.

438
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,480
But it is funny because relatively to what a lot

439
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,040
of moves wrestlers take, I feel like are very dangerous

440
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,680
in the back and spine, but it's like, no,

441
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,920
we can't have them nick their forehead anymore.

442
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

443
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,120
Relatively speaking, a lot of what they do is,

444
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,980
in my opinion, more dangerous than having a little cut

445
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,720
on the forehead, but because it's so crazy looking.

446
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,280
It looks so much more upsetting, but yeah,

447
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:06,000
they can get their skull bashed as often as they want.

448
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Yeah. Yes.

449
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,700
And Mike, what's the term for if you start bleeding

450
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,760
out of your head, but from actually being like hit.

451
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,080
Cut the hard way, I believe,

452
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,160
is what you're looking for.

453
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,840
Fabio got it the hard way for sure.

454
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,840
Well, we don't know.

455
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,040
Scott has shed some mystery on this.

456
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,880
What?

457
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,960
Yeah, let me bring this up.

458
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,800
Yeah.

459
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,560
Why I brought up that medium article again

460
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,000
is that there's an important part of this article

461
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,400
that inspired some thinking from me.

462
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,080
The quote in dissecting all the ins and outs

463
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,800
of this incident, this medium writer said,

464
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,320
how there hasn't been a where are they now

465
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,520
or podcast or oral history of this day, I will never know.

466
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,920
Now as for podcast, we're doing it, baby.

467
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,760
We're doing it.

468
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,600
We're in it.

469
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,440
You got your wish.

470
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,280
2000.

471
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,600
And we're doing it, we should say like right around 21 years

472
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,840
to a week that this incident occurred.

473
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,480
This article was written on the 20th anniversary,

474
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,480
which I can't believe it's been that long.

475
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,400
This doesn't feel that long ago.

476
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,220
Yeah. I mean, this was right on the cusp of the millennium.

477
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,260
I have some, we'll get to it later.

478
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,720
I have some like, what was going on in the world this week?

479
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,560
Ooh, good.

480
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,400
Oh, okay.

481
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,640
Yeah, I have a couple of things like that too.

482
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,480
Ooh, neat.

483
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,840
I'm excited for a time capsule.

484
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,560
But it does feel to me like a perfect metaphor

485
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,640
for the 90s ending and running face first

486
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,200
into the millennium.

487
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,800
And of course we can't, of course we'll discuss

488
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:35,560
how the Fabio Goose incident factors into 9-11,

489
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,280
what it means before in a pre-9-11 time.

490
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,880
This was a little bit of levity

491
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,480
during the Clinton impeachment, like, you know.

492
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,440
Oh, is that what was happening?

493
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,600
Period.

494
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,240
I think that was a month later.

495
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,920
Wait, that was all wrapped up by, no, no, no, no,

496
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,400
it was 99, that was still going on.

497
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,120
Oh, that's right, okay, okay.

498
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,400
We'll take a trip backwards.

499
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,280
But when I read that and I was like, okay, well,

500
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,920
I'm excited because we're doing this podcast.

501
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,880
But then I thought, what we're doing right now,

502
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,600
three guys like riffing about the Fabio Goose incident

503
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,640
is not what this guy wants.

504
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,240
Yeah, what he wants is a full,

505
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,240
as a serious NPR serial kind of investigation

506
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,120
into this incident.

507
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,240
And I realized that just with a little bit of backdrop

508
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,840
that that's exactly what we could give him and here.

509
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,840
We all know the story, or at least we think we do.

510
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,320
Fabio goes on a roller coaster

511
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,880
and gets hit in the face by a goose.

512
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,440
But what if that isn't the whole story?

513
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,200
What if Fabio wasn't hit by a goose at all?

514
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,640
What if for the last 20 years, we've all been caught

515
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,840
in the world's biggest game of Duck Duck Goose?

516
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,880
And the truth has been chasing us in circles

517
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,880
this entire time.

518
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,160
For National Podcast, The Right Radio, I'm Scott Gardner.

519
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,800
This is Goose Chase.

520
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,280
And all right, and now we've set the scene.

521
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,720
I was wondering if we could just do the whole thing like this.

522
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,840
Well, here's, okay, if you have anything to say

523
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,240
and you would like the serious marimba music

524
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,200
to make this feel more, just call for it

525
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,440
and I'll pull it right back up.

526
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,680
Sure.

527
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,840
And I don't do, I don't set the serial tone for no reason

528
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,600
because I do think something is up here.

529
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,720
Interesting. Yes.

530
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,960
I started here, you know what?

531
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,920
I'll bring it back right away to say this.

532
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,120
As I started watching the footage,

533
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,160
I saw something that I'd never seen before.

534
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,000
As the coaster started going up the first lift hill

535
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,360
and it got out of the point of view

536
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,960
that we've all seen in the video,

537
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,880
there was something on the front of the coaster car,

538
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,720
a camera.

539
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,080
If this footage has been played over and over again

540
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,080
by news shows, comedy shows,

541
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,640
why have we never seen the point of view of the camera

542
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,080
mounted to the coaster as the goose exploded

543
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,400
on Fabio's face?

544
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,760
I started to wonder, it got me thinking.

545
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,480
So I did some digging.

546
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,480
And I can't keep up that tone for an entire,

547
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,000
I'm getting wrapped up in it, honestly.

548
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Yeah, call, tell me if you want the backdrop.

549
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,120
I'm not even here again.

550
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,760
Can I tell you what I read and then you can go?

551
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,680
Sure, yes.

552
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,080
From what I can tell, and Jason correct me if I'm wrong,

553
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,560
the official story they've put out is that a goose

554
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,760
hit the front of the car and then like ricocheted off

555
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,280
into Fabio's head.

556
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,760
I came across that as well.

557
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,680
I have not.

558
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,760
This is interesting. Really?

559
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,520
No, yeah, yeah.

560
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,160
Because what you were describing is different

561
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,640
than what Fabio himself describes.

562
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,680
Interesting, yeah.

563
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,440
So I think mine was like a post,

564
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,880
the New York Post article I was reading.

565
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,920
Okay. Yeah.

566
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,720
Okay, so ricocheted off the front of the car.

567
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,240
The front of the roller coaster,

568
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,760
then hit him in the head.

569
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:55,760
Okay, so the body bounces back onto him, onto his face.

570
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,240
And that, in this story, you'd have to think that

571
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,120
what's on his face is a combination of goose

572
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:05,920
blood and Fabio blood.

573
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,760
I'm trying to remember now.

574
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,080
They definitely mentioned he had swelling from getting hit.

575
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,280
I'm pretty sure someone said something about a cut,

576
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,040
but I was always under the impression

577
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,240
that it might be like a little blood

578
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,360
and then it was the goose as well.

579
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,840
Okay.

580
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,680
All right, what is?

581
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:24,600
Well, to me, the camera was the key to the entire thing.

582
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,600
And I've noticed that in a lot of the edits of this footage

583
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,200
that truly you're watching it

584
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,520
and the coaster starts to leave and you don't see the camera.

585
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,120
But like, why have we never seen what's on that?

586
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,800
That seems like that would solve the entire thing.

587
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,400
And that footage would be like the most popular footage

588
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,400
in the world to see a goose just turn to dust.

589
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,120
Why haven't we seen this?

590
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,360
And I think I know why,

591
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,760
because I kept digging a little bit.

592
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,880
Just if you keep going down in the YouTube results

593
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,080
for Fabio Goose roller coaster,

594
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,240
you hear an interview with him

595
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,440
that's not entirely about this incident,

596
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,880
but that's partially about this incident.

597
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:10,400
It's from Australian television about,

598
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,320
I don't know, maybe four or five years ago.

599
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,240
So, all right, listen to this.

600
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,400
This clears up a lot.

601
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,280
And I think it throws a wrench into the entire story.

602
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,120
Interesting.

603
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,040
This is the twist.

604
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:24,640
One of the goose hit the camera, the video camera,

605
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,920
and a piece of video camera barely slashed

606
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,120
the bridge of my nose.

607
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,760
Now I have to do other, you know,

608
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,800
10 minutes upside down with my head down.

609
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,120
And blood going everywhere.

610
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:34,960
Yeah, because you know,

611
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,200
it's like most of the blood is in your head.

612
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,320
But I wasn't hurt.

613
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:43,200
I was pissed because they wanted to cover their butt.

614
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,280
So they go, okay, if the goose hit him,

615
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,360
he's a nut of God.

616
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,720
So they spread to the media, then the goose hit him.

617
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,920
And it wasn't the goose.

618
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,960
The goose hit the video camera.

619
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,920
The video camera split.

620
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,760
Interesting.

621
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,520
Weird things can happen.

622
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,680
Easy.

623
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,600
Now wait a minute, but that contradicts,

624
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,360
because there was an interview with Fabio

625
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,000
not too long after the incident.

626
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,800
Well, he's saying he was manipulated.

627
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,760
Where he is said, it wasn't a freak accident,

628
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,440
and it's going to happen again.

629
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,280
And I cannot.

630
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,680
He said it wasn't a freak accident?

631
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,560
It wasn't a freak accident.

632
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,200
It was not.

633
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,280
He's saying it wasn't a freak accident,

634
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,920
and it's going to happen again.

635
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,880
And I cannot live with my conscience

636
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,680
knowing that the ride is still running.

637
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,960
And maybe a person.

638
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,240
Or even a child can be killed.

639
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,280
Killed?

640
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,120
Did not happen.

641
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,320
No, but Paula's chariot has now been running safely

642
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,160
for over 20 years.

643
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,640
20 years, no incident.

644
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,720
And also no other, for what I saw,

645
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,560
incident of a bird hitting someone

646
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,400
on a different bush gardens.

647
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,560
No, no.

648
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,920
But let's unpack this, what he has just said.

649
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,680
At least according to this story,

650
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,480
at least how he sees things today.

651
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,520
The goose did not hit Fabio,

652
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,840
and it did not hit the coaster car either.

653
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,000
The goose hit the camera.

654
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,160
Who put the camera there?

655
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,680
Bush gardens put the camera there.

656
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,600
And if we were able to see the footage from that camera,

657
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,960
we would see plainly no goose.

658
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,520
Now, he brings up another thing.

659
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,920
If the goose had just hit Fabio straight in the face,

660
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,880
that is an act of God.

661
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,960
And I started analyzing, I was looking at other,

662
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,880
I started looking at other articles and video,

663
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,120
and over and over again,

664
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,160
bush gardens representatives said,

665
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,640
act of God, act of nature, act of God.

666
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,480
Interesting.

667
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,520
Why did they keep pushing the story?

668
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,280
Did they have something to hide?

669
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,920
I'm Scott Gardner, this is Goose Jesus.

670
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,880
So they do get out there right away.

671
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,720
Interesting.

672
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,640
With that act of God thing.

673
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,480
Right.

674
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,160
It makes it not their fault.

675
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,760
But if it's a coaster car that they've,

676
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,200
and the, probably even if it's a coaster car,

677
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,120
or the camera, then that does make it their fault,

678
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:10,960
I believe.

679
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,780
Well, it's interesting though,

680
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,920
because wouldn't you still consider

681
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,260
if a goose hits the camera and the camera hits you,

682
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,760
that is still an act of God.

683
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,080
It's not like the camera,

684
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,000
the camera alone falling apart and hitting him

685
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,320
is them not securing it correctly.

686
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,280
Maybe.

687
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,680
And he also, I believe says that the camera split in half.

688
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,200
I forget if that was in that clip or not.

689
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,960
So I think there's something to be said for

690
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,800
if the camera was not installed properly,

691
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,640
or if there hadn't been a camera at all.

692
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,480
I think he could be wrong,

693
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,360
and I don't know the legalities here.

694
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,720
This is raising a lot of questions for me,

695
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,240
because broadcast quality cameras back then

696
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,520
were kind of built like a brick.

697
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,120
They were pretty, they weren't super delicate.

698
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,920
The other thing though is there's no way

699
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:07,920
Bush Gardens just has this quality of camera laying around.

700
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,600
I would assume they would rent it from somewhere,

701
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,320
or they would have a production,

702
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,480
a video production company they would work with.

703
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,880
But what is the story we've already talked about

704
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,880
with Robert Reed making sure that a camera

705
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,680
was mounted correctly on a roller coaster?

706
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,520
Remember this?

707
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,680
That was at King's Island.

708
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,320
At King's Island.

709
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,160
Robert Reed.

710
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,400
And if he had not been there to say

711
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,280
we have to run a test on this,

712
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,360
the camera would have killed the entirety

713
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,200
of the Brady Bunch.

714
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,240
Right, Robert Reed, Mike Brady,

715
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,520
at a promotional appearance at King's Island.

716
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,920
So I'm just saying he proved them wrong

717
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,040
that they hadn't done a good job

718
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,080
securing a camera back then.

719
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,200
I'm saying it's always possible.

720
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,720
Well, I think sloppiness is always possible.

721
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,400
I wanna know, yeah, whose camera is it?

722
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,000
Whose rig is it?

723
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,840
Oh, you're right.

724
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,840
Wait a minute.

725
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,000
This does not, they,

726
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,600
presumably Bush Gardens does not own this camera.

727
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,400
They aren't in the camera rental business.

728
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,720
Now they could have the rig.

729
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,040
I think it would make sense to buy a rigging device

730
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,480
to put on a roller coaster.

731
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,160
They'll use that over and over again

732
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,920
to promote different attractions, sure.

733
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,760
Yeah.

734
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,000
And maybe, and I don't think it's a rig problem.

735
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,960
I think it's a camera problem.

736
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,000
Either way, I do find this interesting

737
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,120
that the goose didn't hit Fabio.

738
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,880
I don't think any of it is goose blood.

739
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,120
I think that's all Fabio blood.

740
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:34,960
It's possible.

741
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,560
So I'm on this, dailypress.com,

742
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,680
and this is what they say.

743
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,320
They say, and it's pretty much what I was saying,

744
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,600
a goose who would have been nesting nearby

745
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,160
flew into the path of the speeding coaster car.

746
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,000
Best anyone can tell.

747
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:49,960
I'll give you this.

748
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,560
Best anyone can tell,

749
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,320
the goose hit the front of the car, breaking its neck.

750
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,880
The bird's carcass then flipped upward,

751
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,920
striking Fabio on the bridge of his nose

752
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,560
and causing a cut that would later require three stitches.

753
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,520
No bones were broken, but there was some swelling.

754
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,040
Turns out that was the extent of it.

755
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,000
He wasn't hurt too bad, and he was a good sport about it.

756
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
The women riding with him took some splatter,

757
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,320
which is what happens when a bleeding man

758
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,720
with an open wound rides in an open car at high speeds.

759
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,800
Wow, wow.

760
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,120
The fact that there's different,

761
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,560
we're hearing different stories from the American press,

762
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,560
from the Australian press.

763
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,520
Fabio is saying different things.

764
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,360
It's almost like you have to start analyzing now

765
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,080
who owns these papers.

766
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:33,160
What do they have to gain from Bush Gardens Williamsburg's loss?

767
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,400
Let me look, okay, let me do a little bit

768
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,760
of better looking now, because again, I'm a wrestling fan.

769
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,200
I know what a cut from-

770
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,880
It's funny that you brought all that up, yeah,

771
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,520
because a little part of a camera slicing his forehead

772
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,000
is exactly what would have happened to,

773
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,560
I don't know if that's what happened to Steve Austin

774
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,680
in that incident, but Vince is bleeding or whatever.

775
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,880
That's probably something similar to a camera piece.

776
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,600
Yes, I mean, I assume you have, it's glass especially.

777
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,680
They don't cut themselves with glass,

778
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,280
they cut themselves with a little razor blade,

779
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,160
at least usually.

780
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,600
There's been some death matches where they use glass.

781
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,760
We don't know if this was glass,

782
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,360
we don't know if it was like a filter.

783
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,520
What are those shade filters on cameras called?

784
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,200
Oh, I know, yeah, I know what you're talking about,

785
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,440
I can't think of the name.

786
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,080
There's this one picture with this woman right behind him

787
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,480
who's covered in his blood.

788
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,720
It's like, which is I feel like a comedy movie TV trope now

789
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,160
where you get like a spray, you know what I'm saying?

790
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,600
Oh yeah, the cannon blast, yes, yeah.

791
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,480
And she just looks so sad.

792
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,840
She doesn't even look like horrified,

793
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,600
she just looks sad and she's covered in Fabio's blood.

794
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,600
I mean, it looks like it's blood coming from,

795
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,440
it looks like it's maybe on his nose,

796
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,440
no, no, no, no, I take that back, it's on his cheek.

797
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,360
The swelling is on his cheek,

798
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,720
but perhaps there's a little cut on his nose as well,

799
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,360
because that does look like where the origin

800
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,120
of the blood is.

801
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,320
But you could see, like I guess if a goose hit,

802
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,480
the beak is sharp, the beak could cut you,

803
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,800
and I guess anything, hmm.

804
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,040
Well, the fact that we have two stories now

805
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,160
where it was not the goose,

806
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,440
and think about how big a goose is.

807
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,640
I think a goose would have done some serious damage.

808
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,960
I think he'd be way more bruised.

809
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,760
Well, I think for sure the goose wasn't full on

810
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,760
hitting him in the head.

811
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,280
That's what we always thought it was.

812
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,120
Yes.

813
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,160
But if the goose hit the front of the, let's, okay,

814
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,040
the theory that the goose hit the front of the car

815
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:33,720
then hit Fabio, it would be decreasing in speed, right?

816
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,960
Like if the goose was going full flight speed

817
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,680
and Fabio was coming down the hill at the same speed,

818
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,160
I think that would be a worse incident

819
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,720
than if the goose is slowed by a bounce.

820
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,560
It's a second bounce.

821
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,960
He's getting hit by a bounce, goose.

822
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,800
Mm-hmm.

823
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,880
I think we can all determine it is not,

824
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,080
he was not hit by a first bounce goose.

825
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,640
Fabio was not the first bounce.

826
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,560
Jason, you're advocating for it's a second bounce.

827
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,320
Well, I think the goose was a second bounce.

828
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,280
They talked to a bird expert,

829
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,520
and one of the news clips talks to a bird expert,

830
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,400
and they're like, well, they're lucky a goose is pretty soft.

831
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,120
I'm gonna go ahead and go reach out,

832
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,880
birds have hollow bones.

833
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,320
Mm, good point, good point.

834
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,400
So there's some softness added there.

835
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,760
But had he had the goose eaten recently,

836
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,240
that impacts the weight as well.

837
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,560
Yeah. If he's got like a full rat inside of him,

838
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,280
or if he's searching for food,

839
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,000
that definitely impacts the weight.

840
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,120
Wait, you're applying a scenario

841
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,640
where a goose eats a full rat. A goose eats a rat.

842
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,640
Yeah, goose eat, I know a lot about animals.

843
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,520
Now that's a story I wanna hear on NCR.

844
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,840
He eats rats, right?

845
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,160
What, I don't know, what do they eat?

846
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,560
Have a... Berries, nuts, leaves, I think.

847
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,400
Rats. Rats.

848
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,240
Maybe small things.

849
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,680
Have we seen... Why not?

850
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,600
They don't really have teeth.

851
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,880
Gulling a full rat.

852
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,240
Goose gulping a full rat.

853
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,560
It dissipates inside its body.

854
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,360
Yeah, there's no chewing involved.

855
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:03,240
Okay, I have a picture here of him bloody on the coaster,

856
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,480
and we should be able to see if the camera's there or not.

857
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,320
Mm-hmm.

858
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,360
Let me see here.

859
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,640
Well, the camera's there.

860
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,720
You can watch that in the AT footage.

861
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,000
But he said, what did he describe it as?

862
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,840
As it split in half?

863
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,680
Oh, wait a minute, you're talking about,

864
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,120
oh, after the...

865
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,400
Oh, wait, when it came back.

866
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,880
Right, I'm saying we should be able to see

867
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,840
if the camera looks like it was damaged.

868
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,680
I have a photo here,

869
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:28,360
but there's not a good high-res of it,

870
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,120
but he's bloody already,

871
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,240
and it's a pretty good view

872
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,200
if I can find a higher-res picture of it.

873
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,680
Mm-hmm.

874
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,280
Side issue, okay, we're unpacking that,

875
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,600
but I've just Googled do geese eat rats,

876
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,920
and yes, they do.

877
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,760
Perhaps babies might be a baby.

878
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,160
I don't know if they could gum up a full rat,

879
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,720
but according to poultrypages.com,

880
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,440
but now who's funding poultrypages?

881
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,760
Wait, so that's saying they could or they couldn't?

882
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,760
They do eat baby rats.

883
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,600
A baby rat, okay, yeah.

884
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,560
Well, they don't have to eat them, so gumming a baby.

885
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,360
Baby rat, I'll, yeah, that makes sense to me.

886
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,080
This is a fair compromise between us,

887
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,800
like baby poultrypages.

888
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,200
Jeff Bezos owns poultrypages now.

889
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,840
He purchased it.

890
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:16,200
The poultrypages employees write for $3 an article,

891
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,720
and it's a tough lie.

892
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,160
They aren't allowed to go to the bathroom.

893
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:24,040
There is Epstein Black Book entry for poultrypages,

894
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,040
so that adds another wrench.

895
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:26,880
This picture.

896
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,560
Poultrypages had so many positive articles about Epstein.

897
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,160
This picture is too low-res for me

898
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,280
to be able to tell what's wrong.

899
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,240
I mean, I have a picture of,

900
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,360
it's right here, that's it.

901
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,200
Okay.

902
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,040
I can't tell if.

903
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:41,880
Oh, it's so pixelated.

904
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,720
I know.

905
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,560
I'm trying to see if this.

906
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,520
This is a lot like, if you guys watch the documentary

907
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,640
about the guy getting acquitted of murder

908
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,920
because he was on camera in a Curb Your Enthusiasm episode.

909
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,760
Yes, yeah.

910
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,560
And they needed higher-resolution cameras

911
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,560
to prove his in it because the regular

912
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,920
stadium cameras weren't gonna do it.

913
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,760
This is where we're at.

914
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,480
We need better, and there were so many cameras

915
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,960
filming the whole thing.

916
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,800
Right.

917
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,240
Why have we only been given, this is what I'm asking,

918
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,880
why have we only been given the one AP feed,

919
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,080
and why have we never seen, if there was a camera,

920
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,160
maybe the camera was damaged,

921
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,160
so we wouldn't be able to see that footage.

922
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,680
Well, I think I, so,

923
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,320
okay, I think there's a couple reasons on this.

924
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:25,320
One, probably some local outlets had footage,

925
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:30,480
but the AP wire was probably gonna syndicate a lot of it.

926
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,840
Yeah.

927
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,280
That's where the more local, yeah,

928
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:37,760
like Fox, Fox in Las Vegas or whatever

929
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,600
is cutting down from the AP footage.

930
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:43,440
Yeah, so, I mean, this very quickly shifted

931
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,800
from minor celebrity, novel celebrity news

932
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,560
to the oddly enough section,

933
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,280
or in the case of the free press,

934
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:56,280
the newspaper A1, front page, front and center.

935
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,640
Why not?

936
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,160
For the local paper.

937
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,600
A reporter who was there wrote an article

938
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:06,080
about their experience,

939
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:11,080
and 20 years later, they did a retrospective last year.

940
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,040
Oh.

941
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,960
And he said, me?

942
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,440
I did okay that day.

943
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,080
I went to Busch Gardens with a story

944
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:19,120
that was slated to run on the bottom of page B2,

945
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,320
and I came back with an A1 centerpiece

946
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,520
that moved on the national wires.

947
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,080
That story would take third place

948
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,120
in that year's Virginia Press Association

949
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,840
judging for spot news stories.

950
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,680
So what was first?

951
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,560
To this day, I half-jokingly describe

952
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,280
it as one of the greatest days of my journalistic career.

953
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,120
So like, are you mad?

954
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,720
Fabio's suffering, and these poor women

955
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,600
getting blood on their face.

956
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,080
This is a death merchant,

957
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,280
this third place Virginia news winner.

958
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,680
If it bleeds, it leads.

959
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,360
If it bleeds, it leads.

960
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,160
He's praying, this guy's praying for the Iran War now.

961
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,560
He wants chaos.

962
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,400
Okay, so here's Fabio on a throne.

963
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,240
So this is the ceremony where he's got.

964
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,160
I've never seen this.

965
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,000
Yeah, that's him in the ceremony.

966
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,520
He's in like a throne, and he has a cape with the khakis.

967
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,280
Are they jeans?

968
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,120
Well, this is great to see.

969
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,480
All right, this is when it was just pure fun.

970
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,240
So here they're getting on the ride now.

971
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,520
First of all, I always thought he was always 50.

972
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,200
He's 38 years old here.

973
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,440
He's not far away from our ages.

974
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,480
It's like a different species.

975
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,120
There's still time, start growing your hair out.

976
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:22,960
And that's fair.

977
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,040
Start getting jacked.

978
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,120
I will get jacked.

979
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,960
I wanna take HGH.

980
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,000
I've been dying to.

981
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,440
I haven't seen this footage honestly.

982
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,280
Okay, so we're.

983
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,680
But this footage caught out the part

984
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,280
where there is a camera in the front.

985
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,120
I think they're avoiding.

986
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,640
So there's the drop from behind.

987
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,040
It should happen.

988
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:37,880
It should happen right there.

989
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,520
And it has happened here.

990
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,760
But there's that camera.

991
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,640
Where is it now?

992
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,480
Yeah, hold on.

993
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,600
Let's see if there's any wider shot from it.

994
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,840
He's obviously upset.

995
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,720
Everyone is like worried and confused.

996
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,560
There we go.

997
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,920
We should have it right here.

998
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,920
There's the camera.

999
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,080
Okay.

1000
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,240
I can't tell how much of it's there or not.

1001
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,440
It looks like most of it.

1002
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,600
I think it's still there.

1003
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,440
I have a still of that.

1004
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,440
It looks like it's still there.

1005
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,280
Does it not?

1006
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,160
It could have been the front.

1007
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,000
What do you call it?

1008
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,040
It could be a piece of glass

1009
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,520
flew out of the front or something.

1010
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,360
That's what I think.

1011
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,560
But maybe the entire thing wasn't hit.

1012
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,080
Right, because it looks like most of it is intact.

1013
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,400
Interesting.

1014
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,880
That's, I mean, that's pretty close.

1015
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,280
That's probably as good as we're gonna get.

1016
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,120
I think so, yeah.

1017
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,080
And we can analyze this frame by frame.

1018
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,360
Also, if you keep playing it,

1019
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:28,360
watch the faces of the children who have to see this.

1020
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,520
This is really a part worth watching.

1021
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,800
And the poor women next to him.

1022
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,040
The woman next to him is so distressed.

1023
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,720
The one over his left shoulder is the one

1024
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,760
who's really covered in blood and disturbed.

1025
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,960
Back and to the left.

1026
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,800
Back and to the left.

1027
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,000
Back and to the left.

1028
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,920
Because you would think if the whole camera came apart,

1029
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,000
and he said what, broken half?

1030
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,480
I mean. That's clearly bullshit.

1031
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,120
Like. That couldn't be.

1032
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,440
We may not be able to trust his part.

1033
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,800
It might be part of the lens

1034
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,720
or what's the plastic thing that kind of goes around.

1035
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,440
If you got hit in the head with a full camera.

1036
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,200
It was not the full camera.

1037
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,160
I think it was a slice.

1038
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,000
Yeah.

1039
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,840
Yeah.

1040
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,680
A little piece.

1041
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,160
I mean, it looks like a little piece of him hit it.

1042
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,800
Like, cause he has a bruise on his right cheek

1043
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,640
and he might have a cut on his nose.

1044
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:18,120
So a piece this big, you know, is probably what hit him.

1045
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:18,960
Yeah.

1046
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,040
And I'm making, you know, two inch, you know,

1047
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,520
with my fingers right now for the listeners.

1048
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,360
I think so.

1049
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,760
I think he has exaggerated this

1050
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,840
and I think he's ignored it

1051
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,840
so that he could give that scary safety warning.

1052
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:33,360
But I think can we all, are we all in agreement here

1053
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,080
that a goose did not hit Fabio in the face?

1054
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,360
Huh.

1055
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,160
I'm, it's probably right.

1056
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:46,160
Cause the chances, if this goose hits the roller coaster,

1057
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,400
it's like, it's not gonna hit.

1058
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,480
How would it hit straight up?

1059
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,400
It's not like a ping pong ball.

1060
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,200
It's not like a pinball.

1061
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,040
Yeah.

1062
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,720
If it hit, I mean, I guess if it hit,

1063
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,400
I'm trying to think of it.

1064
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,360
It just seems like so impossible.

1065
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,840
The whole thing obviously seems impossible

1066
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,800
but it actually seems like the bird

1067
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,480
should hit people more on these things.

1068
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,320
Yeah.

1069
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,880
It's almost weird it doesn't happen.

1070
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,720
Yeah.

1071
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,880
I'd also like to point out the issue of pond proximity.

1072
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,720
I watched a ride through of this ride

1073
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,520
and you were next to ponds the entire time.

1074
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,360
Yeah.

1075
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,560
It is not, it is with that, it is strange

1076
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,960
this doesn't happen more often

1077
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,720
but it was an accident waiting to happen

1078
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,680
and that's why Fabio issued that grave warning

1079
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,240
to all the children of Williamsburg.

1080
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,520
A person could be hurt or even a child.

1081
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,800
Even a child.

1082
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,920
Even a child.

1083
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,160
What I'm mainly getting at

1084
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,240
and I think we can split here

1085
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,880
and I think until we get every piece of footage,

1086
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,640
until we get all the camera feeds that were there,

1087
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,840
until we get security camera footage

1088
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,720
and until we get the holy grail,

1089
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,480
the footage from the camera mounted to the front of the car,

1090
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,520
we can't ever know the entire story.

1091
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,360
Uh-huh.

1092
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,960
There's one important piece to me.

1093
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,800
Yeah.

1094
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,040
And that is this.

1095
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:01,080
By the time this story was filtered through the media,

1096
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:04,080
by the time it made it to the late night comedians

1097
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:09,080
of the world, the take clearly was Fabio,

1098
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,680
who is a big lunk of a man.

1099
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,520
Yeah.

1100
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:18,520
That his huge dumb head was of such girth

1101
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,760
that it shattered a goose into pieces.

1102
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,960
Am I correct that this was kind of the feeling and the feel?

1103
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,000
Yeah. Kind of.

1104
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,160
I mean, yeah, the late night hosts had a field day with it,

1105
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,920
but it's even the newspaper articles are so mean

1106
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,880
and condescending.

1107
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,800
Yes, yeah.

1108
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,000
Even more so.

1109
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,720
You expect it from the comedians.

1110
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,400
That's their bread and butter.

1111
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,320
Jay Leno, what did Jay Leno say?

1112
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,680
A collision between bird brains.

1113
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:48,840
How dare you, sir.

1114
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,680
He also said,

1115
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,360
bookstores are now carrying the Autobahn field guide

1116
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,760
to birds stuck in Fabio's head.

1117
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,680
But the.

1118
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,520
That's so strange.

1119
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,880
By the way, what's playing right now is more raw footage.

1120
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,680
Yeah, this is what he's saying.

1121
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,720
I'll keep an eye on this.

1122
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,720
Yeah, yeah, I'm not saying it's.

1123
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,560
Chatting.

1124
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,200
Now I believe, am I correct that Kevin Eubanks

1125
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,200
then added that's cold Jay?

1126
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,320
I mean, I can't.

1127
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,160
That's not documented.

1128
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,040
I can't account for that.

1129
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:21,920
I'd have to get out my complete Jay Leno Tonight Show box set.

1130
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,120
500 DVDs.

1131
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,360
I think I might buy it.

1132
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,200
Yeah.

1133
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:26,840
All right.

1134
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,320
He's about to take off.

1135
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,880
Take a look up the LA Times article about this.

1136
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,840
I think it's the worst, the worst offender.

1137
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,160
I mean, the headline alone,

1138
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:40,040
Fabio survives goose encounter, but take a gander at his honker.

1139
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:41,760
All right.

1140
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,840
So we do have a good view of the camera before right there.

1141
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,000
Which what footage is that?

1142
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,200
What's the source of this footage?

1143
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:51,240
This is CBS six video vault, March 30th,

1144
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:54,120
raw video of bird bloodying Fabio at Busch Gardens.

1145
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,480
OK, it's from the CBS.

1146
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,120
Now he's back.

1147
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:59,000
It cuts out some of the middle is really where it lies.

1148
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,120
So this one cut out.

1149
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:03,400
It's certainly not a shattered camera that much we can we can tell.

1150
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:07,080
I'm just saying I have some sympathy for this man.

1151
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,600
Sure. Because I always viewed the coverage of this

1152
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,840
as criticism of him for having too big of a head.

1153
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,160
Yes. This guy got so stupidly jacked and dares to be a celebrity.

1154
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:22,240
And then it was bound to happen

1155
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,120
that he was going to blow a goose to Kingdom Come.

1156
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,080
Yes. Big Lunk Melon.

1157
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,240
But that is not what happened.

1158
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,240
Here's some camera.

1159
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,200
It's the same sort of footage.

1160
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,240
Look at this. His head is not much higher than these girls.

1161
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,600
No, he said comfortably in the seat.

1162
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:42,120
Fabio, I think anyone in the center, this could have happened.

1163
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:47,320
Yes, Fabio. I mean, the IP, the viewfinder is still comfortably on the camera.

1164
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,920
I can see that clearly.

1165
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,000
Mm hmm. I don't know.

1166
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,600
Maybe a piece of it.

1167
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,800
He didn't lose his watch.

1168
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,160
We can see this.

1169
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,480
He sells his watch. His wristwatch is still there.

1170
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,280
Any any other thoughts from the media, Jason?

1171
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,840
Well, the L.A. Times.

1172
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:06,440
I'll just read their lead because it's it's a good example.

1173
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,840
Duck Duck Goose.

1174
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:11,040
The laws of physics are so mysterious.

1175
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:14,560
We always assume that if we were traveling 73 miles per hour

1176
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:18,240
and collide it with, say, a small bowling ball, we'd be dead.

1177
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,720
So and they go on.

1178
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,680
They talk to a physics professor, Roger McWilliams, a physics professor

1179
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,320
at UC Irvine.

1180
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:30,080
He attributed Fabio's survival to momentum transfer.

1181
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:35,080
Quote, since the goose is mushy, it could squash and diffuse the impact

1182
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,680
like a crush zone in a car, he said.

1183
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,800
However, if it had been a brick, Fabio would be the crush zone.

1184
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,000
This is fascinating.

1185
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,480
But why would a brick be flying in the path of?

1186
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,080
A goose.

1187
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,560
If somebody had thrown it, if a goose had dropped a brick.

1188
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,440
This is the best footage so far of seeing it up close, because this is slow mowing.

1189
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,800
Yeah, it's very clear.

1190
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:04,160
And it's very clear that the most majority of the camera, at least, is intact.

1191
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,160
You can see the eyepiece.

1192
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,400
You can see the top of it.

1193
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,640
And this is some yellow tape seemingly all over.

1194
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,320
Is that a microphone like duct tape down?

1195
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:16,240
But still, why is that footage not available anywhere?

1196
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:20,760
And I think the answer is Bush Gardens Legal squashed it.

1197
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,320
They have the tape. They threw it in a pond as soon as this happened.

1198
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,960
See, I know the problem with that is that I did read that Bush

1199
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,560
Gardens panicked after this.

1200
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,280
Yeah, they don't want they did not want this.

1201
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,400
They don't want that new ride.

1202
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,880
I think it was their first.

1203
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:36,240
So Bush Gardens owns that footage.

1204
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,960
Yeah. But even if the camera didn't break apart,

1205
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,440
Bush Gardens doesn't want that getting out.

1206
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,800
No, because it would be graph.

1207
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,800
So both ways is the motive for both of the things would be true.

1208
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,960
Even if the camera didn't break apart, they're like,

1209
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,120
we're not releasing the footage of a bird hitting him in the head.

1210
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,240
Oh, yes, no matter what.

1211
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,640
Well, let's also keep in mind the manufacturer.

1212
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:00,480
This was the first BNM hyper coaster.

1213
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,560
They probably don't want footage out there of like this is our first hyper

1214
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,480
first giant coaster.

1215
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,800
And I relearned that hyper coaster is higher than 200 feet.

1216
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,520
Giga coaster is higher than 300 feet.

1217
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,280
OK. Huh.

1218
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,560
So it's a hyper. It's a hyper, not a giga.

1219
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:18,800
Yeah, this is 19.

1220
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,920
I think this is from April 16th, 1999.

1221
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:24,120
This is when Fabio warns of roller coaster danger. Yeah.

1222
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,920
So if this is a way to if I'm realizing if this had been a giga

1223
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:31,360
and it had been a brick, then Fabio would have been this mega crush zone.

1224
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,800
Oh, it was for sure. It would have been the crush zone there.

1225
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,400
Here's another another thing in the L.A.

1226
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,000
Times or this one. I'm talking about the meanness.

1227
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,600
Another scientist, Ronald J.

1228
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:45,920
Stern of UC Irvine, wondered if Fabio's physique was a factor.

1229
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,080
Does he have a thick skull?

1230
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:52,800
Stern asked by his profession, that might be the case.

1231
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,800
What are you doing, man?

1232
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,320
Well, what are you doing?

1233
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,560
Why are you being that's cruel?

1234
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:04,360
I'm defending against the idea that his brawn caused this in any way.

1235
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,760
It's not OK. It is jealousy.

1236
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,680
Yes. Everyone wants to look like him.

1237
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,960
That guy wishes he was on romance novel covers. Yes.

1238
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,640
He wishes he showed up ironically in some celebrity

1239
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,400
fit club type thing once every year and a half.

1240
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:23,520
It does feel like that was the 90s was like, you know, fuck Fabio.

1241
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,760
He's jacked and handsome.

1242
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,080
Yeah. And like whatever.

1243
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,960
He's not the most I don't know how.

1244
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,800
Maybe he's smart guy. I don't know.

1245
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,800
But I looked up Fabio accused there was nothing.

1246
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:37,280
It doesn't seem like he's got any things going on that are bad.

1247
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,400
No, I don't think so.

1248
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:43,040
Now I feel a little bit less bad for him because he does go on Fox News

1249
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,200
every once in a while. All right.

1250
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,080
Maybe he's a top supporter.

1251
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:49,760
Well, he hasn't talked about Trump much, but he's talked about how California

1252
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,040
is going to shit because of liberalism.

1253
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:56,760
Oh, OK. And about like his madness out there and Jerry Brown.

1254
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,720
He has let the criminal out and the rapist is on the street.

1255
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,720
He's for sure a Trump supporter.

1256
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,120
Yeah. This is one of these stories, by the way, side note,

1257
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:07,640
had the strangest premise where Tucker Carlson setting it up and saying like

1258
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:12,440
you know, Hollywood has always been a promised land for

1259
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:19,080
buff Europeans from Arnold's to Jean Claude Van Damme to Dolph Lundgren.

1260
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:21,400
It seems like half the continent moved here.

1261
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:24,880
But now things are with the rise of liberalism.

1262
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,560
Like, OK, those are three good examples.

1263
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,560
Name one more.

1264
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:33,240
Your premise is that because of liberal Jerry Brown,

1265
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:36,040
things are tough for brawny Europeans.

1266
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:39,880
You'll be saying I can't believe it's still a state.

1267
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:48,040
All right. So anyway, he hasn't there's no me too yet about him,

1268
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:54,160
but he for sure likes Trump and he's probably I think he probably sucks.

1269
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:57,920
Probably not a great guy, but he's not I don't think he there's no me too.

1270
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:01,800
There's no Q. There was no like, yeah, he hasn't had to go away.

1271
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:05,480
And I just like him on. Sure.

1272
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:09,240
Well, these guys are just complaining that to pay more in taxes.

1273
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,560
And that is usually what it is. They've made a lot of money.

1274
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,960
Well, move to Williamsburg.

1275
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,360
Yeah, I'm looking through in there.

1276
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,560
I was looking through his.

1277
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:23,240
I assume you look through his IMDb and all of the times he's played Fabio.

1278
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:27,160
You're incorrect in that assumption.

1279
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,400
Actually, that seems like something you would just know off the top of your head.

1280
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,400
I don't. Yeah, I don't have a lot of that.

1281
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,640
Go for it. I mean, OK.

1282
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,880
So just this is a little this is a little snippet.

1283
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,640
Tell me if you want the music, by the way, or if you just want to freestyle.

1284
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:42,080
Give me the music. I think the music.

1285
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,400
Yeah, let me assume. Let's continue the investigation.

1286
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,640
I'll do a little improv off the top of my head to intro this.

1287
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:51,040
It turned out Fabio had been in a lot of different projects.

1288
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,960
Builders himself, Fabio credited as Fabio.

1289
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:58,120
Let me list a few of them for you now.

1290
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:02,160
The crew TV series, 1995, Fabio playing Fabio,

1291
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:08,880
Jill Sebul, I Kissed a Girl, short film, 1995, Fabio as Fabio,

1292
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:13,480
1996, Spy Hard, Fabio playing Fabio,

1293
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:18,000
the movie, Eddie, 1996, Fabio,

1294
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,120
would be going for Fabio, I believe so.

1295
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:26,800
I should double check that step by step TV series, 1997, Fabio playing Fabio,

1296
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:32,000
2000, Dude, Where's My Car, Fabio playing Fabio.

1297
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:36,400
Zoolander, 2001, Fabio playing Fabio.

1298
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,000
And I could go on like that.

1299
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,160
It was then that I started to wonder, was all of this

1300
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:49,000
just a contrived publicity incident in order to let him stock up on more cameos?

1301
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,880
How many times could Fabio possibly play Fabio?

1302
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:55,880
Did he, like a roller coaster that was coming back to the station,

1303
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:58,280
feel like his career was losing steam?

1304
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,280
I'm Scott Gardner. This is Goose Chase.

1305
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:07,080
I'm seeing Hollywood Sex Wars 2011, Fabio plays Fabio.

1306
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:11,360
Is he in the hologram theater anywhere?

1307
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,680
Alki David's hologram theater?

1308
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:13,600
Oh, that's a good question.

1309
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:17,040
He's in Sharknado 5, Global Swarming.

1310
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,240
Fabio. Oh, OK.

1311
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,840
Man, that's random as hell.

1312
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:21,960
It's always funny.

1313
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:26,080
He, you know, here's what looks to be his like longest running role.

1314
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:27,960
He was on the show Acapulco Heat.

1315
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:31,000
Yes. And he was Claudio on Acapulco Heat.

1316
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,760
So he was playing a different character.

1317
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:35,960
Claudio.

1318
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,920
Fabio is Claudio.

1319
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,640
I recently discovered is available on Amazon.

1320
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:41,840
I'd never heard of it before.

1321
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:47,120
And when the credits came up and revealed that Fabio was the discovery

1322
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,560
that Fabio was in the show was extremely exciting.

1323
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:50,760
Yeah. I have to read that.

1324
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:53,480
Acapulco Heat is one of those where it's an acronym.

1325
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,040
It's H-E-A-T.

1326
00:51:55,040 --> 00:52:00,800
And that stands for Hemisphere Emergency Action Team.

1327
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:07,480
You know, models and photographers posing as anti-terrorism.

1328
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:11,760
On the occasion when on the occasion when I have a meeting in Hollywood

1329
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,480
and I try to throw out ideas of like stuff because, you know,

1330
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,200
everything's garbage and it's a repeat of something.

1331
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:20,120
I'm going to add Acapulco Heat to the conversation.

1332
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:22,080
Let's bring Acapulco Heat back.

1333
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:25,120
Who's our who's who would take over as Claudio?

1334
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,400
I think we got to bring him back.

1335
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:30,440
It can only be him like James Earl Jones is Mufasa.

1336
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:34,240
Well, you always bring back one from the old one as a mentor.

1337
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,320
Oh, yeah. Well, we got Claudio and Claudio Junior.

1338
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,760
Who's Claudio Junior now?

1339
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:39,840
Who's Claudio Junior?

1340
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:44,400
I mean, I want to say Momoa is too big for this, but maybe a lure

1341
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:49,000
of continuing the Claudio Claudio part would be enough.

1342
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:50,480
That's interesting.

1343
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,760
Money probably wouldn't be the money wouldn't be great.

1344
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:56,040
Right. I haven't watched a little bit.

1345
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,040
Maybe the way I got it.

1346
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:01,760
What if Claudio's son isn't like Claudio?

1347
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,280
So it's a conflict.

1348
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:07,360
Oh, what if Claudio's son is played by Jason Sheridan?

1349
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:12,160
Well, I love the word, you know,

1350
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:15,600
and you can turn then you can turn Fabio from a right wing guy

1351
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,120
into a left wing guy. Yeah.

1352
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:20,480
So you'll be you'll rub off on him on set.

1353
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,360
Dad, Claudio, I give him the music.

1354
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,440
This is going to be the speech.

1355
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,400
Not quite appropriate.

1356
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:32,280
Is this my speech to Fabio or am I in character as Claudio Junior?

1357
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:35,480
You are off. You are on set, but you're not doing the scene.

1358
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:40,600
You're explaining to Fabio that he's wrong about his views, his political views.

1359
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:48,400
You know, from your it's almost like you sit on Mount Olympus, Mr.

1360
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:54,080
Fabio, and from up there, it can be hard to look down and see

1361
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:58,520
so many people suffering when you are doing so well.

1362
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:04,080
And, you know, you you can be part of the solution, not part of the problem.

1363
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:06,880
You know, I just think a better world is possible.

1364
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:11,760
You know, I see what you're saying, Jason.

1365
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:18,040
That's why I think the first season of Acapulco Heat 2.0 needs

1366
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:22,560
needs to come to terms with the chaos that the original Acapulco

1367
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:28,240
Heat team caused, overthrowing governments, assassinating heads of state.

1368
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,960
You know, I see your point, Jason.

1369
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,440
I could not.

1370
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:37,320
I could not have a finer actor playing my son.

1371
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:42,080
They hug a tender hug.

1372
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:44,480
Hey, can I have a bite of your hot dog?

1373
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:52,040
You know, I haven't really eaten today.

1374
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:55,520
And I just look really good.

1375
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,080
OK, all right.

1376
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,640
Take a bite from the other end.

1377
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:00,680
Hey, all right.

1378
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,040
I thought you were an action description.

1379
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:04,400
And then a goose flies in,

1380
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:09,920
a goose flies in, steals the hot dog, does a loop around and I kill that.

1381
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:13,200
No, no ping pongs off Fabio's head into Jason's head.

1382
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,360
Well, I had but I see.

1383
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:17,560
Oh, you see it coming.

1384
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,680
I deliver the you get ahead of it.

1385
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,000
Jason kills a goose.

1386
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,640
By the way, we should say, you know what?

1387
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:25,800
Sad, the goose died.

1388
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,080
I don't want a goose to die.

1389
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:28,800
Oh, yeah. No matter what.

1390
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,480
Yes, it didn't.

1391
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,960
Oh, really? You're a complete goose truther.

1392
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,200
Yeah, maybe not.

1393
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,440
So you think maybe it was all camera.

1394
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,280
We should say what we all think happened now.

1395
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,960
What is our official guess of what happened?

1396
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,320
And then we'll have to obviously do Fabio to to figure out.

1397
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,200
We get all of these camera feeds. Right.

1398
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,320
From our new connections at the AP.

1399
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:53,480
Does anyone because we know we get e-mailed from time to time from people.

1400
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:57,920
Does anyone work at a bush gardens that is listening right now?

1401
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:01,160
Is there a dusty, poorly organized media library?

1402
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,800
Yeah. There's a Zapruder tape.

1403
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,320
Get into the vault.

1404
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,400
Hack the vault. Hack the vault.

1405
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,320
I mean, I would think at this point, they're not like so worried about this.

1406
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,680
So maybe it's the tapes lying around.

1407
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:17,360
What if they get into the vaults and then open a drawer

1408
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:20,600
that says super top secret don't open.

1409
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:25,400
And then inside is another drawer mega super please under threat of death.

1410
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,400
Do not open.

1411
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,800
And then they open that drawer and inside is the goose.

1412
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,840
Oh, my God. The dead goose.

1413
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,400
No, no, no. He's alive. Whoa.

1414
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,120
They've been keeping him under his control.

1415
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,280
They've been keeping the goose artificially alive.

1416
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,800
Is the how long do geese live?

1417
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,680
Probably depends on how many rats they eat.

1418
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,680
But they've been like pumping the goose full of like steroids

1419
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,720
and nutrients to keep it alive.

1420
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,640
Yeah. Just so like no one can.

1421
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:55,960
So it doesn't talk. So it doesn't talk.

1422
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,160
I mean, I don't know how it would.

1423
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:00,800
Well, goose might have come.

1424
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:03,360
It might have returned to the scene of the crime and then just kind of done

1425
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:07,800
circles around the coaster and squawked and squawked as if to say, you know,

1426
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:10,480
there's there's smoke here. There could be fire.

1427
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,480
Yeah. If a pet psychic got a hold of it,

1428
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:17,200
then that would it would be curtains for Busch Gardens.

1429
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:22,720
He's describing a terrible memory, a memory of hitting a man's face.

1430
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,280
Wait, no, no, no.

1431
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:29,320
He's telling more hitting on the way to a man's face a camera.

1432
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,880
Wait, no, he's talking about being perched on the ground

1433
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:37,120
and watching a camera just become dislodged and then being pinned on him.

1434
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:40,880
No, because Busch Gardens employee swooping the goose up,

1435
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:44,160
covering it with fake blood and then saying, I found the goose

1436
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,760
ringing its neck, ringing its neck.

1437
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,240
Oh, no, it's dead. It's dead.

1438
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:50,520
It's definitely dead.

1439
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,760
Let's go take this to our incinerator.

1440
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:57,160
I suppose improperly meaning that they're really not keep them alive forever.

1441
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:00,480
I had some I teased earlier.

1442
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,080
I have some stuff that was happening in the world at the time.

1443
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:05,080
Oh, yeah. Could I get the music? Yeah.

1444
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,960
OK. All right.

1445
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,400
Jason Sheridan has the story.

1446
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,200
What does he?

1447
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:21,720
Spring of 1999 was already a crazy time

1448
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:24,200
for the state of the world.

1449
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:28,240
March 29th, the Dow Jones, Dow Jones industrial average

1450
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,960
gets above 10,000 for the first time ever.

1451
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:34,640
March 31st, 10 Things I Hate About You released into theaters.

1452
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:36,760
April 1st.

1453
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:41,680
None of it becomes a Canadian territory carved out of Northwest Territories.

1454
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:46,800
April 4th, Jack Ma pounds the company Alibaba.

1455
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,720
China's answered Amazon.

1456
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:56,120
Most importantly, April 3rd, Sam Kiska is born in Frankenmuth, Michigan.

1457
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,720
You go on to be the bass player of Greta Van Fleet.

1458
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,280
And.

1459
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:08,320
Well, motherfucker, just turn 20 was about to turn 21.

1460
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:12,600
Want to feel old bass player for Greta Van Fleet was born

1461
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,800
just after the Fabio Goose incident.

1462
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:19,360
So we haven't really looked into who were the Fabio babies

1463
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:23,360
who are the parents made love after seeing that news story.

1464
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,680
Who got the either word it like

1465
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:30,720
it needed the comfort needed of the comfort of a human body

1466
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,560
after being so shaken up by that incident or the perverse people

1467
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:36,840
who were happy that this happened to Fabio.

1468
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:38,800
And I bet it was the fucking journalists.

1469
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:42,760
I think with those with that blood lust, they turned it into literal lust.

1470
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,760
I mean, I feel alive.

1471
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:47,040
I've just written the best piece of my life.

1472
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:49,280
That was the best day of my life.

1473
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,640
Let's fuck.

1474
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:54,480
I think when years later, I think there's a third.

1475
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:57,320
There's a third category of housewife

1476
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:01,160
who is reading Fabio's romance novels already.

1477
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:04,320
Saw that saw the hunky man, saw him covered in blood.

1478
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:06,720
And imagine he was just in some sort of a pirate fight.

1479
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:10,120
Like imagine now seeing him in real life like he was in combat,

1480
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:13,040
like he is on the cover of many of his romance novels where he's on

1481
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,680
holding a woman on a pirate ship.

1482
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:16,920
Oh, sure.

1483
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:21,760
You know, it's a good little shipping we could do, actually, is the

1484
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:24,960
the goddess directly behind him.

1485
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:28,240
You got it like Charlie Sheen's goddesses.

1486
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:30,920
The first thing I think of when you say that.

1487
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:31,640
That's right.

1488
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:33,840
I didn't call him a goddess, did he?

1489
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:35,640
I believe he did. Right.

1490
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:37,120
Angel. I got so much energy.

1491
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:39,440
I got to call these angels.

1492
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,000
I got goose blood energy, man.

1493
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,280
I got Fabio blood energy winning.

1494
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:47,440
Yeah, he called him the goddess.

1495
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,680
Charlie called him the goddess.

1496
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:50,960
Yeah.

1497
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:55,120
Well, whatever you want to cut the you know, like the woman in the in the Roman

1498
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:58,760
drape behind him who was called the goddess from the.

1499
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,640
All right. The goddess.

1500
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,040
Because think about that.

1501
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:07,520
His he did potentially save by taking that blow, whether it was goose or camera.

1502
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,680
He did potentially save a woman.

1503
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:12,560
If there had been nobody there or a shorter person there.

1504
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:15,640
This is where we have to say his brawn was a good thing because it protected

1505
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:18,120
an innocent woman who just wanted to be part of the photo op.

1506
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:21,880
And so it's a little fun to think about them right after, like, are you OK?

1507
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:23,960
Right. No, but are you OK?

1508
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:26,360
Don't worry about me.

1509
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:27,840
I am more concerned with you.

1510
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:29,280
It does not matter.

1511
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:33,840
The you have one speck of goose blood on your face or maybe my blood.

1512
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:36,000
Let me wipe it off.

1513
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,760
And then that's such a tender process and becomes kind of like a ghost sequence.

1514
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:44,200
Yeah. It is funny, as soon as you were describing that before he said ghost,

1515
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:47,680
I thought, oh, it's like ghost, except for blood wiping off in that pottery.

1516
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:51,040
Have a paper cup of slice to cool down.

1517
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:56,520
That's something you would say to you, too.

1518
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:58,760
That's your fantasy of you working with them.

1519
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:00,600
Jason, have a paper cup of slice.

1520
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:07,640
Let's find somewhere private, perhaps the dry off station of Roman rapids

1521
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:12,280
and then the steam and the heat of the Roman rapids.

1522
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:16,320
Let us go enjoy the dining experience that in the mid

1523
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:19,840
90s was all the rage and theme parks, salad bars.

1524
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:24,080
Right. That's my memory of a lot of the parts.

1525
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:26,800
I think a lot of salad bars at the time.

1526
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:33,520
And he Armageddon style lovingly runs a cherry tomato up her chest.

1527
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:38,960
Then he removes her tunic

1528
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:43,000
and she removes his denim long sleeve shirt,

1529
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:45,280
thick long sleeve denim shirt,

1530
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,440
and then gives him the cape here.

1531
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,080
Oh, yeah. Where this.

1532
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:51,800
Hmm. You don't know how I'm going to keep going.

1533
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:53,720
I'm so excited now.

1534
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:57,960
Oh, do we know who was playing all of the goddesses?

1535
01:02:58,520 --> 01:02:59,920
Hmm. I don't think so.

1536
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,840
We should look at it like they're just employees actors or where they.

1537
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,720
Yeah. But garden employees.

1538
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:07,680
Like just like, come on, can you put the tunic on a casting call in?

1539
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:11,160
Because they're all very they're all sort of similar height and hairstyle.

1540
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:12,880
Oh, it seems kind of coordinate.

1541
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,840
A local casting call then, I guess.

1542
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,240
Yeah, that's that makes sense backstage.

1543
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:19,640
Yeah, you would have been checking the listings and backstage.

1544
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:23,680
They were all in a Williamsburg local performance of a funny thing

1545
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:25,720
happened on the way to the forum.

1546
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,760
So they brought the costumes themselves.

1547
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:31,600
Hey, I would say in this case, a really funny thing happened

1548
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:36,080
on the way to the forum at comedy tonight.

1549
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:39,360
Hey, that is up there.

1550
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:40,720
That's really you.

1551
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:43,280
Oh, boy. Any remaining thoughts about this?

1552
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:46,920
That, you know, how this is impacted

1553
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:49,320
or has remained in pop culture.

1554
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:55,120
Oh, I should say Dylan Sprouse of is he the one who's on

1555
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,480
Riverdale or to the other is Jughead.

1556
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:00,400
OK, that's not Cole or oh, I'm sorry.

1557
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:01,760
Yes, the brothers.

1558
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,320
Ah, fuck. I forget this.

1559
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:04,440
I'll look it up.

1560
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:06,120
I believe it was Dylan.

1561
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:10,360
Dylan Sprouse, formerly of Zach and Daddy and Big Daddy,

1562
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:15,360
did a Halloween costume where he was in kind of an open shirt.

1563
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:19,280
He had long blonde hair and he just like threw a bunch of blood on his face.

1564
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:22,000
Right. So that was a recent reprisal.

1565
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,640
Jason, you were saying, yeah, a friend of mine,

1566
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:28,320
Jesse Weinberg, a very funny comedian at UCB, an artist

1567
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:31,280
as sells a print.

1568
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:35,440
She drew a print and T-shirt of the the incident.

1569
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:38,720
Oh, he looks glorious.

1570
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:42,680
Buy online. Yeah, it's kind of it's an idealized version,

1571
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:45,880
you know, a dreamlike version.

1572
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,280
The goddesses aren't there.

1573
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:49,800
The goddesses aren't there. Yeah.

1574
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:53,120
You can find that at Jesse Weinberg, art dot Etsy dot com.

1575
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:54,480
Just a plug for her.

1576
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:57,200
Well, yeah, yeah, that that looks very cool.

1577
01:04:58,040 --> 01:04:59,000
I agree.

1578
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:03,960
And of course, Apollo's Chariot continues to run

1579
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:07,120
and in fact, celebrated its anniversary to celebrate

1580
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:10,480
the park served Apollo's Chariot birthday cake,

1581
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:14,960
purple kettle corn and giant Apollo's doughnuts in the England area,

1582
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:17,800
as well as a pineapple and berry waffle cone sundae,

1583
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:19,880
which was available at Roman Fries.

1584
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:21,120
You know, I think that's great.

1585
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:24,840
I think it's it's the place are getting really creative

1586
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:27,920
with some of their limited run food.

1587
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,640
And I like that.

1588
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:32,440
I know that was done. Oh, sorry.

1589
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:35,760
Team parks are getting more and more creative with limited run

1590
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:41,160
dining options, much with tied to the rise of Instagram

1591
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:44,000
and social media.

1592
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,880
But sometimes you can find a real winner in among them.

1593
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:50,440
Give it a shot.

1594
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:52,000
Why run from this history?

1595
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,120
Why not try a novelty dessert that looks like a goose

1596
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:58,160
exploded on Fabio's face?

1597
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,800
Cherry blood.

1598
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:03,320
A meringue goose

1599
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:05,800
and inside a chocolate rat.

1600
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,880
Why are they why are they running from their legacy? Embrace it.

1601
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:12,480
This ride shouldn't be called Apollo's Chariot.

1602
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:17,880
It should be called Fabio's Goose Wagon.

1603
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:21,960
You have a bit of a plus up on that.

1604
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:25,040
Is there a better if they were going to if they were just going to like

1605
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:28,080
because people are going on this and thinking this is right.

1606
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:31,160
Where it happened.

1607
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:35,160
There's a how we call it the crimson mask, Fabio's Crimson Mask.

1608
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:37,480
That's pretty good.

1609
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:38,600
Paint it red.

1610
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:41,240
There was that goose game, the video game where you played a goose

1611
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:44,240
and you went around and title goose game, untitled goose game.

1612
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,000
Yeah, probably get.

1613
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,960
So you want to put IP on it. Yeah.

1614
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:51,360
Fabio's Crimson Mask.

1615
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:55,400
And then at Halloween time, there's like some sinister.

1616
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:59,000
There should be a big animatronic goose that chases you red.

1617
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,080
They should use drone technology.

1618
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:02,000
Oh, that's good. Yeah.

1619
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:02,800
This incident.

1620
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:05,960
And it's kind of a demon goose who's following you around

1621
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:08,400
and trying to hit you and you wear a reindeer car.

1622
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:13,080
And you they you put on this like ponchos before and then they splatter on you.

1623
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,400
They could splatter blood from the front of the car.

1624
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,920
They blow a little like air cannon. Yeah.

1625
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:18,720
What about this?

1626
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:22,680
What if the line was like a temple of like an ancient god?

1627
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,200
Uh, and he he he's mad.

1628
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:28,360
You're there and you have to escape.

1629
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:32,400
So like you get looted in the car and you hear like, get out of my temple.

1630
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,480
And then real loud, you hear, huh?

1631
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:39,560
And then and then you are you go on it.

1632
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:41,640
Well, it's not a launch. That'd be great for a launch.

1633
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:44,120
Release the goose, release the goose.

1634
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:47,040
You have to get have a giant goose

1635
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:50,000
or like the the impression of a giant. Right.

1636
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:51,760
I've here's a plus up.

1637
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:54,520
You have some sort of red light that only happens.

1638
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:58,080
So you shoot water instead of blood because people want to get sprayed with fake blood.

1639
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:01,960
But the red light hits the car as soon as the spray happens.

1640
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:05,320
So it from your vantage point, it looks like red coming at you.

1641
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:07,400
That's really cool. They just flash it right then.

1642
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:11,400
If they can time it perfectly, then it makes it look like blood is about to hit you.

1643
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:13,080
Wow. But then it's not.

1644
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:15,280
And then when you are on the end of the ride, it's like red.

1645
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:18,120
And it makes it kind of look like you're wet with red blood.

1646
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:21,640
Geeze. And then a bunch of animatronic

1647
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:24,360
goddesses all applaud back.

1648
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:27,760
You made it out safely.

1649
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:30,160
That's good. Have sex in the dry off tent.

1650
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:33,880
Mm hmm. The chill out tent.

1651
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:35,200
This is a hell of a ride.

1652
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:37,760
Wow. A hell of a ride to to talk about this.

1653
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:42,480
Yeah, I think I didn't expect to start an episode about

1654
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:45,920
the Fabio getting hit in the face by goose and discover that possibly

1655
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:50,120
Fabio was not in the face, but I will go I will say I don't think he was.

1656
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:53,200
You don't think that? OK, yeah, let's let's sum up right now.

1657
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:54,720
What do we think happened?

1658
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:57,520
Well, huh? I'm so conflicted.

1659
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:01,640
I you know, a lot of articles about this looking back on it

1660
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:06,280
were very quick to point out that, like, you know, news moved a lot slower

1661
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:08,760
at the time. There wasn't the viral Internet.

1662
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:13,560
This is right before the like Internet, the world of the Internet really exploded.

1663
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:19,520
So people seeing this a lot on late night or local news or in newspapers.

1664
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:22,640
And yeah, I don't know.

1665
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:26,520
I think it's still there's still clearly a fog of confusion

1666
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:30,400
of something, even even these these trusted fact check

1667
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,600
sources at the time, like something.

1668
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:35,760
What does your heart say?

1669
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:36,640
Yeah, what does your heart say?

1670
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:39,640
My gut is I think all your heart and my heart.

1671
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:42,040
OK, fine. My heart.

1672
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:44,320
My gut is saying, let's get some.

1673
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:48,160
You're hungry for goose.

1674
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:50,760
You're going to get a goose to celebrate this goose.

1675
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:52,000
It's not Christmas.

1676
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,560
Christmas. Did you ever have Christmas goose? No. OK.

1677
01:09:56,520 --> 01:10:00,520
You're going to go buy a goose at butcher shop and then make Mike

1678
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:05,240
cook it for us. And I thought about getting.

1679
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:07,160
I can't believe it's not butter on the way over.

1680
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:10,280
But I realized, like, oh, then what just gets stuck with a tub of it?

1681
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,840
I know that's a good glaze, though.

1682
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:13,440
That's a good way.

1683
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:17,080
Oh, yeah. The tribute this incident is glazing goose.

1684
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:19,120
And I can't believe it's not butter.

1685
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:21,360
I think I could.

1686
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:26,880
I'm coming around more to the goose, hit the vehicle and then hit Fabio.

1687
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:29,920
Yeah, I think the camera.

1688
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:31,000
I don't know if it's him

1689
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,360
misremembering either on accident or on purpose.

1690
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:38,080
I think goose hitting the camera piece of camera hitting Fabio.

1691
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:40,240
I don't I just don't buy that.

1692
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:43,440
Huh? I think that a goose is big.

1693
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:47,760
So a goose to do the damage on his face

1694
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:52,080
would have had to like nick him more than full impact.

1695
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:54,040
Yeah, I think it barely touched him.

1696
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:58,440
If if if it's yes, if it's goose, it's it barely touches him

1697
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:00,800
because he is going to bruise here and a little cut.

1698
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:07,120
So it does make more sense that a goose hit and a couple pieces flew off

1699
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:09,720
bruising him and cutting him.

1700
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:13,000
Yeah, because I think if a goose hit his head,

1701
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:17,040
it would have done more. Yeah.

1702
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:23,040
Yeah. So I think probably a couple little pieces maybe fell off.

1703
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:25,800
He could have also been struck a little bit by the goose

1704
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:27,600
and a little bit by the camera.

1705
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:28,200
Could have been a mix.

1706
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,560
That's the extra.

1707
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:31,760
That's maybe the way to make everyone happy.

1708
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:36,840
But I think our listeners,

1709
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:40,120
uh, somebody's going to know more than we do.

1710
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:43,760
And I have a feeling we'll get some sort of inside source

1711
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:47,000
or report about this to really clear it up.

1712
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:50,880
So I'm officially guessing I'm going to officially guess

1713
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,240
it's a little piece of the camera was hit by the goose,

1714
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:57,680
hit him in the face, sliced, hit here and here

1715
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,040
because it only could have been a couple inches.

1716
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:01,360
You're right. I think your wrestling knowledge

1717
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:03,560
factors into the type of of bleed.

1718
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:05,160
Yeah. Nose here.

1719
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:06,840
You don't usually blade on the nose.

1720
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:08,280
It's usually on the forehead.

1721
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:09,520
That's kind of where he got hit.

1722
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:10,640
But the nose bleeds a lot.

1723
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:13,120
I remember in gym class when we were swimming,

1724
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:16,600
a kid had cut himself in the pool and didn't know it.

1725
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:19,560
And it was like right here, I think, on his like forehead and nose.

1726
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:22,800
And he got out of the pool and he had a full face of blood

1727
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:25,080
and had no clue.

1728
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:28,480
And everyone's like, ah, and he's like, what? Yeah.

1729
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:31,240
So like, and it didn't hurt or anything.

1730
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:36,240
So, yes, I think I think camera piece makes more sense, honestly.

1731
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:37,200
I'm full camera.

1732
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:38,600
I think we would have seen that footage.

1733
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:39,800
And you think no goose at all.

1734
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:41,360
And I just know what they were.

1735
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:43,040
I think the goose at the camera. OK, you think goose.

1736
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:46,040
I think I think no goose at Fabio, because I think it would have been

1737
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:49,840
more damage and I, you know, I'm more conspiratorial

1738
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:52,400
than I used to be in a post-epstein world. Right.

1739
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:57,000
And the fact that they rushed out and that all the spokespeople said

1740
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,120
act of God, they were really like push that.

1741
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:01,080
That feels like legalese to me.

1742
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:05,400
Yeah. And I just I call foul on this.

1743
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,400
Definitely legalese.

1744
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:10,040
I really could have laid into that like a newspaper report.

1745
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:12,040
I call foul.

1746
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:13,440
Well, I'll go back and edit it.

1747
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,280
So you had the song under it.

1748
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:19,200
Did they pay him for his silence or his agreement?

1749
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:21,280
Oh, interesting. Did he sue or anything?

1750
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:24,920
Yeah, like I think this was I think Act of God was a way to shut him up

1751
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:26,400
and get him to not sue.

1752
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,520
Right, because I bet he has to sign a contract

1753
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,000
because basically when you go into a theme park,

1754
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:34,560
all the tickets are essentially saying act of God.

1755
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:35,720
We're not responsible.

1756
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:38,520
Obviously, people do get sued and stuff for things.

1757
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:43,280
But there is some sort of like basic going in agreement

1758
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:46,120
that like, hey, if a bird hits you in the head, it's not our fault.

1759
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:48,240
I think they could have kicked him a little extra.

1760
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:49,760
They might have. Just as an apology.

1761
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:51,720
Very possible. Just as like a.

1762
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,000
They should have. Yeah.

1763
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,880
And whether or not it was an act of God, it is appropriate that it is

1764
01:13:57,720 --> 01:14:00,840
it happened on this ride that is about the gods.

1765
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:04,920
And I, you know, I you can.

1766
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:06,600
I don't want to read the whole thing.

1767
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,800
Although, well, here, you know what? Maybe with music.

1768
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:12,480
Yeah, yeah. This seems like a good way to to wind it down.

1769
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:13,880
Take us out. OK.

1770
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:18,680
Every morning, Apollo gets in his chariot and drives the sun across the sky.

1771
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:21,960
One morning, Apollo's son, a human named Faithion,

1772
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:25,840
asked to steer the chariot and take the steed and the steeds on the journey.

1773
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:29,320
The sun god has his doubts, but let his son take the reins.

1774
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:33,920
Faithion's journey starts fine, but the horses soon take control.

1775
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:37,960
The sun ventures too close to Earth and then too close to the heavens,

1776
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:40,160
scorching both realms.

1777
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:44,640
This was proof that no mere mortal could handle the power of Apollo's chariot.

1778
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:47,120
I'm Scott Gardner.

1779
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:48,680

Thanks for listening.

1788
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:13,880
Hi, everyone.

1789
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:17,520
Shortly after recording this episode, we reached out to some of our high

1790
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:20,000
ranking sources in the theme park world

1791
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:24,680
to get another perspective on the Fabio story.

1792
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:26,800
We're butting in with an update.

1793
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:30,520
This is we're now talking to you weeks from having recorded the other one.

1794
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:33,160
So so this is we're we're we're we're we're buttoning in.

1795
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:34,200
We're jumping ahead in time.

1796
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:38,480
And we heard from someone who was not just there

1797
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:41,880
that fateful day, but on the ride itself.

1798
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:44,400
Now they've asked for anonymity.

1799
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:47,920
So on the ride with the on the ride on on the train.

1800
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,560
Yeah, Fabio. So here they are now.

1801
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:52,400
I was there to say I've edited

1802
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:56,960
a little for anonymity and clarity and brevity sake.

1803
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:59,720
Here's what they had to say.

1804
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:04,120
I haven't heard anyone saying anything about a piece of camera.

1805
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:08,960
It was definitely a Canadian goose that hit his face and exploded on impact,

1806
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:12,240
which wasn't so good for the people in the rows behind him.

1807
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:15,040
You can see the innards on them in the photos.

1808
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:16,960
Ick the innards.

1809
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,440
The coaster used to have small lakes

1810
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:22,640
by the bottom where the geese would hang out.

1811
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:26,040
The park paved over the lakes in the hope that a freak accident

1812
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:27,960
like that wouldn't happen again.

1813
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:31,320
There was a camera mounted on the front car,

1814
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:35,040
but that was intact before, during and after.

1815
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:41,680
Fabio was definitely in shock and just kept saying a bird over and over again.

1816
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:43,680
Whoa. Huh.

1817
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:48,240
So now we're thinking this this count contradicts all the Fabio story.

1818
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:50,960
The recent Fabio story.

1819
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:53,840
Yes. But which what doesn't seem like it was always his story.

1820
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:54,920
No. Yeah.

1821
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:58,080
In the day after the event, it seemed like the bird.

1822
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:02,480
Who got to him in the time from that Fox News interview to the time it happened?

1823
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:05,480
Someone was trying to push a camera breaking agenda.

1824
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:08,840
Yeah, maybe so. Is there some other party here?

1825
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:12,880
Like a PETA or something they don't want to put like, give the goose a bad name.

1826
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:14,800
Mm hmm. Huh.

1827
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,720
Yeah. What would be the reason?

1828
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:19,600
Or somebody trying to prove that cameras are dangerous?

1829
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:22,440
Somebody has a problem with cameras.

1830
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:24,600
The estate of Robert Reed, perhaps.

1831
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:27,840
Mm hmm. Trying to bolster his story.

1832
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:30,640
That's right. Famously, no one has believed. Right.

1833
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:35,360
So wait, this person was on this is one of the the nymphs, the goddesses,

1834
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:37,640
the goddesses, because that's all that was on the train.

1835
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:40,560
And Fabio, we've spoken to one of the goddesses now.

1836
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:43,640
Yeah. Wow. Wow. OK.

1837
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:46,400
This is interesting, because honestly, I think I was hoping this would just

1838
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:47,480
completely clear it up.

1839
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:50,400
But now I have more questions about Fabio and his motivation.

1840
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:54,400
Yeah. Yeah. That's that's the next person we have to get to.

1841
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:56,840
Could it also just be memory?

1842
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:01,600
Could it also just be like he has convinced himself for like the haze of memory?

1843
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:04,000
You know, it's not as fun to think it's memory.

1844
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:06,800
Yeah. OK. But you're probably right.

1845
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:10,480
OK. It probably wraps this up.

1846
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:13,080
Probably didn't realize what was happening because he got hit in the head with a goose.

1847
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:15,080
So, you know.

1848
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:19,640
So that could have made him add false lenses in his way.

1849
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:23,360
Maybe he thinks, you know, what he probably thinks is like, I am so powerful,

1850
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:26,440
a goose would never be able to do damage to me like this.

1851
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:31,280
It must have been like a hard piece of the camera that would wound a Fabio.

1852
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:33,680
But a bird high laugh at a bird.

1853
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,640
That's true. Would not cut me.

1854
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:39,320
But now you've got me thinking the Anheuser-Busch people could have gotten to him.

1855
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:42,880
You think those people told him to say the camera?

1856
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:46,000
No, that doesn't make sense because they wanted the bird narrative, as we discussed.

1857
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:49,480
We've just we talked about this a couple of weeks ago, so I've forgotten exactly.

1858
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:52,960
But they wanted the bird because it was an act of God.

1859
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:55,200
They didn't want the camera because then they would be liable.

1860
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:56,040
And they're liable. Yeah.

1861
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:58,480
So the Bush people would that would be not their motivation.

1862
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,960
Hmm. It's hard to know who got to who.

1863
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,560
Right. The goose board, the camera board.

1864
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:07,440
There's a lot of boards at stake.

1865
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:09,960
And this has been 20 years since.

1866
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:14,440
So yeah, of time for like funds to be risen to give to Fabio.

1867
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:19,120
I don't want to go accusing one of the goddesses of having a false memory.

1868
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:21,920
No. All story. They have less to gain, I think. Right.

1869
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:25,880
Fabio is the one as we discussed, a sort of a right wing guy.

1870
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:28,640
Maybe he can be more easily manipulated.

1871
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:31,200
Do you remember what show he's been on on Fox News?

1872
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:35,320
Can we tweet at a Fox News like Judge Carlson? Tucker Carlson.

1873
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:39,040
Can we tweet at Tucker Carlson next time he's on to ask about this?

1874
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,640
Or Judge Napolitano?

1875
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:44,200
Any of the celebrities on the judge?

1876
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:46,080
Jeannie Judge Jeannie.

1877
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:47,440
Any of Steve Doocy?

1878
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:51,320
Any of the stars of Fox News could ask Fabio about this?

1879
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:54,160
Yeah. To clarify.

1880
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:57,120
That would be nice and show old clips and but, you know,

1881
01:19:57,120 --> 01:20:00,440
but they're going to also going to want to keep his story intact.

1882
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:03,520
Because he's their proof that California is going to shit

1883
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:07,280
and that it's tough out there for a European hunk.

1884
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:07,880
Yeah.

1885
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:10,000
California didn't used to be in the 80s.

1886
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,160
That's true. The 80s was the time for European hunks.

1887
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:15,040
So we need to really maybe we need the other.

1888
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:17,480
We need Michael Moore to bum rush him or something.

1889
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:21,640
OK. Well, maybe after the election, we'll get to we'll take care of this.

1890
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:24,000
Sure. Rather solve it sooner than later.

1891
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
You know, you're right.

1892
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,040
Get him off the trail. Get him off the campaign trail.

1893
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:30,240
Get everyone into the room to solve the Fabio problem.

1894
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:34,040
Or you know what? Let's just is he on Twitter?

1895
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:36,680
Oh, good question.

1896
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:38,120
We'll look into that. Look into that.

1897
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:39,880
Fabio, too, will be coming.

1898
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:43,120
I just wish I knew about all this during the I don't know that it happened.

1899
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:45,880
I assume he came in for a Funny or Die general meeting.

1900
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:47,960
And that would have been my chance.

1901
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:49,800
He didn't do a video, though.

1902
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:51,400
I think he did with John Daly.

1903
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:52,800
Oh, yes.

1904
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:56,920
But I don't know that he did a like, well, but he could have.

1905
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,600
They all did all of the like living joke people.

1906
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:01,480
Hasselhoff came in. Yes. Right.

1907
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:05,000
He passed out masks of himself.

1908
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:06,600
So why wouldn't Fabio have?

1909
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:07,760
I don't know.

1910
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:10,040
Will we ever get in front of Fabio again? I don't know.

1911
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:13,840
Do we invite him on to talk about just a ride that he likes?

1912
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:17,440
So Space Mountain, Space Mountain.

1913
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:19,640
I'm excited to talk to you about Space Mountain.

1914
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:21,200
You go flying as if through space.

1915
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:25,480
I don't like the one that put Star Wars ghosts in there.

1916
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:30,400
I don't like the ghost you take away from just the thrill of what even is.

1917
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:31,560
It goes galaxy.

1918
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:33,080
Ha ha. All right. Very fun.

1919
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:34,480
All right. Now, cut the shit.

1920
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:35,920
What really happened that day?

1921
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:39,520
And you don't get to leave this apartment until so many fucking ways.

1922
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,080
You don't know which way is up.

1923
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:44,680
He stands up and he beats the shit out of all three of us and leaves.

1924
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:47,280
You can't beat up the truth, Fabio.

1925
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:50,160
Does Fabio he can be?

1926
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:53,160
He's strong, but is he like a he's not a violent guy, though.

1927
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:54,800
He's a lover. So maybe I'm wrong.

1928
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:57,080
Maybe he wouldn't beat us. Maybe he wouldn't make love to us.

1929
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:00,800
He wouldn't fight us.

1930
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,920
You would fuck up.

1931
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:05,880
No, I just maybe.

1932
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:08,400
Yeah, maybe. I guess we couldn't handle that raw power.

1933
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:09,680
Probably not. No.

1934
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:13,200
Either way, he's going to leave us all like bloodied on the ground.

1935
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:16,760
And then if anybody asks what happened, you'll say it was a camera.

1936
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:24,560
If you have any for everything, if you out there have any theme park secrets,

1937
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:29,760
the real dirt, the raw intelligence, feel free to reach out.

1938
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:32,720
Yeah. And we'll certainly keep you anonymous.

1939
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:34,240
I should set up a signal.

1940
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:38,120
Wouldn't that be very funny where the one podcast, the ride show with signal,

1941
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:42,000
the encrypted messaging app journalists speak to their sources.

1942
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:44,280
I'm more reporter Jason stuff. Yeah, I know.

1943
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:45,520
You're talking. I had no clue.

1944
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:47,080
I thought you meant like a bat signal.

1945
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:48,720
I thought you meant like a thing in the sky.

1946
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:49,600
It essentially is.

1947
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:53,840
But if you ever look at a journalist like, you know, Twitter accounts,

1948
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:55,840
they have their signal numbers in there.

1949
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:57,560
That's why you're a cub reporter.

1950
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:58,840
Yeah, you can't resist the cut.

1951
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:02,920
You can't deny the cub reporter role that you've set yourself up for.

1952
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,480
Sure. Are there elections in Anaheim this year?

1953
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:08,240
That's a good question.

1954
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:09,360
Don't know. Let's take a look.

1955
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:10,200
We'll take a look.

1956
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:14,160
There's more. There were it wasn't all the city council seats, right? Right.

1957
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:16,360
That was up. That's what Bloomberg's running for now.

1958
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:19,120
He's got to go to got to take it somewhere.

1959
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:23,840
We'll spend two hundred million dollars to get on the city council of Anaheim.

1960
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:25,280
All right.

1961
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:26,280
Well, all right.

1962
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:27,440
Thanks for buttoning in with that.

1963
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:30,840
Boy, this story just gets goes deeper and deeper and deeper.

1964
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:31,840
Wild. All right. Bye.
