1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
FOREVER!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
DOG!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Warning, the following podcasts may contain

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
pie-based social media,

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
the dream of flying with the Pteranodon,

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
lightsaber patio accessories,

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and lots of talk about Mickey Mouse's special little outfits.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
All that, plus some nautical chat about the new cruise ship, the Disney Treasure,

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
with Kitra Remick and Peter Serretta from the YouTube channel Ordinary Adventures.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Let's set sail on today's podcast, The Ride!

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a theme park podcast hosted by three men

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
who take all their pills with water from a souvenir sipper.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
My name is Mike Carlson, joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's funny, I do have a souvenir sipper that I bought online

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
that I didn't actually buy in the theme park.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I bought a universal souvenir sipper because it had a big pharaoh's lighthouse on it.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And how often do you see lighthouse merchandise now?

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You just bought this is what you're saying?

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
No, like a year ago.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Okay, how often do you sip from it?

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Pretty regularly, it holds a lot of water.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So you will oftentimes just have a water glass, because I'll be honest with you,

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
that was mostly a joke.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yeah, no, I know.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But you do sip, how often do you think you sip from the lighthouse?

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Maybe like once or twice a month.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I have a lot of these water bottles.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I think it's cool.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It sounds like I'm being insincere, but I do think that's cool.

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I should drink from my pirate's dinner adventure glass more,

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
and the different souvenir glasses I have.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
But I don't have anything as fun as that as the souvenir sipper.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I don't know if the chip on it would work if I went back to,

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
if I went to Universal Orlando and I said, please reactivate this.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Do you think they could do that?

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's one of the ones where it's like drinks all day and you can reactivate them.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Oh, that chip.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yeah.

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I don't think that's still going.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yeah, I don't know about that.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But it's worth a shot.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's worth, well, we'll see.

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's been through the dishwasher a lot.

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Okay, do you think you could go to like, where's the like city hall at Islands of Adventure?

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Oh, it would be on Port of Entry.

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Our guests are the real pros at this sort of thing.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Right.

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So they would know where to complain when you throw like an absolute fit that your sipper won't get you free refills.

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And then I'll be out of the sipper because you know I'm going to throw it in anger.

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You would throw it at the employer at the wall.

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
At the wall.

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Oh, please.

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm not totally uncouth.

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I do have manners.

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
All right.

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
All right.

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Well, let's bring the guests and see where they would throw a sipper if they were having a fit at the theme park.

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
From the great YouTube channel Ordinary Adventures, it's Kitra Remick and Peter Soretta.

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Welcome.

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Did I say your last name right, I'm realizing now?

61
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You did.

62
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I did.

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Okay, good.

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I just had a freak out in my mind.

65
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I should have checked that.

66
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
No, I get it.

67
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I have a very unique name.

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Okay, yes.

69
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You did great.

70
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Okay, because I would have edited this part out and it would have made me look, I would have done it later and then imitated your voice saying, great pronunciation.

71
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You did great.

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So, guests, thank you for coming.

73
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Long time coming, I feel like.

74
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Finally, you guys have been.

75
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
We have been Podcast the Ride listeners for so long.

76
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I remember, how long have you guys been doing this?

77
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Since 2017.

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Okay, yeah.

79
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So we definitely, we started in 2019 and we were definitely listening.

80
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I remember how it happened too.

81
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Paul Shearer DMed me and was like, Peter, they have made a podcast for you.

82
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Wow, really?

83
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yeah.

84
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So I'm not sure when that was, probably like 2018 or 2019.

85
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yeah, because he did the show pretty quickly, I feel like.

86
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yeah.

87
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm forgetting which episode, but yeah, he did it pretty quick.

88
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
He was, yeah, Shearer has been really good.

89
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
He's told a lot of people, I feel like, but I didn't realize he was the reason you got into it.

90
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Oh, yeah.

91
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
We're obsessed with you guys.

92
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
We subscribe to all the Patreon levels.

93
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Wow, thank you.

94
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yeah, you guys are amazing and I feel so grateful and honored to be here.

95
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yeah.

96
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Oh, thank you so much.

97
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
That's very nice.

98
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Thanks for doing this.

99
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yeah.

100
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Thank you for talking, Scott.

101
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
We're on the Scott Free episode.

102
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
We are, yes.

103
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Thank you for joining us.

104
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
We can talk about the points.

105
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I like talking about points.

106
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I love the points episode.

107
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So yeah, so on one hand, I apologize because it's not the three hosts, but on the other

108
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
hand, we're Scott Free.

109
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So if you want to talk points, we can do anything today.

110
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The sky is the limit.

111
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
By the way, quick aside about the points.

112
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Please, yes.

113
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
We recently, we're doing a lot of traveling now.

114
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
We recently got into, we love Delta.

115
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So we got a Delta MX card.

116
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yes.

117
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And we travel a lot, but not a lot in comparison to like people that actually travel.

118
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
But that card, putting all our expenses on that card gets us upgraded to first class

119
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
every time like we fly.

120
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Really?

121
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Yeah.

122
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That's nice.

123
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Is there a big annual fee on it?

124
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yes.

125
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Okay.

126
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's like 600 or something.

127
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Does it have a credit, a travel reimbursement credit as well?

128
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Yes.

129
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Yes.

130
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
We'll also get you into the Delta Lounge too.

131
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So.

132
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yeah.

133
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And how is the lounge?

134
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I know we're supposed, ostensibly we're talking about a cruise today, but how is the lounge

135
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
review wise?

136
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The one in LA is great.

137
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yeah.

138
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The one in LAX is good.

139
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The one in Orlando is still nice, but LAX is better.

140
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The one in Orlando has these creepy Mickey and Minnie art paintings on the wall.

141
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But the one in LA, if you get there early enough for breakfast, they'll make you breakfast

142
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
tacos.

143
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Like they actually have someone there cooking them and yeah.

144
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Wow.

145
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Lounge, Jason, lounge wise, have we, we have not talked about lounges a lot on the show

146
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
and that maybe is because Scott is a third host of the show.

147
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I don't know.

148
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I don't know where he feels.

149
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I don't know about the lounge, if he gets there, but once in a while I've done an airport

150
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
lounge.

151
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I've never been in one.

152
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I know.

153
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Right.

154
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I thought we were going to talk about points, like all the castaway, is that what it's called?

155
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The cruise ship loyalty.

156
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Like, and you just keep getting more and more free totes and stuff.

157
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And I was excited for that.

158
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I didn't even think about the, uh, go ahead.

159
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The way Disney does these castaway points, it's infuriating because you basically get

160
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
one point for every cruise you go on.

161
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Okay.

162
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So if you go on like a three night cruise, you get one point.

163
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
If you get, go on a 14 night cruise, you get one point.

164
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Well, that's foolish.

165
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And then there's different levels.

166
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So if you get to five points, you're at a different level.

167
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You're 10 points.

168
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You're a different level.

169
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
If you're a 50, you're at a different level.

170
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
On Royal Caribbean, the other cruise, big cruise line, you get a point for every day

171
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
or every night you stay.

172
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So I feel like that's better.

173
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That makes a lot.

174
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yeah.

175
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It makes more sense.

176
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I don't know.

177
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I have a background.

178
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
No, I've never been in an airport lounge.

179
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You've never been, this is shocking to me.

180
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Scott has already tuned out of this.

181
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
He's furious right now.

182
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
He's thrown, he's thrown his phone against the wall of whatever building he's in right

183
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
now.

184
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
His phone is broken and now he has to go get a new one.

185
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I, I don't know.

186
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I should, I should think about trying it.

187
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Cause I had, I should try it.

188
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I should try it next time.

189
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I don't know that we get there or I get there pretty early.

190
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yeah.

191
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I, yeah.

192
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You got there earlier than I do recently.

193
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I really like show up very late.

194
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
In fact, the last time we went to Orlando, I was late and missed the flight.

195
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So it was like 15 minutes too late.

196
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yeah.

197
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So yeah, you just, yeah, I don't know why I never even realized this about you.

198
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The splurge I did last time.

199
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Cause you know me, I don't think of myself as splurging much.

200
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I did the Uber X that can pick you up right curbside.

201
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And it's nice because when I flew in, I flew in October and November, December.

202
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And when I flew in October, taking the bus to they, they call it the LA exit.

203
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Horrible.

204
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's awful.

205
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And if you have mobility issues, super awful.

206
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's like a death trap.

207
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So I'm like, Oh, I'm just going to pay the extra $30 or whatever.

208
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And they could pick us up at the curb.

209
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I could just sit for a little while longer.

210
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Because I'm like, this airport is not ready for the Olympics.

211
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,000
No, it's just going to a dirty parking lot to get a taxi or a lift.

212
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's just a little much.

213
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Yeah.

214
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Yeah.

215
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
But yeah.

216
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So, but you don't get like a warm buttered roll in an Uber X.

217
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Like you do at an airport lounge.

218
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I know.

219
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You sometimes get candy though.

220
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I feel like it's grandma candy though.

221
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's like those little strawberry hard candies.

222
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yeah.

223
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's like whatever the cheapest candy.

224
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I mean, you don't, I don't need candy in a lift or an Uber or something.

225
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I don't.

226
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I mean, I like candy.

227
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I don't need it.

228
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
But yeah, it's interesting.

229
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So I guess, yeah, we've got to get you in a lounge, Jason.

230
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
This is a whole, this is a shot to the list of my priorities in my life is to get you in an airport lounge.

231
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Yeah.

232
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So we'll figure that out.

233
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yeah.

234
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And, and yeah, any points talk in the, we can do it.

235
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Feel free.

236
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm so sorry to the people out there listening.

237
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I know some people are probably very angry that I brought up points, but.

238
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I know.

239
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I know.

240
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It was the only one who was upset with Scott.

241
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Everyone seems to like it.

242
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Everyone seems to like it.

243
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Well, maybe one or two.

244
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:16,000
But let's talk, let's talk a little bit about your YouTube channel because I am fascinated by the rise of the vloggers.

245
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And you've been doing this YouTube channel now for what?

246
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Five years?

247
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Roughly?

248
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Four?

249
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I think this year will be our sixth year.

250
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Six?

251
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
We're coming up on six.

252
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Wow.

253
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Like in when?

254
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Like April or May?

255
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yeah.

256
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
May maybe?

257
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Yeah.

258
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So pretty soon.

259
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Yeah.

260
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Congrats.

261
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And the channel does great.

262
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's real fun to watch.

263
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's in the rotation.

264
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Yeah.

265
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
With Mr. Morrow when we're watching.

266
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Oh, what an honor.

267
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
We love Nate.

268
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
He's the best.

269
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
By the way, he is the greatest guy ever.

270
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I know you guys have met him and hung out with him, but like he literally is the person you

271
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
see on his videos and he's just like the nicest dude.

272
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I was in awe.

273
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I mean, I'm not even, no, no hyperbole.

274
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I was in like awe of him.

275
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I was like, wow, he's like, this is the guy.

276
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
He's this guy.

277
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yeah.

278
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I don't know how he exists.

279
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Like, you know what I mean?

280
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Like it's, it's hard to explain, like, because he's just so nice.

281
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Yeah.

282
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And then I was like, oh, you're doing a panel.

283
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
We did a panel at Comic-Con for the, to celebrate the street sharks last year.

284
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And he's like, I'm coming to that.

285
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
He showed up there and then like we saw him later.

286
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yes.

287
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Very, very nice.

288
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And just like, he seems like he runs Disney World.

289
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
He just seems like well connected there too.

290
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
He knows everybody.

291
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
He knows what's going on.

292
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm like, I was fascinated by that aspect as well, which makes sense.

293
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Cause obviously like that's what he does.

294
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
He's just there all the time.

295
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
But yeah, so you're, you're traveling, you're doing cruises.

296
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You're doing Disney World.

297
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Like I am, I am a little jealous.

298
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm a little jealous, honestly, cause I'm like, oh, they're there now.

299
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Like, oh, look at there over there.

300
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Like it is a little bit, a little bit of jealousy on my part, but like, could you

301
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
just talk about starting it and do like, did you have grand plans for it?

302
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Like what was, did you, it was, it just sort of, it happened and like unfolded as

303
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
you went.

304
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Yep.

305
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Okay.

306
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
All right.

307
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I got it.

308
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Nevermind.

309
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
All right.

310
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You can tell the story, but like honestly, it just kind of snowballed into what it is

311
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
now and we never, not that we didn't talk about it, but it was kind of like, we started

312
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
it and it's just like, okay, now I guess we're like full-time YouTubers.

313
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So I used to operate, I started this website slash film.com, which is a movie news blog,

314
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
which I no longer own, but we got invited to galaxy's edge, the opening of galaxy's

315
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
edge.

316
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And I was like, no one's going to, and I used to, as the theme park nerd, we used to get

317
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
invited out to Orlando for openings of rides and stuff like that.

318
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And I used to, you know, write up a blog post and she would take the photos, but I was like,

319
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
no one's going to want to really bad photos.

320
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
No one's going to want to read about this land.

321
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
They want to see it.

322
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Right.

323
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Like, so I was like, maybe we should, because we were watching vloggers, we were watching

324
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
like, 10 tracker, Adam, you know, the OGs.

325
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Sure.

326
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Yeah.

327
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And she was always like, oh, it'd be fun to start a blog.

328
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And I'm like, no, it'd be so much more work than you think it would be, which is, I mean,

329
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
it's both true.

330
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Both of it's true.

331
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Um, but like we use that as an excuse to start the channel and it was supposed to be like,

332
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
we're going to do one video a month and if we ever do anything cool, like, oh, we're

333
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
going to Galaxy's Edge.

334
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'll show that.

335
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And then it kind of, yeah.

336
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Like I said, snowball that first two weeks of Galaxy's Edge.

337
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm not sure if you guys, well, you guys remember you needed reservations to get into that land.

338
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And since we were so such Star Wars nerds, all our friends put us as one of their plus

339
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
ones on their reservation.

340
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So for the first two weeks we were in Galaxy's Edge, like every other day, every other day,

341
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
a lot.

342
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And every time we brought a camera and at that point everybody couldn't get in there.

343
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So they were like, wanted to see what it was like.

344
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
So our Galaxy's Edge videos kind of blew up right away, um, in a way that we didn't expect.

345
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Right.

346
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Yeah.

347
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Don't go back and watch them.

348
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
They're not.

349
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Oh, they're bad.

350
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
They're really bad.

351
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Okay.

352
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
But, um, yeah, we started doing three videos a week.

353
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Um, and it's become like our full time thing now.

354
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Yeah.

355
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Right.

356
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
How does the planning go?

357
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Like you probably saw as we were setting up this podcast, it's like, these guys don't

358
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
plan very well for anything.

359
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Their setup looks haphazard.

360
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
They've been doing this forever, but it seems like this is their first podcast.

361
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
But do you have like, do you feel like you're, do you have like six months worth of vlogs

362
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
planned?

363
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Like how does it even work like that?

364
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I wish.

365
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Well, Peter's the planner.

366
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Okay.

367
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
So he'll, I just kind of show up and I also edit the videos, but yeah.

368
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Yeah.

369
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
So I'm doing the, I do the filming.

370
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
She does the editing.

371
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I do the planning.

372
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Right.

373
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
So like, uh, you know, recently we went to Japan, doing that is like months of like us

374
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:46,000
watching vlogs and reading, I'll read those like lonely planet books and, uh, going on

375
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
TikTok and seeing what's, and then building a Google map and then I'll be like, you know,

376
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
what can we accomplish this day?

377
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Right.

378
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Yeah.

379
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
So it is a lot of like planning, but I mean the regular stuff, I was going to Disneyland

380
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
is, you know, the week before us like seeing what's the new food items, what's the new

381
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
things, what should we, you know, right.

382
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
What can we accomplish?

383
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Are there things like where, you know, the algorithm like certain type, like, you know,

384
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
let's say for instance, like we know that YouTube, if I say the word pie or something,

385
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
like it'll boost my video.

386
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Like, are there like secrets like that to YouTube and maybe you shouldn't even tell

387
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
me this.

388
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Maybe this is like a trade secret.

389
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I wish there was.

390
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Yeah.

391
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I wish there was.

392
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I don't think they're in the title.

393
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Oh, you don't want the bakers coming after you.

394
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
So that Jason really should become like a pie influencer.

395
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'd watch that.

396
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Yeah.

397
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Just going around tasting the taste.

398
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Tasting different pies.

399
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Yeah.

400
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Just keep going to house of pies.

401
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Just trying to make money.

402
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It's mostly just one place.

403
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Yeah.

404
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
One place.

405
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And ordering the same pie every time.

406
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Yeah.

407
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Yeah.

408
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You make the same comments every video.

409
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Hey guys.

410
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Ending the channel.

411
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Parking's gotten really bad at house of pies.

412
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Yeah.

413
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,720
So there isn't like it can't be like that

414
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,080
Pacific yeah, or I guess yet. Maybe the AI and I mean for a while

415
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,680
Like there were stuff that our channel would hit for like if we did a Star Wars video, right?

416
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,440
Right, right. The the people that were watching and subscribing were

417
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:20,240
Star Wars fans, so like it would just perform better, right? But now I don't know. I mean cruises does really well for us. Mm-hmm

418
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,000
We recently been doing a lot of international travel

419
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,520
So we went to China recently did the theme parks over there people seem to be really interested in traveling

420
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:35,480
Yeah, now that is I guess I do like that. I like just watching videos of like walking around

421
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,640
Japan or something a 4k video and you put on the TV you just like kind of zone out a little bit

422
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,680
Yeah, there's something I don't know. I don't know if that's just like

423
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,680
Vicarious. Yeah vicariously living vicariously probably on some level

424
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,480
so yeah, so so

425
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,480
Yeah, I guess Star Wars. Yeah, that makes sense

426
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,240
As far as I like when you go now to these places

427
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:04,120
I'm just so blown away by how much this is blown up by how often you will see somebody taking video

428
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:11,560
Do you run into like oh someone else is taking video for their vlog in the section where we're

429
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:17,820
Trying to do our review of the new like food item or something like does that happen often a lot? Yeah

430
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,660
Opening day or something when you know, everyone's gonna be there, right?

431
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:25,380
Yeah, like we were there this past week for the the video that we published today

432
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:30,860
Which I'm not sure when this is going up, but it was a video in Avengers campus. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I watch and yes

433
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,660
we run into our friends magic journeys and

434
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:40,460
They were there doing the exact same clearly had the Captain America sipper and they like they were doing the exact same thing as us

435
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:44,360
And I was like, oh no, we got we were both doing the same video

436
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,920
So is there like as their etiquette is like, okay

437
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,640
They're reviewing the sipper and we have to move like they were here first

438
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:55,680
Is that just general the general rule or you or you wait for them to stop or you do it at the same time?

439
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:02,160
Well, we I mean we featured them in our video they were they featured us in the world

440
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,600
I mean not all of us friends, but I would say most of the people are friends, right?

441
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,720
so it's also you're like the other thing is I've realized is

442
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:15,600
People don't just watch ordinary adventures, you know, they also watch paging mr.

443
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,480
Maura, they also watch magic journeys or they also you know

444
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:24,960
I mean and they like seeing that in the same way that people liked seeing Avengers and see everybody come together

445
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:30,080
They love those true. That's one look. There's a crossover. Oh, right. Yeah. No, you're right

446
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,960
I was about to make that same comparison because it does feel like us to the vendor

447
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,480
You're not. No, you're saying you're like the Avengers. You're saying would you say you're more like you're like?

448
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,680
Captain America of the group of like the group and some other people are Thor

449
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,880
Yes, and then I mean

450
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:55,860
Oftentimes when we will be watching like sometimes they'll be like, oh this person's in a video a lot

451
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,640
And then all of a sudden they disappear and then we're like, where did that person go?

452
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,220
Oh now like there's and I'm I'm trying to think if I have a specific I won't say a per specific person

453
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,960
but like there is there is like a

454
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,280
Fascination about that as far as personalities are concerned too where you're like

455
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,360
Oh, it seems like this person's hanging with this person a lot and then they go away

456
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:17,400
I don't know what that's about whatever but then you can if you're watching with somebody who is like-minded you can speculate you can

457
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:24,120
Talk about as if you know, these are people we know this is a reality show of some kind sparks were maybe flying

458
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,520
But now they fizzled out more ten

459
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,760
You could do a very tabloid style

460
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,120
Report it to your partner my favorite version is this I think it was

461
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:41,840
Jane and I were watching like the opening night of horror nights like

462
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,520
2021 I think like would have been the first one that was back

463
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,680
And it was just a torrential downpour in Orlando

464
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:58,680
So that always scare actors were out and then the streets are empty besides guests

465
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:05,720
So we just kept strict switching between live streams and it would be like, oh

466
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:11,920
This live streamers meeting up with this live streamer under an umbrella and they're like, how about this rain?

467
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,200
It's like yeah, I might go to a house but it the way it's kind of long and you're in the rain outside

468
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,880
So it's just getting all the angles of like the soggy theme park

469
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,680
And I'd like this is must-see TV for me

470
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,440
It's too bad. There's not like a Google map where you can see where the live streamers and I click on to them

471
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,840
I don't want that's a great idea. Everybody was like a little Apple tracker

472
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,280
If you if the right patreon tier

473
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:48,560
We should do that Jason we should do that for you for how we'll add a patreon tier we're gonna add a tracker to you

474
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,720
Oh

475
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,800
It's gonna be a very high tier though people really have to pay for that

476
00:19:54,800 --> 00:20:00,160
So I say to just see where you are at any moment of the day. Yeah, we want that. We don't know

477
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:05,160
Oh, oh, so it's my whole life. It's not just theme parks. It's your whole life. Oh great

478
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:14,040
Sort of show like as if it was my neighbor Truman some sort of it's like Truman show but with no budget

479
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,520
Or my other neighbor ed TV

480
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,880
Yes, I remember we remember ed TV. Yeah, the other

481
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,440
Yeah, do you remember the the real-life version that they had before?

482
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,880
Twitch was twitch. I think it was called Justin TV

483
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:38,020
Oh, really? I don't know this and they used to have people like I think I Justine was one of the first people that did

484
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:42,160
This where she like would broadcast her life 20 like you could see her sleeping

485
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,080
You did the only time she would turn it off

486
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,400
I think was like when she left her house she would turn it off for like five minutes

487
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,400
Watch so you couldn't see

488
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:56,360
Where her house was? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I knew about like on twitch. I knew there are people who live stream

489
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
sleeping

490
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:05,640
Like if you donate enough they'll like wake up. Oh, really? Yeah, I think it like triggers like alarms or something

491
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,160
Wow, those maybe it's on tik-tok Jason. We gotta get

492
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,040
Disco ball will come down and they'll like wake up

493
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:20,720
No, the disco ball actually come down in their house, I mean there's different scenarios, okay a hundred bucks to watch you

494
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,080
So just torture me. No, no, no. Well, we don't I guess the disc we don't even have the disco ball

495
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:30,120
Maybe it's just something else. It's like but it's just a watch you sleep for $100 a month

496
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,440
Club one club Z's

497
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,800
Yeah, well we'll talk about that off the ear so

498
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:49,520
We were talking a little bit about this and this is this is very embarrassing maybe and I'll just share my part of it

499
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:56,520
What I was saying is, you know the whole the the politics of being invited to things is very interesting

500
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,520
It also makes me feel

501
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:05,440
Loser ish sometimes because look we have a well-documented ghosting happen hook ghosting happening with Knott's Berry farm

502
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,720
With Knott's Berry farm, it's been well documented that Knott's Berry farm stopped inviting

503
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,160
It goes some ghosts that are ghosting. It might be we don't know

504
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:18,960
That's the thing when ghosts happen, you don't know which ghost is ghosting you the ghost that works in the PR office

505
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:26,080
But I am also fascinated by that because sometimes you're like, oh look who got invited to this on YouTube

506
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:32,560
And then sometimes you see a vlogger didn't get an invite and this is always I'm so fascinated by this and I do

507
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,880
Now having experienced it from doing this podcast a little bit

508
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:42,800
I am always like I wonder what this person thinks about if they got invited and this person didn't like does this does this weigh on?

509
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:47,480
Your does this bother you like it bothers me. I guess hopefully it doesn't

510
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,720
There's a little bit of FOMO there. I'm not gonna lie

511
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:57,080
Like especially for the most recent thing like the Disney treasure. We already bought, you know our voyage

512
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,680
We're already planning to go but deep down you do hope like oh

513
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:05,400
Maybe we'll get invited to like a preview thing and then seeing it like because all of our friends there

514
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,760
Yeah, there's an advantage of being first

515
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:12,200
Right right videos early. I should say being early

516
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,920
There's an advantage of being on the ship before the public is because then you can get out and like more people

517
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:20,780
Or you can like watch a show and there's not like a million people in the way and you get like a good shot

518
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:24,760
Or whatever. Yeah, that's it. Yeah, so there was a little bit of FOMO there for sure

519
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,160
Yeah, makes you like I try not to dwell on it too much

520
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:32,720
But you know, I'm only human only human. Yeah, I'm like, why don't they like us?

521
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:38,640
It's weird because you know, I came from the world of journalism with slash film and in that world

522
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,460
If you don't like a movie, you know

523
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:46,520
Just on to the next one and you get invited to the next premiere or the next test

524
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,360
You know screening or whatever or set visit like it's not like they

525
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:56,040
You don't get punished for having any critical thoughts

526
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,200
But I feel like now that we're in the world of

527
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:06,920
YouTube and even you guys with podcasting. I think it's all lumped into like influencer. Yeah world, which I think is more it's weird

528
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,920
It's a weird world. Yeah

529
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:15,200
where people are incentivized to just like everything and we always want to be I

530
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,720
think one reason we have a big audience is as much as we

531
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,880
We do love to spotlight the things that we love

532
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,480
We are honest about the things that we don't like and I

533
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,520
Don't know why we weren't invited on the treasure but

534
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,240
There was a bunch of people. It was amazing. Yeah

535
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:41,360
Yeah, we there was a private island that Disney opened up last year called Lookout Key at lighthouse point

536
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,000
Was that the one with the bugs? Yes

537
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,960
And it just so happens that anybody that showed the flies wasn't

538
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,640
Okay

539
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:58,920
Yeah, we think we don't know interesting that isn't yeah, I could see something like that happening

540
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:03,640
I like to think that Disney has never extended any invite to us because you know

541
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:09,000
What maybe will be like very critical something but I think actually what the case is if anyone ever tried to listen they were too

542
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,840
Bored by what we were talking about

543
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:15,200
That's probably more likely as they were like these guys are just talking about Lucille Ball too much

544
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,300
When are they gonna actually talk about the ride like it doesn't make any sense

545
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:24,680
So they realize how much little scene specials are on hoopla to watch

546
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:33,960
But it isn't it is interesting cuz yeah, well you gotta think too like how much is just someone

547
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:41,140
Making a split second like yeah, I gotta finish this email with the invites for lunch sure like

548
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:47,660
What are their number I know it's just like a meaningless metric like I read so

549
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,900
Often about like people it's like yeah

550
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:58,100
We really wanted to cast this person in something and then the studio was like they don't have enough Instagram followers

551
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,100
And it's like how does that?

552
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,460
Translate like what are the metrics?

553
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,060
What does that mean?

554
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:04,580
well

555
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:09,620
that's also a thing I think Disney's focusing on is they want tick tockers and Instagrammers and

556
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:15,860
You know you posted a tick-tock from the Disney treasure of you dancing on the deck and it gets millions of views

557
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:20,700
That's millions more people than would have watched our video on the right treasure

558
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,660
But I don't know it

559
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:29,380
My argument is I think there's more of a connection there if you watch a 40 minute or 50 minute vlog

560
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:33,940
You're not just like going through your your for you page, so I think

561
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:38,100
people that watch that kind of content could

562
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:44,140
That you have the potential to convince them to go on to Disney Cruise where I don't think like a tick-tock

563
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:48,620
Is gonna convince anybody, but that's just my right yeah that makes sense

564
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:53,580
I mean look I'm would I argue that a two-hour episode of a podcast might help in yes

565
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:58,500
You to do something I would say it would even if how many people do you think went and saw David Copperfield because of you?

566
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,300
Guys I we've heard a lot of them

567
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:04,580
We've heard a lot of people that have gone to see yeah the tale of blue 32

568
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:08,780
Yeah, and they are all delighted and and so yes, it would make a lot of sense

569
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:16,300
But I think I did really not enough to save I left my M in Vegas the M&M store that is true

570
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:22,900
Movie which I think has been retired like it was dying when I saw it at the start

571
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:28,620
Yeah, well, okay, we can't save everything we can't do we can't work mad

572
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,260
We're not David Copperfield

573
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,260
But yeah, so it is

574
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:41,580
Yes, I try not to be like try to make up stories about what what like PR people think of us in my head

575
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,820
It's hard though. You know the other thing is

576
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:50,300
My experience meeting PR people just like from

577
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:58,740
College or at these various companies every time I would go to something it would be a new part

578
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:01,880
It'd be like oh no Jenny went to go work at like

579
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:08,460
Speared off for something it was like oh they went they moved that this was their first second job

580
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:12,900
And they just kind of they were here for six months, and then they moved on every time

581
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,980
It's like a totally new person

582
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:21,060
Mm-hmm, but it's not you're saying that they're not thinking too much about like like Carlson and what they think of him

583
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,540
And he's funny or not in the right way

584
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,980
No

585
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:31,320
Yeah, they're not analyzing your life from a far right, but sometimes it feels like they are

586
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:35,200
Do you encounter PR reps when you go to like?

587
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:40,040
Some of these theme park events that have actually listened to the podcast or never never

588
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,660
I've heard store of like

589
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:52,060
Was talking to someone who worked for the company and they really enjoyed your hotel like there's such and such

590
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:58,260
Yeah, definitely people who work in the the parks and work behind the scenes, but never the actual people making the decisions

591
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:01,580
I don't there's never been a hint that anyone has listened to a second of an episode

592
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:08,100
Before which I guess is probably good. Let's be honest. Let's it's probably good because it's you know

593
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,100
We're just a bunch of silly gooses

594
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,320
What are we gonna do? We don't know what we're saying

595
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,720
Three silly gooses just you guys

596
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:24,800
So, yeah, you can look at the analytics and see how many listens are coming from a campus in Glendale

597
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:30,880
Oh, that's interesting. We definitely down pretty far, but I don't know about that

598
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:36,400
I don't know. Yeah, we know the longitude and latitude of where people are listening. I don't know but we know like city wise

599
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:42,760
Do you have any sort of grand plans for the channel or is it just kind of going and cool stuff comes up?

600
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,660
Is there like are you gonna do like we're gonna make a pilot?

601
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:50,120
Like is there anything I guess I shouldn't you shouldn't reveal that really if I'm asking like a big ambitious plan

602
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:54,380
No, I don't we just like doing what we're doing

603
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:59,220
I mean epic universe this year is probably gonna be a big thing for us, right the Disney adventure

604
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:04,820
Which is their ship going out of Singapore, right? The ones are two big plans this year big plans

605
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,900
we recently kind of in the last couple years got bit by the

606
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,100
international travel bug and

607
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,460
And

608
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,460
So we want to do a lot more of that

609
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:19,220
Sure, but is there let's real quick or not real quick

610
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:26,140
Is there stuff you saw in China anywhere that you were like particularly we're excited about

611
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:33,620
That like you want to tell everybody to go do oh my god, I universal Beijing. Okay, I was gonna

612
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,980
One really surprised us because we did we went to Hong Kong

613
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:45,260
Shanghai and Beijing and I think like I wasn't expecting much from Beijing and it was so awesome

614
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:50,500
Yeah, yeah, and we were over there in their city walk when you guys were doing your last city walk

615
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:54,380
So I got you know, it was like us. Oh, yeah, we're like listening to on the plane ride and stuff

616
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,820
Like they need to get out here

617
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,260
Bubba gumps over here, too

618
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,980
And we need to review the shrimp there you need to know how it tastes

619
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:13,740
Way different I bet but it like that park is so crazy because it debuted during the middle of the pandemic in

620
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:20,900
Almost no one's been there. Like at least from the states. I people are afraid. Yeah, people are afraid I think to go to China and

621
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:25,540
We found I mean politics aside

622
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:31,300
We found as tourists going to China. It was very easy. Yeah, it wasn't scary

623
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,420
It was very intimidating. But then once we got there it was

624
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:39,380
Very chill. Sure. Yeah, I mean there was like police on every corner, but they just

625
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:45,220
They reminded me of like security guards like they're just like clocking in and clocking out and I don't know

626
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:52,280
Yeah, but that park is insane. They're Jurassic right that old ride right is like

627
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:59,260
Amazing I hope they bring that to like epic universe or somewhere over here at some point

628
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:02,860
Yeah, I watched the video the video on that you sometimes you're like

629
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:07,700
I'm not sure if this translates and I feel like it there's just no way it's not ten times even better every time

630
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:13,020
We wrote it like literally ten times and every time I was like, are they real like they seemed so real, right?

631
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:18,460
Yeah, that's like a scoop vehicle the spider-man transformers vehicle. Yeah, but it's like basically the same thing

632
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,800
It's just there's a lot more practical stuff. Yeah on the ride

633
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:26,900
And yeah, the crazy thing is I guess spoiler alert is the the was it in Domus or t-rex?

634
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,820
That's coming at you. I'm that like circular part

635
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,820
I

636
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:38,240
Dominus right or I don't remember. Yeah in Dominus. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, cuz that's the the transitions in that one

637
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,940
It's just so good. There's a part where you're in the middle of that mean mean street of Jurassic world

638
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,060
I don't know what it's called

639
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,820
but like the t-rex and the

640
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:51,500
Indominus are fighting each other and then the t-rex throws Indominus through the window and you're moving into another right minute

641
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:55,040
His head just comes in as you're going through the other room

642
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:59,260
It's something like a part where you go by and you see like the margaritaville like cups

643
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:04,700
Yes, like from Jurassic world. That's good stuff. There's no you not Jimmy, but just the cups

644
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:09,860
Yeah, cuz the Jimmy Buffett robot would be a great tribute to the man and

645
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,260
People would finally would flock to the

646
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:19,820
Universal Beijing if they knew that was there even the red the dress world restaurant looked

647
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:27,740
Awesome. Yeah, just the scale how big it was and unique and I always your guys's a

648
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:33,980
Lot of your videos from Asia. I'm like that theme park food looks so good and so affordable

649
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:37,060
Yeah, it's so much cheaper to get food, right?

650
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:43,560
Especially in Tokyo that restaurant is so cool. Like it's a fine dining restaurant. It's called Hammond's and it has like a

651
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:49,440
John Hammond outside like they really look their water world has like this

652
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:57,140
What are you 30 foot tall? Yes, their water world the statue of of Kevin Costner. It's amazing

653
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:00,780
Ever seen water world, I don't know, but they love it there

654
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:05,180
So there is a big it into it like likeness full Costner face. Yeah

655
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,780
Scrap metal

656
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,260
So that's interesting to me. Why don't we have that here cuz that's a whole land

657
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:18,340
Yeah, right a restaurant like has a restaurant in the show and I think like a churro stand

658
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:23,740
Yeah, it's become its own just like theme park specific IP even though there was a movie

659
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:29,060
And that land is cool for a theme park fanatic because the costumes in that land are just

660
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:35,940
Stitch together pieces of cloth that they have found but some pieces of it have like theme park references

661
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,940
so I'll have like the Institute of

662
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:44,160
Future technology. Yeah future technology will be on someone's shoulder and like oh my god. Yeah, that's cool

663
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,580
Man, I yes, I am jealous of that stuff, too

664
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:52,580
I'm just I am one like water world just survive. He'll never go away. It's seemingly like

665
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:56,780
It's just like it's been they've built new ones in the last few years

666
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:02,660
Yeah, I was gonna say that's a new park and they decided to build over IP. They have yeah, that's movies

667
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:08,220
Yeah, so they determine that water world is more important to do there than like a new movie, man

668
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:11,660
That's interesting and it's fun watching like those crowds like the Chinese crowds

669
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:16,020
Fill up that arena and every one of them buys like a poncho

670
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:20,420
They like to buy the poncho and sit in the wet area like they are they love it

671
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,260
And is it the same show

672
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:28,860
I mean the same kind of like the plane everything and just in a different language, but yes same exact show. Yeah, wow

673
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:36,740
Okay, it's funny. Like I wonder yeah, is there do they have translations going like is there any way to know what it's in English?

674
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:39,980
No, I mean, it doesn't matter obviously for that one. No. Yeah

675
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:45,240
I'm just like wondering if they had like updated the shown anyway, or anything. Do they have horror nights in Beijing?

676
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:52,800
I think yeah, I have it in Singapore and Beijing right and Tokyo or is it one of they have it in Tokyo

677
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,720
I know that because we remember seeing a video of like one of them were like somebody was in a bathtub

678
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:03,040
Oh, they popped out. Did you ever see that? Yeah, and I don't know where that was, but it wasn't in America

679
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:07,300
Yeah, cuz I was like, wow, maybe that was Beijing. Maybe it was

680
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,900
Somebody was literally submerging water and would pop out. It seems dangerous

681
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:18,380
It's like they're paying him seems like there's not there's like a law against that one of the Universal parks

682
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:21,700
in Asia eight horror nights was

683
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:28,820
All day long and included but it was only a few houses and then I think when the Sun went down

684
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:33,460
Maybe there was a little more stuff, but it wasn't a separate ticketed event

685
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:36,260
Right interesting. Yeah

686
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:43,140
Let me ask this you've been to a lot of places you've done a lot of rides now if like you could if there could be

687
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:50,300
One ride that you've ever been on that just existed next to your like home that you could just pop out the door and go on

688
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:57,200
Shanghai Pirates of the Caribbean for me. Okay, or the Jurassic World ride was pretty good, too. Okay

689
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:03,780
The Shanghai Pirates so good because that's another one right like the video makes me think it's amazing

690
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:09,580
Yeah, it's so it's crazy how big and scale it is. Like yeah, I really feel like you're underwater

691
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:12,900
You don't see the ends of the screens anywhere, right and that one

692
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,460
Yeah, I guess we've talked a little bit about it

693
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:20,820
But it's like there's a lot of like practical effects and robots and animatronics and then there's these big crazy

694
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:27,100
Dome screen type things that make it feel like you're being submerged and in water and then popping out of the water

695
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:33,060
Yeah, and the boat goes like all over it like goes backwards. It goes sideways. You're like how how's this?

696
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:35,380
You kind of don't know where it's gonna go at one point

697
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:41,140
It goes like inside a ship and you you're kind of surprised that it goes into the ship and it's really like I

698
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,340
experienced of course on Guardians and Scott always

699
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:49,860
Makes fun of the way I describe things but Guardians of the Galaxies the Epcot ride. I

700
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,900
Never had been handled like that. That's what way I described it

701
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:59,260
I was handled on a ride like it felt like so precise and it seems like that boat is similar where like

702
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:05,180
You've never been on a boat where you feel like you're like there's pinpoint accuracy of where it's pointing you and what it's doing

703
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:09,300
Yeah, like it's an unusual feeling especially for a boat. What would you pick?

704
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:13,900
I don't know why that I have to pick something came to my head. I have to pick something from Asia

705
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,900
It could be anywhere. It could be anywhere

706
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,220
Resistance would be no bullet. Oh, okay

707
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,220
If you have a big Star Wars person boy

708
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:23,620
In my mind all your favorite after all the rides that you've been on

709
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:27,020
I think so, but the thing is I could just drive to Anaheim like

710
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:31,180
Yeah, I guess probably the smart thing to do is would be going to a far away

711
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:34,240
Yes, you're think you're putting actual thought into the yeah

712
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:40,020
You're stressed you need to come down a little

713
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:47,220
Would you be mad if rise the resistance jostled you more like this is the constant refrain that I'm saying about the ride

714
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,340
I wish it would would fuck you up a little more. I

715
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:55,940
Mean I wouldn't be mad. Okay, like it's not a good. It's not a great you have with it. Yeah. Yeah

716
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:01,780
Like it can't do it. Why would that be if you

717
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:10,140
Wish you were getting pummeled with lasers from stormtrooper. I want to feel the heat. I want the yeah

718
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:15,560
I want like that would be kind of cool. I would like that if they are interesting because I'm that I remember we went to

719
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,740
D23 a couple years before

720
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:24,900
Galaxy's Edge opened and I remember clearly talked to Imagineer in front of like the rise of the resistance area

721
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:28,340
And he was like you're gonna feel the heat of Kylo Ren's lightsaber

722
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:33,780
Okay, and I was like, oh, that's cool. Like and I yeah, you don't feel the heat

723
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:39,140
So I'm like wondering like did they get rid of that or probably but maybe it was when it comes through the ceiling

724
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:42,340
It could either have been the car comes to the ceiling or when you like walks out

725
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:47,500
Yeah, one of those two points, but that would have been cool. Right or you like yeah great. Yeah, I wonder

726
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:54,460
Yeah, I guess cuz like how would they have even done that from the ceiling like just make the ceiling hot like

727
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:58,980
Just funneling a space heater. Yeah

728
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,660
Yeah, like one of those things you get like when you're eating outdoors at a restaurant

729
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,860
No, yeah, they just dress it up to look like a light saber

730
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:09,380
Or that's a pretty good like if you have a patio and you're a Star Wars guy

731
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,620
You could just have like a lightsaber

732
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:16,580
Space heater maybe or whatever patio heater. That would be a good

733
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,340
I'm sure you can sell a lot of those if you could design probably

734
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:26,100
And it would have to be like the Sith lightsaber because of red makes it have to sure it just makes the most sense

735
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:30,940
If it's red, yeah, because you could have a blue flame flames are blue

736
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:37,540
It can be they could be purple. Sure the the things that amaze me about the

737
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:45,420
Best rides in Asia are like the magic tricks that they pull off. Mm-hmm like on pirates. There's this part where

738
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:52,700
Jack is a skeleton. He's like skeleton in the animatronic and then you're going towards him and all of a sudden like he just turns

739
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:57,820
Into a full-on Johnny Depp animatronic and it's similar to that. What I've the Beauty and the Beast

740
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:01,020
Japan effect where you're just like I don't know

741
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:06,740
Now I've said this before any every time like we dig into like hey, what was that? It's like that's like a pepper's ghost

742
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:09,920
It's all the same thing. Oh, it's mirrors. Yeah, but I don't know

743
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,300
I still don't really know exactly how it is because it does just look like things are disappearing

744
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:18,240
But yeah, those those are pretty amazing. I assume we'll get

745
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:26,100
Some version of that in the next round of rides out here. I'm assuming something will use of them disappearing thing

746
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:31,980
I don't know which one I would hope so. I I'm hoping that that Pandora boat ride is the Shanghai Pirates

747
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:39,300
Where do you think that's going? Oh, he's got a theory Hollywood back lot

748
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,300
That's

749
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:46,820
What I think and I took me a while to come around to the idea of it the monorail goes right there

750
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:49,180
So I'm like how it seems you'd go under it

751
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:51,940
Well, the thing is they're gonna take over that those bus lanes

752
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:56,220
So it's gonna like they're gonna have to transfer those bus lanes to where they're gonna have to build

753
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:01,940
They want to build a parking lot across the street and they want to so this is gonna take forever

754
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:05,180
We're not gonna get this until you that well they claimed five years

755
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:11,060
But five years ago they were talking about the garage the gateway

756
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:17,580
Well, but that was when I had an unfavorable City Council. Oh, right now the City Council will do whatever they want. So we're good

757
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,580
We're back to good

758
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:26,220
Rubber stamp everything but yeah, yeah, I that's I assume it is going Hollywood and then the cocoa was going behind

759
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:31,900
The coaster or yeah, I'm assuming in that like facade area back there

760
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:36,380
Yeah, I think that's the best place to put it like there's not much going on in that area

761
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:41,820
It's kind of sad because it's our on our first date. We our first ride was Monsters Inc

762
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:47,980
So we're gonna lose that Disneyland history because it was the limo ride before that

763
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,900
Was your first date at Disneyland

764
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:59,060
Yes, we actually met at Star Wars celebration

765
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:02,500
We hung out at Star Wars celebration and then once that was which is like a Star Wars

766
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:10,860
Convention and then once I was over we walked to Disneyland and we went to DCA and we got margaritas at Rita's margaritas

767
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:15,280
And then we went on whatever had the shortest line, which was Monsters Inc at the time

768
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:22,460
Yeah, and yeah, that's very sweet. I was like, hold on. Did you own a first date?

769
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:27,540
Were you like guaranteed three hours in a car 90 minutes each way?

770
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:34,820
Yeah, it's just like so what is what what do you like on your pizza?

771
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:42,260
So no, that's very sweet, yeah, I that's always nice story of a first date

772
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:49,340
We're like go to a second location, you know, what is what year was that celebrate Star Wars celebration 2015 2015? Yeah

773
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:55,380
Okay, we walked over to the Captain EO theater and we saw a preview for the movie Tomorrowland. Yeah

774
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,140
After

775
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:07,020
And it had like the song from carousel of progress in it so that's like our song

776
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:14,820
Did you guys did you guys follow the optimist at all? No, or you did. Yeah. Yeah, I have like a

777
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,440
PDF that's like a 30 or 40 page

778
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:23,060
Explainer of the storyline of the optimist

779
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:29,780
Because I was kind of following it as it was happening and then just online I'd see it like

780
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:33,940
Oh, if you've gone to Chili John's today, Bob Gurr was hanging

781
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:41,140
It's like I was right down the road. Mm-hmm. You didn't make it though. I didn't make it. No, I didn't really

782
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:46,180
Play along I was just kind of following you guys should do an episode on the optimist

783
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:50,460
Like I know on that like that's the whole thing. Yeah. Yeah, that was a cool

784
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:54,340
I mean I didn't get to I kind of followed it from afar like you did

785
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:59,900
Yeah, but I heard some of the stuff they did and it was crazy because they were and there was a literal

786
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:07,900
JJ style mystery box. Mm-hmm that they're likely found this box in the archives

787
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:13,500
And this was all like hype months hyping up Tomorrowland

788
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,620
yes, and then I feel like

789
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:20,860
All of the mystery that was like laid out was not in the movie

790
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:26,100
There was it was almost unrelated to all of this like because it really felt like oh wow

791
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:30,740
Tomorrowland is gonna be for the nerds or at least it's gonna have the treats in there for the nerds

792
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:33,460
Well, I had also submitted what happened

793
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:40,000
Like through one of the casting websites. They were looking for extras to just ride

794
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:47,840
Space mountain and or no ride the Matterhorn like for hours and I was like, yeah, I want to do that

795
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:50,400
Oh, that's and then there is probably

796
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,920
In her second shot in the movie. Yeah, my back would be destroyed

797
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:04,400
That is anyone has any vlogger done a Matterhorn challenge how many times you can ride the Matterhorn in one day

798
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,160
I'll stop see if before your neck goes

799
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:13,720
That's a good look that's a maybe if we start a vlog that'll be my first video is like

800
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:17,500
How many times can I ride the Matterhorn before I tap out twice? Yeah

801
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:24,520
Steel spine Carlson doing the challenge. I feel like a lot of people I know have declared

802
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:30,200
They'll never do the Matterhorn again. And now I'm out there. I'll do it. There's a trick. We have a trick

803
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,080
First of all, you need to go on the fantasyland side

804
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:38,680
Yes, the right side that one isn't as violent

805
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:39,680
Okay, okay

806
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:44,480
And then when you sit in the bobsled and you can easily remember that because it's the right side not the wrong side

807
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,920
Okay. Sure. No, it's a good way to remember

808
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,840
yeah, when you get into the bobsled you want to

809
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:55,720
Grab the seat in front of you and kind of like prop your back off of your own seat

810
00:46:55,720 --> 00:47:02,080
And you just ride the entire ride like that and you will not it doesn't really yeah, it makes it so enjoyable

811
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:08,280
Wait, okay. So if you're holding on the seat in front of you, does that mean you should hopefully know the person in front of you?

812
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:17,340
Unless you're in the very front so you like kind of just have to prop your back off of the yeah

813
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,920
But it is a game changer

814
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,840
What if you like grab the skull of the person in front of you?

815
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:28,640
Just hold their cheeks, but I feel like once once we learn that secret now anyone like even if they don't want my advice

816
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,800
I'm like you gotta do that when you do the Matterhorn

817
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:37,720
We learned it from a VIP tour guide and ever since I've learned that like it makes the Matterhorn so much about how this is

818
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:41,520
This is game-changing news. Yeah, I'm glad this is this is not a horn fun

819
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:46,440
Dude, did you during that date whether any other tips that the VIP guide gave?

820
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:50,720
About like riding rides or anything right now or that was the only

821
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:56,560
Mickey's and so the guy yeah, did you have you how I don't know how often you do a VP

822
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:02,800
Did one VIP guide VIP guide once and I tried to get in the Matterhorn with the basketball court

823
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:08,320
But they said there's no way you can do that. That's not I actually got walked off the Matterhorn once and I got to see the

824
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:16,240
Told me this I mean, it's literally just it's not what you think

825
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:19,240
It's like

826
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,680
Peter still threw a souvenir sipper at the wall

827
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:29,520
I ended it out the noise of it hitting the wall like the one cool ride that I've gotten walked off of well

828
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:34,120
That is that is a big deal though, but yeah, but at that they also explained to me like look

829
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:39,440
It's not yeah a court like it's usually picturing like an NBA court up there a little hoop in them, right?

830
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,160
Yeah, but it's like danger. I was described like it's dangerous

831
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,320
trap, but

832
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,640
They didn't have phones to occupy themselves

833
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:52,720
Did you do that? Have you been go if you go into the bathroom in the secret star tours bathroom for employees?

834
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:56,720
Cuz I got to do that, but I did do is the secret

835
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:01,020
Runaway railway bathroom, which is very boring. Oh

836
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,640
The queue for runaway well at railway and then it's not public

837
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:09,820
But we were on the VIP tour and I had to go the bathroom and then you just go into this very boring hallway

838
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:12,180
And it's like just I was expecting more

839
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:18,620
Interesting wow, they probably don't want people like I want to get I want to see if I can get in this secret

840
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:26,480
Bathrooms, I bet they all have one they I'm sure they do. Yeah, but I and the bathrooms are at least those star tours one

841
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:29,420
Unremarkable. Yeah, nothing special about it

842
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:33,280
But the idea of going to it is so interesting and fun to me

843
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:39,100
No, I want to go to the bathroom and all the secret bathrooms. I always I mean, it's not super challenge

844
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:44,340
Secret anymore, but if I go to Tiki room, I always go to the single occupancy

845
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:48,620
That's a good one because there's still like I feel like vintage fixtures

846
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:51,340
Well, they change those bad

847
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:54,580
But they're both family bathrooms now

848
00:49:54,580 --> 00:50:00,540
I believe there used to be like there used to be like urinal men's bathroom and now I believe they're two

849
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:03,980
Family bathrooms because I went in there to try to change a toddler

850
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:10,860
They did not have the proper table and I had to go to the much more crowded bathroom across the way and that was a

851
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:12,860
Crazy

852
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:14,820
Yeah, I should have gone over to that

853
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:21,780
We need to do an episode about the baby changing area on Main Street because that is it's it's fairly efficient

854
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:24,020
But it's interesting. I don't know if you've been in this now

855
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:30,260
This is you know, this is the perk of having a child is that you can now go in certain places that you couldn't before

856
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:34,820
So my wife has gone into the place where you can nurse now at Disneyland

857
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:36,420
So she needs to come out and talk about that

858
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:38,380
So we got to talk about all the different places

859
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:45,460
But it is like a weird assembly line where you're waiting in line with probably a bunch of children that have a big shit in

860
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:47,180
their diaper

861
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:52,180
And there's a line of parents holding their kid or their kids like whatever and you're just waiting for these little

862
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:56,980
Stations to open up and they're big. There's a couple people in there almost like you're you know

863
00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:03,980
Collecting your meal at a McDonald's like a wave over in here and then you go and you go and then you go into these little

864
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:06,100
Stations and then you're right by

865
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:13,100
Yeah, it's right on it's it's by I'm trying to think it's it's what's that the last

866
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:17,500
Store on Main Street on the right if you're looking at the castle

867
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:25,100
Yeah, it's like right next to there and that is where you go to change your child and there's so many people in there

868
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:28,940
But it is themed and there's like little TVs and there's like a little area for kids to run around

869
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:34,220
But I'm like in the middle of like, oh god, we gotta change this ever. She's having a fit

870
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:36,220
I'm still like the theming in here is nice

871
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:44,780
It's really good to be like things for some enrichment activities to tire myself out there. Yes

872
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:50,200
So I love the idea that there's this list of things that

873
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:57,540
Getting having a child on walks like the yeah petrodon flyers at the island's adventure

874
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:09,720
Yes, except what he's really fun what he really wants to do and he said this before is there's these events right which

875
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,440
Events and now

876
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:19,600
You guys ever been to one? No, no and that you were talking about what a great guy neat

877
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,440
Page of his tomorrow is he almost

878
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:30,960
Obviously, I would have had to change plane tickets and get a longer hotel stay and deal with you know a pet hotel

879
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:36,960
But he's like, oh shoot. Just stay a few more days come to the Orlando and former event. I'm like, oh

880
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,720
You almost got me

881
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:46,800
We're gonna get you on tarot on flyers. That is where you can do tear down flyers without a child, right?

882
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:52,560
Yeah, I will say we've only done one Orlando and former event it was amazing totally recommend

883
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:56,060
But for some reason that ride wasn't open like maybe it was down for

884
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,320
Here like there was yeah

885
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:05,920
I was like, this is my chance. It wasn't working. Right? Yeah, cuz I tried in like

886
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,600
1999 or

887
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:11,480
2000 and it was the longest wait in the park I think and

888
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:18,600
My parents were just like do you really wouldn't do this like man, wouldn't you rather do spider-man like yeah

889
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,480
Yeah

890
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,240
Well, we're good. We'll get you on it

891
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:28,280
I don't know could we maybe like maybe you have an inside person that can like sneak you on or something

892
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,440
Well, if you get me a big lolly

893
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:33,760
Well, we can dress you like a child. Yeah

894
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:39,800
What do you mean get you one you have one hanging in your closet at home? Yeah, I know and it's getting everywhere

895
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:44,000
You guys need to go to the Orlando and former event

896
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,560
Like it is literally walk up to any ride except for a great grids

897
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:53,480
Maybe it's like five-minute wait there. It's amazing and every food place just has free food

898
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:57,040
It's crazy. You go up to the food places and they they bring you out

899
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:00,520
But you don't pay anything and you see the total on the cash register

900
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:03,840
Oh, it's a hundred thousand dollars that it's gone through of like

901
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:10,520
That always fascinates me that like yeah and unlimited bread pudding

902
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:17,800
So yeah, it's a miracle. I've been there already. I was gonna say you could get like so you could have unlimited food at the Fantastic Four cafe

903
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:21,160
Yeah, basically. Oh, how are you not been there?

904
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:25,120
I know and just like you were just ordering a thousand dollars worth of bread

905
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:30,960
Seems you get to have access to this secret walkway between the parks because they connect the parks

906
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:36,280
Yeah, really? I didn't realize this. Yeah, so is that where the train goes the Hogwarts Express?

907
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,640
No, it's closer to Nickelodeon. Yeah

908
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:41,360
Up in the front

909
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:46,880
I mean, it's kind of like the same area that if you're an age of ten like those mazes are kind of right

910
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,560
I don't know. Yeah, maybe okay, you can see the impact zone

911
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:56,800
The old sound stages where they get rest where professional wrestling took place. Yeah. Wow. All right

912
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,800
Well, did they do these?

913
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:05,800
Our friend Ryan for the love of theme parks just recently did this episode of his he does these documentaries on YouTube and he did it

914
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,800
About wrestling

915
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:09,800
I

916
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:14,960
Yeah, I should watch that. It's very very comprehensive, but also frustrating because WWE

917
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,440
doesn't allow a

918
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:22,460
Even a second of footage to be all right. It's like all like still photos. I had to be very creative. Yeah

919
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:30,380
You did a good job. Yeah, like you have a WCW tapings at the entrance of MGM studio. What a time

920
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:35,080
It was just chaos. I didn't remember it. There was like people on top of like where the sign

921
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:36,840
Yes

922
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,560
Jim studios and jumping off there and stuff

923
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:47,400
People were freaked out cuz they had an ambulance like oh, he's getting stretchered out an ambulance, but it's like I

924
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:54,040
Think what was it? They used an actual Reedy Creek ambulance. So everyone's just freaked out

925
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,480
Yeah, we have we have a couple we owe a couple of wrestling

926
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:04,240
I've been like Jay Leno's wrestling career episode has to happen in the next year or so what Jay Leno had a match in

927
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:11,160
WCW and they ran an angle on the tonight show. Oh my god, and Jay wrestled and Kevin Eubanks his bandleader got involved

928
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:17,680
Kevin looked jacked too and Kevin looked like he was like the wrestling fan like Kevin knew what he was doing

929
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:22,240
And I was begging our friend Matt Cardona because he makes wrestling figures

930
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:27,840
I go people want Jay and Kevin and he said okay, I would make it J and I go no no no no

931
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:30,760
Jay and Kevin and he goes all right fine

932
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:36,520
And I go if you can figure out he goes if you can get the likeness if you can get Jay to sign off and Kevin

933
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:41,880
To sign off I will do it because it's not like you just got to show up at Bob's big boys every

934
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:46,920
Well, this is why the way we went there with my dad when he was in town like not thinking that he would be there

935
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,920
And he shows up every there

936
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:54,480
He is ever I haven't seen him a little bit, but Scott has seen Jay a couple times in the last few months

937
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,160
I feel like in Burbank

938
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,680
Yeah, so I if we can get to the big dog garage

939
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:04,560
I feel like part of it is just us doing an interview with Jay and then getting him to sign a contract to allow

940
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:08,940
Matt to make a wrestling figure of him and Kevin

941
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:14,240
And I guess we had to find Kevin too then but that is I do I want that's like my most wanted

942
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:19,280
Figures one of my most wanted figures is Jay. Do they have a figure of David Arquette?

943
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:26,940
No, I don't know. I think they do. I think he I think he may have matted may be made one, but I think yes that happened

944
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:34,540
But he yeah, he has made some more obscure things and then sometimes also I'll be like, you know Regis Philbin did a lot of

945
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:41,140
WrestleMania's and he's like no, but nobody wants like a no. No, they do. Yes. I want it. My friends want it

946
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:46,260
We need a Regis figure, please and then usually he just blows me off

947
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:50,260
But he's wrong. He's wrong about what people want

948
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:55,940
Let's talk about the Disney treasure you just how long ago you just got back from this pretty recently

949
00:57:55,940 --> 00:58:00,060
Yeah, we went in January January. Yeah, okay. That is recent. Yeah

950
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:09,300
How long would you guys say the you know doing this thing to make a video about it is

951
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:13,580
On average, you mean where it comes out? Yeah when it comes out

952
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:20,220
Oh filming and then how quickly we get out? Yeah uploaded does it depend on the I think it's a it depends on

953
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:25,140
What we're filming like so for Halloween hard nights, I'll stay up all night and try to get out as quick as possible

954
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:26,460
Yeah

955
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:30,380
With the Disney treasure, we weren't like on the maiden voyage or anything. So we didn't feel that

956
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:34,700
pressure of like trying to get it out super quick, right so

957
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:41,380
Usually I think it depends but like it usually takes me a few days to edit and

958
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:45,260
We're kind of scaling back this year and only posting one video a week

959
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:48,940
Unless it's like very topical or something. Yeah, but

960
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:54,460
That those I got out I think like a week after so we also usually don't edit while we're there

961
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:58,620
So like if we're on a cruise or we're in Japan, we're not yeah gonna waste the time

962
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:05,340
They're editing right till we get home. Yeah, it just depends on the situation, but I'll never stress myself out like trying to

963
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:11,340
Except for Halloween horror nights. That's the one that all that I'll stay up all night for that one's interesting too

964
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:17,660
It's like Orlando you get one day one media day to film in the houses the rest of the time you can

965
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:20,220
Yeah, but out here

966
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:25,900
And like at a horror night see is that I would just as I was getting ready for bed turn on the live stream

967
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:28,980
And every night someone was in houses. Yeah

968
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:34,100
Yeah, I would hear you'll be in line with someone like a live streamer with like their their flash on

969
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:38,420
Yeah, there's somebody in front of us who was like a live stream or something

970
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:42,580
They literally had their flash on the entire time and nobody said anything. They didn't get in trouble

971
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:48,140
I was dangerous for the actor and I'm like, that's so rude. Like I don't know because it's blasting light in their eye. Yeah. Yeah

972
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:50,980
Yeah, I'm trying to think I guess I don't know if that's happened

973
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:56,220
But it does feel like there's just a steady stream of people that something like that would be like

974
00:59:56,420 --> 01:00:01,140
It would be more annoying if you were like in a little small group to like I'm sure it's annoying

975
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:05,620
but it's also just like like there's just sometimes you're in those houses and I'm like there's a

976
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:11,580
Hard line of 25 people that are going through each like show scene to where I'm like

977
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:16,900
Which by the way is good for me who's still a little scared. Yeah, but I understand

978
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:18,940
It's like making the experience less good

979
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:24,780
So I'm conflicted about that because any time I've ever been there and like and just because of the way the line is

980
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:28,700
The flow is controlled. I end up being like the first part of the line

981
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:31,660
It's a little scary still we went to in

982
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:36,580
Orlando there was what was it called? It was like the night before opening night

983
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:42,900
It was like a premium of ticketed event. Oh, right, right, right and it was empty. No one bought take nobody was there

984
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:47,460
It was amazing because like I would definitely do it again, but I don't think they're gonna do it again

985
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:52,260
I think it's because they announced this way after so everybody already bought their opening night tickets and so again

986
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:54,820
They're like we're not gonna spend twice as much, right?

987
01:00:54,820 --> 01:01:00,900
But like every house was like you were in it alone. So I don't know that would be scary for you or it was like

988
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:05,140
It's one of those were like I know that's like I would do it and I know it's good

989
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:08,900
But I would still be a little bit like yeah, I will say the cool thing about that

990
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:12,380
I'm usually in your boat Mike where I like having

991
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:17,380
The Congo line because they kind of write and see stuff coming and it's not as scary

992
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:23,100
But the cool thing with this is you got to see every single scare and scene and like a fact

993
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:25,660
Yeah, right, right

994
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:30,660
Yeah walking in that alone that preview night to food was included

995
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:36,460
Yeah food was included so it's a really good value and I don't think I think they lost money because nobody bought tickets

996
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:42,100
So I don't I don't anticipate them ever doing that again, which is such a shame. I thought it was totally worth it

997
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:45,580
Yeah, we'll see. I mean though. I was gonna say the rumor

998
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:50,220
Hopefully Scott has at least said he's gonna do some Halloween stuff for the first time this year

999
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:54,300
The only one that hasn't right? Well Jason also has not

1000
01:01:54,820 --> 01:02:01,980
Jason Scott are both scaredy-cats and I am a little less of a scaredy-cat. Let's just put it that way. That's my big brag

1001
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:06,220
A little less of a scary kid. I said I would do it, but you have oh, yes

1002
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:08,740
Push my ass in a wheel. I'll push your ass in a wheelchair

1003
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:13,740
You can't nail a scare act you can't freak out and push me into a scare after

1004
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:17,940
I'll push you but there's no guarantee of what I'm gonna do when I get scared. Okay

1005
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:20,380
Well, just pushes you in the front and runs other way

1006
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:27,780
I think that would be less scary for you because they're looking for like the normal height of people

1007
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:32,140
They're not I can't cover my eyes. Yeah, like put a blanket over your head

1008
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:37,640
Yeah, like I may accidentally will you into that giant pile of fake shit at the Six Flags Fear Fest

1009
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:39,780
souls

1010
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:45,180
Accidentally because I get scared by a scare actor. So we'll see I'll do my best to not be scared. That's

1011
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:53,900
Solely BPA plastic all the BPA that they removed from plastic they put in the sewer of soul shit

1012
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:59,500
Yeah, yeah, have you done sewer of souls at Six Flags Fear Fest? No, we've never done Fright Fest. Oh, wow, really?

1013
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:02,780
Okay. We were thinking about doing it last year, but we just

1014
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:07,660
Never got around to it. I think it's worth it. They're doing a lot more IP whether that's a good thing or bad thing

1015
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:11,180
I don't know. Yeah, but it seems interesting. It was very intriguing

1016
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:16,300
Maybe this will be the year that we'll finally do it. We could all go in the sewer of souls together if you want if we

1017
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:18,300
Want to go on opening nights?

1018
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:22,660
Hopefully this year we do it everybody does it so everybody will get

1019
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:25,620
to walk the like

1020
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:28,420
50 miles that you end up walking when you go to Six Flags

1021
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:32,660
Because of how it spread out the park is and how confusing the layout is still to this day to me

1022
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:38,340
But let's go back to Disney treasure. So how many how many different crew that Disney cruises have you been on?

1023
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:46,980
Good question. I know that I am a gold level. So how many is that? That sounds impressive. That's at least five. Wow, okay

1024
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:48,980
It's under 10. I don't know what the

1025
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:56,420
Number is but like we've been on every Disney ship except for the dream. Yeah, okay right now currently there's how many six?

1026
01:03:56,420 --> 01:04:01,860
Yeah, we've been on at least five of them. Okay, and they're all in the Disney like those 15 Disney approved words

1027
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:04,780
So the treasure the dream

1028
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:08,340
The is there a wish there's the wish there's the way

1029
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:10,700
fantasy

1030
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:15,980
Magic and the wonder magic. Okay, we don't have believe yet. So maybe believe might be like

1031
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:20,660
This year they're coming out with the destiny and the adventure destiny feels like a new one

1032
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:23,820
Yeah, as far as Disney approved words. Yeah, so that's interesting

1033
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:31,620
Okay, the weird thing with destiny is there's no Star Wars on the ship and you think like I know you're recently down on Star Wars

1034
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:35,900
But I feel like out of all their properties destiny when I think destiny I think like

1035
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:38,300
You know the hero's journey

1036
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:43,540
Skywalker saga sure. Yeah, that makes sense and there's Star Wars like do they have most of the

1037
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:50,860
IP on all the ships like there's always like a little Marvel something a little Star Wars something like the newer ships

1038
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:57,180
Yes, the older ships are more like nautical themed. So not as themed the four legacy ships

1039
01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:00,500
the older ships were kind of made during like

1040
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:04,340
the Michael Eisner times the glory days

1041
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:06,340
According to

1042
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:16,060
Yeah, do you remember the big red boat I've seen YouTube documentaries of a vibe don't remember I it was just I think they

1043
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:18,380
subcontracted with a

1044
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:20,380
Cruise company

1045
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:24,180
I only know

1046
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:30,620
Remember it because of the commercials on vacation planning VHS is or parades and stuff

1047
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:36,100
But it's interesting because you go on the older Disney ships and it feels very Michael Eisner in that

1048
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:39,580
He was kind of almost like

1049
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:45,460
Embarrassed to have like Mickey and friend like, you know, I mean like yeah. Yeah, like when he opened DCA

1050
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:52,620
There's no Mickey and friends right Kingdom. No Mickey and friend like so like the lobbies this it feels like the Golden Age of

1051
01:05:53,500 --> 01:06:00,140
Cruising but it doesn't feel Disney in any way. There's like some carvings of Mickey like, you know, look subtle

1052
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:04,800
Yeah, right. So I mean that's what he was into and I I think those earlier boats were less

1053
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:09,740
Themed than the new boats and that's why I like the new boats. They're like, they're really themed out

1054
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:15,780
There's tons of IP all over the place and the adventure like so the new boats are the wish and the adventure

1055
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:20,800
The wish came out like right at the end of the pen measure. You mean or sorry wish in the treasure

1056
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:28,100
Why keep on say it's weird because the theme of the treasurer's adventure is very adventure

1057
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:35,820
And there's all these adventure shows adventure land theming and they should have called that the adventure

1058
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:38,440
I think and the theme of the wish is kind of like fairy tale

1059
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:43,500
Magic. Okay. Yeah princess. That's it. That's confusing

1060
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:46,100
but also

1061
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:51,820
Aladdin is on the treasure. Not the one that is called wish which is but

1062
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:56,900
The theme of treasure wishing

1063
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:03,780
But the cool thing about the treasure I think that you guys I know

1064
01:07:04,460 --> 01:07:09,900
Nobody in the podcast the ride group has been on dizzying. No, I know this is one of the areas where we have not

1065
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:19,100
Indulged or experienced in which I just there's a we were both we met like strangers the other day not strangers

1066
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:21,100
I guess they weren't my neighbors of yours

1067
01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:23,820
But they were like, hey, we just wanted a Disney Cruise

1068
01:07:23,820 --> 01:07:29,740
You got to do it a giant Disney Cruise bag. Yeah, yeah, and we were like, oh do you like and they're like, oh, we love it

1069
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:35,380
Right. It's awesome. And this was change your life. Yeah. Yeah, and this was just they didn't know like they didn't know who we were

1070
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:42,460
They just were giving us advice like as a human to another human, but the reason why I think you'd like the treasure

1071
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:49,120
Most is it's the it is a cruise ship made for theme park fans, right?

1072
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:53,060
Because it has spaces based on Haunted Mansion based on

1073
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:57,040
Jungle Cruise based on 20,000 Leagues Under Sea. Yeah

1074
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:03,680
Yeah, so it's like that that is yeah enticing to me more so now it's hard because I want to hand the old boats

1075
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:07,800
Are touched by Michael Eisner who's never never made a mistake in his life

1076
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:14,560
So I have to like his decisions there, but what you're describing is more what I want from my Disney experience

1077
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:17,840
Yeah, and some purists like those boats more because they're more

1078
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:24,440
Luxury more less like in-your-face Disney, but I kind of want the in-your-face Disney

1079
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:28,120
I don't want to go stay at a Disney hotel and not see

1080
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:33,160
Yeah, right, like I want Mickey to tuck me in. Yeah, I want like that

1081
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:36,400
Knott's Berry farm thing were like the elves elves tuck you in or what?

1082
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:38,880
Did you say?

1083
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:43,140
No, not Elvis. That's a Vegas is our Vegas service where Elvis tucks you. I'm sure

1084
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:49,280
On the Disney Cruise doesn't Mickey call you before you're bored. You're sailing. Yeah, I think so

1085
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:51,320
We did that like my very first Disney Cruise

1086
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:55,960
I don't know why we've never done it since but you could have like an automated call will happen to you like a

1087
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:58,960
week or something before your cruise and it's like maybe like

1088
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:04,720
Get excited to come on the crew like which is very magical. Don't forget to check maritime law

1089
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:20,200
Does Mickey have a wake-up call though with the resorts to like is Mickey the one who makes a wake-up call to you with?

1090
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:26,880
Or he does that's right for a while. You could request right you would like your birthday or something

1091
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:30,880
I'll call well now you could just go like do you want to wake a call from Mickey Goofy or Woody?

1092
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:36,780
Oh, so you choose the character you could choose the character. Yeah, okay, but goofy would forget to call you sometimes probably

1093
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:45,440
Like five days later, I totally forgot I set my alarm for 9 p.m. Not 9 a.m. I'm sorry

1094
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:49,840
I have time blindness. I can't tell time anymore

1095
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:55,640
Yeah, that's fun. I mean I want I want a lot of that. I really the number one thing

1096
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:58,280
I want is Mickey in a full

1097
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:02,720
Captain stooping loveboat outfit and an impeccable white

1098
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:07,720
Sailor type suit captain suit and that's what they the newer ones for sure have that

1099
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:10,440
He has a nice little sailor suit on does he have

1100
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:16,600
Wait whatever you would call it does are there multiple outfits that Mickey has on the boats

1101
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:21,160
Do you do you see him in multiple outfits over the course of the weekend? Okay, so there's a pirate's night

1102
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:25,920
He'll dress up as a poet. Okay, there's like a formal night if you do one of the longer cruises

1103
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:29,040
He'll dress up in a tuxedo. Whoo. I love tuxedo

1104
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:35,080
He's got his he's got his classic like sailor outfit or outfit. Is there another if you go on an Alaskan cruise?

1105
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:37,880
Yes, he wears like a little

1106
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:43,160
Parka I guess yeah, right Eskimo outfit. I don't know right, right

1107
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:46,880
Okay, cuz that's that's good to know because I do want costume changes for Mickey

1108
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:47,120
Oh, yeah

1109
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:51,900
And then on the island the private islands that you go to which is like why we love Disney cruising so much

1110
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:54,880
He'll wear like his little board shorts and his

1111
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:57,480
special outfits

1112
01:10:57,480 --> 01:11:02,460
Yeah, I we we have we done. I mean we talk about Mickey's special outfits a lot on the show

1113
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:05,000
But I do we should try to do a conference

1114
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,800
Yeah, what's your favorite?

1115
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:13,920
Decades of special outfits if you ever do an episode on special outfits, you need to get Disney Dan

1116
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,860
I'm not sure if you've ever seen his YouTube channel

1117
01:11:15,860 --> 01:11:20,820
Yeah, literally just does the costumes of Disney and he's right so great out

1118
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:26,300
He may maybe he already has like a Google document of all the special outfits is a wiki

1119
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:33,720
Yeah, yeah, cuz it would be I there's so much stuff like that that I wish there was a comprehensive list of like

1120
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:37,500
Here's every outfit Mickey wore in 1985

1121
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:41,920
Like and I just a picture of all of it. I know one took that good a record

1122
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:46,320
So I'm sure there's clothes that he wore that just like there's no picture of it. We don't know

1123
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:49,320
like what did he yeah, like what did he wear at

1124
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:52,080
the what is the

1125
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:58,160
State Fair like do we know all the outfits Mickey wore at State Fair the limited time event 30 years ago

1126
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:02,160
I don't think we do but somebody I wish there's like Polaroids in a box

1127
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:06,560
Yeah, East Berlin Mickey the wall just fell and he finally got Levi's

1128
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:11,180
In East Berlin Mickey, yeah, that would be good

1129
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:18,120
So all the characters are like the main five or six also are both are all on the boat

1130
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:24,920
Yeah, and do they all have the wardrobe changes like they all kind of dress similarly. Okay, that's that's good

1131
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:26,960
That's again. This is a good check in the right

1132
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:33,480
Characters, I would say a Disney Cruise is the best place to meet them because they're very easy to meet

1133
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:36,000
They're always around and the lines are usually pretty short

1134
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:38,160
Okay, and do they have like

1135
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:42,600
You can't meet Star Wars characters or do is a chewy on the boat aren't some of these boats

1136
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:45,840
They used to have a Star Wars day at sea

1137
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:49,920
We're like the characters would be around on the new ships like on the treasure

1138
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:55,320
They have a Star Wars area in the kids club. Okay, which you could go as an adult without children

1139
01:12:55,320 --> 01:13:00,000
You could go into special times. They'll allow everyone to go in right and they had stormtroopers

1140
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:05,360
They're chewy in Ray. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so they're not just wandering which is a shame

1141
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:08,680
I wish chewy was just but I think that's why our outfit on and was walking around

1142
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:09,520
Yeah

1143
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:13,800
But I think that's one thing a lot of people that wonder that have never been on Disney Cruise like why would I want to?

1144
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:18,200
Go on a cruise with all the you know, there's tons of children right whatever a lot of the children

1145
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:22,360
Just go to the kids club. Okay, and I think that's the pro tip for a parent

1146
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:27,240
Right is literally you can drop the kids off in the kids club and then go have your own fun

1147
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:32,320
You can park them there basically and they they love it. So yeah, like there's an area of that

1148
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:37,200
That's an imagineering and they can like design rides. Oh, that's cool looks really cool

1149
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:40,960
Yeah, can an adult also design a ride if they wanted to or is that only kids?

1150
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:46,800
But they do have open houses. Yeah, but yes, I'm the right you could just look at the little station

1151
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:50,000
That is a mistake though, because I would like to design a ride

1152
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:55,640
Am I the only one who has been on a cruise period? Okay, so has my family

1153
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:58,280
went on a cruise in like

1154
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:00,560
1997

1155
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:02,560
New York to like Bermuda

1156
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:08,680
Which is of course a fun vacation island in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean

1157
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:17,680
There's a triangle there, huh? Well, I was you don't have to tell me twice about the triangle I was

1158
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:24,480
So scared going I was a nervous child. I was an anxious child was terrified the Bermuda Triangle and

1159
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:26,160
And

1160
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:30,120
1997 there's Titanic stuff everywhere. There's documentaries on TV

1161
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:35,080
there's kids books about like what happened at the Titanic and of course the

1162
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:42,800
You know hit movie and I was so scared and for whatever reason no adult took me aside to go like

1163
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:45,680
Listen to me. There's no icebergs

1164
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:51,640
Don't have to worry about this the ship is not going to sink

1165
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:54,640
Because of that

1166
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:57,560
but yeah, it was a

1167
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:02,000
Lot of yeah, we were put at the kids club a lot

1168
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:08,840
We certainly had days at the pool and like we all got packed together for like breakfast and

1169
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:15,640
Dinner and I was like the age where you got the the stamp on your badge

1170
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:21,040
Like is everyone wore names tags or whatever I could wander the ship myself

1171
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:26,440
My brother was just a little too young to do that and he was very mad that I could do that

1172
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:31,360
But there I mean there there is

1173
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:37,960
There's a lot more stuff on cruise ship nowadays for sure. I mean we ate dinner

1174
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:41,000
I think at the same place every night. We always had the same

1175
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:43,640
Waiter I know this has

1176
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:50,040
Rotational dining do they call it where yeah, you do different restaurants with the waitstaff comes with you

1177
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:52,040
So you see the same people?

1178
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:56,200
But I my big memory of

1179
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:01,040
That cruise were midnight buffets

1180
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:03,680
Yeah, that's not a thing anymore

1181
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:05,720
Yeah

1182
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:07,720
There's also no casinos on

1183
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:15,560
Yeah, okay, there's some sort of gambling I could read the table on that

1184
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:19,420
You mean you would win you could do good. Yeah hustle people at bingo

1185
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:24,360
We had a friend that won she won like the big jackpot

1186
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:30,840
The big jackpot yeah

1187
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:34,560
Yeah, that's the soft like preparing everyone for the gambling

1188
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:39,360
Peter you want a bunch at a slot machine on the cruise ship

1189
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:41,360
Oh, yeah

1190
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:49,160
Royal Caribbean, yeah, they have a fun casino on their ships. Yeah, I won. How much did I end up winning like 6,000? No

1191
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:53,280
Like 4,000 maybe still a lot

1192
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:59,740
Like you rock up points in the casino

1193
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:02,600
points, yeah, thank God

1194
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:08,180
Though so they'll offer you like free cruises and you get like free drink depending on what level you are

1195
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:10,340
They want their money back. Yeah

1196
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:17,340
Yeah, I don't I think works I think Disney will have slot machines in

1197
01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:19,780
Say 10 within 10 years

1198
01:17:19,780 --> 01:17:23,940
I was really hoping the one in Singapore was gonna have a casino because it was

1199
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:29,940
They've bought a ship off of somebody and I think they're originally was supposed to be a casino in it, right?

1200
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:31,940
But they wiped it and now

1201
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:37,140
Mm-hmm. Yeah, will there be let's let's all do we think within 10 years?

1202
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:41,700
There'll be like a slot machine on Disney property. Well, they're getting into sports batting

1203
01:17:42,860 --> 01:17:49,100
SPN and there'll be like laws especially the laws in this country will be a little looser and going forward in the next few years

1204
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:56,340
so I feel like I feel like everyone's gonna have a gambling addiction in the country and there will be like you will be able to like

1205
01:17:57,180 --> 01:17:59,180
Play a slot machine while you're on Pirates of the Caribbean

1206
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:05,380
Play virtual blackjack on parts three fun

1207
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:07,900
I mean, I want to I don't smoke cigarettes

1208
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:12,700
But I'd love to smoke a cigarette on Pirates of the Caribbean and I would love to play blackjack while I'm on Pirates of the Caribbean

1209
01:18:13,540 --> 01:18:19,660
So I see that happening once if at least if there's just like a blackjack night at Disneyland where every ride has a blackjack dealer

1210
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:25,260
It'd be something, you know Tiki room you're watching the show and you're playing blackjack or something

1211
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:28,700
You could see that you can move out a couple benches doesn't seem like too hard

1212
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:30,620
Yeah, right right now

1213
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:34,420
I know Disney doesn't allow like the IP of their properties to be on some machines

1214
01:18:34,420 --> 01:18:38,500
But like when star before Star Wars was bought by Disney they had Star Wars. Oh, right. Yeah

1215
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:43,220
I remember once they bought it like they were like no, right? Yeah, right. They all disappeared

1216
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:47,420
Yeah, well, it's something like I'm not saying that's a bad thing that disappeared with that

1217
01:18:47,420 --> 01:18:54,500
but the other thing like I feel like I feel like alien and predator like I could see a slot machine being alien and

1218
01:18:54,740 --> 01:19:00,860
Disney owns them but like the slot machine the slot machines are wild though. Now, it's like there's a Whitney Houston slot

1219
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:03,460
Oh, yeah, I'm like, okay

1220
01:19:03,540 --> 01:19:08,660
So like it's interesting like what just gets because those screens are now digital so you can like sub out

1221
01:19:09,260 --> 01:19:13,300
properties or pop stars, I guess so it's very like

1222
01:19:13,820 --> 01:19:18,620
You can see the Whitney and then you can see a hot stuff a little devil slot machine

1223
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:21,580
Like they're next to each other and you're like, well, this seems very random

1224
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:27,140
But ultimately, I don't know I don't know if it's a good thing that like Mickey isn't on a slot machine

1225
01:19:27,140 --> 01:19:29,140
I guess it's probably a good

1226
01:19:31,220 --> 01:19:36,140
Someone make a steamboat welly slot machine now, that's true technically. Yes

1227
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:41,500
Yeah, no, I think for sure but it would have yeah, you just have to be wearing the right outfit

1228
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:45,140
Yeah, I want a bunch of money on the riverboat mouse machine

1229
01:19:47,380 --> 01:19:49,780
Or yeah, I guess you could like Popeye's I mean

1230
01:19:49,780 --> 01:19:52,220
I'm sure there was a Popeye slot machine, but that's public domain

1231
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:56,180
Now have you started production on your Popeye movie now that it's public domain

1232
01:19:56,180 --> 01:20:03,180
Hi, you know, we're still trying to beat out the script, you know, there's still where you play all the role cooks in the kitchen

1233
01:20:04,420 --> 01:20:06,420
It's mostly a story about wimpy

1234
01:20:06,860 --> 01:20:14,840
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, but it's yeah Steve's Allianz. Like yeah, you got to get Popeye in there. I'm like Steve. Let it go. Let it go

1235
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:20,440
So there there is you said, okay, there's jungle cruise stuff. There's

1236
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,360
What would I'm completely blinded mention?

1237
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:28,300
Which is the best thing ever crazy that seems like the thing

1238
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:32,160
Yeah, and that seems people keep on saying that's like why don't they build that in the parks?

1239
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:35,840
And I'll tell you why they don't build it because no one would ever leave. It's like right

1240
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:38,480
Yes, it's too

1241
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:41,360
It's too enticing like they would have to do the I mean

1242
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:45,080
They're still pretty aggressive about getting you out of the Cantina and Star Wars land

1243
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:45,600
Yeah

1244
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:51,480
But I do feel like people would really settle in a little more and if they built it exactly the way it seems to look

1245
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,920
Like on them or from what I've seen

1246
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,320
But I guess yeah, you could

1247
01:20:56,320 --> 01:21:01,200
It wouldn't be like are there I feel like part of the Cantina stuff is like standing makes you

1248
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:03,420
Like want to get out of there faster

1249
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:05,800
I know there's booths obviously too but like the last time I was in there

1250
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:10,280
It's like here stand by these 12 people and you only can have 30 to 45 minutes in here

1251
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:14,280
You got to get out of here to even the booths are awkward too. Yeah random people

1252
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:18,580
Yeah, as long if you're not with a big party you get put with other families and it's like right

1253
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:24,200
But I still don't understand why they why there aren't like seven of those rooms

1254
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:30,340
They're all slightly themed differently and then get people to sort of settle in and then you can still put a time limit on it

1255
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:35,600
Yeah, but it does seem like you would sell a lot more drinks and food. I know you don't want people getting hammered

1256
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:40,560
At Disney, but it'd be hard to get hammered on those they're very light

1257
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:44,800
yeah, but you would at least your lips would get very tingling if you did the

1258
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:48,160
Fuzzy tauntaun, which I do which I did

1259
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:52,800
I say this on the show that I took a big bite of the fuzzy tauntaun like six my did say this right right took

1260
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:58,360
A big bite of the foam that has all the copper nose. It went up my nose and I started coughing

1261
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:03,240
It was so embarrassed. I like lost I was like lost it

1262
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:05,360
Like it went in my nose

1263
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:10,200
I did not realize that it would have that effect and it took me like five minutes to recover

1264
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:15,680
And again, you're it's close quarters in there and there is just I couldn't like go and hide anywhere

1265
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:18,360
I just had to like kind of bury my head and like get down toward the ground

1266
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:24,760
So I could recover from having whatever that is that's in that foam. They're the most sanitary thing

1267
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:28,160
I know it's gonna sound awkward if you could go cough on Rex

1268
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:35,440
This cough toward Rex people yeah, and if and they're like you can go outside and cough, but you can't get back in

1269
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:38,560
The rules here

1270
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:45,000
But yeah, I know that like it feels like every ride that people like should have its own version of this

1271
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:50,320
yes, like and I've we've talked about this many times I think on the show where it's like I want like a

1272
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:53,280
Saloon that overlooks Big Thunder

1273
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:56,380
I know there's no room especially at Disneyland for that

1274
01:22:57,120 --> 01:23:03,080
If for some reason you could maybe I guess maybe you could get rid of the quick service right there and build something that's kind

1275
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:04,080
of elevated

1276
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,960
but it does feel like

1277
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:12,040
The next logical step of being a theme park weirdo is I just want to sit and watch the rides

1278
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:17,900
Like I don't believe yeah, I like the ride fine

1279
01:23:17,900 --> 01:23:20,640
But what I'd like even more is to sit and watch the ride

1280
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:25,960
Comfortable position for whatever reason that's that's part of it

1281
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:28,680
So yeah, so when you see stuff on the crew, you're like, why isn't this thing?

1282
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:31,680
Why can't I just sit in the Haunted Mansion when I go to Disneyland's?

1283
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:38,120
Why is this like and they're building what the Pirates there's building a Pirates bar in Florida?

1284
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:42,360
Yeah, so it's cool. They're doing that type of thing. But then there was a rumor there

1285
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:45,560
We're gonna build the tip-top club like permanent in

1286
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:49,280
Florida for the Tower of Terror, but they'd be awesome to that

1287
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:55,800
But yeah, I don't know I I wonder if it's what you're saying and it's like people will not leave

1288
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:57,880
You will have to kick them out of here

1289
01:23:57,880 --> 01:23:58,160
Yeah

1290
01:23:58,160 --> 01:24:04,880
They will be like there'll be claw marks on the carpet from people being dragged by security because they will not leave

1291
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:10,120
I mean, I think that's right, but in your videos you guys were saying like yeah

1292
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:13,760
You just walked into the Haunted Mansion park. Yeah, we got lucky

1293
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:17,680
It was we always managed to go in there when it was a good time and get a seat

1294
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:23,200
Well, I do is it like a reservation serve like system or you have to wait in a regular line if it's

1295
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:29,600
Yeah, you just go in but when the wish there's a Star Wars bar, which is not as cool as a Haunted Mansion bar

1296
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:30,360
Yeah

1297
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:35,520
But I think for the first few months of that like you had to like get a reservation and do all didn't you?

1298
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:37,780
Yeah, yeah, I know it's like very hard to get in this one

1299
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:40,360
We were kind of worried about that, but you just were able to walk in

1300
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:46,800
Mm-hmm. And is this the best of all like the themed bar restaurant areas on any of the ships? Okay

1301
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:49,240
It's so cool in the middle of the bar. There's this

1302
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:57,320
Aquarium that has designs from Holy Crump and it looks amazing. I saw a picture of this. Yes has ghost fish in it

1303
01:24:57,320 --> 01:25:01,800
Yeah ghost fish. They'll sing during like the song one while the songs are playing and stuff

1304
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:05,200
So there's some of like didn't they just it's like some of his like sketches

1305
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:09,000
They didn't use like the Museum of the Weird Stuff that they didn't use and they've put it in here

1306
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:14,800
Which is nice because sometimes you're like I'm worried like that. They've like fired everyone who knows history

1307
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:21,480
Do do you think one of the cruise ships should have a big doll garage themed?

1308
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:29,300
With Jay and everything I think so maybe not Disney one. Well, Jay was in Superstar Luma, right?

1309
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:39,400
Yes, oh yeah, well with it will there be a Tron bar on one of these if this next Tron is a hits

1310
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:44,920
How many more times will they try with Tron? Ah the first drawn that's a hit

1311
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:52,080
2060 Tron bar would be cool. But a Tron bar would be cool. Yeah, cuz the aesthetic I

1312
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:55,040
Again, we're fans of the aesthetic of Tron

1313
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:59,960
We like the aesthetic of Tron a lot and like that it's around but it is interesting that we have this year

1314
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:04,680
It's another Tron try they're doing it right. I think so the Leto Tron. Oh, yeah

1315
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:07,640
legacy legacy areas

1316
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:13,040
Okay, okay, uh-huh. Yeah

1317
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,920
What so the honey mansion bar I

1318
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:24,000
Did think it was very funny when you you guys were spotlighting the like different soda

1319
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,760
they have like cream soda lemonade soda and

1320
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:32,760
Some of them they're like mixed with a cocktail and it's like I poured the wrong. So yeah, that was

1321
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:38,680
One of the drinks depends on you pouring the the sodas into it and the bartender told me he put

1322
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:42,640
You know one in front of one one in front of the other so it was his fault

1323
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:45,320
But so I did it that way. I'm not blaming him

1324
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:46,840
But it was usually awesome

1325
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:51,000
So we had to actually buy that drink twice and I thought like oh maybe they'll comp us for the first one

1326
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:51,640
So we didn't drink it

1327
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:57,080
No, we had to pay for it twice even though it was his fault that I poured the wrong soda in the wrong cocktail

1328
01:26:57,080 --> 01:27:00,880
But yeah now there is that was interesting. I mean

1329
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:05,880
Most your food is included on the cruise

1330
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:10,040
but there are upcharges of like if you want to go to the

1331
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:17,960
Fancy steakhouse or the bar. Can you buy a drink pass on the Disney not on Disney? No on the Royal?

1332
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:25,120
Yeah, I've recently done some surveys suggesting that maybe Disney's considering a drink package

1333
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:31,000
Okay, so what would that entail like that would just be like on an open bar essentially for you

1334
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:36,740
Once you pay one rail you pay the price changes depending on how much does it run like?

1335
01:27:37,740 --> 01:27:43,220
We did the math one time to figure out how many drinks we should be drinking to get our money's worth

1336
01:27:44,740 --> 01:27:48,540
Five or six a day to make your money's worth, uh-huh, and if we drink four

1337
01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:52,940
I'm like, I have to have one more I gotta do it our money is worth. Yeah, but so

1338
01:27:53,340 --> 01:27:58,700
That I don't know if they did it they would make so much more money. I think right probably

1339
01:27:58,740 --> 01:28:02,940
Yeah, did you see I mean, I guess there's a lot of families on these cruises

1340
01:28:02,940 --> 01:28:07,380
But like did anyone get they have to be like cut off. Is there a they go to Disney jail on the boat

1341
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:12,180
There has to I mean every boat is a jail. Yeah, I assume. Yeah. Yeah, they have to have a break

1342
01:28:12,180 --> 01:28:17,340
Yeah, break the break right the break. I've never seen it on a Disney cruise that I have noticed

1343
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:24,060
Royal people get a little you could tell people are like party. I'm royal sometimes right

1344
01:28:24,060 --> 01:28:28,700
I assume that Star Trek cruise that we talked about that that's that which is maybe the number one cruise

1345
01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:30,340
I want to go on and the Star Trek cruise

1346
01:28:30,340 --> 01:28:35,700
Yeah, I have to imagine that a couple people end up in the brig and they get excited because brig is

1347
01:28:37,140 --> 01:28:40,520
So they hope it's like a themed experience, which it's probably not

1348
01:28:41,540 --> 01:28:48,540
Are you guys excited for this for the Universal Fan Fest nights so excited for this for going on the Enterprise D

1349
01:28:48,540 --> 01:28:54,120
Which is from the Picard season 3 I am so and I I've sent an annoying email to

1350
01:28:54,980 --> 01:28:57,100
Universal Hollywood, but like I'm a Star Trek guy

1351
01:28:57,900 --> 01:28:59,900
Let me in let me see

1352
01:29:00,380 --> 01:29:04,420
And they're like, well, we're just figuring it out. I'm like, okay, but you don't know

1353
01:29:04,420 --> 01:29:12,180
I met Jonathan Franks and Burbank last year and I flipped out in a way that was maybe not smooth

1354
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:13,860
I might say

1355
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:18,620
So yes, I had that that specific like the back-to-future stuff. I know you went to a preview of yeah

1356
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:25,620
Yes, which which looked cool and like the back-to-future like they're doing a whole recreation of the clocktower scene

1357
01:29:25,980 --> 01:29:33,220
Which looks very cool and I'm excited about that and just to remind it's it's all the stuff is on one night

1358
01:29:33,220 --> 01:29:35,220
Yeah, so it's it's a little confusing

1359
01:29:36,540 --> 01:29:39,540
Nights, I think they were just trying to do Halloween horror nights

1360
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:45,980
Yeah, I know like yeah, it's all in one but you get Star Trek and back to the future and one piece

1361
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:48,780
all that's right the casting I

1362
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:53,460
Jane forwarded me the casting notices because she

1363
01:29:54,020 --> 01:29:56,780
And these were going around and it's very funny

1364
01:29:58,220 --> 01:30:00,220
Them trying to cast like

1365
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:03,620
anime characters, all right, I

1366
01:30:04,420 --> 01:30:11,140
feel like there's gonna be a lot of a long line to meet Luffy from one piece as opposed to the the

1367
01:30:11,660 --> 01:30:13,380
ogre from

1368
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:14,700
D&T

1369
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:19,980
Or me in line to meet the like 30 year old playing Riker or something. Yeah

1370
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:24,900
I'm a big fan of you're gonna have Yoshi. I'm excited for that. All right, Yoshi

1371
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:28,660
Yes, all the creatures in the Wizarding World to which are not all of them

1372
01:30:28,660 --> 01:30:32,520
But a lot of them we got to see when we were in Japan because they just have them. Oh, okay

1373
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:34,520
So it's cool that they're bringing it here

1374
01:30:34,540 --> 01:30:40,220
Yeah, one of my biggest regrets of not doing something in my life is that Star Trek experience that they had

1375
01:30:40,220 --> 01:30:43,340
I know me too, and I feel like this is gonna be the closest thing

1376
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:47,460
Yes, and there is some cuz it you didn't the it's not built yet, right?

1377
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:52,340
You didn't get to go in the enterprise or anything cuz like something had raised like a walkthrough and like somebody attacks

1378
01:30:52,340 --> 01:30:54,940
I assume Borg maybe they didn't say who okay

1379
01:30:54,940 --> 01:31:00,380
It seems like the Borg has to be the one and they also said you're gonna get to experience the being at the end of it

1380
01:31:00,380 --> 01:31:01,900
You're gonna get beamed out

1381
01:31:01,900 --> 01:31:04,180
Which is what they did in the Vegas one

1382
01:31:04,180 --> 01:31:10,100
Yeah, I may I may like weep a little bit going on the bridge of the enterprise and that's not a joke

1383
01:31:10,100 --> 01:31:14,580
That's just like that's that's what I guess other than like going the X-Men's mansion

1384
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:19,780
It was like I wanted to live on the enterprise when I was a kid and this we'll see it

1385
01:31:19,780 --> 01:31:24,180
We'll see if it if it happens. I'm I I'll hide it in the moment if anyone's with me

1386
01:31:24,740 --> 01:31:30,360
But I will bring it up on the show if it happens the one thing that they showed us that they didn't release

1387
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:38,340
Pictures of is for the Dungeons and Dragons thing. It's like oh, it's a walkthrough kind of like a Halloween Horror Nights house

1388
01:31:38,340 --> 01:31:40,340
Oh, that's cool. Yeah

1389
01:31:40,420 --> 01:31:44,080
The bad guy I don't know anything about D&D but the bad guy is like this

1390
01:31:44,580 --> 01:31:45,540
ball

1391
01:31:45,540 --> 01:31:47,060
creature thing

1392
01:31:47,060 --> 01:31:49,060
They had Jim Henson

1393
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:55,460
Studio build this like puppets like oh really teen feet tall. It looks insane. That's great

1394
01:31:55,460 --> 01:32:02,260
Yeah, I mean this is a I hope this works because this feels like a great way to do just other non-scary stuff

1395
01:32:02,380 --> 01:32:06,700
Yeah, and to get at least like temporary walkthroughs because there's so much stuff

1396
01:32:06,700 --> 01:32:13,740
We like that's not quite like it doesn't make sense for a corporation to approve a budget for a 500 million dollar ride

1397
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:15,660
It's unfair

1398
01:32:15,660 --> 01:32:17,060
But that's the reality

1399
01:32:17,060 --> 01:32:22,260
So at the very least if you can get little immersive things in these parks that have a good budget

1400
01:32:22,540 --> 01:32:25,620
You'll at least get some of it. Like I want to Ninja Turtles

1401
01:32:25,620 --> 01:32:27,300
I know there's Ninja Turtle rides

1402
01:32:27,300 --> 01:32:33,140
But maybe this is how you get a Ninja Turtle thing in a theme park at a pretty high level

1403
01:32:33,740 --> 01:32:39,300
Because it still seems like none of the movies nude or shows or whatever are popular enough for them to put again

1404
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:42,420
$500 million into a turtles ride that it deserves

1405
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:50,780
You keep walking through the Frankenstein parking garage at Universal Hollywood and going lays there any turtles Steph

1406
01:32:50,980 --> 01:32:56,100
Right left over from 1990 when they did that you did the walk through here, right?

1407
01:32:56,100 --> 01:33:01,140
But like going yet you can build a sewer and put some turtles and suits and I'll weep about that

1408
01:33:01,140 --> 01:33:07,460
I'll weep meeting Michelangelo. Like I weep when I met you just need to have a good cry Michael. Sure

1409
01:33:08,340 --> 01:33:12,820
Some stuff out. Oh, that's true. But it's help. It helps if it was a character

1410
01:33:12,820 --> 01:33:14,340
I liked when I was a kid, okay

1411
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:17,660
It helps me to cry as I said on the episode with Matt Mazzani

1412
01:33:17,860 --> 01:33:22,500
It's interesting and this is my personal feeling maybe I think other people feel similarly

1413
01:33:22,700 --> 01:33:29,420
It's interesting being an adult because sometimes you need to have things like movies TV music or theme park experiences

1414
01:33:29,660 --> 01:33:35,580
Force you to cry like it needs to be extracted from you in some ways and I'm being serious like yeah

1415
01:33:35,580 --> 01:33:38,740
It's weird cuz you like all the time. Why am I tearing up at this?

1416
01:33:39,740 --> 01:33:41,740
There's so much misery in the world

1417
01:33:42,220 --> 01:33:49,100
that like it's just like I see it and I don't process it and then I like start crying because I see like data's console a

1418
01:33:50,220 --> 01:33:55,460
Recreation of it and you're like, what is this about? Oh, it's I needed to do this

1419
01:33:55,460 --> 01:33:56,420
It needed like yeah

1420
01:33:56,420 --> 01:34:00,460
It was just a functional thing my brain needed to do and it's looking for an opportunity to do it

1421
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:08,300
What's very weird catcher? I feel like some scare actors got you pretty good less crying more screaming at some of those house

1422
01:34:08,820 --> 01:34:15,780
Expression too. They like to get me. It's so much fun though. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, my daughter loves to be scared already

1423
01:34:16,140 --> 01:34:18,620
She loves to like oh, it's interesting

1424
01:34:18,620 --> 01:34:21,420
We'll see if it lasts cuz like this stuff switches fast with kids

1425
01:34:21,620 --> 01:34:24,380
But like she likes like hiding and then you come in and like ah

1426
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:30,740
Or she likes when I take the my leatherhead turtle figure and like oh, ah, she got like she jumps but like starts cackling

1427
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:33,100
So like that's interesting too

1428
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:38,060
Cuz like that's just like an early thing that people seem to like obviously she knows that it's her parents

1429
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:42,820
And it's not actually a big alligator that's attacking her. But still it's interesting to see that

1430
01:34:42,820 --> 01:34:47,380
I always see people at HHM, especially in Hollywood with like their six-year-old or like

1431
01:34:48,620 --> 01:34:54,300
Yeah, there's strollers that they change at always make me laugh. You'll see that at Six Flags for sure

1432
01:34:55,300 --> 01:34:57,580
A lot of kids at Six Flags and yes

1433
01:34:57,580 --> 01:35:01,660
Some of them seem to enjoy it and then some of them are being punished by their parents

1434
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:06,020
Some of them couldn't get a sitter for their kids and now they are going to suffer

1435
01:35:06,620 --> 01:35:09,460
Because of it or I guess maybe one parent waits with them outside

1436
01:35:10,340 --> 01:35:16,300
But we've all seen kids being forced onto a ride. They don't want to go on too. Oh, yeah, and that is

1437
01:35:16,980 --> 01:35:18,980
Weird that is something

1438
01:35:18,980 --> 01:35:23,300
It's right of passage just like you know, some of it is though. It depends

1439
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:26,940
I've seen kids going please don't make me do this

1440
01:35:27,460 --> 01:35:30,600
Like it'll be fine and and then it's not fine like

1441
01:35:30,980 --> 01:35:36,000
Yeah, you have to know your kid since sometimes I feel like parents are just like I have whatever and then sometimes

1442
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:39,500
It's like yeah, I know my kid will like this once they do it, which is

1443
01:35:40,340 --> 01:35:42,340
What happened to me at a certain point?

1444
01:35:44,100 --> 01:35:51,220
No, I was my mom held us off like doing anything for a while like I was too old by the time I did certain things

1445
01:35:51,780 --> 01:35:53,780
But yeah, yeah, it's interesting

1446
01:35:55,940 --> 01:35:57,940
School dance on Jeopard

1447
01:35:57,940 --> 01:36:01,940
Well, that's true. There's a lot of there's a long list of that of that type of thing

1448
01:36:02,940 --> 01:36:09,580
So crew like is there like I guess yeah, there's no midnight buffet on these cruises, but like is there

1449
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:14,580
Like is it a wake up at 7 a.m. Go to bed at 10

1450
01:36:14,580 --> 01:36:19,100
Is that the sort of vibe of the ship basically or is it like everybody can do whatever they like?

1451
01:36:19,100 --> 01:36:25,300
Will you find people like roaming around at 3 a.m. I will say Disney cruise specifically. We've only ever done royal in Disney

1452
01:36:25,820 --> 01:36:27,700
Disney shuts down pretty

1453
01:36:27,780 --> 01:36:30,900
Pretty early, right? I feel like they shut down the food

1454
01:36:30,900 --> 01:36:37,220
They there are some like adult game shows and stuff you could go to or silent disco or whatever, right?

1455
01:36:37,380 --> 01:36:42,880
But uh, they have this thing on all the Disney cruise is called match your mate, which is kind of like

1456
01:36:44,260 --> 01:36:50,700
What is the the show that it's based on newly was like the newlywed game but like so like singles will go or no

1457
01:36:51,540 --> 01:36:57,380
sorry, like a new like newlyweds somebody who's been married forever and then somebody in between and

1458
01:36:57,700 --> 01:37:00,220
It's always like the highlight of the cruise

1459
01:37:01,660 --> 01:37:04,420
Out and then like they'll ask them questions like, you know

1460
01:37:06,380 --> 01:37:08,340
Describe your love life

1461
01:37:08,340 --> 01:37:12,960
It's funny because they do did its risque, but it's Disney. So they'll bring you like

1462
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:17,660
Let's describe your love life and a Disney song. Is it?

1463
01:37:20,540 --> 01:37:22,540
Whole new world

1464
01:37:22,580 --> 01:37:25,980
Almost there under the sea. What was the other one?

1465
01:37:26,620 --> 01:37:30,260
Remember but it's so good first time in forever be prepared. Yeah

1466
01:37:35,340 --> 01:37:38,820
Fire yeah, yeah, that's it. Okay, that's interesting

1467
01:37:38,820 --> 01:37:41,820
I don't I have not seen a video of that cuz we we talked

1468
01:37:41,820 --> 01:37:46,820
What was this? What was the villain show called the weird Hollywood squares show? Yeah, that is weird

1469
01:37:46,980 --> 01:37:52,700
Yeah, and it's all pre-recorded like but people playing the villains. It's not like cartoon versions of the villains

1470
01:37:53,340 --> 01:37:58,380
There's like this is like a human being hostess. It's not one of the Disney characters, right? Yeah, it's a human being

1471
01:37:58,380 --> 01:38:03,460
Okay, almost like on the Disney treasure. They introduced this new show. There was an Indiana Jones

1472
01:38:03,980 --> 01:38:09,140
Themed choose wisely choose wisely like choose your own adventure and it was the highlight

1473
01:38:09,820 --> 01:38:15,680
By far. Yeah, so they have these new characters called coriander and stage and they're like improv actors

1474
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:21,260
They've brought on to kind of be almost like your your host for the cruise and they do things every night

1475
01:38:21,260 --> 01:38:25,980
Yeah, but they're they're kind of like dressed up like they're from Agrabah or something

1476
01:38:26,540 --> 01:38:32,660
But they do a show one night in the adult area called Indiana Jones choose wisely in it

1477
01:38:32,820 --> 01:38:39,940
They reenact moments from Indiana Jones and the audience gets to choose what direction

1478
01:38:39,940 --> 01:38:42,860
Oh, they go in and like so it'll be like

1479
01:38:44,220 --> 01:38:50,020
The moment from last crusade and there's the the Holy Grail. There's a goofy cup and there's a

1480
01:38:51,940 --> 01:38:57,540
Sipper from 7-eleven and like the audience gets to choose what which one should he choose and like what happens and it's funny

1481
01:38:57,540 --> 01:39:02,420
because like sometimes they'll choose the right way and see what happens sometimes they'll choose the goofy cup and

1482
01:39:02,780 --> 01:39:07,300
Everything goes wrong and like they so like by applause. They'll choose. Yeah. Okay

1483
01:39:07,340 --> 01:39:13,940
It's so much fun and they have like references to you know, the ride from Disneyland or you know, it's

1484
01:39:14,540 --> 01:39:20,180
It's a lot of fun. So it's yeah, it's interactive, but then it's also for the Disney everything

1485
01:39:20,180 --> 01:39:22,500
Everything still has a little Disney in it

1486
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:23,180
Yeah

1487
01:39:23,180 --> 01:39:29,260
That is interesting cuz I wonder if like that newlywed game is like did anybody ever say anything like crazy. Yes

1488
01:39:29,260 --> 01:39:35,180
Oh, that's that happened. Yes every single time we watch that show people will say the craziest things

1489
01:39:35,180 --> 01:39:38,060
And I'm just like and then you see them for the rest of the cruise

1490
01:39:38,060 --> 01:39:43,900
Could you give a like remember them do you remember one specifically? I mean you have to be you could you could clean it up

1491
01:39:43,900 --> 01:39:47,820
I suppose if you don't want to I don't have a good memory

1492
01:39:47,860 --> 01:39:49,300
I can't think of like a good one

1493
01:39:49,300 --> 01:39:51,300
but like one time they're like asking like

1494
01:39:51,340 --> 01:39:57,100
The most risky place you've ever like gotten it on and someone was like on the treasure or like like

1495
01:40:00,700 --> 01:40:02,700
Risky but like yeah

1496
01:40:03,700 --> 01:40:09,160
Earlier in our bedroom on the treasure and it's like why are you tell like right people go a little wild in front of the crowd

1497
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:12,380
Probably yeah, and then that I'm sure that gets a good reaction though

1498
01:40:12,380 --> 01:40:14,580
I mean, that's not a risky one, but like risque one

1499
01:40:15,540 --> 01:40:21,580
Just say things near like what is they like feed them free drinks throughout the thing so they're feeling a little

1500
01:40:21,860 --> 01:40:28,860
Yeah loose, I guess that still feels like risky for anything related to Disney. So I give them credit for that

1501
01:40:28,860 --> 01:40:33,020
What do they win? Don't they you just win like a bottle of champagne or something at the end nothing like yeah

1502
01:40:34,060 --> 01:40:38,060
So you're not doing it for $10,000. You're doing it for a bottle of champagne

1503
01:40:38,060 --> 01:40:43,980
Yeah, trivia events throughout the day that will usually do and lose but like if you win that you just win like a medal

1504
01:40:44,220 --> 01:40:47,720
right, do you is there like

1505
01:40:48,460 --> 01:40:55,460
Like I'm guess I'm trying to say like are there things where now they've really expanded the the the theming

1506
01:40:55,460 --> 01:41:00,940
Is there like a plus-up that you're like now that you've you know, you're going to theme park so often

1507
01:41:00,940 --> 01:41:05,400
You're like I wish they could do this or like I know they can't build like a crazy big ride on it

1508
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:10,380
They can do little things or like is there something you would be like if they only did this it would be the greatest

1509
01:41:10,940 --> 01:41:16,940
Cruise of all time. Do you have these feelings or I want a lazy river on a cruise? Oh, that's a great idea

1510
01:41:16,940 --> 01:41:21,580
Does any ship have it? I know there's these giant crazy new boats that look like they could do anything

1511
01:41:21,580 --> 01:41:26,420
But I know on the the new ship that's coming out of Singapore the new Disney ship the adventure

1512
01:41:26,420 --> 01:41:31,740
They're gonna have like a roller coaster on it. They're they actually have some like wrong. Yeah. Yeah, I've seen this

1513
01:41:31,740 --> 01:41:34,420
I don't remember what the other two rides are. I think they're like

1514
01:41:34,820 --> 01:41:37,340
Spinner rides or something, which I just think right so cool

1515
01:41:37,340 --> 01:41:44,380
I'm like why have they never done this before it's the the treasure has an attraction, right? It has the aqua mouse

1516
01:41:44,380 --> 01:41:46,460
Oh, which is a water coaster

1517
01:41:47,020 --> 01:41:53,100
Which is some screens in it and audio cues and yeah, and the aqua mouse is not the aqua duck

1518
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:56,060
Similar but different. Okay. Yeah

1519
01:41:56,060 --> 01:42:01,940
Yeah, the aqua mouse that has like the little videos as you go up the conveyor belt and the aqua duck is just like a classic

1520
01:42:02,420 --> 01:42:06,940
Water coaster. Yeah. Yeah, very fun. I want a lazy river

1521
01:42:06,940 --> 01:42:08,380
I was gonna say like lazy river

1522
01:42:08,380 --> 01:42:12,900
I guess you would the way you would probably have to do it just on the top deck or

1523
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:16,340
I guess not that's too heavy or something. Yeah

1524
01:42:17,020 --> 01:42:18,740
Yeah

1525
01:42:18,740 --> 01:42:23,340
Could I but like is there a way you could like have it be on the bottom of the boat and have it be like

1526
01:42:23,620 --> 01:42:25,620
translucent or something

1527
01:42:25,780 --> 01:42:31,620
It's like a glass bottom boat, right? So you could kind of see the ocean or a little bit. That's a great idea

1528
01:42:31,940 --> 01:42:33,940
I'm trying

1529
01:42:34,860 --> 01:42:40,260
Yeah, we're big lazy river fans on this show I feel Jason I want to speak for you, but I'm well

1530
01:42:40,980 --> 01:42:42,980
Yeah

1531
01:42:43,100 --> 01:42:45,100
So understated so I

1532
01:42:45,420 --> 01:42:48,780
Was winding up as if I was gonna go like I hate them

1533
01:42:49,460 --> 01:42:53,900
But you couldn't turn against your beloved lazy rivers favorite lazy river

1534
01:42:53,900 --> 01:42:57,860
I'm gonna say volcano Bay the fast moving reason. Oh

1535
01:42:58,860 --> 01:43:04,900
I'm the one who's done that and I who I guess so. That's a great question. I'm trying to think the

1536
01:43:05,780 --> 01:43:11,540
So Blizzard Beach lazy river is pretty good is my memory served as I'm correct aiming right?

1537
01:43:11,540 --> 01:43:14,620
There's some good theming. There's some pretty good to never done that

1538
01:43:15,700 --> 01:43:18,540
You guys need to go to a Lonnie is that yeah

1539
01:43:18,540 --> 01:43:25,420
I know we have you ever been to Atlantis in the Bahamas the Bahamas. No, they have this fast-moving lazy river that like

1540
01:43:26,420 --> 01:43:28,420
Many people get hurt every day

1541
01:43:31,660 --> 01:43:35,500
Like like was bleeding I don't think I ever would do it again it was that scary

1542
01:43:36,780 --> 01:43:42,420
They also a day the water slide that goes through the shark tank is that right? Okay, that was fun

1543
01:43:42,420 --> 01:43:50,300
And the the the bridge the walk that connects the two giant bit the bridges on top. I feel like yes

1544
01:43:50,900 --> 01:43:53,180
pedestrian yeah, yeah, yeah, I

1545
01:43:54,180 --> 01:43:57,340
Yeah, that I feel like in the early 2000s

1546
01:43:58,700 --> 01:44:03,700
Television channels were just bombarded with atlantis. Oh my gosh. Yeah when we finally got to go there

1547
01:44:03,700 --> 01:44:07,900
I was like it was the greatest moment of my life just because I'd seen it so much on TV

1548
01:44:08,340 --> 01:44:11,540
It lives up to the hype I'd say. Oh good. That's cool

1549
01:44:12,420 --> 01:44:17,020
You go. Oh, I was gonna say let me ask about the cruising because it does seem like

1550
01:44:17,940 --> 01:44:25,020
There's a there's a lot of stuff to do every how modular like how adjustable is

1551
01:44:25,780 --> 01:44:30,540
Or the Disney Cruises because I think when I go to the theme parks

1552
01:44:30,540 --> 01:44:36,300
I am like the operations person's worst night like I like to plan a little

1553
01:44:36,300 --> 01:44:42,060
But I like some wiggle room and I like to change my mind at the drop of a hat if I'm not up for it

1554
01:44:42,860 --> 01:44:48,180
You know how much in the cruising can you just bail and just go get room service?

1555
01:44:49,260 --> 01:44:52,940
The only thing that you I mean you could we do do that sometimes

1556
01:44:52,940 --> 01:44:57,780
But the only thing that you have like a quote-unquote appointment for is your dinner time is the same time every night

1557
01:44:57,780 --> 01:45:01,380
And then if you want to go see the the big show, okay

1558
01:45:01,700 --> 01:45:05,980
But besides that you could do whatever the heck you want and then the beauty of a cruise

1559
01:45:05,980 --> 01:45:11,820
Did I think it makes it better than like what the parks are now because now you got to do like the the lightning lane

1560
01:45:11,820 --> 01:45:16,460
And like yeah ever and like here you can choose. I'm gonna do this trivia

1561
01:45:16,460 --> 01:45:21,980
I'll go meet goofy or I'll like you know you just I'll go to the pool deck like you can you really don't have to make

1562
01:45:23,100 --> 01:45:28,980
Reservations for almost anything and the dinners because there are like at all you can go to the

1563
01:45:29,900 --> 01:45:34,820
Signature or the fancy dining yeah, and like can you change that like hey?

1564
01:45:34,820 --> 01:45:39,060
We don't really want to go to this right could we just make a reservation or could we just

1565
01:45:39,340 --> 01:45:41,340
Have a snack instead

1566
01:45:41,580 --> 01:45:43,220
Set to where you're going

1567
01:45:43,220 --> 01:45:47,100
They do have some food you could get room service, or you could go up on the pool deck

1568
01:45:47,100 --> 01:45:49,100
But a lot of those actually close early

1569
01:45:49,620 --> 01:45:55,100
Yeah, so room services 24 room services. Okay room services 24 hours, and it's

1570
01:45:55,780 --> 01:45:59,060
Included yeah on a lot of cruise ships you have to pay like an extra fee

1571
01:45:59,340 --> 01:46:04,900
So that is the beauty of it as many as many get like Mickey bars whatever you want is anywhere

1572
01:46:05,060 --> 01:46:07,060
That could be a video for me

1573
01:46:07,580 --> 01:46:09,580
Bars, I try to push it and see how many

1574
01:46:10,820 --> 01:46:15,760
Right yeah like when in hours are like within two hours before they go look sir

1575
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:18,980
We have to there's a big article that just came out about

1576
01:46:20,020 --> 01:46:24,540
Netflix and all the different weirds like how Netflix destroyed everything

1577
01:46:25,140 --> 01:46:29,100
basically and how when they were do still doing the DVDs they would

1578
01:46:29,540 --> 01:46:35,580
Like choose the people that were you actually using the service a lot, and they would like throttle their delivery speeds

1579
01:46:36,900 --> 01:46:40,540
They were yeah, so like you would get if you were actually really sending DVDs

1580
01:46:40,540 --> 01:46:43,520
And you were watching a lot of movies a month. They would slow it down

1581
01:46:44,260 --> 01:46:51,140
Because that was not helping them you know make money or whatever so I wonder if like they they caught wind that like room 302

1582
01:46:51,660 --> 01:46:56,640
Is like ordering hundreds of chicken wings that they'd be like look we got a disconnect the phone or something

1583
01:46:56,760 --> 01:46:58,760
Like they would figure out a way to slow me down

1584
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:04,560
They would have to I think because I would there's only a finite amount of chicken fingers you have on a boat

1585
01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:10,280
And they were not prepared for an experiment to happen for content. We're

1586
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:18,120
Pulling into Nassau. It's an unplanned port. We need more chicken fingers because of Mike Carlson in room

1587
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:20,400
300 he's making content

1588
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:26,840
Making content he's eating about a few dozen DiGiorno pizzas that we keep on board

1589
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:29,520
Or if it or it could be if you're on the boat

1590
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:36,600
They've made a note that you brought several cool bags to keep the chicken fingers to take off the boat

1591
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:42,600
Well, yeah, when you go home, then you can eat chicken fingers for a full like month or two sure filling up buckets with soft serve

1592
01:47:45,400 --> 01:47:48,200
I'll carry this off the boat. You don't need to check this

1593
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:54,800
Well, you do have unlimited soft serve on the yeah, yeah like that is what I love about cruising

1594
01:47:55,800 --> 01:48:00,560
Especially on Disney. They have like unique flavors like banana, which is so good. I was gonna ask what the flavors

1595
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:05,000
That's good mango. And do you do to self serve the soft serve on the older?

1596
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:10,720
Yeah, the older ships you do but the newer ships they do it for you. Okay. Okay. Now that's another thing

1597
01:48:10,720 --> 01:48:14,960
Well, I like I've said this before I like it when somebody makes me a cone

1598
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:20,520
Like I don't like this new like pink berry trend of I have to do it. I don't want to do it

1599
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:22,200
I know people disagree with me about this

1600
01:48:22,200 --> 01:48:27,560
I like an expert to make a little thing for me or do the cone because I will mess the cone up

1601
01:48:27,560 --> 01:48:33,120
Oh that some of the dining halls in college you would make your own code right and it was I was a mess

1602
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:37,840
When you go to like old country buffet with your grandparents like I would

1603
01:48:38,160 --> 01:48:43,200
You'd have to do it self-serve sure and I would ruin it or I would blow it mine just looks so bad

1604
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:46,720
Yeah, you want it to be aesthetically pleasing before

1605
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:52,760
So look, that's I guess that's another rare Michael Eisner lose losing

1606
01:48:53,240 --> 01:48:58,600
Choice, I feel like I'm on the other side of things because like like the buffet on the ship is called Marceline's market

1607
01:48:58,680 --> 01:49:00,800
You know reference a wall

1608
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:04,880
At that buffet they

1609
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:09,200
Put the stuff on the the plate for you and then hand you the plate

1610
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:12,160
Okay, because it's trying to it's more sanitary than I guess

1611
01:49:13,160 --> 01:49:15,160
When you're like, yeah

1612
01:49:20,160 --> 01:49:24,000
It's a good point that is true if you're like, I'd like to really

1613
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:30,320
Full of french fries, please the older ships. I think you're you could still do it yourself. So what that's an interesting change

1614
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:33,480
I wonder why pandemic pandemic? Yeah, that's probably yeah

1615
01:49:33,480 --> 01:49:37,080
I am sure they're trained to make chaos plates like to

1616
01:49:37,640 --> 01:49:42,880
They're trained to like chow chow me next to chicken fingers

1617
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:51,720
Yeah, I also I'm one of those picky people that I don't want the things to like to touch yeah

1618
01:49:52,120 --> 01:49:55,880
Yeah, I guess I'm like that more than not but yeah

1619
01:49:57,120 --> 01:50:01,940
Really have to think about my plate preference. But no, I guess I get pretty chaotic at a buffet

1620
01:50:02,500 --> 01:50:08,780
Now do the buffets live up because I do find buffets often even though it's fun in concept they often are underwhelming

1621
01:50:09,340 --> 01:50:12,740
but sometimes you get a rare like really good buffet, I feel like

1622
01:50:14,060 --> 01:50:17,540
Comparing Royal and Disney Royal is way better just because I have a bigger selection

1623
01:50:17,740 --> 01:50:21,780
But one thing that you could only get on a Disney Cruise buffet

1624
01:50:22,740 --> 01:50:29,620
One day out of the entire trip. They they serve you churro Mickey waffles. Oh, and they are the best

1625
01:50:30,500 --> 01:50:34,780
Breakfast item of all time. Oh, okay. They taste so good. They're so good

1626
01:50:34,780 --> 01:50:39,260
Yeah, and I don't know why they don't have them in the parks or why and it's only one day

1627
01:50:39,260 --> 01:50:41,180
I don't know why you can't have them every day

1628
01:50:41,180 --> 01:50:43,560
I guess it makes it special and you never know what day it is

1629
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:48,660
You just have to go up there and hope that they're there really so it's kind of like a fun little challenge to try to find

1630
01:50:49,220 --> 01:50:53,820
Put something special in them, but we don't know what like it's a secret recipe that they don't use

1631
01:50:53,820 --> 01:50:56,740
I mean, they just encrust it in like sugar and cinnamon and it's

1632
01:50:57,540 --> 01:51:00,740
Fried yeah, they're like deep-fried like oh, okay

1633
01:51:00,740 --> 01:51:07,940
You don't even need like maple syrup on them, but I still put the you guys were on a seven-day. Yeah treasure

1634
01:51:10,300 --> 01:51:11,740
What

1635
01:51:11,740 --> 01:51:13,060
I guess

1636
01:51:13,060 --> 01:51:18,580
So I'm assuming do you repeat dinners when you're out that many days?

1637
01:51:18,940 --> 01:51:24,540
Do you repeat restaurants? Can you go like oh, I love Marvel. I want to go to the Marvel restaurant three times

1638
01:51:25,380 --> 01:51:29,860
No, you have to go to whatever you do repeat the restaurants, but there's different menus

1639
01:51:29,860 --> 01:51:33,060
And then at the certain ones like the Marvel one, there's two different shows

1640
01:51:33,580 --> 01:51:39,140
The play so like a second night. It's different same with the cocoa one. There's like a different show

1641
01:51:40,140 --> 01:51:44,000
I will say one of my complaints about this is the seating in the

1642
01:51:44,660 --> 01:51:45,980
in that

1643
01:51:45,980 --> 01:51:47,620
venue is kind of

1644
01:51:47,620 --> 01:51:49,900
That like we were behind a pole. We couldn't really

1645
01:51:50,460 --> 01:51:52,460
The old Jenny Nicholson

1646
01:51:52,700 --> 01:51:54,780
Yeah, yeah

1647
01:51:54,780 --> 01:51:58,060
But the the shows look good. It was just hard to see him

1648
01:51:58,060 --> 01:52:06,260
Yeah, but um one tip that you can learn if you're a seasoned Disney cruiser is if there's a food item

1649
01:52:06,260 --> 01:52:12,100
You like at a different dining venue you you can just order request it and you can get it like every night

1650
01:52:12,100 --> 01:52:16,220
That's like oh, that's a good tip. I like that cuz they're someone's in that venue

1651
01:52:16,980 --> 01:52:21,740
Ordering that food do I mean like it's like it's the same kitchen for all three, right?

1652
01:52:21,740 --> 01:52:25,460
So it's not sure someone's not like running that multiple decks

1653
01:52:25,460 --> 01:52:29,780
Yeah, like I one churro in their hands to get to you. It's all in the same area

1654
01:52:29,780 --> 01:52:34,180
Do you do the can you do the two entrees trick? Oh, yeah

1655
01:52:38,540 --> 01:52:40,540
Multiple entrees

1656
01:52:40,660 --> 01:52:44,900
Sure, you could order like you could order everything on the menu if you wanted they'll bring it to you

1657
01:52:45,460 --> 01:52:51,060
Okay, cuz it gets covered under the normal plan or whatever you want like you can't decide between chicken or salmon

1658
01:52:52,020 --> 01:52:57,500
So the two entrees trick could also be the nine entrees trick. Yeah, it doesn't have to just be two entrees

1659
01:52:57,500 --> 01:53:00,700
you know, I always ask like the server like what's better this or that and like

1660
01:53:00,860 --> 01:53:04,620
It's dangerous on a Disney cruise because you ask them that and they're like, I'll just bring you but yeah

1661
01:53:04,620 --> 01:53:06,620
They're like, no, I'll just bring you both

1662
01:53:06,620 --> 01:53:09,900
Interesting, so they have enough food if everyone ordered nine entrees

1663
01:53:11,380 --> 01:53:13,380
Hopefully, yeah

1664
01:53:14,380 --> 01:53:15,780
What um

1665
01:53:15,780 --> 01:53:21,860
So for like like there's a Zootopia ice cream parlor and sweet shop when you

1666
01:53:22,620 --> 01:53:24,620
order all cart stuff there

1667
01:53:25,220 --> 01:53:29,940
Is it do you just tap a room key or do you just pay with a credit card?

1668
01:53:29,940 --> 01:53:37,660
So you pay everything with your room key. Okay. Yeah, but yeah, the Zootopia one isn't up charge. Unfortunately, it's not the free soft serve

1669
01:53:37,660 --> 01:53:39,660
I

1670
01:53:40,260 --> 01:53:45,900
Was watching with beta breath watching that and then I saw the price as I'm like, okay, it's fun to try

1671
01:53:45,980 --> 01:53:53,540
Yeah, but yeah, the freeze officer essential. Yeah. Okay. Jason. Do you have any more questions about the amount of meals?

1672
01:53:55,660 --> 01:54:00,380
Sweets well, I now I'm moving like uh, I like all the freebies

1673
01:54:00,380 --> 01:54:06,180
You get on the free Jane made fun of me when I said freebies cuz she's like you paid for the cruise like

1674
01:54:06,460 --> 01:54:12,500
Yeah, you're getting a dry wet bag of like or a tote bag or something. I enjoy that as well

1675
01:54:12,500 --> 01:54:18,020
Yeah, we usually say free on the channel, but then people yell at us and be like, no, it's included, right?

1676
01:54:22,260 --> 01:54:25,000
It's like a brand new ship and it says like inaugural

1677
01:54:25,660 --> 01:54:28,460
Sailing or whatever on it feel special. Mm-hmm

1678
01:54:28,460 --> 01:54:32,040
Like first edition like we bought a bunch of tiki mugs on this on the treasure

1679
01:54:32,200 --> 01:54:39,000
Because for some reason they had so many like awesome tiki mugs we bought them all and they all said first edition and their ship exclusive

1680
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:44,640
Yeah, and they're what they were all really cool. This is good. This is what I like to hear a ship exclusive stuff

1681
01:54:44,640 --> 01:54:46,040
Yeah, that's

1682
01:54:46,040 --> 01:54:48,740
Haunted mansion. They have one of the bride who's like this

1683
01:54:49,960 --> 01:54:55,160
Mermaid mermaid and then one of the captain. Oh, that's cool. And then at the Jungle Cruise bar

1684
01:54:55,160 --> 01:55:00,320
They have one of that boat with the chimpanzees on it that have taken over. Oh, that's cool

1685
01:55:00,360 --> 01:55:07,920
Oh man, but like now I'm extra incentivize shrimp is wearing like a Disney Cruise line hat instead of like so it's like special

1686
01:55:08,120 --> 01:55:10,120
Yeah, no, that's

1687
01:55:10,680 --> 01:55:15,720
People are serious about the all the merch that's sold on the Disney Cruise stores

1688
01:55:15,720 --> 01:55:22,820
I'm crazy just like that first day when they open right they don't open those stores until they get out to the water at the right

1689
01:55:23,400 --> 01:55:27,720
Like there's a lot like people are just it's like Black Friday people are hearing

1690
01:55:27,760 --> 01:55:32,940
I was gonna say like wow as if like that surprises me, but it doesn't surprise me because I would be in line

1691
01:55:33,160 --> 01:55:35,160
Yeah punching someone

1692
01:55:36,280 --> 01:55:42,820
First do you think that's people who want the keepsake or trying to flip some of them probably both I assume

1693
01:55:43,960 --> 01:55:52,380
5050 yeah. Yeah, I was surprised when you guys got on the ship. You couldn't go out on your patio or balcony

1694
01:55:53,340 --> 01:55:55,100
Fueling I'd never heard of that

1695
01:55:55,100 --> 01:56:00,900
Yeah, depending on what side of the ship you're on like I guess they were obviously have to refuel when they're back in port

1696
01:56:00,900 --> 01:56:06,980
So we weren't allowed to go out there until I I think with the ship left. Yeah, we've never seen that before

1697
01:56:06,980 --> 01:56:11,800
I don't know why maybe they think people are gonna smoke or something in a spark. Oh, I don't know

1698
01:56:12,100 --> 01:56:14,480
Does Mickey patrol the deck and be like?

1699
01:56:14,480 --> 01:56:16,480
I

1700
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:19,920
Wish

1701
01:56:20,160 --> 01:56:22,160
Guess I want some of that fuel

1702
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:26,480
Can you smoke on those balcony or there there's

1703
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:32,920
Two but that they do have dedicated smoking areas. Oh, they do. Okay. Are they themed to any characters?

1704
01:56:34,600 --> 01:56:39,180
Is it lamp wick? No, unfortunately, no, that would be smart though

1705
01:56:39,180 --> 01:56:41,180
Oh

1706
01:56:43,500 --> 01:56:45,500
Here lighting up with you

1707
01:56:46,620 --> 01:56:51,320
Cruella Cruella de Vil. Oh, there we go. The friend from the goofy movie. It's like hey, man

1708
01:56:53,420 --> 01:56:55,420
Like play it cool

1709
01:56:56,020 --> 01:57:00,880
That's probably not a great idea you're going to multiple countries you might watch that

1710
01:57:01,740 --> 01:57:07,860
Well, look, we probably could talk about this all day Jason's already asked all his main questions about the meals

1711
01:57:10,020 --> 01:57:14,760
Which Disney character loves

1712
01:57:20,580 --> 01:57:23,540
But we'll have to you'll have to come back tell us about the other

1713
01:57:24,300 --> 01:57:28,520
Disney approved name boats. Yes, hopefully we will have gone on one

1714
01:57:29,460 --> 01:57:36,260
Soon, I hope I hope to go on one soon the Triton class, which I had to double-check like oh is that cruise line wide?

1715
01:57:36,260 --> 01:57:38,260
It's like no. No, that's a Disney thing

1716
01:57:39,220 --> 01:57:43,940
But Peter and Kittra, you've survived podcast, right? Oh my god. Thank you for doing the show

1717
01:57:45,220 --> 01:57:47,980
Let's exit through the gift shop. I mean we've talked about your channel

1718
01:57:47,980 --> 01:57:51,580
But if anything else you have any other things to plug social media names

1719
01:57:51,580 --> 01:57:56,060
I mean if you want to see footage from the Disney treasure, we have three videos

1720
01:57:56,620 --> 01:58:00,620
Well somebody Irishman's runtime length of video. Yeah

1721
01:58:01,340 --> 01:58:06,560
Sure. Yeah, we combined multiple days into a single video. So they're pretty long

1722
01:58:06,840 --> 01:58:12,040
But if you want to watch them go check them out, we'd love that. Yeah, check them out for sure and it's fun

1723
01:58:12,040 --> 01:58:14,000
It's like it's the next best thing to being in the park

1724
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:18,560
It's like seeing what's going on there and seeing you walk around and I did I watch there's new

1725
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:22,480
Drinks now in Avengers campus, which I am excited. We're gonna going soon

1726
01:58:23,360 --> 01:58:29,500
So I want to try is there is there a drink specifically the new of the new ones you would recommend that you tried

1727
01:58:29,500 --> 01:58:34,200
I think just you need to get the Captain America sipper, which is pretty cool. Oh wait, it's the shield

1728
01:58:34,200 --> 01:58:39,800
Yeah, the shield. I mean that's just you pour a soda into right, right. I think you like the litmus lemonade

1729
01:58:39,800 --> 01:58:44,240
Yeah, I don't remember what the names are. There was some kind of strawberry lemonade drink. That was pretty good. Okay

1730
01:58:44,240 --> 01:58:48,320
Yeah, that sounds like I would like that. Yeah, so I like the patriotic punch

1731
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:52,760
Yeah, sure old patriotic punch. I did see that that stuck to I just like the alliteration of that

1732
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:55,440
But that's all I need sometimes to enjoy a drink

1733
01:58:56,120 --> 01:59:01,640
And it's red white and blue until you mix it. You got to mix it, but it looks good until you mix it. Yes

1734
01:59:02,520 --> 01:59:11,640

1740
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:46,400
When I've drawn plans for this new lazy river that I just concocted that I am really like proud of myself

1741
01:59:46,400 --> 01:59:48,400
I'll be honest. I'm very proud of myself for thinking of it

1742
