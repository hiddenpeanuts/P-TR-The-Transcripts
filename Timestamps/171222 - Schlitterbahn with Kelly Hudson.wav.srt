00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,060
Featuring a trip to Texas water park Schlitterbahn with guest Kelly Hudson.

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,320
If your bottles are clean, strap in.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:37,000
This is Podcast the Ride.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,180
Hey everybody, welcome to Podcast the Ride, starring the bad boys of podcasts where Walt

7
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:47,040
Disney is lovingly discussed.

8
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,040
Joining me today are fellow bad boys Mike Carlson.

9
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,640
Hey, stay cool.

10
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,140
And Jason Sheridan.

11
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,140
What's up, sleazebags?

12
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:10,320
Damn, bringing that bad boy heat.

13
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,840
I've banned you immediately.

14
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:19,560
We'll do this one, see how it goes.

15
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,760
Joined by very funny, talented writer, actress, podcaster, herself, Kelly Hudson.

16
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,240
I'm here.

17
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,240
She sure is.

18
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,240
Oh.

19
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,240
Thanks for having me.

20
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,240
Absolutely.

21
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,040
I'm sorry it wasn't a more courteous intro.

22
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,040
No, no.

23
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,040
What went through my head.

24
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,040
It's fine.

25
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,720
I think you were just, you were in the hot seat and you were nervous.

26
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,120
You didn't know what you were saying at the time.

27
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,120
I'll obviously be back.

28
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,120
Scott also declared like, I've got it.

29
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,120
I have something.

30
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,120
I'll do the intro.

31
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:52,760
Wait, I'm sick of sitting through your guys' tame, stale, mealy mouth intros.

32
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,200
Time for dynamic Scott to run the show.

33
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,200
Yeah.

34
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,720
You have a great voice for radio.

35
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,720
I will say that.

36
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,720
Oh, thanks so much.

37
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,320
Well, maybe I'll get to radio one day.

38
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,320
Yeah, yeah.

39
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,240
Maybe someday the big leagues of radio.

40
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,720
If radio still exists.

41
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,720
Yeah.

42
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,720
Six months.

43
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,720
Yeah.

44
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,600
I'll host an all Beatles show on Sirius one day.

45
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,600
That's the dream.

46
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,720
Hey, thanks so much for joining us.

47
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,720
Thanks for having me.

48
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,200
Thanks for talking theme parks with us.

49
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,200
Yeah.

50
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,680
So I apologize, we're going to make you sit through some late breaking theme park news.

51
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,640
I'm excited to react to it in the moment.

52
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,000
I don't even know.

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,680
Mike, what's happening?

54
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,680
This just came.

55
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,720
So what happens is I get an alert on my phone anytime there's news about Disneyland because

56
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:41,160
I've switched Twitter to certain accounts that will send you a text with the information.

57
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,160
Of course.

58
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,160
Of course.

59
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:47,600
A couple of minutes ago, I got one of these and it said, coming soon to Disney's California

60
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,080
Adventure, the Incredicoaster.

61
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,080
Okay.

62
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,160
Which there's going to be a re-theme of the Paradise Pier area of California Adventure

63
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,480
and it's going to be called Pixar Pier.

64
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,480
Okay.

65
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,480
So they've released-

66
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,480
How will the Incredibles then?

67
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,480
Yes.

68
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,480
Nice.

69
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,240
So it's the Incredibles from the Pixar movie Incredibles.

70
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,760
So what's going to happen is within six months, they're basically just going to like repaint

71
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,880
everything at Disney's California Adventure in this part of the park and call it Pixar

72
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,880
Pier.

73
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,880
Interesting.

74
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:21,480
They've released the first image from it and I will pass my computer around.

75
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,680
As Mike passes a 15-inch MacBook Pro.

76
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,680
It's very expensive.

77
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,000
All I can really see are the words Pixar Pier and then Mickey's Big Face, of course.

78
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,800
I'm not really seeing anything Pixar-y.

79
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,200
That in and of itself is news.

80
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,560
They're keeping Mickey's Big Face.

81
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,560
That's right.

82
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,560
They're keeping Mickey's Big Face.

83
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,560
Yes, Mickey's Big Face.

84
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,360
Even though it's Pixar Pier, which actually makes the switch more confusing to Pixar Pier.

85
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,320
But what is going to happen is the Ferris wheel, each car will now have a Pixar character

86
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,320
on each one.

87
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,320
Oh, great.

88
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,320
So you could get-

89
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,320
Hand-painted.

90
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,320
Hand-painted.

91
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:59,040
Wait, they are building a giant modernist A-frame style house, I guess is the loading

92
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,840
area.

93
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,840
It's just the loading area though.

94
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,640
It's like the Incredibles lair or whatever.

95
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,640
That sounds fun.

96
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,640
I do love all the art direction of the Incredibles.

97
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,640
Yeah, it's great.

98
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,640
Everything looks amazing.

99
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,640
Yeah.

100
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,640
It is retro future.

101
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,640
It looks like Palm Springs.

102
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,640
Yeah, absolutely.

103
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,840
It looks like a Palm Springs church.

104
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,840
Yeah.

105
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,360
It has been a big missing area in the theme parks that there has not been a great Incredibles

106
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,360
attraction.

107
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,840
This isn't one still because they're just overlaying a pre-existing one.

108
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,000
But yeah, that building looks nice.

109
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,120
Big light up eye.

110
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,560
And there's going to be a Bing Bong candy store from Inside Out.

111
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,560
Remember Bing Bong?

112
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,560
Oh, gosh.

113
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,560
God.

114
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,560
He's right.

115
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,200
The second you mentioned Bing Bong, my eyes well up with tears.

116
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,640
Yeah, Bing Bong stuff.

117
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,520
You love Bing Bong, he's going to sell you some chocolate.

118
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,840
He's ready to give you some candy.

119
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,680
Wait, he's back from hell to sell you chocolate?

120
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,680
Not hell.

121
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,680
That's not hell.

122
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,680
That was a forgotten memory.

123
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,680
He doesn't go to hell.

124
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:02,200
They spent a very different reading of that movie.

125
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,200
Yeah.

126
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,560
He lives inside nightmares now.

127
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,880
Yeah, little girls have the ability to send memories to hell.

128
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:15,480
Bing Bong's back from hell and The Incredibles coaster will have a very hard Ayn Randian

129
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:20,640
message about exceptionalism just like the movie.

130
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,280
Things are getting preachy in the parks.

131
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,280
Well, look at that.

132
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,280
Hot off the presses, a picture.

133
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,280
That's great.

134
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,720
Are you, as a fan of Disneyland, are you also a fan of California Adventure?

135
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,720
I've never been there.

136
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,720
Oh, yes.

137
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,720
I've been to Disneyland.

138
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,720
I spent the entire day at Disneyland.

139
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,200
I was like, I don't have the energy to go over to California.

140
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,800
So I'm glad I didn't buy the dual wristband or whatever.

141
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,800
Which is like $60 more.

142
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,160
Yeah, I don't want to do that if I'm not guaranteed.

143
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,040
Here's the thing, and we've probably talked about this every single episode of this podcast,

144
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:51,600
but what we do, because we've all been there many times with each other in various incarnations,

145
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,760
sometimes just with Scott, sometimes just with Jason, sometimes with my parents or whatever.

146
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,760
Sometimes wives and girlfriends.

147
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,760
Sometimes.

148
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,760
If we have to.

149
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,760
If we have to.

150
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,760
If we have to.

151
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,760
Girls come along.

152
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,760
They're usually ruin it for us.

153
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,760
They slow us down.

154
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,760
I'm tired.

155
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,080
They have reason.

156
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,080
They have unreasonable requests.

157
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,720
She's going to be horrified that you said that.

158
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,680
Erin has pointed out that you walk slowly at theme parks.

159
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,640
I'll just throw that out on the podcast right here and now.

160
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,440
She's so mad right now.

161
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,440
She's finally relaxed.

162
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,560
Hearing me say, hearing me call you out.

163
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,560
But why not?

164
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,000
We're getting, does that sound familiar to you at all?

165
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,640
I'm not sure what she thinks you want.

166
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,640
That doesn't sound familiar.

167
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,680
I feel like I have a pretty decent pace in my normal walking.

168
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,840
I'm sorry, I'm making her seem like a real jerk.

169
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,680
I'm trying to think, maybe I'm just so calm.

170
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,280
I think it's because you're relaxed.

171
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,840
You're taking in the sights.

172
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,880
I feel like people walk slowly in Times Square, right?

173
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:49,200
So like when I was living in New York, walking in Times Square was hell because here comes

174
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,200
hell again.

175
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,200
You know, call back to hell.

176
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,200
Sorry.

177
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,200
Which, I can't tell the difference.

178
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,160
Times Square and hell, what's the difference?

179
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,440
There is an M&M store in both.

180
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,440
Yes, exactly.

181
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,440
Yeah.

182
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,000
People walk closely when they're like off stricken, you know what I mean?

183
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,760
They're just like, wow.

184
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,240
Which you always are, maybe.

185
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,240
At Disneyland.

186
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,040
At your 400th visit to California Adventure.

187
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,600
So wait, so you do like California Adventure.

188
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:18,440
Yeah, so I was going to say, we all, what we do is since we're all men in our 30s, we

189
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,040
have an alcoholic beverage sometimes.

190
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,160
You can get alcohol there?

191
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,520
And at California Adventure, that's the place to do it.

192
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,000
And there's multiple places that we can go.

193
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,120
My favorite being the Carthay Circle, which is an old Hollywood lounge area and also a

194
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,120
restaurant.

195
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,840
It's a recreation of the theater where Snow White premiered in the 30s.

196
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,840
Oh.

197
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,840
This is cool stuff.

198
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,080
I wonder how many sexual assaults took place there.

199
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,080
Sorry.

200
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,080
In the real one.

201
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,080
In the real one, many.

202
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,080
Plenty of them.

203
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,760
It was before the Great Reckoning happened this month.

204
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:51,040
Now the California Adventure one, I'm sure, was, yeah, is reasonably clean.

205
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,360
Yeah, I don't think, I mean, I'm sure.

206
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,360
Less blood on their hands.

207
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,440
There's enough cameras around that.

208
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,640
Like weirdos probably jerked off in the bathroom, but that might be the highly extent of it.

209
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,640
Right.

210
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,640
Yeah.

211
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,000
Sorry to bring that into the whole thing.

212
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,720
It's the dark side of Walt Disney's Hollywood.

213
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,720
Yeah.

214
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,160
There's some scary stuff going on.

215
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,840
We don't know whatever, but that's when celebrities' private lives were kept private.

216
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,840
Yeah.

217
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,360
The fact that, well, okay, just the description of the lounge and the alcohol, you've convinced

218
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,360
me.

219
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,840
You get a nice Manhattan and it's got that circular ice.

220
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,840
That's my favorite thing.

221
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,840
Ooh, a big ball of ice.

222
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,840
Love it.

223
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,040
And it takes longer to melt because it's science.

224
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,040
Yeah, very slow.

225
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,960
It's legitimately great at these.

226
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,480
The bars there are cool.

227
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:36,080
They aren't even cool in some dorky way that we're applying.

228
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,080
I really like the California Adventure.

229
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,680
You can really feel cool there for once in my life.

230
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,680
Or Trader Sam's.

231
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,720
We've been to Trader Sam's before.

232
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,720
That's very cool.

233
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,920
That's a tiki bar over by the Disneyland Hotel.

234
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,920
Gotcha.

235
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,680
So these are the cool places, cool guys.

236
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,680
Bad boys drink.

237
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,680
Cool.

238
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,680
This is where, yeah.

239
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,680
It's great.

240
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,680
It's a nice theme park.

241
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,480
Because as we get older, we get a little more tired, but you take two hours in the middle

242
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,320
of the day, you have two cocktails, and you're back.

243
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,320
Get yourself going.

244
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,320
You're ready to party.

245
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,320
Yeah.

246
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,960
Go to the Pixar block party and dance along with the soldiers.

247
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,440
Hey, everyone.

248
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,440
It's the idiot from The Good Dinosaur.

249
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,360
It's the idiot main character from The Good Dinosaur.

250
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,360
I never saw The Good Dinosaur.

251
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,360
Oh, it's bad.

252
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,240
They should call it The Bad Dinosaur, because it is not a good movie.

253
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,600
Yeah, you can watch it for free on a lot of flights.

254
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,720
So that's why you know that it's not the best.

255
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,960
Not a good, if it's not premium content.

256
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,320
Not premium Pixar.

257
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,320
Premium plan content.

258
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:42,280
Well, what is your general theme park feeling, or Disneyland feel?

259
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,280
Do you enjoy them?

260
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,280
Do you not enjoy them?

261
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,280
Well, OK.

262
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,840
So I have a podcast of my own called Make Me Like It.

263
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,840
Should I have fun on?

264
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,840
I did it.

265
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,880
Scott talked about the Beach Boys.

266
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,400
The other topic I know about.

267
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,400
This is one.

268
00:09:54,400 --> 00:10:01,160
We've done a lot of episodes that sort of delve into theme parks at some point.

269
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:07,880
We talked about, we did a whole episode on Disneyland, which Emily Heller talked about.

270
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,480
She loves it.

271
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,120
OK, so in general, I like it.

272
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,440
I love rides.

273
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:19,600
I think Disneyland's a little light on rides, and that's why I've not loved it.

274
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,960
I grew up in Texas where there's just like a ton of amusement parks.

275
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,520
You could go up to Arlington right outside of Dallas and go to Six Flags.

276
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,160
Six Flags over Texas.

277
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,200
Then Astroworld is in Houston, which I went to once or twice.

278
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,000
Still called Astroworld, or has it been given some other?

279
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,080
I mean, it's been years since I've even said those words.

280
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,080
Sure, sure.

281
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,080
We'll look into that.

282
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,960
Or thought about it.

283
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,560
And then Fiesta Texas was, of course, bought by Six Flags as well.

284
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,000
So there's Six Flags, yes, Texas and San Antonio.

285
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,840
Oh, which the Six Flags, the flags are a Texas thing.

286
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,840
Their name is a.

287
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,840
Oh, really?

288
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,640
Is Six Flags a Texas thing?

289
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,080
The Six Flags are something from maybe the.

290
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,560
I think it's a national thing.

291
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,560
I thought because they.

292
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,560
Oh, no, it is.

293
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,920
But the phrase Six Flags has some Texas history connotation.

294
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,920
Do you guys know?

295
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,920
No, I know.

296
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,920
I never knew that.

297
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,920
I don't know this.

298
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,680
It's something from like the fight for Texas independence or whatever the fight, whatever

299
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,600
war the Alamo was part of.

300
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,040
Yeah, I don't know real history.

301
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,040
I only know thing park history.

302
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,040
Right.

303
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,040
Mexican American?

304
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,040
Not sure.

305
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,040
I don't know.

306
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,040
Anyway, I got it.

307
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,040
I got it.

308
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,040
What do you got?

309
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,720
Six Flags over Texas is the slogan used to describe the six nations that have sovereignty

310
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,480
over some or all of the current territory of the U.S. state of Texas.

311
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:40,120
Spain, France, Mexico, Republic of Texas, the Confederate States of America.

312
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,120
What?

313
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,080
One of the Six Flags is the Confederate flag?

314
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,080
Confederate States?

315
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,080
Yeah, that sucks.

316
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,880
So I guess Six Flags originated in Arlington.

317
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,880
Six Flags over Texas?

318
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,880
Maybe.

319
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,880
I guess so.

320
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,880
This phrase is everywhere now.

321
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,880
It's a hotbed.

322
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,880
It seems felt like a hotbed.

323
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:01,720
So I think my early interest, though, in theme parks definitely had a lot to do with sex.

324
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,720
Sure, sure.

325
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,720
Why not?

326
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,720
Because of the-

327
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,720
Not us.

328
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,720
We like the theming.

329
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,640
Yeah, like in middle school, we would go to a theme park as like end of the year trip.

330
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,560
And you've got the bus ride.

331
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,640
You've got the standing in lines.

332
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,640
All this shit.

333
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,640
Sorry, can you curse?

334
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,640
Oh, yeah.

335
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:26,000
Oh, that's one of the things that makes this theme park podcast different.

336
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,320
We just did an episode of Make Me Like It about waiting in lines where our guest was

337
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,560
talking about how great waiting in lines, especially at theme parks is because you get

338
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,200
to know people and you know you're going to be there for a while.

339
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,720
It was all very confusing.

340
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,680
I remember how much I loved just flirting nonstop in lines.

341
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:50,360
And then I saw the movie Fear, which there's that, of course, epic scene where Reese Witherspoon

342
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,080
gets fingered, can I say, on the air?

343
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,080
Sure.

344
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,080
By Mark Wahlberg.

345
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,080
I'd prefer not to believe that.

346
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,560
On a roller coaster.

347
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,600
And so it's a very gentle local roller coaster, though.

348
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:08,120
And if you try it in real life, for instance, on The Rattler at Fiesta, Texas, it's a different

349
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,120
story.

350
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,720
I'll tell you guys that right now.

351
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,280
And if you're a young gal hoping to just say no to getting fingered on roller coasters.

352
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,280
It's the Rattler.

353
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,280
It's a stationary place.

354
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,280
Yeah.

355
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,280
Is that a wooden coaster?

356
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,280
Yes, it's like one of the largest wooden roller coasters.

357
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,280
They're very rickety.

358
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,280
Yeah, just awful.

359
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:29,960
It's more of that and like it's then the like dips and curves and stuff.

360
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:34,040
You might be fine, but like, yeah, those things do a number on you.

361
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,440
They're bad on your back, let alone genitals.

362
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,760
There's a strong connotation with like, yeah, some sexual tension at these places.

363
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:46,800
But then in addition to that, there's just I got to love rides that after a while, like,

364
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:52,240
I think the first big roller coaster I went on was at Astroworld called the Viper.

365
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,880
And I was so shocked, like the picture of, you know, us afterwards, of me and my brother.

366
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,880
And he was like having a great time.

367
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,320
And my face was that of someone that just like found out they were going to die or something.

368
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,880
It was just like a total look of like illness and shock.

369
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,880
Just I was like.

370
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,880
That'd be me.

371
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,840
I'm not a coaster person in particular.

372
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,000
You're not a coaster man.

373
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,360
You're more of a thrill ride fan.

374
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,360
A little bit of a thrill ride fan.

375
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,080
Because Disneyland does have a lot of rides, but it doesn't have like so many.

376
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,080
A lot of those.

377
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,320
Yeah, a lot of those.

378
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,240
I love my favorite ride at Disneyland is Indiana Jones, though, I think.

379
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,240
That's my favorite.

380
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,240
It's scary.

381
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,280
There's a couple drops.

382
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,880
Yes, you get some gen.

383
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,720
You get some thrills, there's enough of the physical stuff in the car and then just the

384
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,880
decor and everything's great.

385
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,880
We did one on that.

386
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,640
We had fun talking about that one.

387
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,280
Wait, wait, you know, you brought up a different.

388
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:48,200
When we were discussing topics, you brought up a coaster in New Jersey.

389
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,200
Yes.

390
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,200
You brought that up as a potential.

391
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,000
Yeah, Kingda Ka, which I won't.

392
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Oh, at Great Adventure.

393
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Yes.

394
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,640
Someone's going to come on your show and talk only about Kingda Ka.

395
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,400
That's almost what I talked about.

396
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,120
When Kingda Ka opened, it was a fucking debacle.

397
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:09,600
Oh, was it because it did break down a lot or it was just like I don't remember the exact

398
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,080
specifics, but like the year it opened, it was only running like half the time and they

399
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,080
hiked it.

400
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,080
Yeah.

401
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,080
So much.

402
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,080
Yeah.

403
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,640
One of the times that I've been to Great Adventure, I think three times when I was living in New

404
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:26,720
York for eight years and the one of the times we went, it was like down for half the day

405
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,880
and I was on one of the first, I was on the first one that they were like, all right,

406
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,440
we're letting people back on.

407
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,040
And so it's like, okay, wait, but yeah.

408
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,040
You're the guinea pig.

409
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,040
Yeah.

410
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,680
Basically like you're the first one back on after it's been down.

411
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,680
After whatever the problem was.

412
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,280
And you know, it's just the kind of thing where if you get stuck at any point, you're

413
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,280
screwed.

414
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,000
Do you guys know about this ride?

415
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,220
I saw a sign for it in Google Imaging it that said like, you might not make it up the ramp.

416
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,220
This is normal.

417
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,220
Yeah.

418
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,220
It's 90 degrees.

419
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,220
I've never seen that before.

420
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,220
I don't know why you said that.

421
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:05,960
It's one of those ones that you just take off immediately at an insane speed and then

422
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,800
shoot all the way up this huge loop and then down and then come around and then you're

423
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,800
done.

424
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,800
But it's like, it is so high.

425
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,800
Oh, the vertical climb.

426
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,800
Oh God.

427
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,000
The vertical climb is so high.

428
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,520
That does not tell you how high it is.

429
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,520
You really don't understand guys.

430
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,520
Oh my God.

431
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,520
This is me out looking at it.

432
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,520
It's crazy.

433
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,080
When I think about it, I'm like, God.

434
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,320
And I remember that view that I had from the very top.

435
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,080
I think your brain is not able to develop memories fast enough to understand what I

436
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,080
experienced.

437
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,080
You know what I mean?

438
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,080
Yeah.

439
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,080
Yeah.

440
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,320
So it's a... Do you still do it?

441
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,320
Would you do it now or is that an in the past?

442
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,320
Oh yeah.

443
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,960
I did have a moment... One time when I went on it, I did have a panic attack after they'd

444
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,960
strapped us in.

445
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:55,520
And Dan, my husband, was sitting next to me and he was forced to endure me just like,

446
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,520
no, no, no.

447
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:01,160
And then we took off and I was screaming my head off and he was just worried the whole

448
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,160
time.

449
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,080
So he just did not enjoy himself.

450
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:08,840
And of course we get back and I'm like, yay, that was great.

451
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:15,060
That's a fun thing about roller coasters is that it's the only time that you might see

452
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:22,880
someone in your life have a massive catastrophic pre-cat besides if there was actual danger

453
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,320
occurring in your life.

454
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,560
Now that's a preview of what would happen if you were in actual harm.

455
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,560
Exactly.

456
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:34,520
If someone was about to actually murder us, I would be having the same panic attack.

457
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,520
It's a window into hell, what you're like on a roller coaster.

458
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:43,680
It is crazy that this combines the launch coast, the zero to 60 kind of launch kind

459
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:48,120
of coaster that has been very popular the last 10 years, but then also this insane like

460
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,320
90 degrees up, 90 degrees down.

461
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,280
Like, yeah, of course it's going to break down all the time.

462
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,920
If it doesn't work perfectly, then you've got problems.

463
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,320
There was a lot in the accidents section of that ride.

464
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,120
But no one has died.

465
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,120
I just looked it up.

466
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,520
No one has died on Kingda Ka.

467
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:11,920
In your research of stuff like this, you know there's like one of those like, what do you

468
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,920
call it?

469
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,920
Like a tower.

470
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,920
Yeah, like a tower.

471
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,920
Like a tower.

472
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,920
Like a tower.

473
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,920
Like a tower.

474
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,920
I think the first one was one of them where you just get dropped.

475
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,920
They take you to the top and they drop you.

476
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,920
That's the ride.

477
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,920
Like a tower.

478
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,920
Tower of terrors type deal.

479
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:29,400
I read something when I was very stoned in high school about a woman in Japan, I believe,

480
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:36,600
on a ride and her ponytail got caught on something and her entire face and scalp were ripped off.

481
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,600
I think it was the...

482
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,600
Is that true?

483
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,600
I think it's just the scalp.

484
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,240
I mean the scalp is attached to the face.

485
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,240
Just so you...

486
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,240
Well, I mean...

487
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,240
But was she able to live?

488
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,960
Like I just heard that and then I never stopped thinking about it and I never found out what

489
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,960
the real situation was.

490
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,400
That may have happened a couple times on a couple different rides.

491
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,400
No!

492
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,400
Ponytails getting caught.

493
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,400
Really?

494
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,400
Yes.

495
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,400
Do you know, do you know stories specifically?

496
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,880
Well, I know, I know the ponytail.

497
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,880
I don't know if it's...

498
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,880
I can't remember where it is.

499
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,360
So I know I've heard the ponytail.

500
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,720
I've heard the one where there was a giant drop and someone's feet were cut off.

501
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,880
God.

502
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,240
Just sliced right off.

503
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,240
Yeah, there's some...

504
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,400
Oh no.

505
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,520
Some crazy, horrible...

506
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,360
What a way for things to happen.

507
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,200
You already lose limbs or...

508
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,200
Last year.

509
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,200
No!

510
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,200
You had it last year.

511
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,200
Okay, well then that's a different...

512
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,200
That's a new...

513
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,200
That's the newer time I'm thinking of.

514
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,280
Yeah, because I was 16 probably when I heard about this.

515
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,280
That was like 18 years ago.

516
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,240
So yours sounds grizzlier than this one probably.

517
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,840
We don't need to really get into that.

518
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,840
Yeah, we don't have to.

519
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,840
I just want to run by...

520
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,840
Snopes has multiple instances of scalps.

521
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,840
Okay, scalps.

522
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,840
Oh, oh.

523
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,840
It's theme park scalps.

524
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:50,640
Six Flags Great Adventure, the note said that...

525
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,160
I think it was like a core question and answer.

526
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:58,360
No one has died at Six Flags Great Adventure in Jersey since like 87.

527
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:06,200
Someone like fell out of coaster I think in California recently at Six Flags Great America.

528
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,920
No, that's in Chicago.

529
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,920
But there's a Great America here too.

530
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,920
Is there one in here too?

531
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,920
Yes, there's one here too.

532
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,920
Oh, sorry.

533
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,920
In Northern California.

534
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:18,880
I saw an article last week that it's like a nine person fight broke out like in line

535
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,880
for something.

536
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,040
You would think New Jersey would have that covered.

537
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:28,080
Yeah, because I've been to Great Adventure in the summer and it gets hot and humid and

538
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,080
people start to lose it.

539
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,760
Families, fist fights from parents to children break out.

540
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:42,920
So at Great America this past weekend, a bunch of teens ran wild in the park, some of them

541
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,920
with tasers.

542
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,920
Oh yes, I saw that.

543
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:50,680
So like a full like Warriors kind of movie.

544
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,960
I bet sex had to do with it in some way, right?

545
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,240
Someone was trying to impress somebody and the tasers got involved.

546
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:02,480
It was a fight over sex that had occurred or to get sex later to be achieved.

547
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,480
Yeah.

548
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:08,840
I was 17 and at all comfortable with anything sexual at all.

549
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,120
And there was a place I wanted to go and like have sex and fight.

550
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,680
It would be a Six Flags theme park.

551
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,280
Those are the perfect places for it.

552
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:21,280
Of course, when I was 17, I was still years away from engaging in any sort of meaningful

553
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,200
sexual or any remotely close to sexual relationship.

554
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,200
Or physical altercation.

555
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,200
Or if it's still a fight version.

556
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,200
I'm still waiting on the fight.

557
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,200
Like we all are, yes.

558
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,200
You can imagine that.

559
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,200
It'll happen.

560
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:37,280
It'll happen on this show between the three of us.

561
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,640
One of us will secretly bring a taser one of these times.

562
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:46,360
Hey, you know where you wouldn't want to bring a taser is to the place we're talking about

563
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,360
today.

564
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,560
Slater, bun, bun, bun.

565
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,560
You know the song.

566
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,360
I have to cue up the song.

567
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,360
Yeah.

568
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,360
Go ahead and play it.

569
00:21:54,360 --> 00:22:01,120
It's a great day.

570
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,200
It feels like an ocean spray.

571
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,080
Friendly fun in the sun.

572
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,080
Summer getaway.

573
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,080
Grab a wave and ride.

574
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,080
It's time to get excited.

575
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,080
Big smiles every time.

576
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,080
You just can't hide it.

577
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,080
It's the hottest.

578
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,080
Coolest.

579
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,080
Floating on cloud nine.

580
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,080
Everybody have a cool time.

581
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,080
Always the hottest, coolest time.

582
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,080
Always, shiva.

583
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,080
Always, shiva.

584
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,080
Always, shiva.

585
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,080
Always, shiva.

586
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,080
Always, shiva.

587
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,080
Always, shiva.

588
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,080
Always, shiva.

589
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,080
Always, shiva.

590
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,080
Always, shiva.

591
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,080
Always.

592
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:32,980
We've already violated Fair Use.

593
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,980
You knew the song?

594
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,620
You were singing the song before we started.

595
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,620
Different song.

596
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:42,640
In the 80's or 90's whenever I last time I heard it, it was the hottest, coolest time

597
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,200
in Texas come play, shlitter bun, bun.

598
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,800
Which sounds like the Save By The Bell theme kinda.

599
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:56,520
A child's impression of rock music as opposed to a child's impression of reggaeton or whatever

600
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,520
that was trying to be.

601
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,760
Yeah, I don't know what that was, but it was definitely more contemporary and definitely

602
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,200
they've, I don't think they mentioned Texas once, which is sad.

603
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,200
No, yeah, generic.

604
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,200
It's not exclusive to Texas, I read.

605
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,200
Oh, they've spread them out?

606
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,200
There's one in Kansas City as well.

607
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,200
Oh, geez.

608
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:16,960
So, guys, Schlitterbahn has an insanely German name.

609
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,560
Do you have any guesses why?

610
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,160
I think we, I sort of was looking at it.

611
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,160
You did a little research?

612
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,160
Well, it's based on the town, correct?

613
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:29,160
Well, yeah, the entire, while New Braunfels is where it is and Braunfels, New Braunfels,

614
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:33,120
there's just so many, that whole area is riddled with German settlements.

615
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,800
Like all of those towns are German.

616
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,960
So New Braunfels is where it was.

617
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,620
We would often, after going to Schlitterbahn, go to dinner at the New Braunfels smokehouse

618
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,120
and just eat a bunch of sausage.

619
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,120
Oh, sweet.

620
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,120
Oh, great.

621
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,120
Sounds great.

622
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,120
It was great.

623
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,200
So, it's kind of, is it like old world feeling or just?

624
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,400
It feels a little like that.

625
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:56,840
I'd say Fredericksburg, a town nearby, is a lot more cutesy, like Solvang.

626
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:01,200
This is more of like small town Texas with German vibes.

627
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,160
Is there an Amish population at all in Texas?

628
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,880
I know they're kind of spread throughout.

629
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,000
Yeah, not that I know of.

630
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,680
It's more Czech and German.

631
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,240
There's like some Czech towns, German towns.

632
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,720
Apparently San Antonio was settled by Canary Islanders, which is a Spanish island.

633
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,720
I don't know.

634
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,720
Specifically Canary Islanders.

635
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:24,880
There's all kinds of weird, it's kind of a little like the West.

636
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,160
There were all kinds of new settlements happening.

637
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,600
Schlitterbahn translates to slippery road.

638
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,000
Oh, that makes sense.

639
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Right?

640
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I mean, now you could have made it up by now.

641
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Yeah, like Autobahn.

642
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Get it?

643
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Bon.

644
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,320
So for the listeners who don't know what Schlitterbahn is, let's sum it up.

645
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,880
It's like an enormous water park in Texas.

646
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:50,880
There's multiple versions of it, but they're all called Schlitterbahn, I believe.

647
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,880
I've never been to any other Schlitterbahn.

648
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,600
I didn't know there was another one.

649
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,800
It was only the New Braunfels one.

650
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,800
Was that correct?

651
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,800
New Braunfels.

652
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:07,600
There was only that one until, that opened in 1979.

653
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,800
I think there was another one until mid-2000s.

654
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,800
They're in Corpus Christi.

655
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,800
They're in South Padre, Galveston.

656
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,800
Nice.

657
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:19,160
So keeping it local for the most part.

658
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,160
That's great.

659
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,160
Yeah.

660
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:25,520
So what do you want to know about Schlitterbahn?

661
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,520
When did it open?

662
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,520
Just give us years and days.

663
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,520
All the stuff you can find on Wikipedia.

664
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,320
Which company made the slides?

665
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,320
It's an interesting, well, okay.

666
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:40,640
I will say just an interesting thing about Schlitterbahn is that I have these very old

667
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:48,000
memories of older Schlitterbahn because it got expanded and a lot of new stuff happened.

668
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,040
Like wave pools and these up, up, up, what do you call them?

669
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,040
Like water coasters?

670
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,040
Yeah.

671
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,600
They go uphill water coasters.

672
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,920
They made the first one of those, I believe, is what we learned.

673
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:07,080
So it's like all these things started to come later that I sort of experienced at the tail

674
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,080
end.

675
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,840
So I haven't been there probably since I was 18.

676
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,600
I think me and my cousins all went.

677
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,400
But before that, it was like a lot of times as a kid and a lot of times as a teenager.

678
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,160
So what was there in childhood, if not these high tech adventures?

679
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:27,920
Well, central Texas just has a lot of cold springs.

680
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:33,560
And so parts of the park were just like spring fed.

681
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:37,560
And right next to a river would be going by.

682
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:41,880
I can't remember what the, it's like the Neches or something is right there.

683
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:46,200
There's all sorts of rivers in Texas, as my father, I'm sure would be glad to tell you.

684
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,520
Point out is, bring him on River Talk.

685
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,520
Yeah.

686
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:55,000
My dad's favorite, my dad sat my husband down one time and said, Dan, do you know how many

687
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,200
rivers Carol and I swam in this summer?

688
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,640
And he goes, nine.

689
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:08,600
And then he sat back, closed his eyes and started listing them with a very thick Mexican

690
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,600
accent.

691
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,120
Oh, he like really pronounced every colorado.

692
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,120
Meches.

693
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,120
Pedernales.

694
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,120
Anyway, that's very, that sounds really nice on headphones.

695
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,120
I hear that.

696
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,120
It's very relaxing.

697
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,120
Yeah.

698
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,120
It's like ASMR.

699
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,120
Yeah.

700
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,120
We're going to get that ASMR for this episode.

701
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,720
A big ASMR fan, guys.

702
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,720
A list of rivers.

703
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,720
So the rivers right there, so a lot of the park was spring fed, I remember.

704
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:43,240
So there was like these big pools and like different rides that were slightly dirty,

705
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,840
you know, just like a little bit dirty.

706
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,840
And like, but I liked it.

707
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:51,360
Like it was natural and you'd get spit out into like a, you know, a naturally fed pool.

708
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,680
Like a not controlled, like a big rocky, actually slightly dangerous.

709
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:59,160
Kind of a nasty bottom, yeah, you'd like hit mud at the bottom.

710
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,200
I think one of the rides would spill out into the lake or in the river.

711
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,840
So it's more of a watering hole type.

712
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,840
Yeah.

713
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,640
I mean, there were definitely like rides, but it just felt like all very natural.

714
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,360
Like it was built into the, like it was just naturally.

715
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,360
It's a real river, right?

716
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,360
Yes.

717
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,360
Yeah.

718
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,560
Something about it seemed like it was supposed to be there.

719
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,040
Like chlorine might not have been involved.

720
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,040
Maybe not.

721
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,040
No, not for those parts.

722
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,040
At least it couldn't be.

723
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,040
Yeah, no.

724
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,040
It's really a river.

725
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,040
No.

726
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,040
Yeah.

727
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,040
Have you guys been to like, have you been to Austin?

728
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,120
There's Barton Springs is that enormous spring fed pool.

729
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,120
I've not been there.

730
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,120
No.

731
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,120
Yeah.

732
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,680
There's a lot of these big spring fed pools and it's hard to explain what they're like

733
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,680
because they're half natural.

734
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,680
I've seen pictures of that.

735
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,680
Yeah.

736
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,680
They're like half natural, half manmade.

737
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,680
Okay.

738
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,800
What is the, how do they feel different?

739
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,800
What's different about being in them?

740
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,000
The water is freezing cold.

741
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Oh.

742
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,360
And yeah, it's just not chlorinated.

743
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,360
Okay.

744
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,520
Is it sort of relaxing or feel more natural?

745
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,520
It's great.

746
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,640
I definitely feel, I go to Barton Springs every time I'm in Austin, which is a big spring

747
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,640
fed pool.

748
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,640
I feel very replenished.

749
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,640
Sure.

750
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,640
Healed with those waters.

751
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,640
Are there other ones of these that aren't in Texas?

752
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,920
Would there be any around here?

753
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:17,320
Well, it reminds me of, in Ithaca, there's tons of waterfalls and gorges that usually

754
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:24,200
pool and then they build in like some steps and stuff and they kind of like corral people

755
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,200
in certain areas.

756
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,440
But yeah, it is very, it's very cold and it's very refreshing.

757
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,440
Delicious.

758
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,440
Yeah.

759
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,440
It's the same temperature all year round.

760
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,280
So you can even go swimming in the winter and it would be the same temperature in there.

761
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,280
Oh.

762
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,940
It doesn't get any colder or hotter.

763
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:41,320
It reminds me of what Disney wanted to do, tried to do when they built River Country

764
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:47,240
USA, but instead just created a public health crisis for 20 years.

765
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:52,840
They used to have a water park that was fed by the lake that surrounds the magic in the

766
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,840
swamp.

767
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,840
Oh shit.

768
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,840
In Florida.

769
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,840
It was not fresh like spring, it was swamp water.

770
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,840
Dirty swamp water.

771
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,840
Yeah, there's a problem.

772
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,800
Once water starts to be stagnant, you've got major problems.

773
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,800
Yeah.

774
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,800
And they did.

775
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,800
They did, yeah.

776
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:10,480
It's also where that thing, Discovery Island was, which was like this little zoo island

777
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,360
that you took little boats to at original Disney World.

778
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,800
Still open in the nineties when I went.

779
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:19,520
Like now they've like abandoned it and people have swum on, like swum, they passed extensive

780
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,520
swim.

781
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,520
Swum, swum.

782
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:26,240
They swum on the island and like there's still, they didn't take all the animals out or like

783
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,360
there's still like baby vultures like in weird little corners of these rusted out building.

784
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,360
Yeah.

785
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,760
Like Discovery Island seems like a major ecological disaster.

786
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,760
Yeah.

787
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:40,080
There was a rumor briefly they were going to turn it into a Lost attraction when Lost

788
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,080
was at the height of its tower.

789
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,080
Wow.

790
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,080
I'd still go.

791
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,720
Lost is still up there for us.

792
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,720
Step into Lost.

793
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,720
Yeah.

794
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,720
And hug a smoke monster.

795
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,720
Yeah.

796
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,720
Eat some more.

797
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,720
Yeah, if they can simulate smoke monsters.

798
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,600
Oh my God.

799
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,720
It's just a big puffy guy walking around.

800
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,720
Yeah.

801
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,720
Taking pictures.

802
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,720
Yeah.

803
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,720
Okay.

804
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,720
So it was like a more natural rustic kind of place.

805
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,720
Yeah.

806
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,720
And then it kind of like doubled in size at some point.

807
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,720
It did.

808
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,400
They started to build different areas.

809
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,840
Like you could go from one, like they were called different things.

810
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,840
What are they called?

811
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,840
Like one called Surfenberg.

812
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,840
Wait, I have a list of some of them.

813
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,840
You have a list of them?

814
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,840
Oh, good.

815
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,840
It's not probably not all of them, but I have Surfenberg.

816
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,840
Yeah.

817
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,840
I have Blastenhof.

818
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,840
Blastenhof.

819
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,840
And then there's a thing, there's something called Tubenbach.

820
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,840
Okay.

821
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,840
I don't know Tubenbach.

822
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,840
Which sounds like.

823
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,840
That's probably very new.

824
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,840
That is very funny.

825
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,840
I know there's a restaurant at one of them called Shrimp House.

826
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,840
Oh.

827
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,840
HAUS.

828
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,840
HAUS.

829
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,840
Which I think is hysterical.

830
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,840
That sounds disgusting.

831
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,840
It's disgusting and very funny.

832
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,200
There's nothing like, yeah, shrimp in central Texas.

833
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,200
Yeah.

834
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,920
I mean, it took me several hours to be there.

835
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,920
Oh, that's right.

836
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,920
Yeah.

837
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,920
Yeah.

838
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,920
Not from the Springs.

839
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,920
Yeah.

840
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,920
No, not that I know of.

841
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,920
Could get some geckos in there.

842
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:54,400
When it started to expand, do you remember, were you excited about it or were you kind

843
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,400
of like.

844
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,400
I think so.

845
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,360
I think I was excited and then disappointed.

846
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,600
I think I just expected more of the same.

847
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:07,280
I don't know what it is, but there's something so gentle about Schlitterbahn Central and

848
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:14,280
how dirty and lived in it was and how everything just felt old and wet.

849
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:19,240
And the new ones were just so bright and.

850
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,240
Corporate.

851
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:26,920
Yeah, the pools have white bottoms and the water's blue and there's these plastic tubes.

852
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,880
You don't get a big old rubber tube like you get.

853
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:35,240
You get these big black rubber tubes at Schlitterbahn and then at the new parks you would get those

854
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,080
bright green ones.

855
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,080
It just felt weird.

856
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,360
And I think a lot of the rides weren't kid friendly to me at the time.

857
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:47,480
My brother and I, it's like a very distinct memory that we still laugh about of this tiny

858
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:54,040
kid getting on one of those surf rides where you go out there on a board and you're surfing.

859
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,280
Or a fake booby boarding.

860
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,280
Yeah.

861
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,280
Like water's coming at you really fast.

862
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,080
You know what I'm talking about.

863
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:03,880
And she got on there and immediately was surfing for two seconds and then immediately was overtaken

864
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,880
and just rolled.

865
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,880
Just beat you.

866
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,280
And her body just rolled like hundreds of times.

867
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,560
Like caught in a wave.

868
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,560
It was like brrrrrrrrr.

869
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,240
Like it was so terrifying.

870
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,920
We both were like, oh God, we're never going on that.

871
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,800
Was it an injury prone place in general?

872
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,120
I feel like there was slipping and falling constantly for sure.

873
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,360
Not the level of injury of the Six Flags Bug.

874
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:30,840
They tried to make the cement rough, but you were still soaking wet at all times.

875
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,840
Sure, sure.

876
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:38,400
And then you're at every water park, you're like running on slippery ground.

877
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,120
The possibility of knee skins.

878
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:44,040
There's definitely drinks being spilled, vomit being spilled.

879
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,040
Sure.

880
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,040
Blood.

881
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,040
Blood being spilled.

882
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,040
Probably.

883
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:51,760
I have not been to a water park in a long time.

884
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,400
Yeah, I haven't either.

885
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,440
It's a weird- Mike was this summer.

886
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,440
Like two months ago.

887
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,440
What did you think?

888
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:03,640
Well, it was a place called Volcano Bay, which is a new universal place.

889
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,640
The highest tech water park.

890
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,640
Wow.

891
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,400
It's a big fake volcano in the middle.

892
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,400
Computers everywhere.

893
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:14,200
Computers constantly shorting out.

894
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,360
Futuristic volcano.

895
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,680
And part of it, a lot of it is great.

896
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,480
And then some of it is just terrible as all water parks are.

897
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,480
Right.

898
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,480
Yeah.

899
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,480
Like the ground was hot.

900
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,480
Oh wow.

901
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,480
It was like running from puddle to puddle.

902
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,480
Yeah, that's disgusting.

903
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,480
Which seems like they should have figured that out.

904
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,480
Hot puddles too.

905
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,680
You get to the next puddle and it's hot.

906
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,680
Dipping your own foot in one.

907
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,680
Yeah.

908
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,680
Yeah.

909
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:41,280
It was also like that's the first month of its operation, two couple months of its operation.

910
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,600
So they were really, there were some poor employees that were trying to give me tacos.

911
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,600
Just had no idea what was happening.

912
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,600
No idea.

913
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,600
Waited forever.

914
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,600
Oh man.

915
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,160
They didn't understand the number system that they were employing.

916
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:56,920
They couldn't figure, like 16 would go to 20 and then I would say, well it's 17, but

917
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,040
they said we're on 20.

918
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,240
It's not, and they would be confused.

919
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,560
That's funny because that was part of the marketing for that park was like, and the

920
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,160
food's really good everyone.

921
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,320
Uh huh.

922
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:12,160
Well they cut the menu, the menu was very elaborate for that, this is a side note of

923
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,160
course.

924
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,160
The menu was very elaborate.

925
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,160
Like there was like 25 things you could get and then everybody came there and everybody

926
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,280
just wanted a chicken sandwich and a fucking hot dog.

927
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,280
Yeah.

928
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,320
They cut everything off the menu and now it's just tacos, hot dogs and something like, so

929
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,800
all the good food is gone.

930
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,800
Yeah, that sucks.

931
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,800
Good friends don't know.

932
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,800
Nothing as good as the Shrimp House.

933
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,800
Yeah.

934
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,760
I haven't been to many baseball fields, but I went to the city field for the Mets a few

935
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,460
times and people really take advantage of the good food there.

936
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:44,480
They have like Shake Shack, they have some like barbecue thing and I'm glad that, you

937
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,280
know, cause they would get rid of them otherwise.

938
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,280
Sure.

939
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,280
That was a big thing.

940
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,480
Surprisingly, I was kind of shocked cause there's like a lot of, you know, there's a

941
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,880
decent barbecue in Mexican and all that stuff.

942
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,240
Staples has gotten better.

943
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,640
But you still do McDonald's, you know, you're just doing McDonald's.

944
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:03,680
I did do McDonald's last time, but I also did the taqueria, forget what the, forget

945
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,400
it, whatever, it's good.

946
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,240
I haven't been to a water park in a long time for two reasons.

947
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:15,640
One, my wife Erin, super germaphobe and like, she kind of poisoned me against them.

948
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,560
Now I only see these places through her lens.

949
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,880
I feel like, yeah, if you gulp any of that water, you're dead.

950
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,880
Yeah.

951
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:28,800
Although I was looking it up and there aren't like, you cannot really find like specific

952
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,320
stories of I got a lot of STDs from water parks, but it still feels like-

953
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,680
Yeah, I don't know about STDs, but I think like Salmonella and foodborne illnesses.

954
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,680
Yeah, Listeria.

955
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:42,840
Something happened at here in California at the Six Flags Hurricane Harbor.

956
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,560
Diarrhea probably number, oh, you know, oh, oh.

957
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,560
Yeah.

958
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,800
I was at the other water park, Blizzard Beach in Orlando.

959
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,920
Mike really perked up when you're diarrhea.

960
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:58,160
There is a sign at Blizzard Beach telling you, if you have diarrhea, do not get in the

961
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,160
water.

962
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,160
And it says diarrhea.

963
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,160
They have that at YMCA.

964
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:06,480
They actually are like, don't get in the water if you've had diarrhea within the last 12

965
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,480
days.

966
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:11,120
And I was like, at this rate, I'm never going to get to use the pool.

967
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:14,800
Every 12 days like clockwork.

968
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,800
Your poop period.

969
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,800
Yes.

970
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,800
Twice a month.

971
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:24,800
That warning is also on the official universal like attraction warning signs, which I-

972
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,040
Just on regular rides?

973
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:30,080
Yeah, on regular rides because I was walking through the big, through Harry Potter and

974
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:34,360
the Forbidden Journey once and I noticed it and wrote a sketch where it's like an old

975
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:39,720
British character actor having to record the like, please do not ride if you've had diarrhea

976
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,000
in the last 14 days.

977
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Is your British character actor Don Pardo?

978
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Yeah, diarrhea.

979
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:53,360
I'm a ghost in hell with bing bong.

980
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,360
We're back.

981
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,360
Oh, diarrhea.

982
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,360
Oh man.

983
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,360
From diarrhea and Don Pardo.

984
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,600
Yeah, that's like legalese that's starting to get put a lot of places.

985
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,600
Hotel pools, I've noticed it.

986
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:06,120
It's amazing to see diarrhea written just out in the open.

987
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,120
It's so silly.

988
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:10,120
Yeah, it's like cooties or something.

989
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,840
They don't even try to sugarcoat it because people won't-

990
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,840
Because you can't.

991
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:17,320
People would be like, well, we didn't see diarrhea because they might be like, well,

992
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,640
if you're having a little tiny problem down there, wink.

993
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,600
Right, or loose bowels, wink, wink.

994
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,280
It's like, no, we got to be specific.

995
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,720
We have to draw a picture of it.

996
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,720
It's diarrhea.

997
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,720
It's diarrhea.

998
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,040
Welcome to this four star hotel.

999
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,760
Do you all have diarrhea?

1000
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,480
Any of you fuckers have diarrhea?

1001
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,840
You can't go in our bath tubs.

1002
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,880
Don't go in our fucking pool.

1003
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,880
Do not bathe yourself.

1004
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,880
Yeah.

1005
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,880
You're on the right.

1006
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,960
Okay, so germs are the number one scaring-

1007
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,960
Oh, wait, you're right.

1008
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,960
I was saying-

1009
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,960
Reasons you haven't been.

1010
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:51,000
Yeah, the other one is I was very scarred when I was 14 where I went to a water park

1011
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:57,800
in Georgia, like somewhere outside of Savannah, Georgia, I think, on a family trip.

1012
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:02,080
And I was mistaken for a girl with my shirt off.

1013
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,120
And I was so mad.

1014
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:07,440
Did someone tell you to put a shirt on?

1015
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,440
No, it wasn't that.

1016
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,560
Because if you're a topless- Oh, did they think you were a girl child?

1017
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,560
Yeah, yeah.

1018
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,560
You hadn't developed yet?

1019
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,280
Some snotty kid was like, are you a boy or a girl?

1020
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,280
Oh, fuck you.

1021
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,280
And I don't think I answered.

1022
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,280
You're gonna get those assholes everywhere.

1023
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:25,200
I just said, shut up, and ran away, which proved nothing, probably.

1024
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,200
But I had no shirt.

1025
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,200
I was in swim trunks.

1026
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,000
Shouldn't that prove it?

1027
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,480
Still upset, but I think I miss giant swaths of that.

1028
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,240
I don't know what else happened when I was 14, but I remember that.

1029
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,200
Yeah, you blacked out for me being insulted.

1030
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:41,480
To be fair, the Coppertone girl only had trunks on as well.

1031
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,480
So yeah.

1032
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,480
She did not.

1033
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,440
It was a tiny little pink thing.

1034
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,440
Didn't she have trunks?

1035
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,440
Am I misremembering?

1036
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,440
No, they're little panties.

1037
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,440
Yeah, she had little panties.

1038
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,440
She had little pink panties.

1039
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:54,480
When are they gonna take that dog down?

1040
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,400
When are they going to put some trunks on that little girl?

1041
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,040
Shocking in the wake of Tobac and Weinstein.

1042
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,040
Yeah.

1043
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,840
The Coppertone dog continues to-

1044
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,680
Continues to yank undies off.

1045
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,040
Seven little girls.

1046
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,040
The list is growing.

1047
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,040
Yeah.

1048
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,040
Poor little white boy.

1049
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,080
I auditioned to be the new Coppertone girl.

1050
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:17,760
I auditioned to be the new man harassed by dog.

1051
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,600
I forgot that part of the story.

1052
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,440
Then that boy pulled my pants down and bit my butt.

1053
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:26,320
Now I understand why you won't go back.

1054
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:29,320
I didn't say the whole story.

1055
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,320
Yeah, I don't know.

1056
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,320
From that.

1057
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,920
Yeah, I think it's uncomfortable.

1058
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:39,000
Along with the whole loving going to theme parks because of sexual tension.

1059
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,680
I definitely, you're in a bikini.

1060
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,200
You want to be seen.

1061
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,920
You're looking at dudes' bodies.

1062
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:50,760
This was when I was in the peak of horniness.

1063
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,760
It was new to you.

1064
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,760
What do you call it?

1065
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,760
Puberty.

1066
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,760
Puberty was running rampant.

1067
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:59,920
I was so stoked about dudes with Lebray piercings and bleached tips.

1068
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,120
Oh yeah, Sugar Ray guys.

1069
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:07,760
I got some phone numbers at water parks at Slitterbond specifically.

1070
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,760
I think I am jealous.

1071
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,760
Yeah.

1072
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,760
Oh damn.

1073
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:14,280
Just being a married adult.

1074
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:20,600
So yeah, I think now the appeal before would have been like, I get to show myself off.

1075
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:25,720
Now it's like, I don't want anyone to see what's happening.

1076
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:30,320
I'm not only self-conscious, but also just I don't care about that stuff anymore.

1077
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,320
You're not on the market.

1078
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:35,320
Not 14 anymore.

1079
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:45,360
Were you guys stressed out about, did you try to tan or get a buffer if you were going

1080
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,360
to a-

1081
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,360
I'll field this one.

1082
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,360
Let's hear it.

1083
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:59,400
Well, I was a chubby little guy, but I made a vow to myself very early on.

1084
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,560
I don't think I ever vocalized this, but it's like, I'm taking my fucking shirt off when

1085
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,560
I'm going to the pool.

1086
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:09,400
I'm not going to be one of those guys in the pool with his shirt on unless I fucked up

1087
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:14,960
the sun tan lotion and I'm beet red on my back and it's more of a safety thing.

1088
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,680
I definitely fucked up some sun, just forgot large portions.

1089
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,320
But you proudly took that fucking shirt off.

1090
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,880
But I was like, yeah, I'm not, this is-

1091
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,880
You're not going to pretend.

1092
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,480
Yeah, I'm just going to.

1093
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,120
And I went to the beach a lot.

1094
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,720
I went to the beach and pool a lot.

1095
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,720
That's great.

1096
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,720
I'm glad that you did that.

1097
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:35,240
I'm glad that you had the courage because the t-shirt is confusing.

1098
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:38,280
It just clings in the worst way.

1099
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:44,840
And if you have big wide nipples and those are sticking to your wet shirt, that is much

1100
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,840
worse than if you just had the shirt.

1101
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,880
Than if they're just out in the open.

1102
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,640
Yeah, these odds sort of seem to-

1103
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,640
Right.

1104
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:59,920
I think if I've had, like in a sketch or whatever, if you wear, I've had to do things where you're

1105
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,920
in a unitard.

1106
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,840
And that stuff, that looks worse than if I was just totally shirtless or naked.

1107
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:11,680
The way fabric clings to your body, I think is far more embarrassing than just the body.

1108
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,440
Right, yeah, that's true.

1109
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,440
Yeah.

1110
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,440
Yeah.

1111
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,440
Keep me out of those body scams.

1112
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,440
Good to know.

1113
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:25,760
I wonder if whoever came up with the idea of water parks, like Mr. Schlitterbond, for

1114
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:29,320
instance, I wonder if he, why did he do that?

1115
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,240
Was he like, this is fun for kids?

1116
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:36,200
Or was he like, this is a way for adults to commune with nature?

1117
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,560
Or was he like, this is a great place for horny teens?

1118
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,560
I don't know.

1119
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,560
I think that element-

1120
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,560
I don't know.

1121
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,560
It seems like that might be the focus.

1122
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:49,280
I feel like most, I wonder if we could get some stats to see how many teens, what's the

1123
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,280
ratio of teens-

1124
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:53,720
How many pregnancies occurred at water parks?

1125
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,440
Yeah, it seems like a teen activity.

1126
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,240
Yeah, yeah.

1127
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,280
And also mission statements from existing water parks.

1128
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,280
Why'd you do it?

1129
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,280
Why'd you do it?

1130
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,840
Just wanted to know why did you do it?

1131
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,480
There's just one thing I need to know.

1132
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,480
Write out your confession.

1133
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,720
Oh, the food was really good at Schlitterbond too.

1134
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:12,720
Is it German?

1135
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,720
Is it German-inspired?

1136
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:16,000
Well, it's basically the same food you get at any place.

1137
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Yeah, of course.

1138
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,760
There was funnel cakes, which I'm sure had some German spin to it.

1139
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:21,760
Funnel cakes.

1140
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,520
Funnel, yes, with two little dots over it.

1141
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,520
Umlaut.

1142
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:30,240
But there was a smoked turkey leg that I was obsessed with that I thought you could only

1143
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:34,480
get at Schlitterbond, but I think you can get at any theme park in the country.

1144
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,520
But only there can you do it in wet clothes.

1145
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,520
Yes, yeah.

1146
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:42,800
You can hold it with a wet hand and then just rinse your hand off in the water afterwards.

1147
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,800
You have a bunch of smoked turkey leg on your hand.

1148
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,760
Just wipe off this turkey char.

1149
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,560
I got turkey char in my eyes.

1150
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:54,520
There's a swim up bar you can get the turkey leg at.

1151
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,640
Is there a swim up bar?

1152
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,160
You can drink alcohol there, right?

1153
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,160
I think so.

1154
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,160
At the actual park.

1155
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:06,280
I was too young to acknowledge that, but I believe, I remember the world's biggest hot

1156
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,920
tub, which was the most disgusting thing ever.

1157
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:13,560
There was definitely a lot of people just chilled out parks at that bar.

1158
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,560
I saw that on the website.

1159
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,560
It only holds 20 to 25 people.

1160
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:18,560
It's not that big.

1161
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,560
It's not that big.

1162
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,560
Yeah, no.

1163
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,000
But they kind of can't be for pure temperature and probably shouldn't be.

1164
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
I don't like it.

1165
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
It's still at a hotel or whatever.

1166
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I don't like a giant hot tub.

1167
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Why do you need a big hot tub?

1168
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,960
It's okay to have several smaller ones.

1169
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:37,560
I'm remembering the fact about my life that I nearby, New Braunville is pretty close to

1170
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:38,560
San Antonio, right?

1171
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,560
Yes.

1172
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,240
It's halfway between Austin and San Antonio.

1173
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,800
Oh, gotcha.

1174
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:50,760
At a hotel pool in San Antonio, like a Hilton with a bunch of slides and lazy rivers and

1175
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:57,760
stuff, a hot tub at this San Antonio resort is the first place that I told a girl I loved

1176
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,760
her.

1177
00:45:58,760 --> 00:45:59,760
Oh my God.

1178
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,760
Wow.

1179
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:05,960
In a hot tub with other kids as close as you guys?

1180
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:06,960
Oh my God.

1181
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:07,960
Oh really?

1182
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:08,960
Yeah.

1183
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,960
I just remembered that I lost my virginity in a hot tub.

1184
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:11,960
Isn't that crazy?

1185
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:12,960
In a hot tub?

1186
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:13,960
Yes.

1187
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:14,960
Really?

1188
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:15,960
It was actually-

1189
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:16,960
With 25 of your closest friends?

1190
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:17,960
Exactly.

1191
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:18,960
Exactly.

1192
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,640
It was the world's largest hot tub.

1193
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:22,640
Yeah.

1194
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:23,640
Memories were made.

1195
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,040
You told a girl you loved her.

1196
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,040
Yeah, in a Jacuzzi.

1197
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:31,160
What a place to do it, sure to be an accurate statement.

1198
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:35,240
Remember, folks, you can't get pregnant in a hot tub.

1199
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:38,760
That's scientific fact from your friends at Podcast the Rock.

1200
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:39,760
I'm living proof.

1201
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:44,560
And you can't misrepresent your own feelings, your own feelings of love in a hot tub either.

1202
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:45,560
That's true.

1203
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,080
If you say I love you, you have to mean it.

1204
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,080
Yeah.

1205
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,080
Oh my God, it's so funny to imagine.

1206
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:52,080
It's a steamy setting.

1207
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:57,080
It puts the oxygen in your brain and makes you go for it.

1208
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,080
Yeah, I guess so.

1209
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,240
You feel less inhibited.

1210
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:01,440
That's why swingers use them.

1211
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:02,600
We all went for it.

1212
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,840
Was it something you had planned to say?

1213
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:05,840
No.

1214
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:06,840
You know what?

1215
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,840
It came out of me during the kiss.

1216
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:09,840
I was like, you know what?

1217
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:10,840
I'm saying it.

1218
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:11,840
You were feeling it.

1219
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:12,840
I'm really feeling it.

1220
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,840
But maybe really, I just loved the hot tub.

1221
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:18,840
Oh, you were saying it to the hot tub.

1222
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:19,840
Yeah, she misunderstood.

1223
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:25,160
I love you hot tub for these feelings.

1224
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:26,160
Oh, yes, you.

1225
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,160
I love you.

1226
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,160
That's what I...

1227
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,160
Okay, okay, great.

1228
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:34,160
No, I wasn't saying it to an amygdala.

1229
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:40,520
Hey, so head to these places and make your feelings known.

1230
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:41,520
Yeah.

1231
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,520
Yeah.

1232
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:46,880
When you said, because obviously everyone was horny at these places.

1233
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,920
Was it actually, was it just boiling under the surface or was it actually was stuff going

1234
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,620
on that you would see?

1235
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:56,600
Was it actually seedy or was it just sort of that was in the air?

1236
00:47:56,600 --> 00:48:03,800
I think I remember, I don't feel any seedy or uncomfortable crap going down, but there

1237
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:10,320
were definitely like, a dude would call out to me from across the pool, I love you or

1238
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,320
something like that.

1239
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,320
That was Scott.

1240
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,320
That was Scott.

1241
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,320
Now you know my tricks.

1242
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:20,960
Yeah, you'd see a guy in line that you would keep seeing or...

1243
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:26,520
Of course I was in love with any lifeguard for some reason, male or female, and they'd

1244
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,680
have to handle you and you're like...

1245
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,920
Oh, like set you in your tube?

1246
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:31,920
Oh, whatever.

1247
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:36,280
You would be going down this huge thing and you'd come up and they'd get the tube and

1248
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:39,600
shove it away down to where it was supposed to go.

1249
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:43,480
You never did a fake CPR, did you?

1250
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,920
No, I did not fake out anyone.

1251
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:46,920
No.

1252
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,320
It was a great plan.

1253
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:53,160
I was doing a thing for visually, when we were on a podcast, we'd pretend like, oh,

1254
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:54,160
I need a mouth to mouth.

1255
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,160
I see.

1256
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:58,200
I think I saw Sandlot and saw how fake and fucked up that was.

1257
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,200
Yeah, don't do that.

1258
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:04,720
I was like, no, I don't want to do that to some poor woman or man.

1259
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:08,520
And of course it would be, it wouldn't be the one that you wanted, it'd be some tub of

1260
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:09,520
lard that came over.

1261
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:10,520
No, not you.

1262
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,520
Where did that tub of lard come from?

1263
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:22,640
Yeah, no, I think it was definitely obviously people were flirting nonstop.

1264
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,960
It wasn't a horrible den of evil, like a Six Flags.

1265
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:27,960
No, I didn't.

1266
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:28,960
Yeah, not that well.

1267
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:34,240
Yeah, there is no, the official, the souvenir shop at Schlitterbond does not sell shirts

1268
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:37,520
with Tweety Bird that say Blue Lives Matter on it.

1269
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,520
Oh my God.

1270
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,520
Is that real?

1271
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:43,160
Yeah, I feel like I've seen some weird Tweety Bird shirts.

1272
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:45,560
I don't know if they sell that at Six Flags.

1273
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:46,560
Probably not official.

1274
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:49,560
That could be an unlicensed Tweety Bird shirt that you saw.

1275
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:50,560
Yeah, probably.

1276
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:51,560
What a nightmare.

1277
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,560
Tweety Bird says talk shit, get hit.

1278
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:53,560
Oh my God.

1279
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:58,560
I'm vaguely remembering, I have vague memories of the Schlitterbond gift shop and I can't

1280
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,800
remember for the life of me what was in there.

1281
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:06,640
I think of course there was like, you know, you could buy some poncho or, you know, just

1282
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:07,640
stuff you would need there.

1283
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:08,640
Oh sure.

1284
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,640
I can't remember what they would sell.

1285
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:15,480
Maybe like a, you know, like floaty tubes or rubber duckies or something.

1286
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:21,000
Something I haven't mentioned that is notable is that I've dreamt about Schlitterbond several

1287
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
times.

1288
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Oh boy.

1289
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Throughout my life.

1290
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
What happened?

1291
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,360
About old school Schlitterbond and like a more natural version of it.

1292
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:32,920
Like a jungle-y, overgrown, like yeah.

1293
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,840
Like a return to form for Schlitterbond.

1294
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1295
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:40,920
Which that's, I can see what you, like it'd be very exciting to like be in a more controlled,

1296
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:47,440
like actual rapids seem crazy and scary, but like the mid point of a controlled but exciting

1297
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,440
jungle adventure.

1298
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:49,440
Right, yeah.

1299
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,480
I think I'm making this place sound more paradise-like than it was.

1300
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,440
Like I think it's legitimately disgusting.

1301
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:55,440
Sure.

1302
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,440
Like the old part.

1303
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,440
Probably.

1304
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,520
I don't even know if the old part exists anymore.

1305
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:06,440
Can I ask, just because it's very big in their marketing, what's the lazy river, a big...

1306
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,440
Draw?

1307
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,440
...thing when you were there?

1308
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,440
Was that a big draw?

1309
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,440
Yeah, yeah.

1310
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,920
I think it was pretty cool to like spend half the day there.

1311
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:16,680
I think, yeah, as I got older, that was definitely a huge draw.

1312
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,280
It was fun, yeah.

1313
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:23,040
And like, you know, when you have a littler body getting pulled along in a lazy river,

1314
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,040
it was exciting.

1315
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,040
I know all about that.

1316
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,040
I'm a very small man.

1317
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,040
Having a tiny body.

1318
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,040
Having a tiny body.

1319
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:34,400
On their website, they brag, featuring the transportainment river system.

1320
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,400
Okay.

1321
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,400
Wow.

1322
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,000
The four-hour water park are almost all connected by a single river.

1323
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,320
You can enter from one of several beaches within the park and then choose your water

1324
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,720
adventure from there.

1325
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:46,720
Wow.

1326
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:51,040
With the help of the aqua-vayor, you do not have to leave your tube to float the day away,

1327
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,040
etched in your body.

1328
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,040
Wow.

1329
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:58,040
They really want to appeal to, yeah, people that just can, cannot or will not get up.

1330
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,040
No.

1331
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,040
You've been floating for seven hours.

1332
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,040
Yeah.

1333
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,640
I will float my day away.

1334
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:04,640
Yeah.

1335
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:09,160
No, I mean, I don't remember that part.

1336
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:14,200
That might be a newer thing, but there was definitely a lazy river that was the first

1337
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,800
lazy river and the most powerful lazy river I've ever been to.

1338
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:20,000
Did you get a lot of natural flow?

1339
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,200
Yeah, I feel like more...

1340
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:26,720
It was in the newer part, of course, this one, but it was like, yeah, I feel like it

1341
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,600
was like, you know, you'd get like this huge...

1342
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:34,000
Everyone would stand next to the wall where the wave would come out of and just get plowed

1343
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
and it was really exciting.

1344
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,440
Oh, like it came from a central source and then you'd wait to get a gust.

1345
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,440
Yeah, there was like a wall.

1346
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:45,160
Yeah, it was probably very unsafe, but at that point I had no clue that I would die

1347
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:48,720
someday or could die.

1348
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:55,240
I think that it's the first place with one of those surf, like a wave machine.

1349
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,840
Yeah, the surfin' bird machine.

1350
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:01,480
Or wait, it says the first, where's the first inland surfing ride?

1351
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,200
Oh, how does that mean?

1352
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,200
I was not allowed...

1353
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,200
The boogie bond.

1354
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:09,680
I was not allowed in a wave pool like that as a kid.

1355
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:10,680
Oh.

1356
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:11,680
My mom was...

1357
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:12,680
You might get sucked up?

1358
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,160
Yeah, I mean, I wasn't allowed on a lot of stuff.

1359
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,280
My mom, especially with water parks, was...

1360
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,280
Terrified.

1361
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,280
I couldn't go alone.

1362
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:21,760
I couldn't go with friends even, especially if you thought the mom was reckless.

1363
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,760
And I mean, to be fair...

1364
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:23,760
The mom was reckless?

1365
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:24,760
Well, to be fair...

1366
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:25,760
There were a lot of reckless moms.

1367
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:26,760
Wow.

1368
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:31,720
To be fair, this mom called us in third grade and was like, I just want to let you know we

1369
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:35,280
have a gun in the house and the boys know where it is.

1370
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,760
Thank you for letting me know.

1371
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:38,760
My son will never come over.

1372
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:39,760
That is what happened.

1373
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,240
I was not allowed it for years and years.

1374
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:44,400
Then I think my mom forgot about the loaded gun and then I went back over there in junior

1375
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,400
high.

1376
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:46,880
And did you get to touch the loaded gun?

1377
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:47,880
No.

1378
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:48,880
Where was this from?

1379
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:49,880
Where did you grow up?

1380
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:50,880
Schaumburg, Illinois.

1381
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:51,880
Okay.

1382
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:56,040
But I wish it was like, you can't go in the wave pool.

1383
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,560
I don't want you going on those water slides.

1384
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:03,080
And then I think we were allowed to go to river country and that was it because it was

1385
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:04,080
very tame.

1386
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,080
Wholesome.

1387
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,320
Were you a strong swimmer or no?

1388
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,320
I was...

1389
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:08,320
Not bad.

1390
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,120
Did you swim competitively at all?

1391
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,120
No, not competitively.

1392
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,920
Is anyone here a strong swimmer?

1393
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,800
Me and my brothers were strong swimmers.

1394
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:15,800
We all swam competitively.

1395
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:16,800
Competitively.

1396
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:17,800
Yeah.

1397
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:21,960
So I think my parents were really loose about water parks because they knew that we would

1398
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:22,960
not drown.

1399
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,160
Well, my mom had no faith in my ability to stay alive.

1400
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,160
Yeah.

1401
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,160
She really just...

1402
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,160
Anywhere.

1403
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,880
My swimming style is staying alive.

1404
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:30,880
Yeah.

1405
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:34,120
Although I was in the Boy Scouts and I do know how to...

1406
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:40,480
If I were to fall into water with clothes on, like say off a ship, I can rig them into

1407
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,400
temporary flotation devices in the water.

1408
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,400
Wow.

1409
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:44,400
I had to do that too.

1410
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,400
That's incredible.

1411
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:46,400
That was part of passing the...

1412
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,400
See, I can't do that.

1413
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:48,400
The local swim program.

1414
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,400
I really can't do that.

1415
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:53,320
Ideally, you're wearing light wool slacks and a button-up shirt, which we had to bring

1416
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,520
to summer camp.

1417
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:57,000
And it's like, when would I wear these clothes?

1418
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Yeah.

1419
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I'd be on a ship.

1420
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Yeah.

1421
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,160
I wore old clothes and it feels like you'd almost have to do a magic trick in the water

1422
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:06,600
because you'd have to take your pants off, but you had your suit underneath and then

1423
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,760
you would fashion some...

1424
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:14,640
You're shoveling water into the shirt so it kind of inflates while you get the pants tied

1425
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:15,640
around your neck.

1426
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:16,640
Oh man.

1427
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:17,640
This is great.

1428
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:18,640
When in reality is this happening?

1429
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:19,640
This is great.

1430
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:22,240
If you fall into the Titanic, that's one...

1431
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:27,560
You're just suckering Jason and I's parents into paying money to pretend that this is

1432
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,000
going to be a useful skill.

1433
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Wow.

1434
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,160
Maybe someday though, if things get a little more apocalyptic, which seems more and more

1435
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,160
possible.

1436
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:37,160
We'll have to take our pants off in the water to stay afloat.

1437
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,160
Yeah.

1438
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:46,040
There's a scene in that movie Mermaids where Christina Ricci almost drowns from her clothes

1439
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:47,960
are too heavy and they're dragging her down.

1440
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:48,960
Oh God.

1441
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:49,960
Yeah.

1442
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:53,120
I'm glad I didn't see that as a kid because drowning scenes freaked me out for sure.

1443
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:54,120
Yeah.

1444
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:55,120
Well, it was weird.

1445
00:55:55,120 --> 00:56:00,880
Because that character, the little girl Christina Ricci plays, was constantly in the bathtub

1446
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:06,320
trying to outdo her time for holding her breath.

1447
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:10,480
So she was obsessed with holding her breath long and then she almost drowned.

1448
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,480
Oh wow.

1449
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:12,480
Yeah.

1450
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,160
It was kind of a reminder that she's a baby.

1451
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,160
She's a little kid.

1452
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:16,160
I guess.

1453
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,160
I don't know what...

1454
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,160
Maybe.

1455
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,160
I haven't seen that movie in a long time.

1456
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,120
Death can come for you, child.

1457
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,480
Don't forget it.

1458
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,800
That's literally what my mom would say all the time before I would go to things like

1459
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:26,800
that.

1460
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,800
Before you go to sleep every night.

1461
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:28,800
Remember Mermaids.

1462
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:29,800
Remember Christina Ricci.

1463
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:30,800
She almost died.

1464
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:36,320
This is sort of a sidetracky thing.

1465
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:40,400
It's a little bit of a walk to get there, but I think it'll be worth it.

1466
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,800
So there's multiple Slitherbonds.

1467
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:46,200
We've only talked about the new Brownfuls one, but there's...

1468
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:49,240
I think there's one in Corpus Christi, there's one in Kansas City, and they've been trying

1469
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,320
to build one in the area of Padre Island.

1470
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:52,600
Do you know where that is?

1471
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:53,600
Oh, of course.

1472
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,680
South Padre Island was another hotbed for horny teens.

1473
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:56,680
Oh boy.

1474
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:57,680
Wow.

1475
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,600
You're making it sound like all of Texas is...

1476
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:01,600
Yeah, I just filled...

1477
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:07,240
Well, it just helps that most of my time was spent either in childhood or in puberty in

1478
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:08,240
Texas.

1479
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,240
Okay, sure.

1480
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:10,240
I left when I was 18.

1481
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,800
When you could handle it, when you were just overflowing.

1482
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:13,800
Yeah, exactly.

1483
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,840
What is in South Padre Island?

1484
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:16,840
It's a beach.

1485
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:17,840
It's like a beach town.

1486
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:18,840
Okay, okay.

1487
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:19,840
Yeah.

1488
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:24,240
They're trying to build a big development there of which Slitherbond would be an anchor.

1489
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:29,000
The primary parties trying to put this together are the current owners of Slitherbond, Jeff

1490
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:34,560
and Gary Henry, who inherited the company from their dad, and another guy, a local developer

1491
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:36,560
named Paul Schexnailder.

1492
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,600
Ooh, Swindler.

1493
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,600
So yeah, probably from the...

1494
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,920
I wouldn't trust him.

1495
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:45,120
Anyway, they've ended up in this big real estate war and the thing has never gotten

1496
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,120
built.

1497
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:48,920
I don't think the hurricane helped those efforts either.

1498
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:51,200
Why build on that coast at this point?

1499
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,200
Yeah.

1500
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,200
It's crazy.

1501
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:57,040
But anyway, yeah, Schexnailder is claiming that the Henry brothers aren't putting up

1502
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:01,680
money and then, and whatever fighting is going on, the two brothers have split apart.

1503
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:02,680
They aren't friends anymore.

1504
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:03,680
They aren't working together.

1505
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:04,680
Wow.

1506
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,720
And all everyone I'm talking about is like 60, 70 year old men.

1507
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:07,720
Yeah, sure.

1508
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:09,880
I thought the South Padre one did get opened.

1509
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:10,880
I don't know.

1510
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:11,880
Possibly.

1511
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:16,560
On Wikipedia, it seemed like the Fort Lauderdale one was dealing with a lot of the similar.

1512
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:17,560
Oh, okay.

1513
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:18,560
It could be.

1514
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,200
I'm not sure which is which.

1515
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,600
But anyway, a giant fight.

1516
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:27,320
The Schlitterbahn has not gotten built and this is all from a newspaper article I read.

1517
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:29,600
But then the Henry's father was dying.

1518
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:33,240
A major Schlitterbahn executive, probably the CEO of the company, and he's about to

1519
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:34,240
pass.

1520
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:35,600
He's been given the last rights.

1521
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:36,820
He's in his last week.

1522
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:42,320
So Schexnailder puts all their differences aside to email the brothers and say, hey,

1523
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:45,120
I know everything's crazy, but I wanted to let you know I'm thinking about you and your

1524
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:49,120
family and I'm sorry that your father is going to pass away.

1525
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:54,120
And he gets an email back from Jeff Henry, Schlitterbahn president or something.

1526
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:55,120
One of the brothers.

1527
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:56,600
And it is this.

1528
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,840
I am extremely tired of both of you guys.

1529
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,640
Consider me your lifelong enemy now.

1530
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:04,160
Wait, is this the dad that's about to die he wrote this email?

1531
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,160
No, this is not the dad.

1532
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:06,160
It's one of the brothers.

1533
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,160
It is one of the brothers.

1534
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:08,160
So his dad is about to die.

1535
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,160
Both of you guys?

1536
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:12,120
Yeah, so he's talking to his own brother and to Schexnailder.

1537
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:13,120
And to Schexnailder.

1538
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:14,120
Okay.

1539
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:18,960
So Schexnailder and Gary, I'm extremely tired of both of you guys.

1540
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:23,200
Consider me your lifelong enemy now as I have sworn on dad's grave to avenge.

1541
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,200
Dad's grave?

1542
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,200
Believe me now.

1543
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,200
Wait, is his dad even dead yet?

1544
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:27,200
No, he's about to die.

1545
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,200
But we bought the grave.

1546
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:29,200
I swore on the grave.

1547
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,200
I've got my hand on it.

1548
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,200
My grave is next to it.

1549
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,200
Gary, I'll make sure yours isn't.

1550
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:33,200
Believe me now.

1551
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:42,200
I'm going to blow both of you out of the water or worse sink you below it.

1552
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,200
Wow.

1553
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,200
I can't help it.

1554
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:51,880
I think water and even when I'm furious, you may win in court, but let me assure you, you

1555
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:53,880
will not win in the end.

1556
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:55,280
Hell is where you both belong.

1557
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,280
Oh my God.

1558
00:59:56,280 --> 01:00:00,320
Don't worry, Paul, Gary, one and the same.

1559
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:01,640
Judges will eat you both.

1560
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,400
I love this.

1561
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,400
That's a real email that's in a newspaper article.

1562
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,920
I love petty, stupid old man shit.

1563
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:10,920
Yeah.

1564
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:15,200
And you know what I love about it is that it's like Dallas or Falcon Chris.

1565
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:20,960
It's like one of these crazy 80s businessman soap operas that had happened in real life.

1566
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,600
I declare, sir.

1567
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:25,840
Like an oil man or something.

1568
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:28,920
It's obviously very theatrical, but I was looking at all the different names of the

1569
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:29,920
rides.

1570
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:34,720
So I'm wondering if these guys, because they've named a couple of slides after pirates.

1571
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:35,720
There's Blackbeard.

1572
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:36,720
There's a Blackbeard water slide.

1573
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:37,720
Oh, I remember Blackbeard.

1574
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:38,720
Lafitte.

1575
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:39,720
It's another pirate.

1576
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:40,720
That sounds sexy.

1577
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:41,720
It's a very sexy purple slide.

1578
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:42,720
Normal purple slide.

1579
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:43,720
It sort of looks like a penis.

1580
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:56,720
Yeah, purple can be the color of a dead man if there's problems.

1581
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:57,960
And there's like the Black Knight.

1582
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:03,700
So I wonder if these guys have like an affection for these old characters.

1583
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:09,800
And when he's writing that email, if he isn't thinking of himself as Lafitte or Blackbeard.

1584
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:13,000
Or what you want is the Sheck Snail or your regular Blackbeard.

1585
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Right.

1586
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Now I'm Lafitte.

1587
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
I shall vanquish.

1588
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:22,480
I shall drown you as though you were Christina Ricci, except I'll finish the job.

1589
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,840
It's on the menu too.

1590
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:30,000
It's like, hey, I want one shrimp basket with fries and one order of a father's revenge.

1591
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
That's a combo.

1592
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
That's shrimp and fried cod.

1593
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Yeah, one of those.

1594
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,440
Can I get it in a mega father's grave?

1595
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:40,720
I can't believe he swore on his father's grave.

1596
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:41,720
That's insane.

1597
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:42,720
That's wild.

1598
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,520
He's like four days away from dying.

1599
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:45,520
Where do these guys live?

1600
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:46,520
Where are they?

1601
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:47,520
I know Padre Island.

1602
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,600
The company is called Upper Padre Partners.

1603
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:50,600
Oh wow.

1604
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:51,600
It's like nice, fun name.

1605
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:55,800
And they're talking about a water park for children.

1606
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:59,080
And they're like, I will eat you.

1607
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:00,880
Consider your eyeballs spit out.

1608
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,440
That's so crazy.

1609
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:04,800
Someone got screwed hard in this thing.

1610
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:05,800
Yeah.

1611
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:07,520
It's a very, very sensitive subject.

1612
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:08,640
Tour the Henry brothers.

1613
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:13,200
I also like the guy swearing on his dad's grave against his brother.

1614
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,800
Like shouldn't the brother have equal right to swear on the grave?

1615
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,080
But he claimed it, I guess.

1616
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:19,080
He claimed the right.

1617
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:20,080
Dibs.

1618
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,800
I call first on daddy's.

1619
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:24,360
I get to swear on his grave first.

1620
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:27,040
Then you can do it later, but about something else.

1621
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:30,920
You can use a non-profane term that's less aggressive.

1622
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:34,360
But profanities on father's grave shall come from me.

1623
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:39,520
This is not uncommon in the behind the scenes theme park.

1624
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:43,840
If you hear the stories from Disney in the 80s and 90s of Michael Eisner and Jeffrey

1625
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:51,720
Katzenberg and Frank Wells, the shifting alliances trying to rebuild this once great company.

1626
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:54,720
And they just all kind of hated each other.

1627
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:58,720
And then Frank Wells died in that helicopter accident.

1628
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,240
One guy died and then they got out of...

1629
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:01,240
Tilted the balance of power.

1630
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:02,240
Yeah.

1631
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,320
Put their differences...

1632
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:06,240
He was like the calming presence.

1633
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:11,120
And you do see like more madness setting in after he passes.

1634
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,120
Wow.

1635
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:14,200
I think they flew too close to the sun.

1636
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:15,400
They expanded too much.

1637
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,400
They got too greedy.

1638
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,400
Absolutely.

1639
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:20,680
I think more money, more problems is where this ends.

1640
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:23,200
As Tweety Bird would say, more money, more problems.

1641
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,920
Tweety Bird, you didn't fucking coin that shit.

1642
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:29,680
You stole this for your shirt, Tweety.

1643
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:33,160
Whenever though anyone works with anyone for multiple years, they hate each other.

1644
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:34,960
That's just sort of the band rule.

1645
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:37,760
That might be the podcast rule in a couple of years.

1646
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:38,760
Never ever.

1647
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,800
Like I'll be wishing Jason dead in a couple of years.

1648
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:44,160
I swear on my father's grave.

1649
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,960
I'm like, dead?

1650
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:48,160
Why would you do that?

1651
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,560
God, I'm still alive.

1652
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:54,120
Jason brings up like corndogs again on the podcast and I just lose my mind.

1653
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:55,120
God damn it.

1654
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:56,120
Not again.

1655
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:59,120
I'm sick of hearing about corndog castle.

1656
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:00,960
Can it be hot dogs?

1657
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:01,960
Once?

1658
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:02,960
No.

1659
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:06,600
Sometimes we explain that Carthay Circle is cool.

1660
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:13,160
California adventures where we drink and we feast on mead and other libations.

1661
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:15,400
I will eat your butt, Jason.

1662
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,440
Consider your butt.

1663
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,240
It's chewed and swallowed.

1664
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:20,840
Still polite though.

1665
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:22,760
At some point we went really clean.

1666
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:24,600
At some point we tried that approach.

1667
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:25,600
Wait, what?

1668
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,600
Just do, I'll eat your butt.

1669
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:29,840
Oh yeah, you went back down to butt.

1670
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:30,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1671
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:31,840
Kids are listening still.

1672
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:32,840
Eat your butt.

1673
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:33,840
Yeah.

1674
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:35,920
Yeah, eat your butt when I was a kid would probably confuse me.

1675
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:36,920
I'd be like, huh.

1676
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:37,920
Is that a throaty?

1677
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:39,920
You didn't consume the butt.

1678
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:40,920
Interesting.

1679
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:44,120
This is a murky threat you've given.

1680
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:50,040
Since we've talked about like lots of gross things from my sexual past.

1681
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:53,480
When I was 10, I dated like this 11 year old boy.

1682
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:54,880
You dated when you were 10.

1683
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:55,880
I'm still jealous again.

1684
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:56,880
This is all weird.

1685
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,600
This is all weird circumstances.

1686
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:00,280
My parents never knew about this.

1687
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:05,440
My friend from my neighborhood set me up with her friend from her school.

1688
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:10,200
So I didn't know him and we'd just write each other's notes and talk on the phone.

1689
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:12,920
I went on one date with him and I was terrified.

1690
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:14,480
I was like, I can't do this.

1691
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:15,480
An older man.

1692
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:16,480
An older man.

1693
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:17,480
He's a gentleman.

1694
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:18,480
Yes.

1695
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:19,820
He wrote something.

1696
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:23,680
He wrote me a poem and it was like roses are red, violets are blue.

1697
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:28,760
I really want to fuck you was written and then fuck you was crossed out, which I can

1698
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:30,040
still see it.

1699
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:31,960
And then eat you was written.

1700
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:37,120
Which again, I had no concept of what that meant.

1701
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:39,240
I did not know what eat you meant.

1702
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:41,640
Like I mean he meant like connellingus, right?

1703
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:42,640
I would guess.

1704
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:43,640
Or just like eat you up.

1705
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:44,640
Like you're such a little cutie.

1706
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:45,640
I want to eat you up.

1707
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:46,640
Yeah.

1708
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:47,640
Yeah.

1709
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:48,640
Yeah.

1710
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,080
Or like eat my shorts type thing.

1711
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:51,080
I don't know.

1712
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:52,080
Something funny.

1713
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:53,080
But he'd also said fuck already.

1714
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:58,280
He already said fuck and then crossed it out to where I could still see what he wrote.

1715
01:05:58,280 --> 01:05:59,280
God.

1716
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:02,440
Can we launch a Twitter campaign against this guy?

1717
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:03,440
Yeah.

1718
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:04,440
Yeah.

1719
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:05,440
Stuart Schuller.

1720
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:06,440
I know you're out there.

1721
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:07,440
Oh God.

1722
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:11,680
I still have the note.

1723
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,280
First noted case of slander.

1724
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:14,280
Very good.

1725
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:15,280
Let's call him out.

1726
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,280
To a 10 year old girl.

1727
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:20,240
You did that to a 10 year old girl.

1728
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:23,920
I mean it is so scary to think about, but we were both children.

1729
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:28,360
I swear on your grant Stuart, so long as I live.

1730
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:31,200
I wouldn't even, I don't even know if it said I want to fuck you.

1731
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,200
I don't think I would have known.

1732
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,200
I wouldn't.

1733
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,200
No I didn't either.

1734
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:35,200
I was in a committed relationship with.

1735
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,280
I didn't know about fucking in that sense.

1736
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:41,000
I knew it was a bad word, but I didn't know it meant sex.

1737
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,960
10, 11, I was in a committed relationship with my X-Men action figures.

1738
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:45,960
Oh.

1739
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:46,960
Very, uh.

1740
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:47,960
How committed.

1741
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:51,480
Rogue was your best girl.

1742
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:55,640
I had six joke pitches that flashed in my head when you were about to go into that joke.

1743
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:56,640
Yeah.

1744
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,640
I had a nice, uh, Haagen-Dazs, uh.

1745
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:01,640
Whoa, whoa, my family wasn't millionaires.

1746
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:04,360
We were buying a fancy ice cream.

1747
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:05,360
You were getting Blue Bunny.

1748
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:08,360
We were a Briars family.

1749
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:15,080
Um, well with all of those horrors, do we have any closing thoughts about this great

1750
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:16,080
franchise?

1751
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:17,080
Yeah, Slitherbond.

1752
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:18,080
I want to go back man.

1753
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:19,080
Oh there's um.

1754
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:20,080
You shouldn't.

1755
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:23,520
My nieces are probably going to get like old enough to go and I can go with them as an

1756
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:26,040
adult and watch the fun.

1757
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:28,880
Go and make sure no pervy 11 year old start, uh.

1758
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:31,120
I don't know how old your nieces are but.

1759
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:37,000
In recent years, some of the Slitherbond locations have added indoor parks that run like year

1760
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
round.

1761
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Whoa, okay.

1762
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,400
Uh, which is there was also uh.

1763
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:43,000
So while I'm there for Thanksgiving I can go check it out.

1764
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Yeah, so you may be able to.

1765
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,440
The fun can go year round.

1766
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:46,440
Yeah.

1767
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:49,000
There's an indoor park and that is in California now.

1768
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,040
There's a place called Great Wolf Lodge like by Anaheim.

1769
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:53,040
That sounds awesome.

1770
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:55,080
That is an indoor water park with a hotel.

1771
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:57,320
I remember that as I gotta go.

1772
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:00,160
It's an indoor water park with a hotel built in.

1773
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:02,680
Uh Scott lurked around at one time.

1774
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:03,680
I wandered around there once.

1775
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:04,680
I was for it.

1776
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:05,680
Yeah.

1777
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:06,680
Uh not a good.

1778
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:07,680
Just gonna check it out.

1779
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:08,680
Yeah, yeah.

1780
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:11,360
Just see if it might be fun for future uh head orange county owners.

1781
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:15,360
That's so funny to imagine someone walking up to Slitherbond and just like can I walk

1782
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,480
around here and just fully clothed.

1783
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:18,480
I'm not going to anything.

1784
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:19,480
I'm on my lunch break.

1785
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:20,800
I just want to see what it's all about.

1786
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:25,880
Just getting the gist in case I ever have or no children.

1787
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:26,880
Yeah.

1788
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:27,880
Yeah.

1789
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:28,880
Filing it away.

1790
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:29,880
Yeah.

1791
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:30,880
Um well do we do.

1792
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:34,880
I don't think we've established if we do our system when it's an entire water park.

1793
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,520
Well and we haven't been there.

1794
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:37,520
And we haven't been there.

1795
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:38,520
So we can't do it.

1796
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:46,000
We judge rides on a scale of keep it as is plus it up or burn it to the ground for insurance

1797
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
money.

1798
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Wow.

1799
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:53,440
It seems I doubt anyone's opinion is to burn uh Slitherbond to the ground for insurance

1800
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:54,440
money.

1801
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:55,440
No I don't think so.

1802
01:08:55,440 --> 01:09:00,800
From the website perusal that I was doing I would I would plus it I would I would put

1803
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:05,800
like black beard I would at least draw a black beard on the side of the slide if you're gonna

1804
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:06,800
call it black beard.

1805
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:09,040
Oh you love hand painted rides like Pixar.

1806
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:10,040
Uh huh.

1807
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:11,040
Uh huh.

1808
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:15,800
Oh don't they do have one I think where you go through like a little uh screen of mist

1809
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:17,720
and there's a dragon on it or something.

1810
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:18,720
Oh interesting.

1811
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:19,880
Uh so there is some.

1812
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:20,880
A little bit of.

1813
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:21,880
Character work.

1814
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:22,880
Character work.

1815
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:24,360
Which I don't know that you're getting that in almost any water slide.

1816
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:27,160
You like see a a character a monster.

1817
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:28,160
No I know.

1818
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:29,160
That's kind of neat.

1819
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:30,160
Yeah.

1820
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:34,840
Well you know here you do though there was a whole big thing uh the local indoor pool

1821
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:39,080
we had they like redid it when I was 12 and the whole big thing was that down the water

1822
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:45,440
slide there was a picture projected like that on the pirates and on what you're discussing.

1823
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:48,360
And it would just be like like a sun or something.

1824
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:49,360
It was Rahm Emanuel.

1825
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:50,360
You just like go through it.

1826
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:51,360
It was a young Rahm Emanuel.

1827
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:52,360
This was years before.

1828
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:53,360
Like one of those.

1829
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:54,360
It was Mayor Daley.

1830
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:55,360
Chicago Mayor Daley.

1831
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:59,400
Oh it was a Daley like doing like a deal with the Teamsters.

1832
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,360
Yeah yeah yeah they were shaking hands and a big sack of money.

1833
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:04,920
Reminds me of like a Magic Eye poster or book.

1834
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:05,920
Yeah it was a.

1835
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:09,560
You would see just a random image and it's like couldn't you do something clever with

1836
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:11,440
this and it was supposed to be a sun.

1837
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:12,440
Seems like a shitty gimmick.

1838
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:13,440
Sorry.

1839
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,440
They were both shitty.

1840
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:16,440
A baseball bat.

1841
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:19,320
But we were very excited and then yeah no it was nothing.

1842
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:20,560
So yeah I would always want a character.

1843
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:21,560
I always want a character.

1844
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:23,800
I want a robot but that's just me.

1845
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:28,680
I guess my whole overall opinion with Schlitterbahn is stop plussing it up.

1846
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:30,200
Oh yeah you don't want the plus.

1847
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:31,440
Let it die a little bit.

1848
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:33,960
I want it to like go back to its roots a little.

1849
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:36,160
Let it get overgrown with beasts.

1850
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:37,160
Oh boy.

1851
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:38,160
Return to nature.

1852
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:43,240
At least you know keep the water circulating so that no one gets any illnesses.

1853
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:44,240
Keep the filters.

1854
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:45,240
That's a good.

1855
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:46,240
Keep the filters going and the lifeguards.

1856
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:47,240
New filters.

1857
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:48,240
Keep the lifeguards.

1858
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:49,240
Oh boy.

1859
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:54,360
You will have to make a choice when you go back with like nieces of like do you just

1860
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:59,040
give them each twenty dollars and you go like I'm going to be here.

1861
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:00,040
I trust you.

1862
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:01,040
Oh.

1863
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:03,320
Go see the world or are you like I got to go.

1864
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:04,320
Oh no I wouldn't.

1865
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:05,320
I would kind of let these two.

1866
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:07,440
I'd be terrified to let them out of my sight actually.

1867
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:08,440
I think if my.

1868
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:09,960
Okay so my oldest niece is 15.

1869
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:14,760
If she was with her other 15 year old friends that would be fine to go off by themselves

1870
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:16,720
but no I couldn't.

1871
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:20,600
Like the 11 year old the seven year old the two year old.

1872
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:21,600
Oh there I am.

1873
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:22,600
Okay.

1874
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:23,600
Do they go.

1875
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:24,600
Have they been to.

1876
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:25,600
I don't know if they have.

1877
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:26,600
I wonder.

1878
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:28,880
You sure you want to bet that two year old's probably fine in the way.

1879
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:29,880
Yeah she'll be alright.

1880
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:30,880
She'll be alright.

1881
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:33,600
Right by next to the wall that water flies out of.

1882
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,600
Give her 20 bucks she'll be fine.

1883
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:36,600
Yeah.

1884
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:37,600
Jason was advocating.

1885
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:38,600
20 bucks maybe.

1886
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:44,080
I wonder how the inflation on those turkey legs has gone.

1887
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:46,440
I think they were probably like six bucks.

1888
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:47,440
They're probably.

1889
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:48,440
Closer to 10 now.

1890
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:49,440
Yeah 10 13.

1891
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:50,440
Maybe 12.

1892
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:52,720
Prices lower in Texas or higher in general.

1893
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:53,720
Is there an overall.

1894
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:56,120
I mean obviously prices go up everywhere.

1895
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:57,120
Yes.

1896
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:58,120
Yeah yeah.

1897
01:11:58,120 --> 01:11:59,120
But in the way things are more expensive in New York.

1898
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:01,200
I mean gas is still very cheap there though.

1899
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:02,200
Oh really.

1900
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:03,200
Oh yeah.

1901
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:06,400
And when I smoked it was a lot of fun to buy cigarettes there because of how cheap they

1902
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:07,400
were.

1903
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:08,400
Ah really.

1904
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:09,400
Don't smoke kids.

1905
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:14,400
You don't go across the border specifically for cigarettes.

1906
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,400
Across the border.

1907
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:16,400
Across the border.

1908
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:17,400
The Texas border.

1909
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:20,400
You don't make cigarette runs back to Texas.

1910
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:21,400
No I don't.

1911
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:22,400
No I don't.

1912
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:26,960
I definitely used to like yeah excitedly bring them back to New York or Washington state

1913
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:27,960
where I lived but.

1914
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:30,400
Oh yeah New York cigarettes are very expensive.

1915
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:31,400
Very expensive.

1916
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:35,240
They're somehow cheaper in California even though like everything else is more expensive

1917
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:36,240
than California.

1918
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:37,240
Why?

1919
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:38,240
Make them expensive.

1920
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:39,240
That's so awful.

1921
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:41,880
I can't stand the idea of cheap cigarettes.

1922
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:42,880
So awful.

1923
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:44,920
Yeah it's pretty seedy isn't it.

1924
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:45,920
Make them cheap.

1925
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:46,920
Yeah.

1926
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:47,920
Well.

1927
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:48,920
Well.

1928
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:49,920
We'll be right back.

1929
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:54,480
We'll be right back.

1930
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:55,480
Welcome back.

1931
01:12:55,480 --> 01:13:01,200
We're here now with another installment of our beloved segment Souvenir Smackdown.

1932
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:02,880
Kelly to set this up for you.

1933
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:09,600
The three of us have each gone hunting on eBay to try and find the weirdest or strangest

1934
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,520
or just most interesting funny.

1935
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:16,640
Or more too expensive for what is being sold.

1936
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:21,760
Souvenir prop from theme parks or something being sold online.

1937
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:22,760
Gotcha.

1938
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:23,760
That is connected to theme parks.

1939
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:24,760
All right.

1940
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:27,800
And we've all been hunting on eBay and Etsy.

1941
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:30,760
There is a large secondary market.

1942
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:31,840
Etsy has a very.

1943
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:32,840
I'm sure.

1944
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:33,840
Large population.

1945
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:34,840
So much garbage.

1946
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:37,000
Of knickknacks and garbage and theme park stuff.

1947
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,640
So Mike you want to go first.

1948
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:42,160
You will judge which one is the weirdest.

1949
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:43,160
Which is your favorite.

1950
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:44,160
OK.

1951
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:45,160
Yeah.

1952
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:46,160
Favorite's fine.

1953
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:47,160
Favorite's fine.

1954
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:48,160
Pick one out.

1955
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:51,400
It'll be apparent which is more expensive immediately.

1956
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:53,800
Pick the most expensive.

1957
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:55,240
Based only on the number.

1958
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:58,120
Yeah this is a supermarket sweet.

1959
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:02,120
So I'll read the headline first.

1960
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:08,360
And the headline is vintage rare Disney name tag badge cast member gag name tag.

1961
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:10,760
And it says must see like exclamation point.

1962
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:11,760
Oh my god.

1963
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:15,800
And then the description is this one of a kind name tag was discovered in the estate

1964
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:20,840
lot of a man who worked in central shops at the Walt Disney Resort in Orlando.

1965
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:25,760
And he must have had a pal working in the name tag department who made this gag tag

1966
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:26,760
on the slide.

1967
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:28,360
They're really assuming a lot.

1968
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:30,160
And there's so much backstory already.

1969
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:34,080
And there's so much like he knew a man who went to this one location.

1970
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:38,520
If you look at the grassy knoll there is a puff of smoke in the footage.

1971
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:41,680
Because it is an estate sale that this person found this.

1972
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:44,680
So the name tag that is hilarious.

1973
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:45,800
The gag.

1974
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:46,800
Is ratso.

1975
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:47,800
Oh.

1976
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:50,800
From mouse butt U.S.A.

1977
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:51,800
U.S.A.

1978
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:52,800
U.S.A.

1979
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:58,720
So the name on it is ratso.

1980
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:00,240
That's pretty cute.

1981
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:02,320
The city is mouse butt.

1982
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:03,320
And the U.S.A.

1983
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:04,320
U.S.A.

1984
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:06,760
I love the name tag.

1985
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:10,080
The description makes me feel like this guy doesn't have a good sense of humor.

1986
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:11,840
Even though he's like it is funny.

1987
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:14,960
But he's like I don't know the way he's saying that it's funny.

1988
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:16,680
It's like too dorky.

1989
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:18,040
It gets more extreme.

1990
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:21,600
It says the word ass but then the name itself is so tame.

1991
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:22,600
It's very mild.

1992
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:23,600
Right.

1993
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:25,600
What did you search to find this?

1994
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:26,600
Mr. Butt.

1995
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:27,600
Ratso.

1996
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,040
I searched Disney World I think.

1997
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:31,040
That's all.

1998
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:32,040
Do you think I searched like ass?

1999
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:33,040
Disney ass?

2000
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:34,040
No.

2001
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:36,440
I'm just curious to see what your searching method was.

2002
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:37,440
My searching method.

2003
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:38,440
Hardcore Disney porn.

2004
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:39,440
Yeah.

2005
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:41,120
Sexual Disney things.

2006
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:45,320
I think I searched Disney World and then I switched it so the highest price items are

2007
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:46,320
at the top.

2008
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:47,920
So I just surfed down from the.

2009
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:52,240
Because this is going for buy it now price $550.

2010
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:55,000
Oh my god.

2011
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,760
And this is the name tag of someone that worked at Disney.

2012
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:58,760
Right.

2013
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:02,480
It was probably just the guy who worked as the description speculates.

2014
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:06,960
Probably just a guy who loved a good gag that made it and then handed it to somebody because

2015
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:08,040
there would be no way.

2016
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:12,920
But also worked at Disney World or worked on a lot of a movie.

2017
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:13,920
There's no way to be sure.

2018
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:14,920
There's no way to be sure.

2019
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:17,080
This person has speculated so much as it is.

2020
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:19,440
But it is like the Disney name tag.

2021
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:21,000
So like chances are whoever.

2022
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Yeah.

2023
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,480
Or they could have snuck in one night.

2024
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:24,480
They had access.

2025
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:27,160
Access to the badge printer.

2026
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:28,160
Great.

2027
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:29,160
Right.

2028
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:30,160
And they used it on the ultimate joke.

2029
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:31,160
Ultimate prank.

2030
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:32,160
Ratso.

2031
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:33,160
Ratso.

2032
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:34,160
All right.

2033
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:35,160
Well.

2034
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:36,440
So let's hear the next one.

2035
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:38,040
Do you think yours has a chance to top?

2036
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:39,040
Because mine doesn't.

2037
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:40,040
It's just weird.

2038
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:41,040
I.

2039
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,880
Mine is also weird.

2040
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:43,880
So I.

2041
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:44,880
Can't wait.

2042
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:47,120
But if you thought I want to go out with a bang.

2043
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:48,120
There I go.

2044
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:49,120
I'll just go.

2045
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:50,120
I'll go for it.

2046
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:51,120
Yeah.

2047
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:52,120
You go.

2048
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:53,120
Don't undersell yourselves guys.

2049
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:54,800
It's definitely expensive for what it is.

2050
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:57,960
But the item is so silly.

2051
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:05,800
So what we're what we're looking at is this is a Mickey Mouse that is specifically a Mickey

2052
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:06,800
Mouse plush.

2053
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:07,800
Oh no.

2054
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:12,160
It is themed specifically after the Aerosmith Rock and Roller coaster.

2055
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:14,080
Oh that's an MGM right?

2056
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:15,080
Yes.

2057
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:17,480
That's at the Disney Studios in Florida.

2058
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:25,800
So it is a rockified Mickey Mouse who let me just try to explain.

2059
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:32,160
He's he's wearing like it's a it's a definition of rock music that's really more of a rave

2060
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:33,160
guy.

2061
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:34,440
He looks like Slash to me.

2062
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:35,440
Oh there you go.

2063
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:37,560
Doesn't he have the Slash hat and hair?

2064
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:39,040
It's a very Slash hat.

2065
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:41,960
He's in like patent leather and boots.

2066
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:43,800
Mickey is looking wild.

2067
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:45,920
He's kind of like a 2000s rave guy.

2068
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:48,400
Yeah he has a pair of silver glasses on.

2069
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:49,400
What are those?

2070
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:50,400
Silver glasses.

2071
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:51,680
It's a little like Elton Johnnie.

2072
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:52,680
Yeah.

2073
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:53,680
He's getting wild with the glasses.

2074
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:54,680
Someone just.

2075
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:57,400
I hate this so much.

2076
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:58,400
It's really hideous.

2077
01:17:58,400 --> 01:17:59,400
Read the description.

2078
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:04,520
The Aerosmith logo coming out of his hat and then he's wearing.

2079
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:05,840
Oh actually wait a minute.

2080
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:08,760
The version that I'm looking at he's missing his jacket.

2081
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:09,760
Don't buy this version.

2082
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:10,760
Do not buy.

2083
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:11,760
Because.

2084
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:12,760
Do not buy.

2085
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:16,680
If they hadn't misplaced the jacket it's got like flames on it.

2086
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:19,840
It's like a shirt the Smash Mouth guy would wear.

2087
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:20,840
Yes.

2088
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:26,160
There's not much going on description wise and actually there's a lot of these on eBay.

2089
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:28,480
There's not just the one.

2090
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:32,880
But so just a couple highlights though.

2091
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:36,600
Gently Loved and Ready for a New Home.

2092
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:38,800
That is my favorite Aerosmith song.

2093
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:39,800
Gently Loved.

2094
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:42,880
Get a little ready for a new home.

2095
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:44,560
Wait so what does the title say again?

2096
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:45,560
Rock and Roll Mickey?

2097
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:46,880
Oh gee yeah what does it say in the.

2098
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:53,360
Well this version that I have is paired with a children's book about the history of Aerosmith

2099
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:55,480
called Aerosmith Hard Rock Superstars.

2100
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:57,600
So this is kind of a bundle.

2101
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:58,600
Children's book.

2102
01:18:58,600 --> 01:18:59,600
Yes.

2103
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:01,440
Which probably leaves out a lot of chapters about their.

2104
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:04,000
Yeah they don't talk about love in the elevator in there.

2105
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,040
This is four years ago on Instagram.

2106
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:07,040
You just found this?

2107
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:08,040
This is my picture.

2108
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:09,040
What did Mike took in picture?

2109
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:13,000
Four years on Instagram of Mickey in Aerosmith outfit.

2110
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Oh boy.

2111
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,600
So they were still selling this.

2112
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:16,600
So they were selling this very recently.

2113
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:19,280
This Aerosmith outfit I still don't understand the glasses.

2114
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:20,640
I'll never understand the glasses.

2115
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:23,160
It's kind of Elton John and they're square.

2116
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:25,040
I think it's a little nod to rock history.

2117
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:26,400
Little nod to maybe Buddy Holly.

2118
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:27,400
But to Aerosmith?

2119
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:28,400
No.

2120
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:32,000
It doesn't make a lot of sense and the idea of well Mickey just kind of looks like this

2121
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,080
like devilish jester.

2122
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:38,960
He's like the demon of all things rock.

2123
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:41,120
He's a little Alice Cooper.

2124
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:45,200
It's a very bizarre definition of what a rock guy would wear.

2125
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:48,120
I couldn't name one hard rocker that wears glasses.

2126
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:49,120
Sorry.

2127
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:50,120
No I don't think there is one.

2128
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:51,120
I think you're right.

2129
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:52,120
It's also sort of a Jesse Camp vibe as well.

2130
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,120
You can't wear glasses.

2131
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:54,120
They're going to fly off.

2132
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:55,120
Yeah yeah yeah.

2133
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:56,120
Rocking too hard.

2134
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:59,920
Unless you like attach them at the back like a basketball player or something or like a

2135
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:00,920
dorky little girl.

2136
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:02,920
He should be dressed like Steven Tyler.

2137
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:05,680
He should have like an open shirt and just be covered in scarves.

2138
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:06,680
With scarves everywhere.

2139
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:07,680
Yeah.

2140
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:08,680
A little microphone with scarves.

2141
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:11,960
It would be very easy to do an Aerosmith Mickey.

2142
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:12,960
Right.

2143
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:15,080
Yeah Steven Tyler himself looks kind of iconic.

2144
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:16,280
The execution on this.

2145
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:19,400
This is sort of nothing.

2146
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:24,340
My description of this of how he's dressed is like if Mickey and Minnie were going to

2147
01:20:24,340 --> 01:20:30,940
an Aerosmith concert and he walked out and was like I'm ready and Minnie's like you're

2148
01:20:30,940 --> 01:20:31,940
going outside in that?

2149
01:20:31,940 --> 01:20:32,940
I don't know why.

2150
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:33,940
Yeah why did you do this?

2151
01:20:33,940 --> 01:20:34,940
No I guess no I was just joking.

2152
01:20:34,940 --> 01:20:41,680
I'll just put on the red shorts again I guess.

2153
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:42,680
He's 13 inches.

2154
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:43,680
Very cool.

2155
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:44,680
13 inches.

2156
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:45,680
13 inches of pure plush.

2157
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:46,680
Alright.

2158
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:53,680
Like I assume Mr. Tyler is packing and.

2159
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:54,680
Yeah sure.

2160
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:55,680
Thirteen at least.

2161
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:56,680
Oh yeah.

2162
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:57,680
Minimum soft.

2163
01:20:57,680 --> 01:20:58,680
But when he's hard rocking.

2164
01:20:58,680 --> 01:20:59,680
Wait a minute.

2165
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:00,680
Who knows.

2166
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:01,680
Anyway this is only.

2167
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:02,680
There's a lot of people who are like.

2168
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:05,160
Oh who knows.

2169
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:06,160
There's a lot of these on eBay.

2170
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:07,160
You can get your own very easily.

2171
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:10,160
They're all somewhere from 15 to 25 dollars.

2172
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:11,160
Not unreasonable.

2173
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:12,160
Yeah.

2174
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:13,160
But pretty stupid.

2175
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:14,160
15 to 25 dollars.

2176
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:17,160
I did just casually describe that as.

2177
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:18,160
Yes that's funny.

2178
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:19,160
It's kind of a bargain.

2179
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:20,160
Yeah yeah it's good.

2180
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:21,160
If you want Kelly go for it.

2181
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:22,160
It's a good Christmas present.

2182
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:23,160
Definitely.

2183
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:24,160
That might still be on sale.

2184
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:25,160
I should see if it's still on sale.

2185
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:26,160
It's probably for sale.

2186
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:27,160
They probably are still selling them.

2187
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:28,160
Don't buy it.

2188
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:29,160
We're not selling them.

2189
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:30,160
We're not selling them.

2190
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:31,160
We're not selling them.

2191
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:32,160
We're not selling them.

2192
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:33,160
Don't buy it.

2193
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:34,160
What are you doing.

2194
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:35,160
I'll buy one for each of us.

2195
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:36,160
All right.

2196
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:37,160
Okay.

2197
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:38,160
Oh wait.

2198
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:39,440
Also my wife posed this question to me.

2199
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:42,480
What do you think Mickey's favorite Aerosmith song is?

2200
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:43,480
Oh god.

2201
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:46,480
I don't know.

2202
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:49,080
My rationale is that he likes.

2203
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:53,800
I think Mickey's favorite song in the world is When You Wish Upon a Star.

2204
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:55,520
Because it's within the company.

2205
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:56,520
It's a ballad.

2206
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:57,520
He's a tender.

2207
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:58,520
He's a tender guy.

2208
01:21:58,520 --> 01:21:59,520
Yeah.

2209
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:01,520
So I think he likes I Don't Want to Miss a Thing.

2210
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:02,520
Oh that's true.

2211
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:04,360
It is kind of loving.

2212
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:06,200
It's almost like a classic Disney song.

2213
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:08,720
You can imagine Jiminy Cricket singing I Don't Want to Miss a Thing.

2214
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:10,400
No I cannot.

2215
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:11,880
I think it's Dream On.

2216
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:12,880
Dream On.

2217
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:14,680
Because dreams are so much of part of Disney.

2218
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:15,760
It's dreams.

2219
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:16,840
So Dream On.

2220
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:17,840
What about Ragdoll?

2221
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:18,840
No.

2222
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:23,080
It's an old timey kind of song.

2223
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:24,360
As a doll.

2224
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:27,000
He also would probably be a big fan of Toys in the Attic.

2225
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Yeah.

2226
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Toys in the Attic.

2227
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,000
We know this song.

2228
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Toys in the Attic.

2229
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Attic.

2230
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
There we go.

2231
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,000
We all know it.

2232
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,000
All right.

2233
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Let's see what you've got.

2234
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Jason.

2235
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,000
All right.

2236
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,560
So from readily available to one of a kind.

2237
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:49,520
Walt Disney World actual park used prop sign stained glass window town square.

2238
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:53,680
That nonsense sentence is the description on eBay.

2239
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:55,200
Here has told us nothing.

2240
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:56,200
It's a sign.

2241
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:57,200
Right.

2242
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:58,200
Yeah.

2243
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:02,360
The prop sign was used at the original town square restaurant on Main Street USA inside

2244
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:07,540
the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World sponsored by Hormel from 1981 to 1989.

2245
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:11,160
This piece hung above the doorway as guests entered the restaurant now known as Tony's

2246
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:12,440
Town Square.

2247
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:17,960
It was removed during refurbishment which converted the former Hormel sponsored space

2248
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:20,960
into the now famous Tony's Town Square restaurant.

2249
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:25,040
What is your guess as to what this stained glass window says?

2250
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:26,040
I already saw it.

2251
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:27,040
Yeah.

2252
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:28,120
You said it's Hormel.

2253
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:29,120
That was the sponsor.

2254
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:30,120
Yeah.

2255
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:31,120
Is that a chili?

2256
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:32,120
Hmm.

2257
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:33,120
What it says?

2258
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:34,120
I don't know.

2259
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:35,120
That's hard to narrow down.

2260
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:40,560
Well, Scott, it's the official logo of Hormel in stained glass.

2261
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,600
Oh, beautiful stained glass.

2262
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:43,600
There's it.

2263
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:44,600
Okay.

2264
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:47,320
It says Hormel and then around that are some beautiful pink flowers.

2265
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:48,520
Some beautiful pink flowers.

2266
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:49,520
So this is a one of a kind.

2267
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:50,520
And this hung above someone.

2268
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:51,520
Oh my God.

2269
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:52,520
It was in Main Street.

2270
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:53,520
That was in there.

2271
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:54,520
Right.

2272
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:55,520
Wow.

2273
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:56,520
Oh my God.

2274
01:23:56,520 --> 01:24:01,400
Along with this window, the purchaser will receive an original Town Square restaurant

2275
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:03,000
newspaper menu.

2276
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,880
Oh no.

2277
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:05,880
Featuring entrees.

2278
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:11,200
Town Square restaurant, cafe, bill affair.

2279
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:13,200
This is an old time fun menu.

2280
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:14,200
Wow.

2281
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:15,200
Town Square cafe.

2282
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:16,200
And-

2283
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:18,360
What do we got on that, baby?

2284
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:20,360
Someone cares about that.

2285
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:24,160
Entree number one with a bullet.

2286
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:25,160
Ham steak.

2287
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:29,360
Then you got beef stew.

2288
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:33,160
You can get a cup of chili, a dollar 75, a bargain at the time.

2289
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:35,160
I wonder if it's Hormel brand.

2290
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:37,480
Something tells me.

2291
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:38,840
Might be.

2292
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:41,400
The Main Street deli plate.

2293
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:45,720
All of these delicious in the hundred degree Florida heat.

2294
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:46,720
Eww.

2295
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:47,720
Ham steak.

2296
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:48,720
Yeah.

2297
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:49,720
Shrimp salad.

2298
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:50,720
Awful.

2299
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:51,880
Shrimp salad sandwich.

2300
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:55,800
And I think the good people at Hormel, I'm thinking shrimp salad, baby.

2301
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:57,760
I wonder when this menu came out.

2302
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:00,520
I feel like it was when food was at its worst.

2303
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:01,520
Does it say?

2304
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:02,520
Yeah.

2305
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:03,520
80s were crummy for food.

2306
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:04,520
Yeah.

2307
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:05,520
Bad food.

2308
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:06,520
Yeah.

2309
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:07,520
81 to 89.

2310
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:08,520
So this is-

2311
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:11,120
All the mass production had just started and they were not doing a good job.

2312
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:12,120
Sure.

2313
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:15,600
So everything's really bland and you have no influences of other cultures.

2314
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:18,720
There is nothing international about this food whatsoever.

2315
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:19,720
Yeah.

2316
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:20,720
That's true.

2317
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:21,720
It's all white.

2318
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:22,720
It's all Mexican.

2319
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:23,720
Yeah.

2320
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:24,720
Here's a favorite.

2321
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:25,720
White and brown food.

2322
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:26,720
Ugh.

2323
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:27,720
Potatoes.

2324
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:28,720
Plain.

2325
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:32,360
So I don't know why Hormel's name is in this one.

2326
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:34,560
Farm fresh catfish from Hormel.

2327
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:35,560
No.

2328
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:38,280
Like no other item has Hormel in the name.

2329
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:40,560
And I don't want farm fresh for fish.

2330
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:45,760
I mean, I know that a lot of them come from farms, but you don't say farm fresh catfish.

2331
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:48,040
You want to imagine they're caught from a stream.

2332
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:49,040
Like a stream.

2333
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:50,040
Yeah.

2334
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:51,040
Like a stream.

2335
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:52,040
Like sugar bottle fish.

2336
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:53,040
Yeah.

2337
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:57,200
Dan went to a steakhouse with the Wet Hot American Summer writing staff.

2338
01:25:57,200 --> 01:26:01,240
And it was a fun staff night out.

2339
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:03,840
And it just turned out to be the worst steakhouse ever.

2340
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:10,280
I can't remember what it's called, but they boasted on the menu, our beef is corn fed.

2341
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:12,280
That's a very common steakhouse thing.

2342
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:13,280
No.

2343
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:14,280
They want it to be.

2344
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:15,880
No one likes corn fed anymore.

2345
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:16,880
Corn fed.

2346
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:19,200
That was impressive a long time ago.

2347
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:21,600
I bet that jerk Stewart runs that steakhouse.

2348
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:22,600
Yeah.

2349
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:25,400
And they're like, corn's hard to find, you know.

2350
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:26,960
There's not a lot of corn to go around.

2351
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:29,600
The government doesn't like to subsidize corn.

2352
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:32,080
We shoved corn down this cow's throat.

2353
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:33,080
Yeah.

2354
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:34,080
Ready to eat it.

2355
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:35,080
He hated it.

2356
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:38,080
Corn fed catfish.

2357
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:39,080
Some more info.

2358
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:40,080
They were very thorough.

2359
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:41,560
Are you going to read us the whole menu?

2360
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:42,560
No, no.

2361
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:44,760
This is more from the eBay description.

2362
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:49,160
The menu is one sheet of heavy newspaper like paper printed both front and back containing

2363
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:54,120
Hormel history, facts, and of course the food and drink offerings at the time.

2364
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:56,600
I hate that this comes with the sign.

2365
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:57,600
Side note, all the-

2366
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:58,600
Pretend you're there.

2367
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:06,200
All the framed artwork under the glass inside the dining room are original works made by

2368
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:09,760
the famous Disney artist Don Ducky Williams.

2369
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:11,280
Okay.

2370
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:13,360
Which is kind of a confusingly word.

2371
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:16,560
Is that like the, he made the stained glass himself?

2372
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:17,560
I don't know.

2373
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:19,560
He wrote the menu items.

2374
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:20,560
There's some catfish on there.

2375
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:21,560
He wrote the menu.

2376
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:22,560
I don't know.

2377
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:24,600
Hungry for shrimp salad.

2378
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:25,600
Hungry.

2379
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:26,960
Ducky loves shrimp salad.

2380
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:27,960
Ducky loved ham.

2381
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:28,960
Ham's good.

2382
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:30,320
Everyone loves a good ham.

2383
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:31,320
Sirloin steak.

2384
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:32,320
What's the price?

2385
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:35,320
What is the price?

2386
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:37,040
The current buy it now price.

2387
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:39,040
Does anyone want to guess?

2388
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:40,040
$42.

2389
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:41,040
$6,000.

2390
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:44,040
I'll split the difference.

2391
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:45,040
$1,000?

2392
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:49,640
My real answer is $200.

2393
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:53,000
Mike's too high and Scott, you're a little too low.

2394
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,800
Currently selling for $3,500.

2395
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:56,920
Oh my God.

2396
01:27:56,920 --> 01:27:59,920
So that's insane.

2397
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:00,920
Yep.

2398
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:01,920
That's stupid.

2399
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:02,920
It is a nice window though.

2400
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:03,920
Stained glass.

2401
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:04,920
Hormel though.

2402
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:05,920
Hormel is an embarrassing word.

2403
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:11,400
It is an embarrassing word, but Disney has a rich history of being associated with evil

2404
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:13,120
corporations and companies.

2405
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:18,760
So if you could get a House of the Future Monsanto sign, sure Monsanto is evil, but it's

2406
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:19,760
from that-

2407
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:20,760
But it's the House of the Future.

2408
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:23,360
It was the House of the Future, so I could see people paying a large-

2409
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:24,360
Oh my God.

2410
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:25,360
I'm not going to buy this.

2411
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:26,360
Yeah.

2412
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:27,360
I might.

2413
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:29,920
Jason though, I could see having a stained glass window with Hormel.

2414
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:34,080
It's probably one of my top five seasoned preserved meat companies.

2415
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:38,200
You just think of sloppy, wet, greasy meat when I've hit Hormel.

2416
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:40,200
You know what I mean?

2417
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:41,200
Yeah.

2418
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:43,520
And having a lot of stained glass is incredible.

2419
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:46,480
Can drippings, like goo coming out of a can.

2420
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:48,880
Wait, I can't remember what yours was.

2421
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:50,360
Oh yeah, that name tag.

2422
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:51,360
Rat, though.

2423
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:53,080
Well, I think mine was the Hormel.

2424
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:54,080
It was the Hormel.

2425
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:55,080
Jason Wins.

2426
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:57,120
Yeah, it's so fucking stupid.

2427
01:28:57,120 --> 01:28:58,120
Your favorite slash.

2428
01:28:58,120 --> 01:29:02,660
And I feel like it is kind of the most worth, I mean at least it was a sign at the place

2429
01:29:02,660 --> 01:29:04,600
and we know that.

2430
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:07,120
This Aerosmith crap is so loose.

2431
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:09,440
That's pretty, and they threw the jacket away.

2432
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:10,440
Yeah, exactly.

2433
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:11,440
They threw the jacket away.

2434
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:12,440
I assume.

2435
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:13,440
Fuck this.

2436
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:19,160
This does come with a certificate of authenticity, if you were concerned.

2437
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:26,240
Which is actually like in California, if you try to sell a signed book, you have to provide

2438
01:29:26,240 --> 01:29:27,840
a certificate of authenticity.

2439
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:28,840
It is a serious legal thing.

2440
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:32,560
I wonder what life would be like if I thought about those kinds of things.

2441
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:34,160
You know what I mean?

2442
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:35,160
Would it be better?

2443
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:38,160
You'd have a podcast like this.

2444
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:43,840
But would it be better if I obsessed over collecting items of things I liked?

2445
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:44,840
Would life be better?

2446
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:46,200
Does it bring a better quality?

2447
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:47,200
You're asking because we do that.

2448
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:48,200
Do you?

2449
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:49,200
Do you?

2450
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:50,200
You do do this?

2451
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:52,000
I have a lot of, yeah.

2452
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,400
Do you like it and you think about it and you like it?

2453
01:29:55,400 --> 01:30:00,440
Well, I have probably like 60 little of these Disney toys that I collect.

2454
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:01,760
I have all these other figures.

2455
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:07,120
I just bought a couple months ago, a $200 something doll of Adam West.

2456
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:09,000
It's dressed as Batman, little.

2457
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Sorry, sorry.

2458
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,000
What kind of sigh was that?

2459
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:16,000
I mean, it seemed like she was exhausted by what I was explaining.

2460
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,440
It goes in waves.

2461
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:21,760
Sometimes I go, well, I have too much stuff and then I get rid of it.

2462
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:25,600
And then sometimes I'm like, I need a little more and then I need a fix.

2463
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:26,600
Wow.

2464
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:27,600
And it feels good.

2465
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:28,600
It makes you happy.

2466
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:29,600
Yeah, it does.

2467
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:32,680
I just have to, I think I'm still in the process of balancing because for a while I was doing

2468
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:36,000
too much and I've sold a bunch of stuff.

2469
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,760
I don't have anything like that in my life.

2470
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:42,040
I guess it's sort of furnishing my home is at the moment my obsessive like collect it

2471
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:43,040
all thing.

2472
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:44,040
Oh, sure.

2473
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:45,040
Sure.

2474
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:48,880
But you know, yeah, you haven't bought some like bizarre piece of nostalgia or arcania.

2475
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:49,880
I don't think so.

2476
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:53,680
I have a lot of weird little figures, but they're all dirty and out of the package.

2477
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:55,320
I have a minor out of the package.

2478
01:30:55,320 --> 01:30:57,720
So I'm not like some crazy person.

2479
01:30:57,720 --> 01:30:58,720
Yeah, no.

2480
01:30:58,720 --> 01:30:59,720
Yeah.

2481
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:05,360
My brother has a lot of the figures too, like Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, all them shits.

2482
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:09,560
I remember when Star Wars Episode One came out, like they started re-releasing everything

2483
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:12,080
and then new ones too.

2484
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:17,080
So he was like, I'm going to start now because I fucked up as a kid and all that shit got

2485
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:18,080
buried in the sand.

2486
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:20,960
It's going to get so expensive.

2487
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:23,800
My newest thing is that I'm not going to collect the little things.

2488
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:29,840
I'm just going to spend money on the big expensive, but it's a classier look for my disease.

2489
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:33,080
Like a nice piece of art.

2490
01:31:33,080 --> 01:31:35,000
Maybe you would consider this Hormel thing.

2491
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,000
I know I would.

2492
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,000
I would consider it.

2493
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,000
It depends.

2494
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,000
I don't know where I would put it.

2495
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:42,560
I mean, I have the big haunted mansions from like the front, like it's a replica of it

2496
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:44,560
obviously, but we have that in the living room.

2497
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:46,400
Classier as opposed to a bunch of junk and knickknacks.

2498
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:49,760
Yeah, because if it's smaller and if it's all, I mean, I still have some of that stuff

2499
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:50,760
in my office.

2500
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:53,640
Yeah, I've seen some classy presentations of collector items before.

2501
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:55,400
Like that Adam West thing is cool.

2502
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:56,400
Yeah.

2503
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:57,400
Yeah, I've seen it.

2504
01:31:57,400 --> 01:31:58,400
Oh, it's very, yeah.

2505
01:31:58,400 --> 01:31:59,400
Thumbs up.

2506
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:00,400
Sign off.

2507
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:02,400
You can't touch his costume though because it'll rip.

2508
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:03,400
Gotcha.

2509
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:04,400
So do not.

2510
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:05,400
I'll see a picture of that one.

2511
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:06,400
You'll choose that over all of these items.

2512
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:07,400
It'll fall into dust.

2513
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:08,400
On that note.

2514
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:11,400
Hey, thank you so much for being here.

2515
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:12,400
Yeah, thanks for having me.

2516
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:13,400
That was a lot of fun.

2517
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:14,400
I'm sorry if I offended anyone in theater.

2518
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:15,400
No, no.

2519
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:17,400
Oh boy, some of those words and tales thrown around.

2520
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:21,760
Anything you want to plug or mention or send people to?

2521
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:26,080
Listen to Make Me Like It, my podcast I do with my husband, Dan Klein.

2522
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:28,240
Watch Dan Klein's show that he writes for.

2523
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:29,240
Great news on NBC.

2524
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:30,240
Hey, yeah.

2525
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:31,240
Love of God.

2526
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:32,240
Check out, oh, well, my show.

2527
01:32:32,240 --> 01:32:35,240
It's not online, but you can always hit me up.

2528
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:38,240
Is it lost in the Go90 turbine?

2529
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:42,840
Yeah, Go90 turbine shredded it and then my contract with them ran out.

2530
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:43,840
Thank God.

2531
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:44,840
So now I can do something with it.

2532
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:49,280
This is similar for my show, TwinFest, which I've never promoted on here, but it's out

2533
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:50,280
of the Go90 collection.

2534
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:51,280
Got it.

2535
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:52,280
Is Go90 a tale now?

2536
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:53,280
It's in hell.

2537
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:55,080
It's a memory like Bing Bong.

2538
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:56,080
Out of, yeah.

2539
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:58,680
But it doesn't have as good of a name as Bing Bong.

2540
01:32:58,680 --> 01:32:59,680
Yeah.

2541
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:00,680
Welcome to hell, Go90.

2542
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:01,680
Yeah.

2543
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:05,960
Hey, on that, well, yeah, watch and do all those things.

2544
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:06,960
Kelly, thanks for being here.

What can I say?

2558
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:24,880
That is the Feral sound effect.

2559
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:26,280
I was just being a bad boy.
