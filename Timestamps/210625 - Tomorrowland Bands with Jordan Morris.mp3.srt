1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,440
Warning, today's episode is a small yet lively horn section.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:15,680
Sad and bad future food, Smash Mouth Guy voice, and the long awaited debut of a new running

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,240
joke involving Jason Sheridan and a blue shirt.

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:26,040
Yes, all that plus Jordan Morris returns to talk Tomorrowland bands on today's podcast,

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:26,800
The Ride.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the theme park podcast hosted by three guys who love rock

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,320
concerts as long as the set list is approved by 15 Disney lawyers.

10
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,440
My name is Mike Carlson, joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

11
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,040
Yeah, you know, I just want everything on brand.

12
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,160
I want it to be in the right queue zone, the right quadrants.

13
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,880
Yeah, you want it to appeal to all demographics.

14
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,760
That's right.

15
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,280
Yes.

16
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,800
Nothing too bawdy.

17
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,520
Nothing too bawdy.

18
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,520
Scott Garner here.

19
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,040
Yeah.

20
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,360
How do you feel about that?

21
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,720
You know, it's called rock and roll, not rock and raunch.

22
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,560
So I don't want any raunchy materials.

23
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,920
It can be a tad edgy.

24
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,560
Maybe I'll allow some, you know, a journey or a Bon Jovi.

25
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:27,920
Right.

26
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,800
What have you.

27
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:35,520
They'll have long hair and the image is edgy, but the music mostly is squeaky clean.

28
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,160
Yeah, I want to make sure like Bob Chapek or Josh Demaro has looked over the songs that

29
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,720
I'll be hearing if I go to a theme park or a concert.

30
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,320
So I know that it's safe.

31
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:44,820
Yeah.

32
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,080
And neither of them have too wild of hair.

33
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,000
You couldn't trust an executive with long hair, I don't think.

34
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,600
So, you know, they're not getting too must, too rowdy.

35
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,720
You know what I'll say, though, real quick, and this, this, you know, we're doing a

36
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,040
rock and topic today, of course.

37
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,320
But I was looking through this, all the research and I was seeing, of course,

38
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,920
my beloved Mad Tea Party, which was a big rock and roll music extravaganza with the.

39
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,400
Call that I actually would not call that rock and roll.

40
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,360
They would play Prince, they would play Blink 182, some of the rock and his songs

41
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,120
that I know.

42
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,200
So what I thought it was more like rave ish.

43
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,520
Maybe I didn't know that we need to do this episode.

44
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,720
We were talking about showing.

45
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,080
Yeah, you're showing now that you actually.

46
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,080
You're literally finger wagging now.

47
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,480
You did not experience the actual Mad Tea Party.

48
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,040
Trappings, it has the visual elements of like it was an electric daisy carnival,

49
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,480
but in reality, it just has electricity and maybe a few days.

50
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,080
Well, Jason, you're you're no.

51
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,680
You see, Jason, you're not correct either.

52
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,880
There are so many points.

53
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,240
The most aggressive point.

54
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,200
OK, so for the listeners who don't know, the Mad Tea Party was something that they

55
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,480
had over in the dead zone of California Adventure by the Monsters Inc.

56
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,880
Ride, and they would have people dressed up as like Alice in Wonderland characters,

57
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:02,080
either playing in a band where they would play rock and roll music or DJ White Rabbit

58
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,600
would, as Scott's saying, come out and do a very like, you know,

59
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,400
Alice in Wonderland down the rabbit hole rave.

60
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,760
So they would do that.

61
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,760
You said that phrase as if it's a natural, you know, it's a real Alice in Wonderland,

62
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,760
you know, Tweedledee, Tweedledum, you know, really like, you know, just groovy stuff.

63
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,680
They had two large men playing Tweedledee and Tweedledum who would walk around as well.

64
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,400
And they would talk and they would like do banter with people.

65
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,760
So I I've probably seen parts of at least 10 of these Mad Tea Party shows.

66
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,560
So I've by the way, I forgot where I'm that many times.

67
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,680
I think so.

68
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,760
By the way, I forgot why I even started talking about this.

69
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,160
I know it's not even what we're using.

70
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,120
It's what we're talking about.

71
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,920
Rock and roll. Yes.

72
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,520
Always waiting. Any chance ready to remotely related.

73
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:51,040
There's already so much of the Tomorrowland Terrace and all the bands and the design and the

74
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,040
up and up and down stage.

75
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,040
I think where I was going with it was that they play Prince songs in the park.

76
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,480
So I am impressed that sometimes they get away with a slightly body or material.

77
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,920
I mean, they was let's go crazy, you know, and then kiss.

78
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:10,400
They were not only I've heard I heard the I heard the White Rabbit do a cover of Darlin' Nikki,

79
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,840
where actually they shouted.

80
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:18,240
He shouted masturbated louder than it is in the song and like kept adding it to other lyrics.

81
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,480
Or it didn't. So they'll get a real body.

82
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,520
Wow. Interesting.

83
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:26,480
I would I would you know, I love Prince of a huge Prince fan, but I would I would appreciate it if

84
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,520
they would change those lyrics to make them a little more kid friendly.

85
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,760
Mitter in a hotel lobby quietly perusing.

86
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,440
Gingerly turning the pages on a magazine.

87
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,680
Marveling at the contents of a magazine.

88
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,600
Right. Of a clean highlights magazine with leaving it for another guest to enjoy.

89
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,960
Chuckling at the Goofus and Gal in a cartoon.

90
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,520
Awesome gal. Yeah.

91
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,920
Zorowitz has done it again.

92
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,840
So we should at this point check in on the bodyness preferences of our guests.

93
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,160
Joining us in person from Jordan, Jesse Goh and the co-writer of the upcoming graphic novel

94
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,840
Bubble, it's Jordan Morris.

95
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,440
Hi, hi, everybody.

96
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,720
I'm here to rock and roll and kind of a hard PG.

97
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,160
Kind of way.

98
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,120
Yeah, no, no references to smoking, no references to drinking.

99
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,080
Right. Yeah.

100
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,360
Spending the night together.

101
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,080
Spending the night.

102
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,920
Because things can happen when you do that.

103
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,880
No. Yeah, exactly.

104
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,800
Yeah. Spending the evening together and then going to your separate homes.

105
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,280
That's what I'm that's what I'm here to do.

106
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,880
Making sure everyone's landed safely.

107
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,200
Right.

108
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,760
You don't want to interrupt each other's prayers.

109
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,440
Right. Or your magazine time.

110
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,800
Or your magazine time.

111
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,320
Because there's a new Andy Borowitz.

112
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:48,560
Right.

113
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,760
I have to send my hotel lobby and thumb through US News and World Report before bed.

114
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,240
Finishing the crossword in a magazine.

115
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,600
I might get too horny.

116
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,920
And hey, I've been to the I've been to the Mad Tea Party.

117
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,680
Just a little a little tip.

118
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,800
If you're a newbie, the scones are strong, so just take half.

119
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,200
Just do half.

120
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,400
See how you feel.

121
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,120
It won't it won't hit you right away.

122
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,160
So just like don't.

123
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,960
Alice in Wonderland is a cautionary tale in general.

124
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,760
She takes too much.

125
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,720
She grows really big.

126
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,760
She shrinks really small.

127
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,720
You don't want that to happen.

128
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:20,960
Yeah.

129
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,760
Know your limits.

130
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,320
That's the that's that's my message here today.

131
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,240
Kids know your tolerance levels.

132
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,720
Very great.

133
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,600
Thanks for that warning.

134
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,360
Yeah.

135
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,760
Hey, thank you for being here and for bringing us this this area, this musical area.

136
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,320
It's very specific area, which I think we're I mean, we know we can go a thousand directions.

137
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,560
We can mostly just keep talking about the Mad Tea Party.

138
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:40,960
Sure.

139
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,600
If you wish.

140
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:41,840
All right.

141
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,720
And that's that'll be the plan.

142
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,480
But like so we're mainly talking about like bands that play at Tomorrowland and not just

143
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,880
tomorrow like there's bands that play all over Disneyland.

144
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,640
That's kind of the main spot.

145
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:59,600
Sort of a, you know, a Coachella, if you will, a celebration of the many bands that have played

146
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,000
at Disneyland regularly over the years.

147
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,480
And you must bring this to us from experience.

148
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,760
You grew up down there.

149
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:14,160
Like, would you go to Disneyland for musical purposes specifically or accidentally?

150
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,480
Yeah.

151
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,120
I mean, I think the thing that got me thinking about this.

152
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,440
So I grew up in in Orange County in the like in the 90s.

153
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,480
So like, obviously, like I was there for like the height of Scott.

154
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:32,080
I was there for, you know, your save Ferris's and your real big fishes and your less than

155
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,920
Jake's and your mighty, mighty boss tones.

156
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,760
And like, and that was like that was like my shit.

157
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,280
That was like incredibly my shit.

158
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:45,280
And yeah, just like it was, you know, it was punk rock with training wheels.

159
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:54,560
It was like very, you know, some kind of generally anti authoritarian lyrics, but nothing specific.

160
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,120
Just, you know, that's, I can think what I liked about it.

161
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,440
Not an instruction manual of how to do some kind of specific overthrow.

162
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:07,040
No, yeah, just like, you know, question authority, but also, you know, wear a bowling

163
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,880
shirt with someone else's name on it.

164
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,760
I had a chain wall.

165
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,160
I had it.

166
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,040
I could, I could encompass this all by saying I had a chain.

167
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,160
Some checkered vans.

168
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,360
I did have some checkered vans.

169
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:15,600
Yeah.

170
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,080
And you had to go to the vans outlet to get them.

171
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,880
That's okay.

172
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,080
They were a specialty item back in, back in the 90s.

173
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,280
Now they have them at downtown.

174
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,640
I walked by them at downtown Disney, a whole rack of them at downtown Disney.

175
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,960
But I so, but you know, so like by the time I graduated high school in 2000, like,

176
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:38,960
like that stuff was just a punchline, just a fucking punchline.

177
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,160
Everybody hated it.

178
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,280
New metal was here.

179
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:48,480
You know, the, the unimpeachable new metal was here that something no one can make fun of.

180
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,400
So edgy.

181
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,800
Why would you even dare to attempt fate?

182
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,120
Right.

183
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,680
Exactly.

184
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,240
Get curb stomped by Wes Borland.

185
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,440
Right.

186
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:57,680
Yes.

187
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:58,880
Yeah.

188
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:04,000
Oh, if you, if you even had a horn section, you were in danger of getting curb stomped by Wes Borland.

189
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,640
That's not cool.

190
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,600
Not like at that point, what was cool was a DJ and a small person hype man.

191
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,080
Yes.

192
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,480
And, and bikini, American flag bikini wearing women.

193
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:16,720
Right.

194
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:16,960
Yeah.

195
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,080
That was the new cool.

196
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,280
But I, so, you know, like it was always like a little bit embarrassing to say that like

197
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:28,400
you were a Scott kid, but something that I kind of got wind of after I had graduated was

198
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,240
that all of the Scott kids had migrated to Disneyland.

199
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,280
Like that's, you know, any holdouts, anybody who wasn't too embarrassed to say that they liked it

200
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:41,280
had migrated to Disneyland to watch a band called the suburban legends.

201
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,680
Mm hmm.

202
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:41,840
Yes.

203
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:49,360
Who, uh, like I think formed like, you know, way, way past when you would think a Scott band would,

204
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,720
like late nineties.

205
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,160
And they kind of like, they planted their flag in Disneyland and they like played at

206
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,800
the Tomorrowland Terrace and they did like in, in their set, they had Disney covers.

207
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,280
So they would do, I just can't wait to be king.

208
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,960
They would do colors of the wind.

209
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,840
They would do the gummy bears theme song.

210
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,320
Wow.

211
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,160
The duck tales theme I saw.

212
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,840
And you know, and, and sometimes like there's those songs that you don't know are covers

213
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,680
because the artist just makes them iconic.

214
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,000
I mean, Sinead O'Connor's, uh, nothing compares to you.

215
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,240
Mm hmm.

216
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,120
Bar Rittner, of course.

217
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,640
Originally a Prince song, but we, no one knows it as a Prince song anymore.

218
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,840
It's a Sinead O'Connor song.

219
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,120
Just like Duck Tales is now a suburban legend song.

220
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,080
Wasn't that a cartoon theme song?

221
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,120
No, I thought it was.

222
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,120
Cartoon.

223
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,560
I think I spent a good amount of the first couple of semesters of college trading

224
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,120
wacky cover songs with people.

225
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,560
I feel like that was a big thing.

226
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,000
Cartoon theme songs, ska covers.

227
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,760
Dynamite Hack, Boys in the Hood.

228
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,760
Dynamite Hack, Boys in the Hood.

229
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,080
If that was the number one song in Napster history, I wouldn't be surprised.

230
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,760
At least Kazaa history.

231
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,760
Do I know anything else about Dynamite Hack?

232
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,720
Absolutely not.

233
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:00,880
No.

234
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,240
Who was the, is it Me First and the Gimmie Gimmies?

235
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,440
Did they do covers?

236
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:05,840
Oh yeah.

237
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,960
So the Me First and the Gimmie Gimmies.

238
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,080
Swing covers?

239
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:13,040
They were the like skate punk, uh, super group who does.

240
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:18,160
So they will do like, um, gosh, the one I listened to the most because I was also,

241
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,480
you'll be shocked to know in the drama club.

242
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,520
Ska and drama.

243
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,320
Yes, I know.

244
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,280
I'm the only one.

245
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,080
I'm the only guy to be into these two things.

246
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,720
So yeah, so Me First and the Gimmie Gimmies do like, they started with oldies,

247
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,600
but they had a cover of show, they had a show tunes album.

248
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,080
So it's like Fat Mike from NoFX.

249
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,520
It's Spike from Swing and Utters.

250
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,840
It's one of the guys from Lag Wagon.

251
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,760
Do any of these names mean anything to you guys?

252
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,480
Not the last two.

253
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:48,960
Little Bits and Pieces.

254
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,920
No, not the last two.

255
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,400
Yeah.

256
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,120
Lag Wagon.

257
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,320
Yeah.

258
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,760
Anyway, so it's like a, it is a skate punk, fat records super group that does covers.

259
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,040
And I have, I, I saw them two years ago.

260
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,360
Anyway.

261
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:01,600
Okay.

262
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,360
We have show tunes, you said?

263
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,360
Yeah, they'll do like, they do like themed albums.

264
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,560
There's a show tunes album.

265
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,520
There's an oldies album.

266
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,800
There's a country album.

267
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:10,800
Yeah.

268
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,120
So they like take a, take a little theme and, uh, you know, kind of skate punk them up.

269
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,120
That's fun.

270
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,640
I really should have gone outside more though than, uh, just sitting on the

271
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,440
campus land, like just sitting on my tunes.

272
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,520
You could have heard these covers live.

273
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,080
Yeah.

274
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,960
It's just the nastiest college rental houses in upstate New York or central New York.

275
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:37,920
I am curious though, if you guys like were part of like hometown music scenes, did you guys have like

276
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,960
local bands and venues that you went to, or was that just not part of?

277
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:48,880
Well, I was, I was in the local music scene with my band Second Level, of course.

278
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,380
Wow.

279
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,460
Who played the same one.

280
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:55,380
I don't think we were on the same show, but played the same venue fallout boy did.

281
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,540
Hey, that's, that's a feather in your cap.

282
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,940
Like they were there on Friday and you guys were there on Saturday.

283
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,500
I forget.

284
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,300
And I met Pete once, like a few years ago and I brought up,

285
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,580
because we're both from the same place around the same place and he was like, oh yeah, cool.

286
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,340
That wasn't even saying like, oh, he was so rude.

287
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:10,900
He wasn't.

288
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,780
It was just like, yeah, people, a lot of people are from there.

289
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,860
Better than silence, better than turning and walking away.

290
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,140
Yeah, that's a good point.

291
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,660
He could have just like closed his eyes and passed out too.

292
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:27,300
So how would you describe the music of Second Level?

293
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,340
Well, it was varied, I would say.

294
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,540
Oh, eclectic.

295
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,020
Wow.

296
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:32,820
It was varied.

297
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:37,540
There was some, I would say Red Hat Chili Pepper influenced music.

298
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,020
Okay.

299
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:42,020
I would say there was some like Scottie influenced music.

300
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,500
What else?

301
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,020
Green Day inspired, Offspring inspired.

302
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,580
This was a band I came into, by the way.

303
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,780
Their lead singer had quit and I said, you know what I should do?

304
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:58,740
I should sing in the band and I am not a great singer, but I decided I want to do it.

305
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,540
And then their old lead singer came back, so we were both in the band.

306
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,080
Whoa.

307
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:08,020
And so many of the great bands have multiple singers.

308
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:08,500
It was.

309
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,620
Second level among them.

310
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,020
Of course.

311
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:17,220
And probably, you know, the song our friends might remember the most is a song called Rock the House.

312
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:17,720
Oh.

313
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:19,380
Did it?

314
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,940
Well, we got into the school variety show with Rock the House.

315
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:30,740
We beat out another band that was much more like a polished Dave Matthews influenced,

316
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:34,180
probably much better musicians, and they were furious at us.

317
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,460
Oh, but you guys had like, you guys had like the passion, you know?

318
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:42,020
Maybe we don't have the chops that these guys do, but we had fucking balls.

319
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:42,660
It's very good.

320
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,380
It's punk.

321
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,100
That's for sure.

322
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:44,500
Thank you.

323
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,380
I love the literal skills.

324
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,460
I didn't feel comfortable around any of it.

325
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:55,380
Like the different like the band kids into Dave Matthews, I did not feel at home there.

326
00:14:55,380 --> 00:15:01,380
I did not feel at home in the mall punk like the scene.

327
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:01,880
Yeah.

328
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:07,780
I had like one or two friends and we we they knew a lot more about music than me.

329
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,660
And I just remember everyone discovering Interpool,

330
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,980
but not seemingly not my bloody Valentine, but discovering Interpool first.

331
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,420
It's Interpol.

332
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,900
Interpol, excuse me.

333
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,340
It's a regional pronunciation.

334
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,780
It depends on where you're from.

335
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,820
Some people say Interpol.

336
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:31,460
So yeah, I mean, I've discussed my journey from Thee Might Be Giants to Ben Folds Five to

337
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:36,500
other stuff, to the Strokes in the White Streaks hitting very big when I was like in the middle of

338
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,220
So you're being in the music scene means listening to music.

339
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,740
He's talking about like hanging out.

340
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,140
Yeah.

341
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,740
So that's as far as I got.

342
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:46,180
I like the idea of hanging out and listening to music really didn't hit.

343
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:46,900
Going to shows.

344
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,340
You were like, let's go to shows.

345
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:48,820
Yeah.

346
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,380
Yeah.

347
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,780
Your club was the CD player.

348
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,260
Yes.

349
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:52,660
Yeah.

350
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,300
In college.

351
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,100
The club of the mind was the hottest club in town.

352
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,460
Anybody can get in.

353
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,100
In the summers after college, I would go into Philadelphia a lot.

354
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,380
Like they would do free concerts on the pier by South Street.

355
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:09,060
And I saw the yeah yeah yeah on their first like and they put out their first album and

356
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,100
Phantom Planet.

357
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:10,740
Okay.

358
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,020
Everyone was like lost their minds when they played California.

359
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,620
Jason Schwartzman in the band, right?

360
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,020
Jason Schwartzman was still in the band.

361
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:23,860
They put out that really shitty strokes, strokesy kind of album later and everyone kind of bailed

362
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,420
at that point.

363
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:29,380
So the band, you know, the band, the Academy or they were, I don't know if they're a band.

364
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,540
The Academy is, do you remember that band?

365
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:31,940
Yeah.

366
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,820
This is like, this is some like punk adjacent stuff.

367
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,900
That's like a little bit after my time.

368
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,220
Yes.

369
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:42,180
So this is maybe something that I would call screamo, but people would say that's not right.

370
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:42,420
Yes.

371
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,460
It's post hardcore.

372
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,260
It's something like that.

373
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:44,580
Yeah.

374
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:45,380
Yes.

375
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,900
I get what this kind of thing.

376
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,060
Yeah.

377
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,660
I went to high school with a guy in that band.

378
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,300
Oh, nice.

379
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:49,620
Okay.

380
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,900
Feather in your cap.

381
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,220
Hmm.

382
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:51,700
You know who?

383
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,100
Seriously.

384
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,340
He probably says he goes, he went to high school with you.

385
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,700
I think that's often.

386
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,020
Yes.

387
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,140
That's often what he said.

388
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,260
One of those podcasts around.

389
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,060
Yeah.

390
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,100
The theme park podcast.

391
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,460
So yeah.

392
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:05,780
So I, you know, I had kind of been thinking about that time in my life because there's

393
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:11,220
this narrative that I'm not sure why it's here, but it is here where people are saying

394
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,180
ska is back.

395
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,780
I don't know why they're saying this.

396
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,340
It's unclear, but they're saying it.

397
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,980
So I've been kind of like thinking about that time in my life.

398
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:24,740
And when I was thinking about coming on this show, I'm like, oh yeah, there was a Disneyland

399
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,340
ska band for a while.

400
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,700
So it was a fun excuse.

401
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,780
And I, cause I kind of knew about them, but had never been.

402
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:34,260
It was a fun excuse to like go down the rabbit hole on who these dudes were and like why

403
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:34,980
they were popular.

404
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,220
Yeah.

405
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:35,620
Oh sure.

406
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:39,060
So you didn't, you didn't really go see them, but you were aware that this was like a one

407
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:43,460
of like, as this, you felt like the scene and the genre was losing steam.

408
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:43,700
Right.

409
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,940
It was gaining steam within this particular.

410
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,260
Yeah.

411
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,500
Like that's kind of where it thrived, you know?

412
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,660
And it's like, it's like the, it's, it's a funny journey for ska.

413
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:55,460
Like it's, it started out, you know, credible.

414
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,540
It was like, oh, it's this Jamaican dance music.

415
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:02,100
And then in the eighties, it was this like, you know, British working class music that

416
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,220
like, you know, espoused Rachel unity.

417
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:11,060
And now it's like, you know, 15 years later, oh, some goofballs play Disney covers at

418
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,140
Disneyland and a new way.

419
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,660
You're a play Hakuna Matata.

420
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:14,900
Yeah.

421
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,380
Exactly.

422
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:20,100
So yeah, anyway, it's, it's, it's funny that that's kind of where it ended up and

423
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,820
yeah, it was kind of like fun to fun to dig into it.

424
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:26,180
Well, so what, what'd you think like good at getting into it?

425
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:32,420
Like, like compared to what you grew up listening to, like in terms of ska legitimacy,

426
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,740
the spectrum, I would not know how to judge on whatsoever.

427
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,180
Yeah.

428
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:44,180
I mean, like it is funny how, how much they fell into like the stereotype.

429
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:50,260
Like if you were to dick on ska, what you would be thinking of is, is these guys, like

430
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:56,500
no one in the band has a Hawaiian shirt, but they all are wearing spiritual Hawaiian shirts.

431
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:56,740
Sure.

432
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,220
Sure.

433
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,380
Sort of wearing currently wearing a Hawaiian shirt.

434
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:04,100
So this is a loving, loving, a loving roast here.

435
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,940
But colorful baggy.

436
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,740
Untucked.

437
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:09,700
Yeah.

438
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:13,540
Maybe you have added a tie to your Hawaiian shirt.

439
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,820
Perhaps you've added a tie.

440
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,020
Anyway, I think I can sum it up.

441
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:19,940
I was watching one of the, I was watching one of the videos of them playing Tomorrowland

442
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:27,620
Terrace and as part of the stage, as part of the stage banter, someone says, food court,

443
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,220
give yourself a round of applause.

444
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,780
And I'm like, you know, that's it.

445
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,540
That encompasses it right there.

446
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,060
It's just like, yeah.

447
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,180
It's who they're playing to.

448
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:36,820
That's what it is.

449
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:40,900
If you haven't been to Disneyland, if you don't know the specific venue, which is sort

450
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,180
of what we're focusing on.

451
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:43,220
Yeah.

452
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:49,380
It's the Tomorrowland Terrace, which would also be called the name of a quick serve at

453
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:56,020
like a, like a counter restaurant at Disneyland, which is the main spot to get disappointing

454
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:56,500
burgers.

455
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,860
I have a note about like the food.

456
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,980
I have always considered the food here is step up from dog food.

457
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:06,340
Like I don't like, I give them a lot of room.

458
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:12,500
I give them a lot of rope about like the food quality at theme parks, but I, I feel

459
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,980
like the most glowing review I've ever heard of Tomorrowland Terrace has been like a version

460
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:22,740
of like, it almost seemed like food that someone cooked and served.

461
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:26,180
I have to be pretty desperate to eat at Tomorrowland Terrace.

462
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,380
Literally like throw your arms in the air and go, I don't know what we're going to.

463
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:29,700
Okay.

464
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,620
Well, you're there for the music, man.

465
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,500
It's not about that.

466
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:39,700
I totally did not realize that the whole kit and caboodle was considered Tomorrowland Terrace.

467
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:43,300
I thought it was just the counter service window, which I looked, the current menu

468
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:48,500
is actually the menu, I believe from a restaurant called Harbor Gallery over in New Orleans

469
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,700
square, because it's all fried fish and fried chicken.

470
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:56,340
So I think that little hut is closed and they have moved the menu here because the

471
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,580
Tomorrowland Terrace menu has no identity.

472
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:01,140
Like for a while they serve Star Wars food.

473
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,340
That was abysmal.

474
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,780
Like everyone's like, this sucks.

475
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,700
Is this what Galaxy's Edge is going to be?

476
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:12,500
Isn't your Ronto wraps and your cool things, your bent, this is not what they figured out.

477
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:20,180
I have not been to Galaxy's Edge yet, but the people who have been, the Ronto wrap always

478
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:20,660
comes up.

479
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,820
Is that the gold standard for theme park food now?

480
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,020
Is the Ronto wrap the like-

481
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,380
Certainly up there.

482
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:30,900
For a quick thing to get for like, you know, compared to other stuff reasonably

483
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,060
inexpensive thing to get, what is it?

484
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:33,620
Nine dollars?

485
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,020
I don't know.

486
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,700
Yes, I think so.

487
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,180
I think other than like maybe corndog, people love corndog.

488
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:43,220
I'm not such a corndog person, but most people seem to like, love those corndogs.

489
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:49,140
I think you got to like that it is something fast and easy and you can take it on the go.

490
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,420
And it's like not that adventurous.

491
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:57,460
So mom and dad can have it, but it also is kind of only at the theme park.

492
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:01,300
So you feel like you did a thing you could only do there, which is not true of a bad

493
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,260
hamburger or something.

494
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:07,620
A better notion of something you can only get at Disneyland than this thing that Defunctland

495
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,100
and Kevin Perger did an episode about the hand witch.

496
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,220
Did you see this little spike of hand witch?

497
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:17,780
He got obsessed apparently with a mega tribute to the hand witch, which was like a,

498
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:22,180
this was a Michael Eisner invention specifically, apparently.

499
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:28,580
Like if a sandwich was a cone, if an ice cream cone, it was a savory cone, but then it's,

500
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,420
you know, it's 1986.

501
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:33,300
So it's like, it'll be full of like shrimp salad.

502
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,580
Chicken a la king, baby.

503
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,460
I think like this, whatever.

504
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,540
I'll take the clams casino, please.

505
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,740
Hot dog for the little one and I'll take the lobster thermidor hand witch.

506
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,240
Sure.

507
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:57,620
Yeah, that kind of weird, weird mayo-y, just like, you know, five kinds of bright white

508
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,820
things all at once.

509
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,580
Not dying to have a hand witch, I gotta say, but.

510
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:06,980
Well, they have like similar in the cozy cone, the cozy cones in Cars Land.

511
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:11,220
They have like a new cone thing where they put chili in a cone and it's great.

512
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:11,460
Wow.

513
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,020
It's very good.

514
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:12,520
Yeah.

515
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,540
Yeah, sure.

516
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,420
Chili on the go.

517
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,700
That's always my complaint about chili is I have to sit still to eat it.

518
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:22,660
No, but now you have a bread cone and you can jog, jog and eat chili.

519
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,620
Go on a roller coaster.

520
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,260
Yeah, sure.

521
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,940
Sip, just sip the chili.

522
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:32,820
But so yeah, sort of cruddy restaurant that overlooks this concert venue.

523
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:37,940
And the big thing about the concert venue is that you might get there at a certain hour

524
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:40,660
of the day and you see no stage.

525
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,420
What do you mean a band will be here?

526
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,140
I can't fathom where they would be playing.

527
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:45,860
This is just a planter.

528
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:50,660
I hear this is where the concert is, but I don't think we were sold a bill of goods here.

529
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:54,340
Yeah, it seems to me step one of a concert would be a stage.

530
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:54,740
Sure.

531
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:58,420
My end microphones and lights if you're feeling festive.

532
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:58,740
Right.

533
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,860
And I see none of that.

534
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:03,140
But then as the concert begin, the music starts.

535
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:07,220
You hear the music, maybe even a ladies and gentlemen so and so.

536
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:12,260
And what you thought was a planter rises up out of the ground and that is the stage.

537
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:12,980
Mm hmm.

538
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,060
Now this has been they've had this at Disneyland since 67.

539
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,060
It was part of a Tomorrowland redo.

540
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:23,940
And this is a thing I really specifically remember my mom pointing out to me in an early

541
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:28,980
Disneyland like like not knowing it was coming, watching the rise up happened and me just

542
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,340
stopping in my tracks.

543
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,780
What are you talking about?

544
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:32,580
This is crazy.

545
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,260
My mom being very excited to share.

546
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,980
Oh, yes, the stage rises out of the ground.

547
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:40,180
So just that I don't think we've really said on the podcast.

548
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,940
There is a stage that rises out of the ground.

549
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,380
That is so dramatic.

550
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,060
Yeah, yeah, it's really something.

551
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:45,620
It's great.

552
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:51,860
And in the position of theme park history, notable because it was originally a mid century

553
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:58,900
modern design designed by Roly Crump, Disney Imagineer Roly Crump recently in the news for

554
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:03,780
discussing how he occasionally partook of alcohol and marijuana gas.

555
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,220
When he was cooking up in the.

556
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,460
Oh, he is 90.

557
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:10,340
I hope that doesn't make its way into a song.

558
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,820
A body song that everyone could hear.

559
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,540
Here's what it originally looks like.

560
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,780
It is a beautiful piece of design.

561
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,540
That is so rad.

562
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,580
But over the years.

563
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,100
Bright orange mod.

564
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:22,580
Yeah.

565
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:27,460
And it's funny to me because this might be just my perspective, but I feel like mid century

566
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,700
modern design never goes out of style.

567
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,380
I'm sure it feels futuristic.

568
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:36,500
Yeah, I'm sure it went out of fashion, but over the years, like then, OK, they put a

569
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,660
different topper on it for the 35th.

570
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,740
Well, the 35th logo is perfect.

571
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,700
It's a perfect logo.

572
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:48,420
Whistler's mother, the birth of man and that one neon castle.

573
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:48,660
Yes.

574
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:53,940
Then in the late 90s starts to lose me, starts to lose me.

575
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,300
What do you describe it?

576
00:25:56,020 --> 00:26:00,820
It is the Disneyland Tomorrowland redo in the late 90s is like they took the worst

577
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:04,340
elements of the Disneyland from Paris and the worst elements from the Disneyland

578
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:08,260
redo in Walt Disney World and had them fight.

579
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,060
Had them fight.

580
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:13,140
And then at the very last minute, we're like, make it look like a textbook cover.

581
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,620
Britannica.

582
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:15,940
Yeah.

583
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,500
Yeah.

584
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:21,220
And then it became Club Buzz and it's really lost me.

585
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:28,260
Oh, it looks like those those neon blue and purple pop tarts from the 90s.

586
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:28,900
Yes.

587
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:34,980
And a little bit of lip service at the one Club Buzz design element is the house of the

588
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:35,380
future.

589
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,660
Don't spit in my mouth and call it a Sunday.

590
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,140
Okay.

591
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:43,620
Like that's not saying there's a miniature version of the old Disneyland attraction

592
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:43,940
house.

593
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,180
Yeah.

594
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:48,260
Not great to illustrate that you used the Judge Judy phrase.

595
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,140
These are from Judge Judy.

596
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,700
I never, I never knew where that phrase come from.

597
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,340
Things got wild at Club Buzz though.

598
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,220
I remember 4 a.m.

599
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,060
We're doing blow with Slinky Dog.

600
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,180
Now wait a minute.

601
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:07,060
Potato Head pulls a crack pipe out of his ass.

602
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,500
And a lot of these design elements kind of came and went.

603
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,700
Oh, the other big thing until the late 90s, I believe this was technically called the

604
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,620
Coca Cola Tomorrowland Terrace.

605
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,180
Oh, right.

606
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,020
Lost the sponsorship at some point.

607
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:24,180
One of the more wholesome early sponsors that wasn't like manufacturing weapons.

608
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,340
How LeBurton presents.

609
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:37,780
But yeah, I mean, the basic facets of this venue are really awesome.

610
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:45,540
And like similarly innovative, I feel like too that just behind it, there is a theater

611
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:51,060
in the round that actually takes you around the carousel theater that delivers you the

612
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:56,340
whole audience from different stages to different stages, which they stopped using obviously

613
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,820
in the late 80s or that that component of it.

614
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:03,060
But like these two things go hand in hand to me, like like the interesting delivery

615
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,700
mechanisms for shows.

616
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,900
We're going to deliver you to the show in a little circle.

617
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,140
A show is just going to rise up out of the ground.

618
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:15,700
And I mainly am like, why didn't more places do this?

619
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,900
Like to me, it's so much better than a curtain being pulled.

620
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:24,100
Like I all concerts should have should come after this point become that it all thing

621
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,140
rises up out of the.

622
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,140
The Hollywood Bowl should come out of the ground.

623
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:31,620
Well, you know, Radio City Music Hall does that.

624
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,140
That's the thing they have.

625
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:39,380
I guess you have to be like the most major venue in the world to have all the hydraulics

626
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,580
and everything necessary.

627
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:43,540
But red rocks should come out of the rocks.

628
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,100
Yeah.

629
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:48,660
I mean, who doesn't love the artists rising up out of the ground at the top of the.

630
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:52,660
I mean, that feels like a pretty, you know, that's your that's your Britney Spears move.

631
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,900
That's your Ninja Turtles coming out of our shelves.

632
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,460
That's true.

633
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,420
Oh, yeah, sure.

634
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:56,740
Yes.

635
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:00,580
Have you all been has everyone been to a concert where the artist came out of the ground?

636
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,340
Maybe I haven't.

637
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:02,980
And I'm regretting.

638
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:03,940
That's a good question.

639
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:04,340
Have I?

640
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:04,740
I know.

641
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,060
Look, for a while, I don't think he's doing it now.

642
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,580
Ray Mysterio would come out.

643
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,020
Ray Mysterio Jr. would come out of the ground.

644
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,580
He would shoot up out of the ground at wrestling at a.

645
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,660
I don't know if he's doing anymore.

646
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,940
He's gotten older, so I don't know.

647
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,260
Harder on the knees maybe to land.

648
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,540
But I can't think of I know.

649
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:21,700
Yeah.

650
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,740
Other than the turtles, I don't know if anyone came out.

651
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:29,300
It makes sense with the turtles story wise, because they are they're coming from the sewers.

652
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:29,780
Yes.

653
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:30,500
Always come out of the ground.

654
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,700
There's an explanation there.

655
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:31,860
Right.

656
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:32,740
In that sense.

657
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:36,740
I saw a recent performance.

658
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:41,060
Well, a lot of the late night shows were having people doing like they were doing kind of

659
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,940
interesting like musical performances during the pandemic.

660
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:49,300
And they filmed Phoebe Bridgers doing a song like walking through a theater in L.A.

661
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:54,980
And they followed her all the way like backstage onto the platform that raises up out of the

662
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,220
grass.

663
00:29:55,220 --> 00:30:00,820
So you got to see from like over her shoulder coming up with that perspective was cool.

664
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,740
The camera followed her onto the platform and.

665
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:02,980
Yeah.

666
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:03,300
Neat.

667
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,100
Well, anyway, everyone should do it.

668
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,580
I don't care if Jackson Brown should do it.

669
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,980
The band Alabama should do it up out of the ground.

670
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,180
Three tenors.

671
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:14,660
Yeah.

672
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,940
Olivia Rodrigo.

673
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,500
That would be awesome.

674
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:18,900
Yeah.

675
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,660
Everybody just just go for it.

676
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,060
L.A.

677
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:21,460
Lazy.

678
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,260
Philharmonic.

679
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,060
The entire.

680
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:23,540
Yes.

681
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,060
But separate ones.

682
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,100
Separate tubes.

683
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:26,660
Yeah.

684
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,020
They each have their own platform.

685
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:28,740
That's what I'm saying.

686
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,060
Yeah.

687
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:29,540
Yeah.

688
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:32,500
And they should like get some airtime like Ray Mysterio.

689
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,140
You have to do.

690
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:33,620
Yeah.

691
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:33,860
Yeah.

692
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:34,340
Not just.

693
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,540
With their instruments.

694
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:35,780
Yeah.

695
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,100
Yeah.

696
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:36,660
Raise them up.

697
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,420
Someone hits the cellist with a folding chair.

698
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,580
Because you're going to look it's boring to see a film.

699
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,860
How many over the court.

700
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:48,500
So for the course of this thing's life for all the time it's been

701
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,380
rising and falling.

702
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:54,020
How many times do you think Disneyland has had to cover up a crushed keytar player.

703
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:56,660
It's a good question.

704
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:01,300
They've had accident other weird accidents but not here I don't think.

705
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:01,540
Not.

706
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,660
Well we don't but we don't know.

707
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,300
We don't know.

708
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:03,540
Yeah.

709
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:06,340
So you're saying this has just been so on the down low.

710
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:06,980
So yeah.

711
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,380
Yeah.

712
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:11,300
It was a singer they might have to own up to it but if it's someone unimportant.

713
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,620
Bass player or a third horn player.

714
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,100
Did.

715
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:14,820
Yeah.

716
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,060
Yeah.

717
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:15,780
And with like.

718
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,180
And if it was if we are using the scobin as an example.

719
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:21,140
You can take out a couple of horn players people wouldn't even know.

720
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,660
Like most of the band is still there.

721
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,940
They always they bring extra.

722
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,660
Yeah.

723
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:27,460
I bet it's something cute like the Beatles cover band.

724
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,140
Somebody got their John Lennon wig caught.

725
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:33,620
The way I get the way I got caught or the sergeant pepper.

726
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,420
Oh yeah.

727
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,140
Outfit like.

728
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,260
Too many dangles.

729
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,660
The 50s dads were right they should have cut their hair.

730
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,140
Exactly.

731
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,340
Their hair was too long.

732
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,900
It's a safety issue more than anything.

733
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,620
That's right.

734
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,260
I feel like I have seen a Beatles cover band on that stage.

735
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,660
Yes I have photos of them if you'd like to see.

736
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,540
Do they look like some guys but in a wig and a mustache.

737
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:57,460
It's my favorite thing is these Beatles cover bands and they're like good they sound good.

738
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,580
Hold on sorry I wasn't prepared.

739
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,980
Anything in the Beatles do you have to clean up for.

740
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,260
I mean I guess you have like vague drug references.

741
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:04,740
Yeah.

742
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,300
It's still Lucy in the Sky with Donuts.

743
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,260
I guess it's still a D.

744
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,060
Still LSD.

745
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:09,780
Here they are.

746
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,340
Hard days.

747
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,780
I want to do Run for Your Life.

748
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,220
Hard days night.

749
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:13,620
Right.

750
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,180
Here they are.

751
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:14,740
Wow.

752
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,380
Hey guys.

753
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,700
In the Sergeant Pepper's outfits.

754
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,300
Why are you showing us the photo though?

755
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,780
That's a picture of four guys basically.

756
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,180
But they're in the outfits.

757
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,460
They're wearing the outfits.

758
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,340
They're wearing the outfits.

759
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,460
I love the Beatles.

760
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:30,100
I know a Beatles band is going to wear the outfit.

761
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,460
Was I going to be surprised by that?

762
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:34,420
Yeah but it's funny because look at them they're like in the costumes.

763
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:35,620
Yeah.

764
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,140
Wigs aren't that good.

765
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,060
All right we'll do a poll is this funny.

766
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,820
This is funny.

767
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,780
I think it's funny.

768
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,500
Jason is it funny you could be honest.

769
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:47,620
I've just seen I've seen a bit what a Beatles band looks like.

770
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,420
I haven't seen.

771
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,660
Is this the next is this the next is Aladar cute.

772
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:52,740
Is it funny.

773
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:58,100
I want to see a hard day's night run into another Beatles cover band.

774
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,420
Well they do hard days night does all the different eras too.

775
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,100
So they're on the top they're doing the.

776
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:04,900
They got the suits.

777
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,500
The let it be.

778
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,460
They got the let it be.

779
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:07,780
Yeah.

780
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,260
Yeah so.

781
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,180
So they they're chameleons.

782
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,620
They could they could be any of them.

783
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,260
Exactly.

784
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:12,660
Wow.

785
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,540
They are chameleons.

786
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:18,260
Again I feel like every Beatles band has multiple costumes.

787
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:18,820
I'm not sure.

788
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:22,900
But you gotta think there's Beatles cover bands who like we only do the pre.

789
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,700
It's like a Sullivan era.

790
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,980
Yeah yeah yeah sure.

791
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,700
Right right.

792
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,020
Yeah.

793
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,580
Yeah before they got like Trippier.

794
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:33,220
No nothing after Norwegian Wood.

795
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:33,780
Yeah.

796
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:42,580
We only do John and Paul's like cocaine fucked up jams in 1976 that are unlistening even

797
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,140
though it's them.

798
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:48,900
Yeah that's or the outtakes of on the one anthology.

799
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:53,380
The like 15 second outtakes and stuff.

800
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:56,580
That's what they were somebody tripped and the drums knocked over.

801
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,140
Yeah yeah Ringo starts cursing.

802
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:01,060
Covers of studio accidents.

803
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:03,540
They all take a minute to masturbate in front of each other.

804
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:03,860
Yes.

805
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,940
Remember when that happened.

806
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,020
That was a news cycle Ringo said he wasn't there.

807
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:08,900
Oh yeah I do.

808
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:09,300
Yeah right.

809
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,540
That's kind of like back in the news because Ringo's.

810
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,660
Right saying he didn't do it.

811
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,900
Ringo said he did not masturbate with the rest of the Beatles.

812
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,380
Yeah I forgot all this was this like a stern revelation.

813
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,660
When did we discover.

814
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:22,020
I don't maybe I don't remember I feel like Paul said it somewhere else.

815
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:22,820
I think Paul said.

816
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:26,820
Paul was promoting that song he he made for Destiny right.

817
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:27,300
Was it on that.

818
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,900
Hope for the future.

819
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,700
That probably right.

820
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:35,220
I mean he has a lot of different he has of course his children's book Hey Grand Dude

821
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,220
that he could have been promoting.

822
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:41,220
I don't think he would have said that during that press but there's a lot you know he's

823
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:44,180
got a lot of things going on so I'm not sure.

824
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:47,940
But yes anyway he masturbated with John and I guess George.

825
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:51,380
And any of the tribute bands will do you just gotta pay him extra.

826
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:51,860
Yeah.

827
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:56,740
Ringo when Ringo was saying this when this came out was he saying it in a way that like

828
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:04,020
hey you know I that wasn't me or I wasn't invited and I I'm a little sad about it.

829
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:08,580
I think he was saying it was I think he was I mean it'd be funny maybe he was trying to

830
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:12,180
like put up a brave like a front of like no I didn't want to be there.

831
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:12,500
Sure.

832
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,620
I'm glad I wasn't there.

833
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:17,060
I'm glad I wasn't there but like he was inside he was a little bit upset.

834
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:17,780
Right.

835
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,300
He wanted to see John's dog.

836
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:23,140
I mean I wasn't busy I could have stopped by but.

837
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,300
In the apartment just below.

838
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,700
I heard I heard the splatters.

839
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,620
The only perk Pete Best has over me.

840
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,660
They invited him back years later.

841
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,980
Right he was out of the band.

842
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,700
Oh really John Paul.

843
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,620
Yeah I'm available.

844
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,940
Oh not to be in the band again.

845
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,420
I'll get my instruments.

846
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,940
Swing by get some magazines.

847
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:57,220
Swing by hotel lobby pick up some magazines.

848
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,460
Bring your impressive load.

849
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,740
That was George right.

850
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,900
Grosser than the show usually is.

851
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,820
Well yeah after the warning at the beginning.

852
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,300
That's right.

853
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,340
Roll baby.

854
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,140
That's rock and roll.

855
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,980
Sunset strip the whiskey.

856
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:11,460
Yes.

857
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,740
My go to for rock and roll.

858
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:22,180
The things are a little tamer at the Tomorrowland Terrace.

859
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:22,980
Yeah they are.

860
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:23,860
They don't do that.

861
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:27,380
I think I remember there being like a Devo style band there.

862
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:31,540
At the height of my Disneyland attendance where they all wore like silver jumpsuits

863
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,140
and a lot of key tars.

864
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,660
Yeah sure that makes sense.

865
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:43,300
I feel like yeah now these days you get a lot of like you know they do Louie Louie or they do

866
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:49,380
Queen or sort of like you know the 10 most famous rock songs.

867
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:58,340
I watched a concert I watched one that was like a lot of like headset microphone headset wearers

868
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:03,540
all running around stage and like handing out tambourines to the audience.

869
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,460
This was the instant replay.

870
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,620
It was instant replay okay yeah.

871
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:12,100
So they got the audience involved in the show which felt very lazy to me.

872
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,500
You have a drummer you know they should be carrying.

873
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,340
Yeah don't make these kids do it.

874
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:16,980
You know it's.

875
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,500
It's on there to relax.

876
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:22,740
It's probably the same principle or the same strategy that people when they're canvassing

877
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:26,260
outside a grocery store use where they hand you a binder to keep you there.

878
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:26,820
Oh right.

879
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:29,860
They hand you the tambourine so you can't leave because you got to give it back and

880
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:32,500
they won't take it back so you get stuck to make sure.

881
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,900
You'll ruin the show.

882
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:38,740
Yeah exactly so it's more maybe more of just an audience control thing.

883
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:44,020
Ending with like here's our fun Louie Louie cover and then as soon as it's over like

884
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,300
all right we need him back.

885
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,660
And number all right number nine I'm not seeing number nine.

886
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:51,860
Did you break out did he sneak off to smash mountain splash mountain did anyone see him.

887
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:52,980
Smash mountain sounds good.

888
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,100
Smash mountain.

889
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,300
Is it smash mouth.

890
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,900
It's a co-branding opportunity.

891
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:02,020
You know how sometimes they'll put red hot chili peppers on space mountain.

892
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:02,260
Wow.

893
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,100
Are you talking about.

894
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,540
Oh it's so it's a smash mouth.

895
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,900
Oh yes I thought that's.

896
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,060
Yeah so put smash mouth on splash.

897
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,140
It's not the mbc smash Jason.

898
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,260
It's smash mouth.

899
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:16,100
Well you know I'd love some Broadway show tunes.

900
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:21,540
Maybe just as a little bridge between the song of the south stuff and princess and the

901
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:26,740
frog just as a little bridge while we're changing it over smash mouth.

902
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:31,460
Take all the robots and the actual elements of it I believe the log flume and just have

903
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,060
lights flashing and play.

904
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,740
Yeah I can't get enough of you baby.

905
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:40,420
He's like kind of doing an english accent but not really.

906
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:44,340
He's kind of like might as well be writing on a log.

907
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:50,180
Yeah I think that's a good bridge to really ease the super fans out of those people that.

908
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,380
Yeah yeah.

909
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:55,140
Flash mountain favorite band they saw it's Sturgis in the middle of the pandemic.

910
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,780
Remember when we all got covid while listening to this.

911
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:00,100
Yeah.

912
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,700
Now I'm not mad that Disneyland is too woke.

913
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,180
They get it.

914
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:04,900
They get it.

915
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:12,580
Have we heard from Disneyland is too woke guy since his whole moment.

916
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:16,180
You mean the one that one article that everyone noticed.

917
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:16,660
The like.

918
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:20,900
The guy pushing for the death penalty in his day job as a district attorney.

919
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,740
Yeah he's like a murder lawyer basically.

920
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:29,620
No but don't worry if you go on Twitter or any other internet forum there's hundreds

921
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:34,420
of dudes just like him and so you know they're out there you know.

922
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:38,340
But we all can agree that we love Smash Mouth.

923
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:38,900
Yeah yeah.

924
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,900
Hey now you're a log flume.

925
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,660
Get it going fans are if we if we get Twitter chatter.

926
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:51,060
Listen guys I'm not writing the rest of this.

927
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,100
Hey I hate to.

928
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,140
Steve to do.

929
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:57,140
I hate to I hate to bring keep this bit going but I have to just

930
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:59,860
flex with my knowledge of the name of the album.

931
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:04,580
They should put it in Tomorrowland because their album is called Astro Lounge.

932
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:04,740
Right.

933
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:07,220
They should change pizza port into Astro Lounge.

934
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:08,980
They should.

935
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:13,060
I would encourage them to not delay but to act now.

936
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,900
Yes so that's what I would like.

937
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,340
Might as well be ordering some fries.

938
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,060
Breadsticks.

939
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,420
Yeah don't change the menu on the Astro Lounge.

940
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:29,540
Yeah.

941
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:35,380
This is actually the current bands that play or hopefully will start playing again

942
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,660
at Tomorrowland Terrace.

943
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:40,660
They should be pushing that to like go order some fish like.

944
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,460
Oh right.

945
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,740
Do we have some songs that.

946
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:45,620
Like songs with fit like they put the menu items in the.

947
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:51,220
They just slip in like you know something about the lobster roll like Tomorrowland lobster roll.

948
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,180
That's yeah that's that's a good Jimmy Buffett does.

949
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,060
Yeah absolutely.

950
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,900
He puts his products in there.

951
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:03,620
How long is there any precedent for like name bands playing that stage like not a cover band

952
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:06,500
but like a band you would pay to see otherwise.

953
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,900
I found some information that the police played.

954
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,180
Really.

955
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:13,700
This might have come up when we did our Patreon Rockin Moments episode.

956
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:18,100
I think that they may have because they have some story that involves the stage rising up

957
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,980
which implies well it must be there or if it wasn't there

958
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:26,180
I think the stage has rising capabilities in or did at one point in time in Florida as well.

959
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,420
It does the sunny hill stage.

960
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,060
Can rise.

961
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,580
Can rise which I saw the video.

962
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:36,740
Robot lounge singer who is always they used to have different bands in Disney World at this one

963
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:42,260
restaurant and then they essentially replaced it all with one robotic lounge singer who has

964
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:47,300
he was backed up by backup singers called the Space Angels who are invisible.

965
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,260
They aren't there.

966
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,860
There are no robots of them.

967
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,420
And that's justified by the angel thing.

968
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,060
Gotcha.

969
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,260
But yeah if they.

970
00:41:54,260 --> 00:42:00,180
Not in this is not a Star Wars thing like this is not they're not part of a IP right.

971
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,460
No it's an original IP.

972
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:05,220
Yeah original from whole cloth thing that we love very much.

973
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:05,540
Sure.

974
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,580
But what were you saying about the police?

975
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:14,260
Yeah I got there's no video of it but I think the police put there's also some confusion on

976
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:17,060
documenting because then there was the Tomorrowland stage.

977
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:21,220
Yes which opened the same year also open in 67.

978
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:21,780
Right.

979
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:26,660
And replaced the flying saucers and now it's where like Space Mountain stuff is.

980
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:29,700
Right and that the bigger acts played that stage.

981
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,500
Yeah.

982
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:37,380
So like there's more documentation of like you know the raspberries Tony Orlando I'm seeing here.

983
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,780
Paul Revere and the Raider like the spinners.

984
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,420
Yeah.

985
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:42,420
Like big stuff big big bands.

986
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:43,700
They would have decent bands.

987
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:43,940
Yeah.

988
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:44,340
Yeah.

989
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:44,840
Sure.

990
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:47,700
I found a brochure.

991
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:53,700
Let me find this for Grad night 84 which you can imagine aesthetically I am super into presented

992
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:54,660
by K rock.

993
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:57,300
Now that old K rock logo so fantastic.

994
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,260
Yeah great.

995
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:59,540
This brochure is so great.

996
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:07,540
They because I was looking for proof that Sparks one of my favorite bands currently having a

997
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:09,620
moment with the Edgar Wright documentary.

998
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:13,300
I had heard that they played at Disneyland at some point and it was probably that stage.

999
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:17,860
Then I found this thing Sparks played all grad night dates in 84.

1000
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:23,300
They were there how single night and that's multiple shows and they'd had pseudo hit as

1001
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,140
much as Sparks ever had hits.

1002
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:25,540
Yeah.

1003
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:28,820
Sparks is that's a that's like a weirder artier choice.

1004
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:34,340
I mean maybe I don't know enough about Sparks but you wouldn't think that like a right a

1005
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:40,260
Disney grad night put on by a like mainstream radio station wouldn't have maybe they would.

1006
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:41,620
Maybe I'm unclear.

1007
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:44,820
Wouldn't have the artists wouldn't have the people who just put up the album angst in

1008
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:45,380
my pants.

1009
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:45,620
Right.

1010
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:50,180
That was too that would be too much of a stretch for them but they'd also but that album has a

1011
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:53,940
song called Mickey Mouse so they may have they may have played into it.

1012
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:56,340
It was just the yeah the first thought someone had.

1013
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:00,580
Like all right if they're willing all right they are mean to Mickey Mouse in it.

1014
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:00,980
All right.

1015
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:06,020
The they're also though back in the day they were not I don't think scrutinizing things as hard

1016
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:10,980
because we've got the Halex we've talked about of course on the show and now of course there's a

1017
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:13,380
documentary about the space band.

1018
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,500
Are you familiar with this Jordan?

1019
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:20,260
I'm not no basically like Disney create like created their own Star Wars rock band.

1020
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:20,580
Okay.

1021
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:24,100
And they played the they played this other bigger stage.

1022
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,060
They played the space.

1023
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:28,020
Okay the Tomorrowland stage became the space stage.

1024
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:28,500
Right.

1025
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:32,260
Which then became the Magic Eye Theater where you would see Captain EO or Honey I Shrunk the

1026
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:32,740
Audience.

1027
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:38,020
So there's like you would see like a guy that was an off-brand wookie like shredding a bass

1028
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:38,580
basically.

1029
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:39,540
Right.

1030
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:45,220
And a keyboard player whose keyboard was built into like a cart that he would drive around

1031
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,820
and he looks like a robot.

1032
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:51,380
So it looks like part of his weird like on the move robot mechanism.

1033
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:51,700
Yeah.

1034
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:53,060
It's a very cool band.

1035
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:56,100
I've like Tomorrowland bands I feel like we have to talk about Halex for a sec but I don't

1036
00:44:56,100 --> 00:45:01,620
have anything else to say about them because this documentary that we helped inspire like

1037
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:05,220
actually they like covered so much more than we ever would have.

1038
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:07,860
We started like oh that sounds interesting as a wookie band.

1039
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:08,180
Okay.

1040
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:13,780
And then Matt Serrano does like the most amount of work and research that could ever be done.

1041
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:16,740
Do you think you can get them to reunite for PTR Con?

1042
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:20,820
Well they're not all living which is a problem.

1043
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,180
But who was the remaining reunited?

1044
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,980
They all like talked at least on a Zoom or something.

1045
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:27,460
Okay.

1046
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:27,620
Yeah.

1047
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:28,660
They did a Zoom.

1048
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:31,220
And Mike Post called us a bunch of dorks.

1049
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:31,620
Yeah.

1050
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:32,660
That was something.

1051
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:34,900
TV legend Mike Post called us.

1052
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,180
Wait called us specifically?

1053
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:39,060
Well he's like I never thought a bunch of dorks would rediscover this.

1054
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:45,060
And then in the documentary it cuts to our logo and the music right after that.

1055
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:45,620
Nice.

1056
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:46,420
Oh that's right.

1057
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:46,980
It's editing.

1058
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:50,900
He didn't maybe necessarily look at pictures of us and get mad.

1059
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:51,780
Not exactly us.

1060
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:52,820
But maybe he knew.

1061
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:53,780
The magic of the movies.

1062
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:56,660
It should be your guys just like pull quote you know a bunch of dorks.

1063
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:57,620
A bunch of dorks.

1064
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:59,700
Guy who did the law and order sting.

1065
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:05,220
Trillionaire who did the law and order sting.

1066
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:10,180
Yeah the man who strung together the two most influential notes in television.

1067
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:11,700
Richer than Jeff Bezos.

1068
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:16,820
So all that to say is that they had they played they have one of their signature

1069
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:18,580
Halyx songs was called Jailbait.

1070
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:22,100
So obviously people were not paying so.

1071
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,140
Halyx.

1072
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:26,980
Was that like was he talking about like a Star Wars jail?

1073
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:27,620
Like no.

1074
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:30,660
Was it prison on the Death Star?

1075
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:32,500
It was about the dog and the key.

1076
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:33,700
The Pirates of the Caribbean.

1077
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:37,300
Yeah you have to bait the dog to get out of jail.

1078
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:39,140
Yeah that's true.

1079
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:40,820
The dog who just turned 18.

1080
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:44,260
Here's his document C it's fine.

1081
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:44,660
Yeah.

1082
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:48,180
Yeah so they talk about how weird it is in the documentary.

1083
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:51,700
But yeah they were not scrutinizing so like maybe just somebody was like hip and was like

1084
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:52,900
oh Sparks is cool.

1085
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:57,780
But let me say on the scrutinizing front that then you go like that seems like a big or like

1086
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:02,660
you know a cheap trick play like the huge lineup for Gradonite 84.

1087
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:08,580
But they were scrutinizing in another area because then you go to it's it's really like

1088
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:13,940
in association with K-Rock it's the greatest party around an outrageous evening of music blah blah.

1089
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:16,580
Then the very next page dress code.

1090
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:20,660
Vental man make sure you're in a suit blazer and dress slacks.

1091
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:21,620
And it is like really.

1092
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:22,660
Outrageous.

1093
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:23,780
Was what?

1094
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:26,180
Not even just there's a dress code be aware.

1095
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:26,580
Wow.

1096
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:30,100
But like like a very cool design by the way.

1097
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:30,740
Wow yeah.

1098
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:32,500
It's like big pink and purple stripes.

1099
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:32,740
Yeah.

1100
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:38,020
But yeah this is page two of the come to the hottest teen party around.

1101
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:41,540
But do make sure you are dressed sensibly that skirt and bowels are ensemble for the ladies.

1102
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:43,380
Make sure your pants have pleats in them.

1103
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:46,260
Make sure they're starched.

1104
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:49,300
Get a ruler out.

1105
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,900
Space those pleats out evenly.

1106
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,900
Let's hide those slutty ankles ladies.

1107
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:56,900
There's still one or two fine dining restaurants at Disney World.

1108
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:00,980
I don't know about Disneyland maybe in the hotels where there is a dress code but it's

1109
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:06,740
literally just like hey don't be a slob maybe like change between the park and coming here.

1110
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:07,860
Have a t-shirt that fits.

1111
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:09,620
Yeah basically.

1112
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:09,860
Yeah.

1113
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,940
Both sleeves please.

1114
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:12,440
Yeah.

1115
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:15,860
You can also you can tell this is specifically from

1116
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:22,100
Grad Nite 84 because they feel the need in the unacceptable attire area to mention bolo ties.

1117
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:23,860
And windbreakers.

1118
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:26,340
No bolo ties.

1119
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:30,020
No no bolo ties good bolo ties no.

1120
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:31,700
What is this a rodeo?

1121
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,180
That means like little Jimmy Dickens wouldn't have been allowed in.

1122
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:38,820
Yeah this is an outrageous Grad Nite not a square dance.

1123
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:40,900
Conrad Hilton turned away at the door.

1124
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:46,740
Could not see his granddaughter Paris go to Grad Nite.

1125
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:48,340
He is a good-notshaperoon.

1126
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:52,260
Disney just changed a lot of the rules about what people were allowed to wear in the parks.

1127
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:53,940
Are bolo ties now allowed?

1128
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:55,220
Oh yeah right.

1129
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:55,540
I hope.

1130
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:58,420
Cast members have tattoos or wear bolo ties.

1131
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:01,220
That's right because yeah that's what people wanted for a long time.

1132
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:03,620
Frontierland you'd have to think in some places.

1133
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:05,220
Yeah you'd assume yeah.

1134
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:06,820
Who knows.

1135
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:12,260
I feel like we should say you know I don't know if you've heard this but I had heard over the years

1136
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:19,540
that like their Disneyland management it was very conflicted about Tomorrowland becoming like

1137
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:26,580
the teen loiter hangout spot like the replacement like you know rather than go to the mall maybe

1138
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:31,860
you just go to Disneyland on Friday nights and Saturday nights and just hang out there

1139
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:33,860
because passes were still pretty cheap.

1140
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:39,460
There were a lot of bands like you know a lot of people would do this and then they were like

1141
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:46,500
oh the 50th anniversary is coming up and we want young people coming and but we want more people

1142
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:52,100
who spend money coming because they come and they don't buy anything or like they share one with

1143
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:59,460
or fries so I feel like I had always heard that they were kind of like oh god these teens are

1144
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:01,220
might be more trouble than they're worth.

1145
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:05,620
I definitely had a summer in high school that was my like Disneyland hangout summer.

1146
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:05,860
Yeah.

1147
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:12,020
Yeah I think yeah I think the passes were you know I don't remember what they cost but maybe the

1148
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:15,460
maybe the reason why everyone had them was because they were cheaper than they are now

1149
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:19,860
and yeah I mean we would just go and like we would just go and like dick around.

1150
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:20,980
Yeah.

1151
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:25,860
Yeah because they I mean they stopped they had Videopolis the nightclub for a while.

1152
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:26,100
Right.

1153
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:29,940
And then they're like well this is definitely more trouble than it's worth so they shut that

1154
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:35,860
down and then I think some people just migrated over to the Tomorrowland Terrace area hanging out

1155
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:36,100
there.

1156
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:44,020
But of course but by the early 2000s like I don't I think it's been many decades since they've had

1157
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:49,060
a band that a teenager would want to see like truly that video that I saw of the tambourines

1158
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:53,220
being passed out was like I would say that's an all-boomer crowd.

1159
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:59,700
I mean they're pretty lit up when she when she says yeah go tambourine team

1160
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:04,420
but it's but notably not tambourine teens.

1161
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:04,820
Right.

1162
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:09,940
Oh yeah at that stage and I mean that stage is also used for the Star Wars Jedi Academy

1163
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:14,980
so it's really it's catering to the over 55 crowd and the under five crowd.

1164
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:20,580
It's a picture of the Jedi Academy popped up when I was just Googling this place.

1165
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:20,900
Yeah.

1166
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:25,380
And like you know you have a Darth Vader and you have some stormtroopers and then you have

1167
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:28,740
a bunch of like like five-year-olds.

1168
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:29,540
Yeah little kids.

1169
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:38,500
Who they've put the Jedi robes on and it reminds me so much of the scene from episode three where

1170
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,100
Anakin slaughters the younglings.

1171
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:44,500
Like you're just dressing up these younglings and putting them right in front of Anakin.

1172
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:46,340
They're gonna get.

1173
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:48,900
You're 100% correct.

1174
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:55,380
If there was another I'm trying there's got to be another like example of like a character that

1175
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:58,100
has just done something awful and then putting like.

1176
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:00,660
Putting teenagers in front of helix you don't do that.

1177
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:04,820
Just show Anakin a bunch of younglings.

1178
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:06,340
Yeah that no you're right that's crazy.

1179
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:07,380
Asking for a slaughter.

1180
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:08,500
That's a crazy thing to do.

1181
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:12,660
But the kids in the robes are really cute.

1182
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:13,700
It's like yeah.

1183
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:17,860
And I'm sure that's a tambourine thing where you get it you get the robe passed out and then.

1184
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:18,580
That thing seems.

1185
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:19,540
Collects it after the show.

1186
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:23,620
Oh yes yes yes yeah no you're not giving you that was that was cute and everything but let's.

1187
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:24,900
Yeah yeah yeah come on.

1188
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:27,060
Bob Shave Bank collects the robes after.

1189
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:29,780
We need the robes man they're covered in mites but we need the robes.

1190
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:33,220
We have to spray the robes for mites.

1191
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:34,660
We gotta degalze.

1192
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:37,940
Yeah a lot of itchy younglings coming out of Disneyland.

1193
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:42,260
Let me see I just here I'm just going to shout out some things in the history of you know you get.

1194
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:47,700
You Jason you showed that very mod photo with the Raleigh Crump topper and that's a lot of what played there.

1195
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:51,380
In the 60s and the 70s was a lot of things you put in the category of like.

1196
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:57,780
Today's sounds like happen in tunes for the young people and often with like just the.

1197
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:04,180
The list is pretty fantastic they are like it's like they're trying to like express the modern.

1198
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:14,020
Feel of it via artists that I'm sure are like drastically watered down Rolling Stones like it's all like crushed velvet it's all Austin Powers style suits.

1199
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:25,780
Despite it being like 1979 yeah let's see we got pop peri the new establishment the blandest name I could think of entertainment committee.

1200
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:30,740
I love that entertainment committee is great.

1201
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:34,500
I love that entertainment committee is great.

1202
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:41,140
That almost sounds like post punk like that feel like that like you know public image limited like.

1203
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:47,460
Well the way that was like a like attempting to be obtuse like I don't know you tell us what it is.

1204
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:54,100
Gang of four had that album entertainment I was thinking like and the ideas is like oh this is like deconstructing what like.

1205
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:58,500
What like music is you know yeah yeah sure anyway I.

1206
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:02,900
Remind me of extremely clinical and on the nose yeah yeah yeah yeah.

1207
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:08,900
It's the same sort of phenomenon where like if a British rock music gets close enough to the event horizon.

1208
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:20,500
They're going to put out like a music hall record like like inspired sure like whatever that some of the kinks albums where it's like oh this is a quite rock.

1209
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:28,420
I feel like Elvis Costello does that every three years oh yeah yeah yeah yeah I don't know what any of this in McCartney to they're all obsessed with this.

1210
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:39,220
Music call these like warblers I love you I'm not sure what that's how that's how we sound now when we talk about music from the 60s and 70s.

1211
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:46,660
It's all just like residual death of the British Empire madness I know we were talking about this before you got here it's just like yeah.

1212
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:55,300
All there's a lot of weird stuff in Britain and I think it's all just like they gave up being the empire that ruled the world they ceded it to America and the.

1213
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:58,340
20th century rock and roll guys have to warble now they.

1214
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:09,060
That's how they cope with it happens with the sun is set on your empire you warble you warble as the sun sets.

1215
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:24,180
Scott what do you know anything about that that YouTube video I sent you earlier today do you know that band what their deal was not really I saw that they they played this grad night 84.

1216
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:33,220
Where they they fit in really well like I'm almost like should I play this or where it probably shouldn't it's the quality is pretty bad but like.

1217
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:48,020
Yeah Jordan you see passed along video this I believe was from 83 the stage is rising out of the ground the voice of Disneyland Jack Wagner of the classic announcer guy there I can tell it's him now said.

1218
00:55:48,820 --> 00:56:02,820
Ladies and gentlemen Disneyland proudly presents crash and it's crash with a K and they put the name up top and they rise up and are jamming out to Toto's Rosanna yes in 83 I watched this video yes that is the as.

1219
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:13,220
Jordan you texted me exactly what I thought when I saw it which is this is my vibe distilled like exactly what is like so perfectly.

1220
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:29,700
The other core here your core I'll take it and what I was so interesting about that and yeah and like it's it's filled on it's filled on a camcorder but occasionally helps to to make things a little more dramatic whoever's operating it will like zoom in and out kind of fast.

1221
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:42,260
And I think it goes into like negative vision at some point oh those in camera effects yeah man I love those and I started to miss around with camera I was thinking when I was watching them like Oh, this is the most.

1222
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:59,460
This is you know arguably the most 80s artifact that exists is this thing here but it's happened in 83 was this cool when they were doing it like so early in the 80s I'm like is this is this thing that they're doing was this actually cool at the time or was it.

1223
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:12,100
Dork I don't think it was so out of step and it was not like they're dressed in sort of the more like muted you know browns and leathers manner of the of the early 80s and not the like.

1224
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:22,620
The hyper 80s the gross 80s it's not to melody I think maybe that's some of what I like about total or that sort of scene the sort of a war kind of stuff is it's not like.

1225
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:37,340
It's it's not 80s times 80s times cocaine yeah yeah yeah it's not like Halloween costume 80s but you also like it's perfect for me too because you have it's not only like.

1226
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:50,220
That I mean the whole set list is up my alley it's separate ways it's Lionel Richie running with the night they threw it at this a song at the end I didn't even know what it was and I looked it up and it was wham it was a bad song called bad boys by Wham.

1227
00:57:50,900 --> 00:58:05,700
Yeah I don't know that some deeper love the slightly deeper wham pretty good this is crazy that in less than 20 years they got to this point because the other state the tomorrow land stage had like country music Jubilee and another review called show me America.

1228
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:18,300
Oh boy and all straw hats and I got I like some real corny bullshit I like some real corny bullshit but I draw the line at like hurray for America kind of review.

1229
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:29,740
Which cuts out a lot of theme park content over the course of 70 years you guys never go to Branson you guys can never do your Branson ordeal.

1230
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:34,380
Will be in Branson it's come up but it's like oh man.

1231
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:39,260
I'm gonna get right out of Branson for being too mouthy.

1232
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:42,220
Joe Rogan went to Austin podcasting.

1233
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:47,260
You can say whatever you want to without snowflakes.

1234
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:48,780
Free speech won't be infringed.

1235
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:51,820
Thank you yeah we can be inquisitive in Branson.

1236
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:57,900
Yeah look I'm just gonna say I don't know if you're supposed to say this these days but I think Barry's William's pretty good singer.

1237
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:58,380
Whoa.

1238
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:02,140
Go ahead cancel me Hollywood elites.

1239
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:06,220
You say it I you know what I think the comedy of Yakov Smirnoff is funny.

1240
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:09,180
Cancel me America.

1241
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:15,180
A few days in Branson everyone's exhausted because every show you have to stand up and salute for some reason.

1242
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:20,780
Have you guys seen the Branson documentary have you seen We Only Lie to Strangers?

1243
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:21,420
No.

1244
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:22,060
Oh no.

1245
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:23,180
Oh it's great.

1246
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:26,140
Yeah it's about the dark underbelly of Branson.

1247
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:27,980
Oh that sounds really.

1248
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:34,620
Yeah and they hit you with the title kind of at the very end of the movie and you kind of you can kind of see what it means it's great.

1249
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:35,260
Oh wow.

1250
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:37,180
We Always Lie to Strangers?

1251
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:40,620
We Only Lie to Strangers maybe am I maybe I'm getting that a little bit wrong.

1252
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:43,100
Anyway.

1253
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:45,580
Oh I don't know but I don't like seedy underbellies.

1254
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:47,100
Yeah no we want to keep it.

1255
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:48,620
I want happy overbellies.

1256
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:55,900
Seedy underbellies a little bit wrong the I guess the like the I guess the like the the pain behind the fireworks.

1257
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:57,820
We yeah we always lie to strangers.

1258
00:59:57,820 --> 00:59:58,380
Yeah.

1259
00:59:58,380 --> 00:59:58,940
I see.

1260
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:01,180
It's killer I think you guys would love it.

1261
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:01,900
I gotta watch.

1262
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:03,020
That's really good.

1263
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:11,500
Yeah so it's not like there's not like people aren't ODing it's like what what when they when they go out and they put on the happy America face what's actually going on.

1264
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:15,100
So funny that you're like trying to soften it for like oh is it gonna be too dark.

1265
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:15,500
I know.

1266
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:31,020
Does it touch on I forget who talked about this but where I heard it might have been the best show might have been something else there's a video online of Yakov Smirnov talking about his theater and it's like and it's the chair has a little trick like a

1267
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:42,300
school like a lecture hall it has a little desk built in and then the food trays are magnet like they're metal but the right the tables are magnetic so you don't have to worry about knocking your food.

1268
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:44,460
What.

1269
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:45,980
This is Yakov Smirnov.

1270
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:48,380
Reinventing yeah.

1271
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:55,100
The reinventing the like canceling out the possibility of food spilling in a live concert I saw.

1272
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:55,900
Right.

1273
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:57,180
The number one issue yeah.

1274
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:59,260
Greatest innovation since the hand which.

1275
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:07,180
John Magnetic School tray John Taffer would go in there and go no notes perfect don't shut it down.

1276
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:15,260
I usually say shut it down but now time to dry clean my one sport coat I got my afternoon free now.

1277
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,020
It's a job Taffer running errands.

1278
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:23,020
Finally I can go to the bank call my aunt.

1279
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:36,620
But I like just to go back to this this crash for the K thing I mean perfect name playing music I dig it it does feel it doesn't feel like I don't know if there's any of this considered cool but it does feel accurately like 83.

1280
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:36,860
Yeah.

1281
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:49,260
Mixed with that by the way the stage is rising up the carousel theater just behind it is spinning around you got skyway buckets flying by you got people mover cruising around and rockers.

1282
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:58,860
It's all these things that aren't there and then the but the monorail and things that are there this is we've let like half of these Tomorrowland kinetic energy things we bring it up all the time.

1283
01:01:58,860 --> 01:01:59,100
Yeah.

1284
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:18,060
I didn't realize the stage is one of them too so just makes this video so great that it's these it's things that aren't there anymore rides that aren't there anymore playing music I dig this is some peak 83 this might be time travel why this would be one of the spots I'd go I go to this Tomorrowland 83.

1285
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:25,660
But if at some point people are looking at the video and they can see you walk through the frame he did it he got there.

1286
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:27,980
He died shortly after.

1287
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:33,820
Right sucked into a time displacement vortex crushed.

1288
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:47,180
But he had the happiest 10 minutes ever that mixed with let me say this too that I watched another another band that played in Tomorrowland a lot called polo and polo is like.

1289
01:02:47,340 --> 01:03:11,740
Not not as much my 80s vibe as crash they're a little more like Flaca Seagulls hair but pretty like right on with what music was and I watched a little like news report about polo it's the new band that's rising up out of Anaheim they apparently made waves at knots and then got stolen away by Disneyland legitimately built a following that Disney this is in like 85 or so.

1290
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:25,660
Like I think got some local radio airplay the drummer for polo Josh freeze you know Josh freeze very well yes so I was friends with his half brother in high school.

1291
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:36,540
Josh freeze went on to drum for the Vandals yeah yeah yeah who's like one of my like favorite high school bands so we would get into Vandals shows for free because I knew Josh's brother Travis oh wow oh that's crazy.

1292
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:42,300
Orange County celebrity he's drum for like everybody he's like yeah going through the list nine inch nails I think.

1293
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:46,380
Gweezer for a long time drums on the new Danny Elfman album.

1294
01:03:46,940 --> 01:04:03,020
Is that true yeah yeah Danny Elfman has a very weird very cool new like album it's on like anti records done on done during quarantine so he didn't have access to orchestra and all of the flourishes so it's like a it's like a pared down Danny Elfman record.

1295
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:13,100
Oh I don't know good question I don't know yeah I only was funny I only heard a couple of the I only watched a couple of the videos which are very weird but they're great.

1296
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:30,540
It's cool he's done that but anyway like such a legit drummer like I guess what I'm saying is at least in the 80s and in the case of suburban legends there have been times where like bands the main place that they play like their home club.

1297
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:37,020
Is this stage or somewhere else right at Disneyland and I do I think they had CBGB.

1298
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:51,980
And we had this the stage that rises out of the ground and I I don't know I think maybe what I'm getting at is Disneyland I just think it's neat and I think Disneyland should not go.

1299
01:04:52,380 --> 01:05:09,420
So hard into the only Bon Jovi covers kinds of bands to where it isn't possible for like something that's vaguely current to play at Disneyland maybe like that's maybe maybe it's impossible to think that something in 2021 that's vaguely cool.

1300
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:18,860
Could play at Disneyland but like I don't know it did it's like they regressed in this area you know like bands were actually a little cooler there at one time.

1301
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:28,940
Well we've talked about this before too that does feel like it goes in and out and I don't know you know a different theme park thing that does more research than us could actually like maybe track.

1302
01:05:29,180 --> 01:05:42,460
Like when Disneyland is hip like there should be like a hip meter because I get the sense that when Disneyland opens their marketing to like cool young adults to go down and there's jazz music and they might have Louis Armstrong or something playing and like.

1303
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:43,980
Have your self a phosphate.

1304
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:55,660
Yeah it's like that's a click it seems like it was really cool to go there at the time and then the 80s this does all and when they're doing Halyx that also seems like they're interested in like current cutting edge what is going on with.

1305
01:05:55,660 --> 01:06:03,580
I feel like 81 it's not so out of step it's not now anything is like 25 years past when it was it would have felt current.

1306
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:21,100
In the 90s I think that was whatever there's probably a real hard thing Videopolis like because Videopolis itself is also the idea of like young people get them here what they like we're going to play music that but then now it's like no thing like whatever is whatever music can comfortably play in a Ralph's.

1307
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:27,180
You know like that might even be too much we need it to be like a Ralph's from 25 years ago.

1308
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:38,060
I saw a recent Tomorrowland band play and I don't remember their name I don't really remember anything about it because it was just so generic and I think I think I had it on for a little bit and heard three Coldplay songs.

1309
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:45,980
And this is from like four years ago yeah so I think that's where they're at and look at you're going to think I'm trying to.

1310
01:06:46,460 --> 01:07:05,500
Talk about Mad Tea parties more and I'm just going to make a point is that I think the closest thing you'll get to current hip stuff is when they do some sort of electronica electron electronica festival where they play like how like house music or electronic music and the same thing with DJ White Rabbit would take the stage.

1311
01:07:05,580 --> 01:07:12,300
That's probably the closest you'll get to like what a young person is like maybe on the cutting edge of some type of music.

1312
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:31,500
Well you but you the one thing we hadn't really talked about you I feel like would pass by Tomorrowland Terrace a number of years like five or six years ago I feel like you happen to be at the park a number of times where like there's a band playing at Tomorrowland Terrace and Max from the Goofy movie is dancing to Gangnam Style.

1313
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:39,980
I don't think we've ever seen Max from Goof Troops dancing to Gangnam Style.

1314
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:43,020
Something or like Mr. Incredible was dancing.

1315
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:52,220
Have I seen the country bears dancing in the last three years and did I run over to them and take photos with them.

1316
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:58,140
Am I wearing the shirt I might have been wearing when that happened very possible.

1317
01:07:58,140 --> 01:07:59,180
A shirt which is.

1318
01:07:59,180 --> 01:08:01,340
Is Greedo it's a Star Wars Greedo shirt.

1319
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:11,500
But you're also talking about the Disney ticketed event their 80s night Lindsay and I went to right before the pandemic where we got to see Totally Mini on this stage on this area.

1320
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:11,900
Right.

1321
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:13,420
Oh that was in this spot.

1322
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:14,140
This was in this spot.

1323
01:08:14,140 --> 01:08:31,260
I don't think the stage was actually elevated but this was in the spot where Mini Donald Goofy all in their 80s outfits came out and danced to 80s songs and the song Totally Mini which is a good song and Lindsay and I hung around dancing with the characters in this area.

1324
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:35,180
45 minutes and then Doug Jones shows up and he's like yeah hey.

1325
01:08:38,860 --> 01:08:46,300
So that those things I remember I don't remember if there was a character like Max they do once in a while yes have little characters run around.

1326
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:47,820
Characters next to the band.

1327
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:48,620
Yeah yeah yeah.

1328
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:51,740
And the character dances a little and then wanders into the crowd a little.

1329
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:53,980
Which is bait for me for sure.

1330
01:08:53,980 --> 01:08:57,980
If the characters are like easily accessible and dancing sign me up please.

1331
01:08:58,780 --> 01:09:05,020
So yeah that that's still I wouldn't say that's hip or cutting edge I would say that.

1332
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:09,580
No no that's just a different flavor of thing that goes on at the stage that we hadn't really been.

1333
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:23,900
Yeah random odd dance party it's it's hard to quantify like what it is that happens there now exactly there are bands they do happen it is like if I've had a couple drinks I will for sure go over and like dance around for a second for whatever it is.

1334
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:24,380
Yeah.

1335
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:30,940
Some like weird some cover of good vibrations is used but what's vaguely in my head.

1336
01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:39,660
Yeah but I don't like also like with I mean there are pop charts still I mean like Taylor Swift is popular right like that would be something you would be playing.

1337
01:09:39,660 --> 01:09:40,620
Yeah I guess.

1338
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:42,140
I'm just trying to think of like what else.

1339
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:45,260
They're up to shake it off they're not playing the like moodier.

1340
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:50,300
Right they're not they're not at Indie Rock Taylor Swift yeah they're still at Pop Branch out.

1341
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:51,580
They're not at the Red Re-Record.

1342
01:09:51,580 --> 01:09:52,060
Yeah.

1343
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:53,740
None of the stuff with Bony Vare.

1344
01:09:53,740 --> 01:09:54,060
No.

1345
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:54,620
They would know.

1346
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:55,180
No.

1347
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:57,500
Nothing is even close to Bony Vare.

1348
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:01,580
His reverb level at Disney Bob Chapek would flip his lid.

1349
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:05,740
Olivia Rodrigo probably too bawdy those songs.

1350
01:10:05,740 --> 01:10:14,220
Probably too bawdy despite the fact that she was is or was a cast member on their high school musical the musical Disney Plus show.

1351
01:10:14,220 --> 01:10:16,780
Yeah the new Lord song maybe.

1352
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:17,260
Maybe.

1353
01:10:17,260 --> 01:10:21,500
It's a little pop you're a little more it feels a little more George Michael to me honestly than the old Lord.

1354
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:26,460
Probably a Miley Cyrus cut off too there's like a Miley that would play but maybe not.

1355
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:26,780
Yeah.

1356
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:27,500
You know her.

1357
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:27,820
Right.

1358
01:10:27,820 --> 01:10:29,660
Her body or material.

1359
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:30,220
Of course.

1360
01:10:30,220 --> 01:10:30,460
Yeah.

1361
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:32,140
She's not visible anywhere.

1362
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:32,460
Right.

1363
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:33,740
Shocking tongue out of the mouth.

1364
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:35,660
Sure with her tongue sticking out like.

1365
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:36,700
Yes sure.

1366
01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:39,100
Like a Rolling Stone logo.

1367
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:42,060
Like a Rolling Stone logo the most bawdy of logos.

1368
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:48,460
Mike do you think would second level reunite to play the Tomorrowland stage do you think you could get those guys to.

1369
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:52,780
Like take a week off of a job a real job they have.

1370
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:53,020
Yeah.

1371
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:56,860
Come to Tomorrowland play the reason with me.

1372
01:11:01,660 --> 01:11:04,220
We did not ever cover who besides the reason.

1373
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:12,060
I haven't talked to some I haven't talked to them in a little while I don't know they would maybe be up for that.

1374
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:12,940
Guess what.

1375
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:17,500
Vodcast the ride bands reunited our new here bring the cameras in.

1376
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:17,980
All right.

1377
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:22,380
We have what if I said we've contacted every other member of.

1378
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:22,700
Wow.

1379
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:23,420
Second level.

1380
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:27,020
And they've learned the reason they already know it.

1381
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:27,580
Yeah.

1382
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:30,220
They're waiting in a jam jamming on it for weeks.

1383
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:34,460
I'll learn I can learn it fast.

1384
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:42,140
What did you do you remember any could you sing a couplet of a second level song.

1385
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:44,220
Do you ask me for a cover an original.

1386
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:45,020
Yeah an original.

1387
01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:45,260
Yeah.

1388
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:45,900
Yeah.

1389
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:47,420
That's when we rocked the house.

1390
01:11:47,420 --> 01:11:49,740
Oh wait a minute we never got out.

1391
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:52,300
I think you said this one on the show I guess I've heard this one before.

1392
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:52,460
Yeah.

1393
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:55,500
We did my friend.

1394
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:56,060
OK so.

1395
01:11:56,620 --> 01:11:59,660
I'll see you have to sing it if you know the melody of the sing it.

1396
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:01,420
Hold on hold the microphone.

1397
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:01,820
Whoa.

1398
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:03,660
Oh my God.

1399
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:04,140
Hold on.

1400
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:07,260
Whoa this is like the concert stage rising up in Tomorrowland.

1401
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:08,220
Somebody hold this.

1402
01:12:08,220 --> 01:12:10,060
A guitar is wait how do we do this.

1403
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:14,780
I didn't play guitar in the band but I can't do we need to do we need to rig up to somebody

1404
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:16,380
need to take you keep them.

1405
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:17,660
No no you need to stand.

1406
01:12:17,660 --> 01:12:18,060
Yeah.

1407
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:19,020
Hold on here.

1408
01:12:19,020 --> 01:12:20,700
Wait here we'll get it out.

1409
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:21,020
Yeah.

1410
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:21,740
Edit this out.

1411
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:22,240
Yeah.

1412
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:27,420
And we've rearranged our usual microphone set up Jordan.

1413
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:30,700
It's got to be a thrill to watch this live concert happening.

1414
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:32,380
I can't spool in front of you.

1415
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:32,620
Yeah.

1416
01:12:32,620 --> 01:12:35,340
I mean this is like like Woodstock for me.

1417
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:37,500
I'm going to say I'm going to tell all my grandkids.

1418
01:12:37,660 --> 01:12:40,140
I will probably be as sloppy as Woodstock often was.

1419
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:46,300
If you remember when Mike Carlson played the second level song you weren't even there.

1420
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:47,260
I feel really bad.

1421
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:51,580
I will I will do like a live show I will have this rehearsed at a certain point too.

1422
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:52,620
No no no.

1423
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:53,820
No it's only two songs.

1424
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:54,620
It's okay.

1425
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:57,260
That's what got you guys into the talent show rawness.

1426
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:02,940
Yeah so basically I'm going to try to play like what the verse sound like

1427
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:04,620
and then I'm just going to do like the chorus of it.

1428
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:05,900
Okay.

1429
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:08,780
Wait and Jason you want to hear intro.

1430
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:09,580
What's this song called?

1431
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:12,940
This song is called Rock the House Jason.

1432
01:13:12,940 --> 01:13:14,620
All right we're here.

1433
01:13:14,620 --> 01:13:18,780
We got Mike Carlson from second level here with his hit song Rock the House.

1434
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:19,580
Take it away Mike.

1435
01:13:20,140 --> 01:13:22,300
Okay so here's here's what I remember.

1436
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:25,660
I think it would be go around like something like this so like we kind of like playing like

1437
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:32,620
that would be like kind of the groove you're thinking like in the drums like a red hot

1438
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:39,100
chili pepper style thing and then the chorus would be like that's when we rock the house.

1439
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:41,820
Oh wait a minute we never got out.

1440
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:46,380
Oh come on can't you see all those people they were looking at me.

1441
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:50,860
Yeah so like that's the that would be the gist of the chorus.

1442
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:52,460
I apologize for how sloppy it was.

1443
01:13:52,460 --> 01:13:55,340
Whoa wow no apologies necessary.

1444
01:13:55,340 --> 01:13:58,220
We never got out and then what was that second line?

1445
01:13:59,020 --> 01:14:03,580
Oh oh can't oh come on can't you see all those people they were looking at me.

1446
01:14:03,580 --> 01:14:09,740
Yeah well one thing's for certain this crowd is going home tonight separately alone to pray

1447
01:14:09,740 --> 01:14:11,020
and read magazines.

1448
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:18,540
That was great I can see how that would have fucking killed at that venue that fallout boy

1449
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:19,340
also played.

1450
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:24,700
Yeah and we were was not sophisticated like the other band that we beat out

1451
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:26,540
because we were more accessible.

1452
01:14:27,180 --> 01:14:28,460
Too self-important.

1453
01:14:28,460 --> 01:14:34,140
Yeah I remember when we did the variety show when we were doing the variety show I remember

1454
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:38,940
I also did a comedy sketch in the show and my bandmates were mad at me because they thought

1455
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:46,540
it was going to ruin the integrity of the Foo Fighters dress up in costumes and

1456
01:14:46,540 --> 01:14:49,100
wait exactly why we love the Foo Fighters.

1457
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:56,140
Exactly so wow that's a snippet I will play I will learn it re-learn it and I'll play it

1458
01:14:56,140 --> 01:14:57,340
at a certain point for everyone.

1459
01:14:58,380 --> 01:15:01,580
Okay fictional PTR con that I'm always booking in my head.

1460
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:04,380
Yeah sure second level reunion.

1461
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:09,260
Yeah we had what was it what was our con called why can't I remember that.

1462
01:15:09,260 --> 01:15:10,140
Did we have one?

1463
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:15,020
Well the one across from the oh we actually did it oh yeah yeah yeah we had a name for it.

1464
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:18,380
Yeah you're right D23 that was our PTR 23.

1465
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:19,980
PTR 23 yeah.

1466
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:23,020
Doesn't necessarily apply so yeah yeah no we can we can PTR.

1467
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:28,380
But you know look have I floated the idea of an all music show for podcast or it I certainly

1468
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:32,140
have internally so I'd like to get some of the groundswell energy here.

1469
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:33,500
Like there would be a lot of support for that.

1470
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:38,540
Have Jason and Mike or Jason and Scott been slightly skeptical?

1471
01:15:38,540 --> 01:15:41,100
That's right that's why I'm going to the people that's why I'm going to the people.

1472
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:43,740
That's why I'm taking a right to the people.

1473
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:44,380
Appealing straight to the audience.

1474
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:47,260
Are those Beatles costumes funny do you want to hear?

1475
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:52,780
Will we wear the Beatles costumes and will you laugh at them because I think the answer is yes.

1476
01:15:53,260 --> 01:15:59,100
I have requested at least one or two outings where I talk on a stage before I get to singing on a

1477
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:01,740
stage getting back to regular life I believe.

1478
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:05,260
Jason needs a lot of warm up time on stage.

1479
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:09,020
I need to get my ring rust off you know I gotta shake off the.

1480
01:16:09,740 --> 01:16:14,220
I could do an improv show with you right now yeah no problem we'll get on a stage it'll be just as

1481
01:16:14,220 --> 01:16:16,060
good as any garbage we did eight years ago.

1482
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:18,060
Well that is true that is for sure.

1483
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:20,300
I don't need any warm up I'm ready to go tonight.

1484
01:16:20,860 --> 01:16:23,500
We're all excited for just not to come back.

1485
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:25,580
I'm not ready just to play rock the house because I haven't done that in a while.

1486
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:27,740
That's when we'll know things are really back to normal.

1487
01:16:27,740 --> 01:16:28,860
That's when we'll know.

1488
01:16:29,740 --> 01:16:34,540
Theater with no air conditioning at 10 p.m. and the show is supposed to start at nine.

1489
01:16:34,540 --> 01:16:37,020
More people on stage than in the audience.

1490
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:38,780
Yeah that's when we'll know America's back.

1491
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:45,020
What have we not name checked in this let me let me just say another quick run of band names

1492
01:16:45,020 --> 01:16:50,940
because we get you know I was saying those like groovy 60 70s ones I also want to mention

1493
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:57,820
Tabasco the friendship train and your kind of people.

1494
01:16:57,820 --> 01:16:59,980
Oh my god I have names too that are not those names.

1495
01:16:59,980 --> 01:17:00,620
They're not those.

1496
01:17:00,620 --> 01:17:05,820
Wow yeah I just I really like your kind of people because it feels potentially from like a grouchy

1497
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:10,780
Disney executive a card walker like yeah you'll like the band it's your kind of people.

1498
01:17:11,740 --> 01:17:16,460
I agree I have Voyager Soundcastle Limited.

1499
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:16,700
Yeah.

1500
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:18,140
You have those two.

1501
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:20,620
I got Soundcastle Limited what an intriguing name.

1502
01:17:20,620 --> 01:17:22,140
I don't know much about them.

1503
01:17:22,140 --> 01:17:23,820
Laser they are with a Z.

1504
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:26,460
Laser with a Z and then do you have Sunshine Balloon.

1505
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:31,340
Yes Sunshine Balloon is really intriguing I couldn't find that much more about them.

1506
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:31,900
Yeah I didn't either.

1507
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:33,340
These things should have been documented better.

1508
01:17:33,340 --> 01:17:34,860
Some of these sound like drug references.

1509
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:36,140
That's true.

1510
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:39,180
Yeah potentially getting a little trippy Disney.

1511
01:17:39,740 --> 01:17:44,140
Maybe I hope you did drug tests on these these rock and rollsters you let.

1512
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:47,500
Has anyone said Papa do run run.

1513
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:49,900
Oh I saw Papa do run run as well yeah.

1514
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:54,940
Papa do run run not I kept going is it Papa umau mao no it's Papa do run run.

1515
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:57,260
Oh here's a name.

1516
01:17:57,260 --> 01:18:01,020
Allie and AJ performed during 2006 during the 50th.

1517
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:05,900
They are I have heard those names before once.

1518
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:09,820
If this were a Coachella poster which of these names would be big and which would be small.

1519
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:13,340
Suburban Legends would be big it seems like.

1520
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:19,980
I mean I would at least a middle I would push for Crash for the K.

1521
01:18:19,980 --> 01:18:20,380
Right.

1522
01:18:20,380 --> 01:18:22,220
Is Papa do run run Beyonce.

1523
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:24,060
I guess is what I'm what I'm getting at.

1524
01:18:24,060 --> 01:18:25,340
That's really like.

1525
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:30,300
Well look they also are to me because Papa do run run are a bunch of people who played with

1526
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:35,020
the Beach Boys and I think in fact for a long time we're specifically the backup band of Jan

1527
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:35,740
and Dean.

1528
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:36,060
Oh okay.

1529
01:18:36,060 --> 01:18:41,820
What I learned about Papa do run run is that they were so so close and so frequently hung out

1530
01:18:41,820 --> 01:18:45,980
with the Beach Boys that sometimes they'd be playing Disneyland and they would tell

1531
01:18:45,980 --> 01:18:51,740
Brian and Carl Wilson do you want to come down and hang and be part of our set and they would.

1532
01:18:51,740 --> 01:18:55,260
Which I never knew about all my Beach Boys fandom I didn't know.

1533
01:18:55,260 --> 01:18:55,500
Wow.

1534
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:59,900
Brian and Carl my favorite Beach Boy heart of the band Trader Long Promise Road

1535
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:06,300
Feel Flows my favorite songs I cannot say them they would come they'd come down and play

1536
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:12,780
another time machine thing if I could go see you know 1978 Beach Boys Wilson Brothers both

1537
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:18,140
huge messes at this point Brian just starting to leave his house for the first time.

1538
01:19:18,140 --> 01:19:23,820
Carl deep in the throes of alcoholism that he later kicked but you know I want to see

1539
01:19:23,820 --> 01:19:27,500
some drunk ass Beach Boys clown around on the Disneyland stage.

1540
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:33,740
This is let me also say how how disturbingly deep my Beach Boys fandom goes that I saw a picture

1541
01:19:33,740 --> 01:19:41,260
that Papa do run run posted of Carl Wilson on stage with them and I was like oh it's his green

1542
01:19:41,260 --> 01:19:46,540
jacket like I know his I know enough Beach Boys footage I'm like niche your green jacket that

1543
01:19:46,540 --> 01:19:52,140
cool shiny green jacket like I've thought like maybe I want to get a green jacket like Carl wore

1544
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:58,060
I it's like it's it's weird I can't you should get the green too much I know

1545
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:05,740
really yeah okay I just haven't you know like you know if you feel a you know a little emotional

1546
01:20:05,740 --> 01:20:10,300
bringing up something like this it's very very vulnerable I think you guys would be okay if I

1547
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:13,500
came in here with a shiny jacket right in 1979.

1548
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:15,660
Take it to Milton 80s they'll make sure the fit's right.

1549
01:20:15,660 --> 01:20:16,380
I love it yeah.

1550
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:17,580
Little Taylor is needed.

1551
01:20:17,740 --> 01:20:23,980
Yeah if the if the listen if the last year's taught us anything it's it do it now man don't wait.

1552
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:27,820
Yeah you're right yeah who knows we'll end up shoved in a closet again.

1553
01:20:27,820 --> 01:20:29,340
Thank you get the green jacket.

1554
01:20:29,340 --> 01:20:34,460

1557
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:50,540
everywhere you go because you'll know why you're wearing it.

1558
01:20:50,540 --> 01:20:54,620
That's right but if I come on stage and we do a live show and I'm wearing this jacket

1559
01:20:55,420 --> 01:20:59,820
just remember this is not a sergeant pepper jacket this is not to be laughed at no this is

1576
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:47,660
uh yeah august summer slam oh big big weekend got it the gcw show the night before

1577
01:22:48,220 --> 01:22:54,220
they're like uh indie they're more hardcore they're more of like a suburban legend right

1578
01:22:54,220 --> 01:22:59,020
versus like your corporate sky or yeah thank you now I'm this makes sense to me now

1579
01:22:59,020 --> 01:23:05,820
now please explain wrestlers in terms of what ska band they're analogous to yeah exactly so

1580
01:23:06,860 --> 01:23:10,540
august is up now yeah so this is like a slapstick or a less than jake what you say

1581
01:23:11,580 --> 01:23:16,940
operation ivy I had a less than jake face though I will say less than less than jake still fucking

1582
01:23:16,940 --> 01:23:22,220
rule less than jake puts out new material and it's good interesting yeah did you break down the

1583
01:23:22,220 --> 01:23:27,740
democratic presidential candidates uh during the primaries into which ska bands they were yes I

1584
01:23:27,740 --> 01:23:33,580
know and that's why I decided I'm like well okay like Elizabeth Warren of course is the dancehall

1585
01:23:33,580 --> 01:23:43,020
crashers um let's see what have we uh anything else we want to shout out um oh you know what

1586
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:49,100
uh a really fast Michael iceberg in the ice machine yes yes yes yeah uh did you did you

1587
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:54,300
run into this they're putting Michael Eisner it's not this is very confusing if you say it fast it

1588
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:59,020
sounds like Michael it's not Michael Eisner it's Michael iceberg Michael iceberg is that

1589
01:23:59,980 --> 01:24:05,020
meant to evoke Michael Eisner I don't think so because I think it predates before there was

1590
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:10,220
Michael Eisner there was Michael iceberg and sometimes you would go to Disneyland or Disney

1591
01:24:10,220 --> 01:24:17,340
World and the stage would rise up and on the stage would be a big glass pyramid and then one of the

1592
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:23,820
triangle flaps would fold down and a bunch of dry ice would shoot out and in saw once the lots of

1593
01:24:23,820 --> 01:24:30,060
dry ice uh dissipated which it seems like it took a long time to you would see inside a guy just

1594
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:37,580
with a full artillery of synths um just like shelf after shelf after shelf and not only that but a

1595
01:24:37,580 --> 01:24:43,180
mirror behind him so you could watch his hands play he has like a beak bin energy to me when I

1596
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:49,980
see him you know what I mean like there's uh did someone say get me a yanny did someone say we need

1597
01:24:49,980 --> 01:24:54,460
a yanny in here I think it predates yanny too but that really seems like something Eisner would do

1598
01:24:54,460 --> 01:25:00,940
is like we what is disney I saw this guy on PBS the mirror watching him play all this stuff is very

1599
01:25:00,940 --> 01:25:07,020
impressive it reminds me of like when someone sits between two pianos and plays two pianos at once

1600
01:25:07,020 --> 01:25:11,900
that sounds cool yeah it is it is pretty neat there was a whole concert special of this inexplicably

1601
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:17,260
on the Disney channel and they would try to like Disneyify it because ultimately it's like a guy

1602
01:25:17,260 --> 01:25:22,620
playing keyboards and they'd go like well how does this guy's song about his daughter apply

1603
01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:27,980
not really Disneyish so then they just kind of like put up footage from Bambi over it like does

1604
01:25:27,980 --> 01:25:35,420
that do it yeah sure very strange special yeah um a lot of banter maybe too much banter maybe too much

1605
01:25:35,420 --> 01:25:44,220
banter yeah yeah more rock less talk iceberg play two keyboards that's what we're here for

1606
01:25:44,540 --> 01:25:49,980
I want to hear pattern he's on uh he made several appearances on the tonight show

1607
01:25:50,620 --> 01:25:56,540
yeah yeah and person kind of Carson hates him yeah yeah he's really mocking him in the intro he says

1608
01:25:56,540 --> 01:26:02,700
like well this still just get me closer to getting to my car and he's like fighting he's like yeah

1609
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:06,940
he's really like mad like shits I've never seen him shit that hard on somebody that's about to

1610
01:26:06,940 --> 01:26:11,820
come out or do something unless he like was being funny like right being friendly this is a really

1611
01:26:11,820 --> 01:26:16,940
abrasive Carson intro to where like you could tell somebody like went and like the person like

1612
01:26:16,940 --> 01:26:21,820
they saw this guy at the opening of Epcot and I think that's why he ended up on Carson so what

1613
01:26:21,820 --> 01:26:27,020
and watching Carson have to say like he was at the opening of the Epcot Center down in Florida and

1614
01:26:27,020 --> 01:26:32,620
you could tell the disdain yeah he hates all what is this shit what is that stupid word yeah give me

1615
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:40,380
these cards to read yeah let me riff he's furious yeah yeah he's like uh what's uh what's his producer

1616
01:26:40,380 --> 01:26:47,260
Freddy Freddy de Cordova uh yeah he's like he's like talking to him and like he's like yeah I'm

1617
01:26:47,260 --> 01:26:53,340
getting through it like he's he's just so upset vicious Carson is kind of frightening it's very

1618
01:26:53,340 --> 01:26:58,940
scary Carson you know was supposed to be a miserable guy from a lot of accounts uh there's

1619
01:26:58,940 --> 01:27:05,020
also a good uh rest in peace Charles Groton interviewer Groton goes at him for like 10 minutes

1620
01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:09,820
have you seen that which extracts the funniest Carson ever is because he's mean right back that

1621
01:27:09,820 --> 01:27:14,460
was always their shtick I didn't realize was that like being like awful to each other yeah I didn't

1622
01:27:14,460 --> 01:27:19,660
either and people didn't understand that so they'd boo Groton right he got angry letters all the time

1623
01:27:19,660 --> 01:27:24,300
why aren't you nicer to America's host yeah and he's the eye he's not just like cranky like he

1624
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:29,820
was on other shows he's like just derails every question yeah and just questions like what he

1625
01:27:29,820 --> 01:27:36,060
cares about who he cares about so the things that I guess really made Carson angry is Charles Groton

1626
01:27:36,140 --> 01:27:43,340
Michael Iceberg Michael Iceberg who it's funny with the context of Carson and watching it as a TV

1627
01:27:43,340 --> 01:27:49,180
show because I'm immediately like oh come on come on why are you being such an asshole about this

1628
01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:55,900
and then it cuts to Michael Iceberg and he plays a real like to use a better I to not know a better

1629
01:27:55,900 --> 01:28:01,740
way to put it a real farty synth sounding Baroque hoedown which is a song from the

1630
01:28:02,620 --> 01:28:08,860
electric parade yeah electrical parade and I go okay I get it now in context that you'd be like

1631
01:28:08,860 --> 01:28:15,500
what is this shit did Michael Iceberg write the electrical no no okay not no but he played it he

1632
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:20,060
played it and like plays a different vert like little versions of it and like uh you know he veers

1633
01:28:20,060 --> 01:28:26,380
off of it and most encounters it's like all the space music yeah the era and yeah I could see

1634
01:28:26,780 --> 01:28:34,700
Carson catches that on a tv on his way in to like yell at his assistant yeah to like make her redo

1635
01:28:34,700 --> 01:28:43,340
all that day's typing and like wait what's on the show tonight I'm just trying to get to my smoke

1636
01:28:43,340 --> 01:28:50,460
house reservation yeah get me drunk Burt Reynolds instead yeah uh because like if it was in the part

1637
01:28:50,460 --> 01:28:54,860
in the chronics of the park I'd be like this is the greatest man I've ever seen Michael Iceberg

1638
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:59,740
and then like in the context of the tonight show I go oh yeah this is a fucking some dumb bullshit

1639
01:28:59,740 --> 01:29:05,420
right if you're not coming out of a pyramid you know yeah less impact right well he does on the

1640
01:29:05,420 --> 01:29:10,220
show he did bring the pyramid brought the ice machine yeah and they take the smoke it takes

1641
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:16,620
the fog so long to go away yeah that's one of the funniest things always to me is the fog machine

1642
01:29:16,620 --> 01:29:24,460
that won't stop um last for the full five minute performance that in like my school theater program

1643
01:29:24,460 --> 01:29:28,620
and like middle school I think that middle school and high school shared a fog machine but that was

1644
01:29:28,620 --> 01:29:33,180
a big purchase that was a big deal yeah that we had the fog machine and you weren't allowed

1645
01:29:33,180 --> 01:29:38,860
we weren't allowed to fool around with that like like a parent managing it like for certain scenes

1646
01:29:38,860 --> 01:29:45,820
of mcbeth only yeah but it was sequences right you could get fleet you could pick this it was

1647
01:29:45,820 --> 01:29:52,220

1648
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:57,180
let it run way too long and it would take forever to dissipate pina colada haze also great on the
