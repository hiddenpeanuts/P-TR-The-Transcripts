1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,260
Ingredients

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:06,140
One day at FCB

3
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,300
Ahhâ€¦ Let's settle into a nice, breezy end of the year.

4
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,500
Club 3, Jason, feeling breezy.

5
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,500
I'm feeling very breezy, yeah.

6
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,300
And I really appreciated everyone who was like,

7
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,500
you know, they've been working hard.

8
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,500
Let's give them their usual flavor of brain poisoning.

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,500
Let's give them something light, you know?

10
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,500
Yeah, well I don't know if anyone gave us credit for working hard.

11
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,500
What was said was,

12
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,000
they work, the job is so hard.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,500
Here's the specific quote, this is from Margarita Javier.

14
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,700
I was not sure, I was very surprised

15
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,700
that the 1999 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade won.

16
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,700
And I was like, what is the sensibility here?

17
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,700
And then I saw the comment,

18
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,700
the boys have been tortured enough,

19
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,700
let's give them a nice parade with a weird pop culture lineup.

20
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,700
And which, thank you for that.

21
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,700
I feel it, I feel the gift.

22
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,700
And I think Mike Carlson does too, hi.

23
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,700
Yes, hi. I do feel it was a gift.

24
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,900
Around every turn, there's something that we want to talk about

25
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,900
for a whole episode, honestly, as far as this is concerned.

26
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,900
So much so that what first I thought was more of a breezy thing

27
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,900
ultimately became something where I kind of feel a bit of pressure,

28
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,900
honestly, to address every single thing that happens in this parade

29
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,900
that is of interest to us and to me.

30
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,900
No kidding, wow.

31
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,900
Okay, well then I'll let you be the points person,

32
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,900
the checklist person.

33
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,100
I have a checklist.

34
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,100
Because I'm feeling super breezy here.

35
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,100
That's great, I'm happy for that.

36
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,100
But of course I want to do the discussion of how the poll went at the top.

37
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:10,100
The runner-up narrowly squeaked it out.

38
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:15,100
The one that was not holiday or avatar oriented,

39
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,100
which is perfect for January,

40
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:22,100
we will refresh with the incumbent candidate,

41
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,100
the Klaski Chupo McDonald Land cartoons.

42
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,300
And just to maybe give it the full pitch that you can't fit into the poll,

43
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,300
this is from Cody Lawrence,

44
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:35,300
the straight to VHS Klaski Chupo McDonald Land cartoons

45
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:39,300
from the early 90s with horrifying live action wraparounds.

46
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,300
I believe these are available to watch on YouTube.

47
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,300
I kind of know, I know I've poked around these.

48
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,300
And I think I did not stick around.

49
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,300
I think I dipped my toe.

50
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,300
So if we're getting back into torture the boys territory,

51
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,500
that should be a good way to do it.

52
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,500
Mike, this was your pick.

53
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,500
When we were choosing one, this one caught your eye.

54
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Is there anything you want to say to endorse this one more fully?

55
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,500
Well, honestly, really the main reason,

56
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,500
and I haven't watched all these,

57
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,500
I don't know them very well,

58
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,500
I've seen pictures which are very intriguing,

59
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,500
but honestly we just haven't done

60
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,500
fully dedicated McDonald Land stuff in an episode.

61
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,500
We've addressed it,

62
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,500
we've talked about certain aspects of McDonald Land,

63
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,700
but this felt like a good starting point to start digging in.

64
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,700
To start hacking away.

65
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,700
There's a lot of McDonald's work ahead of us.

66
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,700
A lot.

67
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,700
So why not start with this sub-sliver of it?

68
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,700
And it's odd in a very specific way.

69
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,700
In that kind of late 90s, early 2000s,

70
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,700
very, I don't know, would you say angular,

71
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,700
like kids animation stuff?

72
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,900
Real, grotesque a little bit.

73
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,900
I don't think I'm the biggest Classy Chupo fan in general.

74
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,900
I guess I liked Rugrats growing up.

75
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,900
It's later, it's much later than Rugrats.

76
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,900
And the style has evolved.

77
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:08,900
But it's also idiosyncratic compared to the main McDonald Land stuff.

78
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,900
It looks different, it feels different.

79
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,900
Yeah, yeah.

80
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,900
I think they go to a grimace island.

81
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,900
I think you learn what grimaces are.

82
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:25,100
Much like Muppets in Space, don't you go to the Gonzo planet?

83
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,100
Yes.

84
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,100
So similarly, Gonzo is from a planet,

85
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,100
but grimace is from an island.

86
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:36,100
And that's what is ahead of us if people pick this one.

87
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,100
Anyway, solid candidate.

88
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,100
Give us more suggestions in the comments.

89
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,100
And vote with your likes to see what you like from the list.

90
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,100
But as for this, let me repeat

91
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,300
what we're doing today also with the full...

92
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,300
We're getting right into a bullet, into checkpoints.

93
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,300
And we know these are all ones we have to hit

94
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,300
even before we get into other bonus ones

95
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,300
that are not mentioned in Shane Cannon's description of

96
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,300
the 1999 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade

97
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,300
featuring Lou Baga,

98
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,300
Vern Troyer on an Austin Powers the Spy Who Shagged Me themed float,

99
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,300
an Ask Jeeves float,

100
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,300
Rudy Giuliani,

101
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,300
and a special performance by the Bacon Brothers.

102
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,500
What a pitch.

103
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:23,500
From Shane Cannon, who really, the MVP of Club 3 for the first year,

104
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,500
this is his second one, the Cannon.

105
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,500
The Cannon doesn't miss.

106
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,500
Got two through the poll.

107
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,500
Gave us Garfield Eats and gave us this one.

108
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,500
Expert marksman.

109
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,500
Yeah, yeah. That Cannon is pointed right at the bullseye.

110
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,500
I'm excited. You guys feel good about this?

111
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,500
I feel great about this.

112
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,500
This is a long video. This is a long parade.

113
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,700
And I went into it going, this is going to be really funny,

114
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,700
blah, blah, blah, but there's going to be a lot of downtime.

115
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,700
Every two seconds I go, oh my god, okay, I got to write this down.

116
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,700
Okay, oh my god, what is this song?

117
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,700
Who wrote this song?

118
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,700
There's so much here.

119
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,700
It's a never ending as far as I'm concerned with stuff to talk about.

120
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,700
Yeah, I think it really,

121
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,700
it does lag a little at the top,

122
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,700
and then the balloons start to show up,

123
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,700
and it really finds its footing, but I think...

124
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,700
There's something right off the bat that I was obsessed with.

125
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,900
Not to give too much away,

126
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,900
but I think a lot of the fun of this for me came from the combinations of things.

127
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,900
Oh, of course, yes.

128
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,900
And I have a fun game to play later too that I've contacted.

129
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,900
Ooh, oh boy.

130
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,900
Just to maybe generally talk about the Macy's parade,

131
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,900
which we don't have to do much of,

132
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,900
we're here to talk 99,

133
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,900
but this is a very good area for us,

134
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,900
and I think maybe there's a specific episode that could come down the road

135
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,100
that is collecting oddities of other Macy's parades,

136
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,100
but we'll handle 99 first.

137
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,100
But when you talk about combos of things,

138
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,100
what I always find funny about them is that it's always like,

139
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:01,100
they are on the mark pop culturally somewhat.

140
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,100
There's two to three performers every year

141
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,100
who are current relevant performers,

142
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,100
and somebody who, as in this one,

143
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,100
there's somebody who you can say,

144
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,300
is America's hottest pop star,

145
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,300
or the biggest teen sensation,

146
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,300
but then they're on some float

147
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,300
where they're dancing around

148
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:27,300
with a bunch of Midwest dads dressed as socks.

149
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,300
It's somebody who is hip

150
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:35,300
always put next to a bunch of raggedy-ans or something.

151
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,300
The mismatch is always really funny to me.

152
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,500
It's like Britney Spears and then a 20-foot Vlasic Pickle store.

153
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,500
Absolutely.

154
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,500
And then my other broad observation about it

155
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,500
is that the best you can possibly do at the Macy's Parade

156
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,500
in any category is be fine.

157
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,500
There's no Prince at the Super Bowl of the Macy's Parade.

158
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,500
There's no Michael Jackson inventing the moonwalk.

159
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,500
It's always one verse maybe,

160
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,700
and the performer themselves seem surprised

161
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,700
when they start to move

162
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,700
and when all of the Crayola crayons dancing around

163
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,700
on street level have to start moving too,

164
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,700
and those people are only so coordinated.

165
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,700
Maybe they got one rehearsal, maybe.

166
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,700
There's just a base level of this.

167
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,700
There's only so good that the Macy's Parade can be.

168
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,700
Yeah, because performers, as far as pop stars,

169
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,700
they're lip-syncing almost 90,

170
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,700
I'm sure almost 100% of the time.

171
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,900
Actors are just waving.

172
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,900
The best you're going to do is if you're in a marching band

173
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,900
and you'll sound exactly the same

174
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,900
as all the other marching bands.

175
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,900
And this is from a guy who was in a marching band

176
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,900
in high school.

177
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,900
You can't tell the difference

178
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,900
if one marching band is better than the other.

179
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,900
They all sound fine.

180
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,900
They all do kind of the same thing.

181
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,900
I think this is blasphemous

182
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,900
if a music teacher was hearing me say this,

183
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,900
but you would notice a very bad one for sure,

184
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,100
but you can't tell the difference

185
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,100
between 10 different marching bands

186
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,100
that go through this parade.

187
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,100
They all sound fine.

188
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,100
They all do the thing.

189
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,100
They all sound fine to me.

190
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,100
It's different than, say, a drum line

191
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,100
where there's a lot of physicality and individuality

192
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,100
and they're trying to really stand out.

193
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,100
There is in this,

194
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,100
I get into the good stuff already,

195
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:32,100
there is a marching band version of some Les Mis songs.

196
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,000
Oh, yeah, yes!

197
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,700
Which really take all of the soul out of those songs.

198
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:43,700
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba!

199
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,000
D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d!

200
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,120
Really takes away the personality of it.

201
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,480
The emotion of it, yeah.

202
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,480
The emotion of it.

203
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,480
I think in the same vein,

204
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,480
I think one that made me go like, huh?

205
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,480
It was the New York police department band

206
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,860
doing 42nd Street, and I'm like, are they?

207
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,860
Like, I'm like straining, and I can like,

208
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,860
okay, I kind of hear it.

209
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,860
As you were saying, the arrangement wasn't something

210
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,860
that actually, you would have noticed it

211
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,860
if they hadn't said it.

212
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,860
I don't know if it was the sound or the arrangement

213
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,860
or the inclement weather.

214
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,860
That's what we saw, right?

215
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,860
That's what you took me to once?

216
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,860
Yeah, we saw a touring production

217
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,860
at the Pantages Theater.

218
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,860
How does 42nd Street go, the song?

219
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,240
To come and meet those dancing feet

220
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,240
on the avenue I'm taking you to,

221
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,240
42nd Street, yeah.

222
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,240
Got it, got it.

223
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,240
Jason sings the old ones.

224
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,240
Jason sings the old ones.

225
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,240
Just got a little taste.

226
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,240
The parade is very dependent, I feel,

227
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,240
on being told what you're watching

228
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,240
because there's another one, the Rockettes.

229
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,240
You need the narration of, and now,

230
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,240
playing a bunch of department store mannequins

231
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,240
who have come to life.

232
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,620
Here are the Rockettes,

233
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,620
because it's not necessarily clear,

234
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,620
because they're just in like,

235
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,620
sparkle dresses and seo wigs.

236
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,620
If you hadn't been told that information,

237
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,620
you might just think they're being 50 Carol Channings.

238
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,620
Well, that's true.

239
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,620
Well, you are given the knowledge,

240
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,620
like they're doing Marshmallow World.

241
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,620
They're doing their number, Marshmallow World.

242
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,620
Well, let's talk about a big part

243
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,620
of the appeal of this special,

244
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
and it's really the tell of any big variety special

245
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
that you find on YouTube,

246
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
like where you can tell,

247
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
will this be interesting or not,

248
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
is the big crazy list of names that you get

249
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
who is going to appear in this special,

250
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
and this one does not let you down

251
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
because the big crazy list is courtesy

252
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
of Saturday Night Live's own Don Pardo.

253
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Christina Aguilera, Lou Vega,

254
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,380
Cool and the Gang,

255
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,380
Shadayzee,

256
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,380
Big Bad Woodoo Daddy,

257
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,380
Rockefeller,

258
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,380
Giant Perix of Balloons,

259
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,380
including Hawthorne,

260
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,380
Full Winkle and Rocky,

261
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,380
Garfield,

262
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:14,380
and the debut of Millennium Snoopy,

263
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,380
Blue from Blue's Clues,

264
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,380
Honey Nut Cheerios B.

265
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,380
That's my favorite one.

266
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,380
And a little game to do in your head

267
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,380
is just like, combine what you just heard

268
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,760
with the typical setting of Don Pardo,

269
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,760
just to make it,

270
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,760
and your host,

271
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,760
Honey Nut Cheerios B.

272
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,760
He says it really,

273
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,760
like I clocked that.

274
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,760
I was like, he says that straight.

275
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,760
Like there's something weird.

276
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,760
I mean, Millennium Snoopy,

277
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,760
they talk a lot about Millennium Snoopy too,

278
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,760
but then Honey Nut Cheerios B

279
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,760
following that up with something else.

280
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,760
It's recently been discussed on the show.

281
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,760
I brought up that Nellie clip

282
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,760
that I like all the commercial

283
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,760
that he shares with Nellie,

284
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,140
and I said with a lot of confidence

285
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,140
that that is Buzz,

286
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,140
the Honey Nut Cheerios B,

287
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,140
but what the parade reveals

288
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:07,140
is that they were on the way to naming him.

289
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,140
He was just the Honey Nut Cheerios B

290
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,140
at this time,

291
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,140
and then they opened it up to the audience,

292
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,140
a la Club 3,

293
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,140
and clearly the nation's children

294
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,140
picked Buzz as his name,

295
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,140
a great name that's stuck in it,

296
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,140
we all know.

297
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,140
It's Buzz B maybe,

298
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,140
with one word.

299
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,140
Oh.

300
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,520
That's what I read.

301
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,520
Wait, really?

302
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,520
His name is,

303
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,520
wait, his name is not Buzz,

304
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,520
it's Buzz B?

305
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,520
I will double check,

306
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,520
but I think when I looked up

307
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,520
Honey Nut Cheerios B,

308
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,520
I think it says Buzz B.

309
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,520
But like,

310
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,520
spelled like Buzz B Berkeley

311
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,520
or Buzz B

312
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,520
as one big...

313
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,520
Oh man, you know,

314
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,520
I'm seeing it both,

315
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,520
I'm seeing here it says Buzz B

316
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,520
like it's a first and last name,

317
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,520
but I did see it written

318
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,520
one word Buzz B in the same way.

319
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,520
Well.

320
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,520
That's gonna be a whole episode.

321
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,520
Mm-hmm, well,

322
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,520
we'll find out.

323
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,520
I'm gonna go ahead and go ahead

324
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,520
and go ahead and go ahead

325
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,520
and go ahead

326
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,520
and go ahead

327
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,520
and go ahead

328
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,520
and go ahead

329
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,940
Yeah, well...

330
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,940
We will have plenty of time

331
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,940
to get down to that

332
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,940
on the full Buzz.

333
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:58,940
Yeah, Buzz B here.

334
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,940
Sorry.

335
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,940
Oh, I'm so sorry,

336
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,940
Wikipedia does say Buzz B

337
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:02,940
one word.

338
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,940
Really?

339
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,940
Yeah.

340
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,940
Geez.

341
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,940
Well, I apologize for my misinformation.

342
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,940
Well, we don't know

343
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:08,940
because it says,

344
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:09,940
now this fictional character

345
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,940
wiki says Buzz the

346
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:11,940
Honey Nut Cheerios B.

347
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,940
Hmm.

348
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,940
So I guess Buzz is

349
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,940
a nickname for Buzz B.

350
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:15,940
The gift,

351
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,980
I mean the gift certificate,

352
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,980
the birth certificate says,

353
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,800
if you got him a gift certificate,

354
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,460
it would have to say Buzz B

355
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,460
for it to work.

356
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,460
Show us the birth certificate.

357
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,460
Come on, you got nothing to hide.

358
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,460
Oh yeah, well the contest in 2000,

359
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,460
Christine Tong, a fifth grade student

360
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,460
from Coolidge, Texas,

361
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,460
won the contest naming him Buzz B.

362
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,460
Yeah, one word.

363
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,460
Interesting.

364
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,460
But then this very paragraph

365
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,460
calls him Buzz as well.

366
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,460
Maybe they just started finding it clunky.

367
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,460
Yeah.

368
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,460
But now we're going against

369
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,460
Christine Tong's wishes.

370
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,460
So I think we've really gotten away

371
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,460
from Christine Tong's vision

372
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,460
as part of the contest.

373
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,460
Yeah.

374
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,460
So we're going to move on to

375
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,460
the next question.

376
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,460
So, we're going to move on to

377
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,460
the next question.

378
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,460
So, we're going to move on to

379
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,460
the next question.

380
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,460
So, we're going to move on to

381
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,460
the next question.

382
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,460
We're getting away from Christine

383
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,460
Tong's vision as presented in this poll.

384
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,460
Well, there was a contest and there

385
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,460
was a contract drawn up.

386
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,460
And yeah, I think they should abide

387
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,460
by whatever she said.

388
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,460
And if it was a one word,

389
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,460
Buzz B, and not Buzz B,

390
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,460
unless it's Buzz B B,

391
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,460
because then you could shorten it

392
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,460
to just Buzz.

393
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,460
Like what you're saying is not

394
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,460
incorrect when you call him Buzz.

395
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,460
I think they inserted,

396
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,460
I think they added a space,

397
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,460
a space that Christine Tong

398
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,460
did not intend.

399
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,460
And I just know,

400
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,460
I hope Christine, I hope you're out there

401
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,460
and you're thriving, even though this

402
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,460
company did you dirty.

403
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,460
I would be furious.

404
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,460
They should sue.

405
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,460
Do you?

406
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,460
What did she get?

407
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,460
Does she get like Honey Nut Cheerios

408
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,460
for free forever?

409
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,460
That I don't know.

410
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,460
I have no further details about this.

411
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,460
Well, again, episode coming soon.

412
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,460
We'll find her and ask her.

413
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,460
To me, that mention of the contest,

414
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,460
the naming, that felt like a piece

415
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,460
of a thing that corporations would do

416
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,460
in the 90s in terms of being

417
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,460
civic minded or in the name of edutainment

418
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:53,460
of like select the new M&Ms color,

419
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,460
do the Pepsi challenge.

420
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:59,460
And I did both these things in school.

421
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,460
I think teachers were just like,

422
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,460
oh great, I can coast for an hour.

423
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,460
We're all going to taste sodas blind,

424
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,460
you know?

425
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,460
You tasted sodas blind in elementary school?

426
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,460
No, the teacher poured it in three cups

427
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,460
and it's like one, two, three.

428
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,460
And everyone's like, and you had to try

429
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,460
and identify it.

430
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,460
I was like, I think this is Pepsi.

431
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,460
And it was actually RC Cola

432
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:24,460
because Pepsi and RC Cola are very similar.

433
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,460
Did you do this instead of like gym?

434
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:30,460
It was like eight up, you know, a period.

435
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:34,460
I think my teacher in like fourth grade was very,

436
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,460
she had been a scientist.

437
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,460
She was very science minded.

438
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:40,460
She found ways to do a lot of lessons

439
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:43,460
into experiments or like into like

440
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,460
with the chemical makeup of soda and flavors

441
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,460
and that sort of thing.

442
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:50,460
You were like a guinea pig in her sick soda experiment.

443
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,460
Yeah.

444
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:54,460
You were like a gerbil running through a maze

445
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:57,460
trying to solve some sort of soda thing

446
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,460
she was trying to crack.

447
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:01,460
And by the way, loving every minute of it.

448
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,460
Well, I mean, the best was when,

449
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,460
we had a really cool student teacher that year

450
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,460
whose parents owned an ice cream parlor.

451
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:12,460
So we got in groups and designed ice cream flavors.

452
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:16,460
And then eventually they churned the flavor

453
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,460
that my group won.

454
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,460
We won.

455
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,460
You invented an ice cream flavor

456
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,460
when you were around Christine Tong's age.

457
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,460
That's right. Yeah.

458
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,460
Did you go to Willy Wonka Elementary?

459
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,460
I mean, it was certainly, it was a fun year.

460
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,460
What was the flavor?

461
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,460
It was called fudge caramel cream

462
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,460
and it was fudge and caramel.

463
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,460
And it wasn't really cream.

464
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,460
It was marshmallows.

465
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,460
How do I not know you invented an ice cream

466
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,460
up until right now?

467
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,460
I, yeah, it was delicious.

468
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:46,460
It's a real sugar blast of a combination.

469
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,460
Wow. Can you make it still? Do you remember?

470
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,460
Oh, no.

471
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,460
I mean, we made it in class the old fashioned way

472
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,460
where you combined like cream and salt and ice

473
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,460
and you like mash it.

474
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,460
So we all made like shitty versions of it.

475
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:01,460
And then they churned a couple of buckets

476
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,460
of like the real deal.

477
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,460
I love this.

478
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:07,460
So you had like a teacher that was like a sugar mad scientist.

479
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,460
Yeah. I mean, they, they,

480
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:12,460
I think part of student teaching is you have to design a chapter

481
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,460
or unit and teach something.

482
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,460
And she just grew up around this and it was so unique.

483
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,460
And the science, that science minded teacher was just like,

484
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,460
well, it's great.

485
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,460
It's like science experiments.

486
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:26,460
Well, I think Jason, the student teacher slash podcast host

487
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:30,460
needs to find the, the existing ice cream

488
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:34,460
that is the closest to your own invention fudge caramel cream.

489
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:38,460
Give that, give that out to the audience as a little assignment.

490
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,460
Yeah.

491
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,460
The answer is a fish food.

492
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,460
Whoa.

493
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,460
You invented fish food.

494
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,460
It's very close.

495
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,460
I think the fish food uses a chocolate ice cream base,

496
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,460
not a vanilla ice cream base.

497
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:52,460
And that's after you invented it in elementary school.

498
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,460
Basically.

499
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,460
That came out later.

500
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,460
Yeah. Yeah.

501
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,460
So you invented it.

502
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,460
Essentially. Yeah.

503
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:01,460
Do you have, do you harbor any ill will for its fish?

504
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,460
No, I love, I love fish food.

505
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,460
I love that.

506
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,460
It's like my favorite ice cream.

507
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,460
You, you were, yeah, you were, it was like an open source recipe.

508
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:14,460
You know, it was not copywritten because you wanted to share it.

509
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,460
You're not like greedy Pfizer and Moderna with their vaccine technology.

510
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:21,460
You were wanting this to be spread everywhere so that everyone could have

511
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,460
fair access to it.

512
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,460
No, I'm like Jimmy Wales.

513
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,460
I'm like the Wikipedia guy.

514
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,460
It's an open source of knowledge of labor.

515
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:32,460
You know, I appreciate, well, that the world appreciates you and you're

516
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,460
giving it, you're giving spirit.

517
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,460
Well, and then I think what we owe the next time,

518
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,460
we don't really do introductions as much on club three,

519
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:42,460
but I feel like the next episode we should say, and there's Mike Carlson and

520
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,460
the inventor of fish food.

521
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,460
I'll take credit.

522
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,460
That's what I'm from now on.

523
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,460
We all just call.

524
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,460
I mean, look, Mike invented the mighty Akron, you know,

525
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,460
look, it's taking the nation by storm.

526
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,460
That's right.

527
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,460
I received the national daddy award.

528
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,460
We all have to grab what we can in this world,

529
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,460
whether it be at a fictional award or a,

530
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,460
an ice cream that you, nobody knows you invented.

531
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,460
That's right.

532
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,460
Even yourself until right now.

533
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,460
When I was nine.

534
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,460
Yeah.

535
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,460
Back to the parade a little bit.

536
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:19,460
Well, pretty much, which incidentally this year,

537
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:23,460
of the parade, won an Emmy.

538
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,460
We're describing an Emmy winning broadcast.

539
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,460
So this, this is high quality.

540
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,460
It won.

541
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:36,460
I want to say maybe the first ever Emmy for outstanding special class special,

542
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,460
which is a great category if redundant.

543
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,460
I guess I like that the word special is in it twice.

544
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:48,460
And to this day, this is a category at the daytime Emmys that seems to exist

545
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:52,460
largely to give awards to the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade.

546
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,460
It doesn't always win.

547
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,460
It has stiff competition.

548
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:58,460
Listen, here's how, here's how I went from 2004.

549
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,460
To 2009.

550
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:03,460
It doesn't, it's, it's either a fun parade or something upsetting.

551
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:09,460
So 2004 Macy's parade wins 2005, 9 11 Memorial from ground zero.

552
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:13,460
2006 Walt Disney World Christmas Day parade.

553
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:18,460
2007 a question of life or meth, a special on A&E.

554
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:23,460
2008 America's invisible children, the homeless education crisis in America.

555
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:27,460
And then 2009 the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade.

556
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,460
The tones are a little different.

557
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:32,460
Funnest award or the saddest award.

558
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,460
Gosh, that's wild.

559
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,460
I used to love the daytime Emmys as a kid, cause that would be the cartoons.

560
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,460
Oh, and maybe where like a cartoon voice wins.

561
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,460
So I would be excited about those.

562
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:46,460
My mom would be excited cause she would want to see if Susan Lucci was going to win.

563
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:49,460
Oh, which, and this is the year, this is big content.

564
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:53,460
One of the big celebrities in it this year is Susan Lucci.

565
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,460
And wait, the whole history here.

566
00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:02,460
She on all my children as Erica Kane, of course, never won until, yeah, eventually did.

567
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,460
But it was this year that she, cause they refer to it a couple of times.

568
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,460
This is the one where it broke.

569
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:11,460
The fever broke and she finally got her due.

570
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,460
Right.

571
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,460
The year to be Susan Lucci for sure.

572
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:20,460
I probably never saw more than five minutes of her on all my children, but that was definitely an annoying fact.

573
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,460
At 14, I internalized.

574
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:25,460
Well, you know, Susan Lucci was nominated 18, 19 times.

575
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:30,460
She finally won a daytime Emmy, like just like annoying preteen.

576
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,460
Tell you, I knew that.

577
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,460
And I would say that I would repeat that fact.

578
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:38,460
Just got to do ever repeat that fact when you were a child.

579
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:44,460
I mean, it's it sounds like young me to say award based stats unprompted.

580
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:51,460
I mean, about a show you don't watch a show you don't watch or like, I have no, I have no clue what Erica Kane is.

581
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,460
I think she's bad.

582
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,460
Right. Or was more bad than not.

583
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:58,460
I think they go back and forth on how bad she is.

584
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,460
She's you know, many years you have to do a lot like comic books.

585
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:04,460
Sometimes the character turns a little bit better or worse.

586
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:08,460
The other thing in this parade they point out, it's like Susan Lucci is here.

587
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:12,460
She's taking over for Bernadette Peters and Annie, get your gun.

588
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:17,460
And that is not a position I would want to be like.

589
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:23,460
Like I feel like Bernadette Peters Broadway royalty at like whoever's following that.

590
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,460
That is a hard road to hoe.

591
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,460
You know, yeah.

592
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:31,460
The thing about Susan Lucci, I've heard a rumor she lives at the Americana.

593
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,460
What? Really?

594
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,460
That's what I've heard. Yes.

595
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,460
I shouldn't say I guess I shouldn't say that.

596
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,460
I don't know where I heard. I honestly don't know where I heard it either.

597
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,460
But and I don't know if it's true.

598
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,460
I looked it up on Twitter and all I found was in 2010 a bunch of people spotting her there.

599
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,460
So I don't know that she might have just been there.

600
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,460
It's possible she was on different dates.

601
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,460
But somebody told me this and I don't remember who it was.

602
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,460
So I'm sharing that with the Club 3 listeners.

603
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,460
All of America's favorite stars live at the Americana.

604
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,460
That's what I, yeah exactly.

605
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:02,460
What else? Oh, oh, just in terms of like broader statements about this parade,

606
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:05,460
Shane who suggested it in doing a little bit of campaigning brought up a good thing

607
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,460
because there's the question of like we're going to end the year in December.

608
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,460
We're going to do a Thanksgiving parade.

609
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:15,460
And Shane pointed out, well, well, well, really what you have hanging over this is Y2K.

610
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,460
That's what broadens it out.

611
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,460
This is this is big pre-millennium entertainment.

612
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,460
And this is coming out right before the new year.

613
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,460
And I'm like, I buy it. Sure. Absolutely.

614
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:32,460
What with Millennium Snoopy and it having kind of like Y2K ephemera all around.

615
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:36,460
It really it is the Y2K Thanksgiving parade.

616
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,460
I think that runs throughout. Yes.

617
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:41,460
I don't know that I saw this, but it felt like I've seen this.

618
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:45,460
And I remember feeling the ticking clock.

619
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:52,460
And I we've talked about this before and we've been yelled at by people who say it was a big deal as far as Y2K is concerned.

620
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:56,460
But I do remember feeling like the world was going to maybe end.

621
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,460
No, that informed a lot around that time.

622
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:02,460
The writing of like, yeah, do we do we have a month left right now?

623
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:09,460
So there's a for any for listeners who weren't there, this this bro we we thought we were seeing our last kick line.

624
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:16,460
Yes, that that was yeah, we were really like cherishing that because, yeah, we may never see we may never see people in fruit costumes again.

625
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:20,460
Yeah, I mean, a walking orange slice.

626
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,460
The Millennium and the parade is very positive.

627
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,460
It's like it's common. It's going to be a ball.

628
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:30,460
It's going to be a blast. Very Epcot Millennium celebration.

629
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,460
So Disney Epcot.

630
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:37,460
There's for sure some big Marionettes at some point, like in the Epcot parade.

631
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:42,460
You get you get like three decades worth of types of entertainment from theme parks in this.

632
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:49,460
Some of the things start and the music reminds me of like a late 70s Disney World parade with the music.

633
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:54,460
And like there's a real like Sandy Duncan woman in the front.

634
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:58,460
And then some of it's like 90s trying to be hip.

635
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:04,460
Like, I feel like there's there's so many different styles of lame happening in this parade.

636
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:15,460
Yeah, included. Yes, the kind that only existed in that little sliver, which was for some reason the Millennium had to involve big abstract puppet creature.

637
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:20,460
The first thing was so that happens in this parade, I guess, other than the hosts being introduced.

638
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:29,460
But like the first thing I got so confused because they said now America Sings performs the song headed for the future.

639
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:34,460
And I was like, what is this terrible song that I don't think I've ever heard of?

640
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:38,460
And I did some digging and then I was like, oh, this is from this song is from the 80s.

641
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:42,460
You know what I'm talking about? I know I do. I don't know the entomology of this.

642
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:49,460
America Sings was fascinating. It's just there's a few of these in the parade where it's just like, and here's the group and it's called America Sings.

643
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:55,460
Same name as the attraction and then cut to five hundred people.

644
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:59,460
Yes, with it, with maybe like three different varieties of shirts.

645
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:04,460
Yes, sweatshirts. Like how did this get together? Does this group still exist?

646
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:08,460
How do you coordinate a group with 500 people? It's so confusing.

647
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,460
And immediately some things if they start doing this song and I'm like, this this song is bad.

648
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:16,460
It's a bad song. And it's coming from me who likes a lot of bad songs.

649
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:19,460
But I'm just like, this is sort of like there's not it's not very catchy.

650
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:25,460
It sounds kind of like a prince kind of rip off as far as like the percussion and like there's that metallic like quality to it.

651
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:28,460
And so I go, what is this song? And I started digging.

652
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:35,460
I didn't have to dig too far into a lot of work, but I found out that this is and I will play it because we may as well.

653
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:39,460
This is not an original song by America Sings.

654
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,460
This is things didn't write it.

655
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:49,460
No, this is a 1986 song by Neil Diamond called Headed for the Future.

656
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:05,460
I didn't know he got so simply. Oh, yeah. Yeah, you had to.

657
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,460
What choice did you have?

658
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:13,460
Music video is on. It's very dramatic. We haven't even seen Neil's face yet.

659
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:17,460
It's all silhouette. Whoa, there he is.

660
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:22,460
And that's it feels like a very like limp rip off of Prince.

661
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:27,460
And then that part sounds like, hey, look me over. Tell me, do you like what you see?

662
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:31,460
Yes, it's it's lame computer.

663
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:42,460
I mean, it's a great video. We'll post the link to it.

664
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:51,460
Yeah, so like I'm ashamed that you're showing me a Neil Diamond flaccid attempt at synth rock, and I've never been aware of it.

665
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:56,460
I was I'm actually I'm shocked because I assumed you just knew exactly what this was.

666
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:01,460
I just assumed you would know it because it's like, yeah, there's a video was very 80s.

667
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:05,460
It's like Captain EO with like way less of a budget and a warehouse.

668
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:11,460
And then there's machines that are like this is an 80s depiction of the future, but it feels like 60s computer machines.

669
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:19,460
Yeah. And it's like it's like kind of that starlight, a cheap starlight express aesthetic we talked about in 1999.

670
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:28,460
They decided that a bunch of like sweatshirt wearing dancers were going to do a Neil Diamond song no one ever heard of called Headed for the Future.

671
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:31,460
Yeah, we're starting off hot here.

672
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:38,460
I'm excited immediately. My note for this was kids do not head for that future.

673
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:42,460
Whatever you do, you don't know what's coming.

674
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,460
Neil Diamond's future. Yeah, Neil Diamond's future.

675
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:51,460
And I it's kind of intercutting between him and like a beat up leather jacket and then a sequin coat.

676
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:56,460
Like he just had it. That's just a safety blanket for him. A little Vegas panache.

677
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:00,460
The credits of this of the album, which is also called Headed for the Future.

678
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:08,460
I'm seeing every name that I like. David Foster, Burt Bacharach, Greg Philling Gaines, Stevie Wonder, Bobby Caldwell.

679
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,460
It's like this is Stem-Arise White.

680
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:13,460
You want to cancel the episode just listening to this album.

681
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:16,460
Yeah, I need to get on this because I got work to do.

682
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:21,460
Nobody minds if I drop out. Yeah, no, I know I hated the song that was just played from it.

683
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:24,460
But maybe there's a jam.

684
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:30,460
They're very welcome. Yeah. Well, you know, my boy Bobby Caldwell, he knows about gems.

685
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:34,460
So I will I will explore on my own time.

686
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:39,460
Well, look, yeah, right off the bat. But you but you missed something.

687
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:46,460
I mean, this parade starts as many did for a long time with the introduction of your host, Matt Lauer.

688
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:50,460
Of course. There's no special that you're going to watch from this era

689
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:55,460
where you don't run into a me too pretty quick. Oh, yeah.

690
00:30:55,460 --> 00:31:08,460
Matt Lauer is one I have read like he's so thoroughly because he shows that you almost have to show Matt Lauer if you're addressing this time because 90s, 2000s to 2010s.

691
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:19,460
He's like always in everything like in order to just like say the basic of what a big story was, be it like Clinton scandal or even, you know, Woodstock 99.

692
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:25,460
He's just in so many every documentary has to show him or Charlie Rose at some point. Yes.

693
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:28,460
Matt Lauer taints everything is what what I'm saying.

694
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:37,460
He's also I don't know if I just because of all the stuff, but he is annoying in this just a dud, just a totally charmless man.

695
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:42,460
Yeah, you sense his like combativeness with Katie Couric.

696
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,460
And I don't know if you're just if I'm just like, that's what I'm wondering.

697
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:51,460
I'm just putting that on it at this point. But there are little like jabs and she reads something wrong and he kind of like gives her the business.

698
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:57,460
Yeah, it seems a little angrier than obviously like there was the those anchors that just were revealed to be having an affair.

699
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:01,460
But like that all that all was like you could tell like they liked each other for real.

700
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,460
This one, it feels like maybe they didn't like each other.

701
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:11,460
But maybe I'm maybe I'm just adding that layer on. They possibly never, never got along.

702
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:26,460
The other the other interesting thing with Matt Lauer too is that while he taints all of this old footage and nice parades like this, there's nobody who's less around than him of the me to bring like he hasn't like done his comeback attempt.

703
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:31,460
Although then I was Googling this issue like to prep for this and like, oh, I see.

704
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,460
He's trying. He wants to.

705
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:39,460
So we might be there might be some disgusting Matt Lauer come back on the horizon.

706
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:46,460
But I've really enjoyed that for the last few years that there's not some Louie esque like, oh, let me have to hear about some fucking crap he's doing.

707
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:49,460
And somebody's making a point of like, I'm going to have Louie.

708
00:32:49,460 --> 00:33:02,460
You know what? I'm going to have Louie on the I'm I will let Matt Lauer host my I mean, you know, it's only a matter of time in in Elon's world before Matt Lauer rears his boring head.

709
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:16,460
But Elon is going to put Matt Lauer in charge of SpaceX because he's for free speech, which like and then like 20,000 bros are like, hell yeah, finally.

710
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:19,460
Good idea. My pronouns are Matt slash Lauer.

711
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:25,460
And then everyone else just watches the footage of all the spaceships exploding and focuses on that.

712
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:32,460
Everyone else is like, I have to go to work. I have bills to pay. I have things to do.

713
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:38,460
OK, life cannot revolve around this man. I this charm black hole.

714
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:42,460
Why is your version of free speech just calling people pedophiles?

715
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:46,460
Like, I don't understand. This isn't like government class at all.

716
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:55,460
He saw he saw that everybody only talk about Trump every day for six years and he wanted a piece of he wanted it and he got his wish.

717
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:58,460
And now we're doing in character. We are doing it.

718
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,460
We're feeding right into it.

719
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:06,460
We should. We are. We're talking about Elon Musk when we should be talking about Millennium Snoopy.

720
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,460
Elon Musk doesn't have a cool hat like that.

721
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,460
A cool jester's hat.

722
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:18,460
Millennium Snoopy shows up a lot in the I think the only person who shows up more is Al Roker, who is just he's doing it.

723
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:23,460
He had his thing figured out in ninety nine and he's just never stopped doing it.

724
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,460
Always liked Al Roker. Always happy to see him.

725
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:34,460
You know, Al Roker is like kind of a regis like figure to me because it's like he's always himself when he's broadcasting

726
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:44,460
and he's a very dependable presence on whether it's a parade, whether it's news, whether whatever it is, the universal tram tour or that.

727
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:50,460
Yeah. What else do we I mean, like, look, Mike, you have your you have your priorities.

728
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:55,460
I certainly do. You should lead us through your big ticket items.

729
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:59,460
I'll try to like Lewis Black. I'll catch what falls through the cracks.

730
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:07,460
Thank you. OK, great. Perfect. I always look Jason's the last Jedi host and you're the Lewis Black host of podcast the ride.

731
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:10,460
So we mix in metaphors, but sure. Yeah.

732
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:13,460
Yeah. OK, so I have a big list here.

733
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:23,460
First of all, I just shout out to a woman I didn't know, Jean McFadden, the woman who is in charge of this parade for many years, who seems like a very interesting character.

734
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:27,460
And again, if we do more parade stuff, which I'm sure we will, I would love to look into her.

735
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:34,460
She passed away a couple of years ago, but she's like a Texas lady who was in charge of like the heyday of the Macy's Day parade.

736
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:41,460
And she marches and she announces at the start of this when she's talking to Al Roker that they have let me find it.

737
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:45,460
They have 800 clowns in the parade.

738
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:53,460
And I believe unless I miss heard at a certain point, there's a stat that said in the history of the parade, over 50,000 clowns have marched.

739
00:35:53,460 --> 00:36:00,460
So there's so many clowns that have marched in this.

740
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:11,460
I believe it's like they use a cute little like phrase like the longest running show on Broadway is the Macy's Day parade because it was started in the 20s and it's continued.

741
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:17,460
But yes, so she gives some clown stats right away that I think are fantastic.

742
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,460
And there are a lot of clowns when you're watching this.

743
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:29,460
There are all of a sudden you'll just see shots of clowns in like Batman Returns as if some evil clown gang has infiltrated the Macy's parade.

744
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,460
But they're good clowns.

745
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:33,460
They're not the bad clowns from Batman Returns.

746
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,460
Well, some are medical figures.

747
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:41,460
I wrote the one that I wrote down is the they cut some point it cuts to the funny bone medical team.

748
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:47,460
And then there's a clown doctor who's driving a John Deere around.

749
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:51,460
I was kind of confused by the premise of the funny bone medical team.

750
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:54,460
Yeah, I don't know that they thought it out so much.

751
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,460
I don't know.

752
00:36:55,460 --> 00:37:05,460
So thought out my clown phrase that struck me was Chloe is the guardian spirit of the clowns and the clowns, of course, are the spirit of this parade.

753
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,460
Guardian clown.

754
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:14,460
That's a sentence that a lot of people heard and no one had meant nothing to anyone.

755
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,460
Millions heard this sentence.

756
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,460
It literally not a single person.

757
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,460
It went stuck.

758
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,460
Not a single person did it move them.

759
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,460
Did it make them upset?

760
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,460
It was completely no.

761
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:28,460
People are in the other room fighting about like, well, should I put the marshmallows on the yams or not?

762
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:31,460
Well, Gladys always makes them stink about the marshmallow.

763
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,460
But you know, but it's our thing.

764
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,460
We like to do them.

765
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,460
We're doing them.

766
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,460
I don't care.

767
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:40,460
We'll just do Gladys can deal two dishes, one yams with and one without.

768
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,460
And then everyone's happy.

769
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,460
Fine.

770
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,460
I will make a second.

771
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,460
I will make a second.

772
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:48,460
I will do extra work and I'll make a second.

773
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,460
Oh, wait, hold on.

774
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,460
Cool.

775
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,460
The gang on TV on the jello float.

776
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:56,460
Everybody stop your quarreling.

777
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:00,460
We must all appreciate this as a family.

778
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,460
That what they're on there on the.

779
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:06,460
They're on the jello float in front of a bunch of people dressed as pieces of fruit.

780
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:10,460
Oh, they're kind of they're like the fruit of the loom mass.

781
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,460
Yes.

782
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,460
Who are also.

783
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,460
Oh, that's right.

784
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,460
Yes.

785
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,460
I noted that the fruit is mostly grapes.

786
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,460
It's yes, they do a lot of close ups on the grapes.

787
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:27,460
But then you will get a stray like guy dressed as an orange slice that like wanders in and you can just sort of see his head in the frame.

788
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:33,460
Because obviously these aren't these can't be that precise because this is such a crazy operation to be shooting.

789
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:36,460
You're not going to get precision.

790
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:43,460
You're not going to get perfect framing for all of the different fruits that jello uses all the different flavors of jello.

791
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,460
No, no, no.

792
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,460
It's a jello.

793
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:51,460
Bration and the this is the second performance of celebration in this parade.

794
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:55,460
I guess it's more notable because it's by the real cool and the gang.

795
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,460
Yes.

796
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,460
Although I was like, who who even is this?

797
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,460
I don't know who I'm looking at right now.

798
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,460
And it is cool.

799
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,460
Right.

800
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:06,460
Cool didn't write a lot of the songs and cool did not sing the songs.

801
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,460
Cool is not the singer.

802
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:16,460
So it's not it's whatever singer took over in like 1991, which that's you know, that's that's a concerted amount of time.

803
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,460
Right.

804
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:20,460
But if you want that if you want that original vocal, you're not getting it.

805
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,460
Yeah, it's we've we've talked about that before.

806
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:28,460
We a deep dive on what bands who's in what bands still in the history.

807
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:38,460
I love my Wikipedia band timelines where you end up with so many confusing like the format they figured out for it where it's like all stripes.

808
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,460
Here's red and here's green and here's yellow.

809
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:45,460
But then here's yellow with an orange smaller stripe through the middle.

810
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:52,460
It's it's so confusing but rewarding looking at band band member length timelines.

811
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,460
I'm sure you've spent some time.

812
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,460
I have.

813
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:58,460
I just I just made you explain this to me at one point, I believe, Scott.

814
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:04,460
But Mickey Thomas Starship featuring Mickey Thomas plays at Epcot Center.

815
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,460
Yeah.

816
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,460
This starts with Jefferson Airplane.

817
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,460
And I got so confused the other day.

818
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:13,460
I had to relearn exactly how this goes because I was the most confusing.

819
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,460
I think of all right.

820
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,460
Right.

821
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:26,460
And Mickey Thomas was not an original member of Jefferson Airplane, which then became Jefferson Starship, which then became Starship, which then became Starship featuring Mickey Thomas.

822
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,460
Right.

823
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:30,460
But now Mickey Thomas is no longer associated with Starship.

824
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:33,460
And there's still separately a Jefferson.

825
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:35,460
I think I'm right about this.

826
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:36,460
I think there's there.

827
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:43,460
There's a Jefferson Starship where it's only the keyboard player and the singer is just some writing like it was no association with any.

828
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:46,460
And Grace Slick, though, was the original singer.

829
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:49,460
What did make it to all the different incarnations?

830
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,460
But then stop through Starship.

831
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,460
Right.

832
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,460
Yeah.

833
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:58,460
So this I had to refresh myself because professional wrestler Orange Cassidy uses the song Jane as his entrance music now.

834
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,460
Oh, great.

835
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,460
She did on the Indies.

836
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:06,460
So I was just refreshing myself and making I was like, OK, this is one of the most confusing ones.

837
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,460
Check out.

838
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,460
Find your way back to that one.

839
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,460
That one's very solid.

840
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,460
You haven't heard it.

841
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,460
I don't think I have.

842
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,460
So so cool.

843
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:16,460
Cool will be on the list to deep dive of who's in the.

844
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,460
Yeah.

845
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,460
Learn learn about cool.

846
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,460
But that's jumping around.

847
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:26,460
That's also you know, this parade I should mention features an appearance by REO Speedwagon, not the band.

848
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,460
The wagon.

849
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,460
Yes.

850
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:35,460
That's a fact I didn't know that phrase is based on a wagon that would deliver things in New York City.

851
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:39,460
I didn't know there was a real speed wagon and it's in the parade.

852
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:41,460
I guess I didn't either.

853
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,460
Although now it makes perfect sense.

854
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:46,460
It's the wagon from REO Speedwagon.

855
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:54,460
But I take points away for creativity because that phrase based when you don't know what it means, you're like, whoa, REO Speedwagon.

856
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:56,460
How did they come up with that?

857
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,460
But now we've got to eliminate that creativity.

858
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:03,460
Like that was just a functional code of a real wagon.

859
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,460
Right.

860
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:11,460
At a certain point, there's a kind of hip hop techno remix of a grand old flag.

861
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:14,460
She's a high flying flag.

862
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,460
It's very brief.

863
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,460
Jason's ideal music.

864
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,460
But I was going to say this is perfect.

865
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:19,460
This is what Jason would want.

866
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:25,460
If Jason were to go to a club, he would want to hear this thumb thing through the bass.

867
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:31,460
Yo, the DJ just put on taps in the club.

868
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:34,460
Is this the new is this the Diplo remix?

869
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,460
It's a long way to Tipperary.

870
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:39,460
Yeah.

871
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:44,460
Well, I will use that as a segue for a thing that made me very excited.

872
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:56,460
I think this happened right after the clowns announcement and they went featuring the cast of Fosse, Kiss Me Kate, Saturday Night Fever, Swing and Ragtime.

873
00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:00,460
And I was like, wow, that is an assortment of musicals.

874
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:07,460
I love looking at random just years or months of like, here's what's on Broadway now.

875
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:10,460
And that it's just such an odd mix.

876
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:14,460
I mean, perfect for a swing dance musical.

877
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,460
Perfect for 1999.

878
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:19,460
But like a lot of these I didn't know.

879
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:22,460
I mean, Fosse is made up of a lot of Fosse stuff, I believe.

880
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:29,460
Kiss Me Kate is called Porter Music, which I think I know the instrumentals more than versions with lyrics.

881
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:34,460
There's that Saturday Night Fever is one of the first musicals they have a number from.

882
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:40,460
And boy, boy, they take the fun out of all the amazing BG songs.

883
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:42,460
Yeah, that is that is.

884
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:44,460
Well, boy, that's hard.

885
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:48,460
Like the BG songs, if you've got a good even a bad speaker, you listen to me.

886
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:49,460
These are fucking awesome.

887
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,460
These are produced even though like the hits you've heard a million times.

888
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:55,460
If you really listen to me go, oh, my God, they just sucked.

889
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:58,460
Any fun out of them?

890
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:00,460
Oh, and I like just their color.

891
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:01,460
Their shirts are boring.

892
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:03,460
Everything about it is boring.

893
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:07,460
And I go, I wonder why this show didn't last longer.

894
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:15,460
Yeah, Fosse, Fosse a lot more lively and the number from Kiss Me Kate about putting on.

895
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,460
We're all putting on a show.

896
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:18,460
That's pretty fun.

897
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:22,460
The number from ragtime is a fucking downer.

898
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:23,460
And it's just because it's so.

899
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:26,460
Yeah, that's late in the parade, too, I feel like it is.

900
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:28,460
And it's just like, look at our children.

901
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:30,460
Oh, our children.

902
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:32,460
And I'm like, God, this is bombing me.

903
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:35,460
You all look like you're about to die of consumption.

904
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:38,460
The reality is you probably got all stage at 11 p.m.

905
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:43,460
last night, woke up at the crack of dawn, and then you have to be back at the theater in a few hours.

906
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:45,460
This is one of the biggest downers in the show.

907
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:47,460
The other downer.

908
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,460
And I get that maybe you want to mention it, but maybe you could.

909
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:50,460
You didn't have to say it.

910
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:51,460
And I don't know if you guys know what I'm talking about.

911
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:53,460
No, it bummed me out.

912
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,460
Just they see Millennium Snoopy and they go in.

913
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:57,460
There's Charles M.

914
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:59,460
Schultz, the 50th anniversary of Peanuts.

915
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:02,460
Charles was just diagnosed with colon cancer.

916
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:08,460
And you're like, yeah, oh, they say, can we just say, oh, and we wish they wish him well.

917
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:12,460
But I'm like, oh, God, he did die, I believe, a few months later.

918
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:15,460
I think this was the last hurrah of.

919
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:19,460
But in the context of the cheery parade, I think it was the last hurrah of.

920
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:20,460
The cheery parade.

921
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:23,460
I'm just saying you don't have to say that type of cancer.

922
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,460
Just say we wish him well.

923
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:27,460
He's he's two bummers.

924
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:30,460
Ragtime and then a medical diagnosis.

925
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:34,460
It is a play called Ragtime and it is the least ragtime.

926
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:37,460
So yeah, there's like upbeat numbers in ragtime.

927
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:38,460
Yeah, I don't know.

928
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:45,460
Look, I don't know if there's a Jean McFadden interview where she sort of we could find where she lays out her philosophy that you want a couple

929
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:46,460
of bummers in the show.

930
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:47,460
Maybe there's something there.

931
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:51,460
Maybe that's she had an idea that we can't be all sunshine.

932
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:54,460
She understands a parade set list.

933
00:45:54,460 --> 00:46:05,460
Well, now on the opposite end of things, when I realized that what we had to watch involves the musical swing and a performance from Big Bad Buddha Daddy.

934
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:08,460
I got that was that was a bummer for me.

935
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:10,460
What is swing swings?

936
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:14,460
Now the musical swing and then it cuts to a swing song.

937
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:15,460
But it was a bit of it.

938
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:20,460
Oh, and like then I'm looking at it and there's a big list of swing songs in the description.

939
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:26,460
I can't I can't make heads or tails of what swing is and I don't want to.

940
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:27,460
I don't know either.

941
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:28,460
Jason, do you have any?

942
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:29,460
I don't really.

943
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:31,460
You're the swing guy of the three of us.

944
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:32,460
I know.

945
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:35,460
I certainly like this music at the time.

946
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:50,460
None of these shows were really my shows and I don't know a lot about swing, but it just felt like pretty topical that they got a swing dance musical up and mounted and running on Broadway as the swing revival.

947
00:46:50,460 --> 00:47:03,460
I guess it lasted for a few years, but the Big Bad Buddha Daddy performance is notable because they do is that phrase that phrase like getting a needle right into my brain.

948
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:08,460
The Big Bad Buddha Daddy performance was notable and notable in what we talked about earlier.

949
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:14,460
I where it's like, OK, they're doing the song from the Jungle Book, right?

950
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:15,460
I want to be like you.

951
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:16,460
I want to be like you.

952
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:18,460
And which float are they on?

953
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,460
I don't know.

954
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:22,460
Fucking like diaper wipes.

955
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:24,460
It is talcum powder.

956
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:25,460
Oh, Mr. Peanut.

957
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:27,460
Yeah, they're on the Mr. Peanut.

958
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:30,460
And it is a giant Mr. Peanut.

959
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:31,460
Yeah, yeah.

960
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:33,460
They're bundled up.

961
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:34,460
They're bundled up.

962
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:36,460
They're under Mr. Peanut.

963
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:38,460
And it was a warm day, though.

964
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:40,460
It was warm for that time of year.

965
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:45,460
It was a 60 degree day in New York in November, late November, which is obviously uncommon.

966
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:46,460
But raining.

967
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:50,460
The rain had like finally broke, like as the parade was really starting to move.

968
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:54,460
That's another thing that always lames up the performances of that.

969
00:47:54,460 --> 00:48:02,460
Like to this day, it will be a performer who maybe you know for their sexy outfits and then this on.

970
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:13,460
And it's like a turtleneck all the way up, like the most covered anybody can be saying, Dad, I'm saying is I would like that Big Bad Buddha Daddy if I could have seen them.

971
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:18,460
Seen their trademark like layer assets in their little swing shorts.

972
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:22,460
They can't wear their big fedoras because they blow away.

973
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:25,460
So they've just got their pea coats all the way up to the shin.

974
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:27,460
But God is right.

975
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:29,460
Big Bad Buddha Daddy into his swell.

976
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:30,460
God is right.

977
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:32,460
He went into a power line.

978
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:34,460
He understands the appeal of the Big Bad Buddha Daddy.

979
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:37,460
It is their sex appeal, not the music.

980
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:38,460
That I get.

981
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:45,460
And I look I put what I'm saying is the only performance for me that's notable is one that's on mute so I can just look at them.

982
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:47,460
I've been boss.

983
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:51,460
Those suspenders, those big pants.

984
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:55,460
To snap those.

985
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:56,460
Jason, do you know the name of the guy?

986
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:58,460
Anybody in Big Bad Buddha Daddy?

987
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:00,460
I unfortunately no, I don't know.

988
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:09,460
The only guy I really knew was Brian Setzer because Brian Setzer was a pretty regular Conan musical guest on the late.

989
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:10,460
Oh, yeah.

990
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:13,460
We thought we said exactly this in the Country Bears episode.

991
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:14,460
And that's where it got testy.

992
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:15,460
And must we?

993
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:17,460
Brian Setzer's not in this.

994
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:18,460
We do not need to go into Brian Setzer.

995
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:20,460
We haven't talked about him in a while though.

996
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:21,460
And what?

997
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:22,460
Wrap it up fast.

998
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:25,460
And I well, it was just funny because I never really liked this.

999
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:30,460
I knew it didn't know the Stray Cats, but I knew the Brian Setzer Orchestra of Conan O'Brien.

1000
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:31,460
Okay.

1001
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:32,460
All right.

1002
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:33,460
So moving on.

1003
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:35,460
James Bond's car appears.

1004
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:36,460
Great.

1005
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:37,460
We did it.

1006
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:38,460
We got past it.

1007
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:39,460
James Bond's car.

1008
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:40,460
I mean, that's very exciting.

1009
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:41,460
The world is not enough.

1010
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:45,460
A very interesting Bond movie.

1011
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:47,460
That's the Christmas Jones, right?

1012
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:48,460
Dr. Christmas Jones.

1013
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,460
That's Denise Richards' character.

1014
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:51,460
Yes.

1015
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:52,460
His name Dr. Christmas Jones.

1016
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:53,460
Dr. Christmas Jones.

1017
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:54,460
Yes.

1018
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:55,460
I've never heard this in my life.

1019
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:58,460
She's a nuclear scientist.

1020
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:04,460
And she's dressed like in the shortest pair of like hacky shorts and like a sports bra.

1021
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:05,460
Okay.

1022
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:06,460
All right.

1023
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:09,460
This show, we're getting, everyone's getting worked up on this episode now.

1024
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:11,460
She's talking about nuclear vision.

1025
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:15,460
We're going to have to take a five minute break.

1026
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:17,460
Dr. Christmas Jones.

1027
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:18,460
Yeah, Christmas Jones.

1028
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:20,460
How did they land at that?

1029
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:23,460
Does anyone ever, does James Bond like give a little look when he hears the name?

1030
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:24,460
Oh yeah, he does do it.

1031
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:27,460
I can't remember what the quip is.

1032
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:29,460
Is it Christmas Comes Early?

1033
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:32,460
Oh, it might be.

1034
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:34,460
It's really on the nose.

1035
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:38,460
So they named her Christmas so that they could make a cum joke?

1036
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:41,460
That was the, that's, I mean, look, can you look it up?

1037
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:44,460
We can look it up to see what the quip was.

1038
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:46,460
The World Is Not Enough.

1039
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:50,460
This was followed by the Halle Berry one, the last spruced and what?

1040
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:51,460
Yes.

1041
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:54,460
I, I, the last two aren't as good as the first.

1042
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:56,460
The first two I have a lot of affection for.

1043
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,460
I like Tomorrow Never Dies.

1044
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:00,460
Yeah, I like that one a lot.

1045
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:02,460
Jonathan Price, bad guy.

1046
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:06,460
He has the submarine that shoots a torpedo full of cheats.

1047
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:08,460
Yeah, very good.

1048
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:10,460
He should have been in this parade.

1049
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:12,460
I guess it's a year after it came out.

1050
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:15,460
So I think he's Dr. Halloween Smith.

1051
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:18,460
Let's let's hit one on the list.

1052
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:22,460
Let's talk a little bit about the special performance by the Bacon Brothers.

1053
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:24,460
Oh yeah, the Bacon Brothers.

1054
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:30,460
Thank you, Shane, for assuming we'd be interested in talking Bacon Brothers.

1055
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:34,460
I mean, this is the this is the boring thing I've ever seen.

1056
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:40,460
I will say in the defense of the Bacon Brothers that the Bacon Brothers was never around.

1057
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:46,460
It was I didn't feel like the Bacon Brothers ever jammed themselves down my throat enough to truly bother me.

1058
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:53,460
Like when you compare it to something like Kevin Spacey asserting that he can sing jazz standards,

1059
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:57,460
something that was plugged into any and everything he ever did,

1060
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:05,460
I feel like if you know, Kevin Bacon kept it modest with with his band, the Bacon Brothers.

1061
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:06,460
I think that's right.

1062
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:10,460
I think that there is a lot you heard a lot more about other celebrity bands.

1063
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:13,460
And Kevin Bacon was like, I'm going to set this over on the table.

1064
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:15,460
This is my album. It's going to be over here.

1065
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:17,460
I'm going to leave the room.

1066
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:19,460
If you want to listen to it, go for it. If not, don't worry about it.

1067
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:22,460
See my movies. Don't see my movies. I'm a cool guy.

1068
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:24,460
Don't worry. Yeah.

1069
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:27,460
Yeah. Have fun with my brother. Why not?

1070
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:34,460
They the Bacon Brothers were like it every year, every other year during the summer at the Jersey Shore,

1071
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:36,460
like playing the Ocean City music here.

1072
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:39,460
And they always gave a lot. They always seemed happy to be there.

1073
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:42,460
They always played. Did you go? I never went because I didn't understand.

1074
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:44,460
I didn't know what it was.

1075
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:48,460
How do you know they were happy to be there? Well, Scott, because I read the papers.

1076
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:54,460
And they give a like, well, yet another year, another Bacon Brothers article.

1077
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:56,460
Yeah. I wonder how their mood is.

1078
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:58,460
Oh, happy to be a great. Very good.

1079
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:02,460
I think the thing that I never I didn't realize the brother was like a composer.

1080
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:06,460
Like I didn't realize he was like doing music for TV and movies.

1081
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:08,460
I didn't know that either, actually. Yeah.

1082
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:14,460
Bacon is back. Bacon is back singing because of the Guardians of the Galaxy holiday special.

1083
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:16,460
Spoiler alert. I don't think he wrote the songs.

1084
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:20,460
The old ninety sevens wrote a couple, I believe, original songs for this special.

1085
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:22,460
Yeah, I saw that. I love the old ninety sevens.

1086
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:24,460
And they're a great band. And the songs are good.

1087
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:28,460
And Kevin Bacon sang one on Fallon. So I like it. I like him.

1088
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:35,460
Maybe it's not the greatest song in the world on this parade. OK. But no, it's not.

1089
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:41,460
Because I clearly NBC was not willing to play the greatest song in the world,

1090
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:46,460
which is elsewhere on their the same album called Getting There, their second album,

1091
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:51,460
their song, which is called Arm Wrestling Woman. Oh.

1092
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:19,460
Got to got to got to got to make a man. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1093
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:23,460
I was I was like, how many got tos are there going to be?

1094
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:27,460
It'd be pretty bold if he went for like two minutes with those. Yeah.

1095
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:30,460
I mean, maybe live he embellishes a bit.

1096
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:33,460
It kind of might stretch out. Yeah. If you've seen the Bacon Brothers,

1097
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:39,460
if you went past the newspaper article on like Jason and saw them at the Jersey Shore,

1098
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:42,460
let us know how many gotchas there were in Arm Wrestling Woman.

1099
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:45,460
OK, there you have it. The most specific assignment ever.

1100
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:49,460
Yeah. Arm Wrestling Woman. OK.

1101
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:53,460
So we're landing it. We do. You don't mind the Bacon Brothers.

1102
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:57,460
No, that's true. But yes, I don't know that.

1103
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:00,460
Look, I will do a deep dive on them, honestly. I'll go through some of the albums.

1104
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:05,460
I've gone through a lot of celebrity albums and it's a thing I enjoy.

1105
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:10,460
I want you to rank like Bacon Brothers, Dogstar, 30 foot of grunt.

1106
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:14,460
There's well, but you got to throw in Old Yellow Eyes is back.

1107
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:17,460
Brent Spiner's album, even though they're not the same genre.

1108
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:23,460
And you got to throw in Robert Downey Jr.'s Futurist album from like 2001 or 2002,

1109
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:26,460
which endlessly fascinates me.

1110
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:29,460
I don't know that one. Somehow that one's never come up.

1111
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:33,460
Is that standards? Did he beat? No, that is no, no, no.

1112
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:38,460
That is an aggr-like that is a I don't even I don't even want to like I'm goof on it or whatever.

1113
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:42,460
That is a completely earnest attempt to do something interesting.

1114
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:45,460
And it's a very strange list. I find it very strange.

1115
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:49,460
Listen, I guess I can kind of appreciate it that it's like it's attempting.

1116
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:54,460
It's really a huge swing at like making interesting, weird music.

1117
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:58,460
But I don't know that I enjoy it.

1118
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:00,460
You don't you just don't want to.

1119
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:03,460
I appreciate your respect for the man that you don't want to do little.

1120
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,460
I respect him down a little. Yes.

1121
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:08,460
You're on this this Patreon within a Patreon. Yeah, I don't know.

1122
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:12,460
I still think if you're going to listen to it and I think you might know why I'm like,

1123
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:17,460
like I'm really actually not even trying to be like, oh, I'm trying to be polite or anything.

1124
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:21,460
It's just truly it's kind of a confusing. Listen, that's really what I'm getting at.

1125
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:23,460
Because it's not like I truly never know.

1126
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:32,460
It's not like it's not like some country like boring three chord country rock or something like it's not that it's something it's different.

1127
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:35,460
And it's confused. A little confusing. Anyway, we'll do it.

1128
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:40,460
We'll do an episode. Twenty twenty three. The futurist.

1129
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:44,460
All right. She Daisy performs.

1130
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:49,460
She Daisy, not the Dixie before the Dixie chicks or the chicks as they're known now.

1131
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:55,460
I don't know anything about them. And that's where it stops as far as I'm concerned.

1132
00:56:55,460 --> 00:57:04,460
Fergie's first band or like first sort of hit band is here. Wild Orchid. Wild Orchid, which was really exciting to see.

1133
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:10,460
Well, they are they're backed up by a bunch of snowflake covered towels.

1134
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:14,460
That's my description of who's dancing with them.

1135
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:27,460
I look there's not a ton here really, but you are getting the beginning seeds of the Fergie like too much like the Fergie insanity.

1136
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:33,460
You're describing you're calling you're describing something that could be said to be Fergalicious.

1137
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:37,460
The beginning of Fergalicious. It's a little bit.

1138
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:40,460
It's a little bit. It's like 30 percent Fergalicious.

1139
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:45,460
But, you know, it's awaiting her in the new millennium, reaching peak Fergalicious.

1140
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:51,460
Yes. I mean, I went down the rabbit hole then of like the other the the performance.

1141
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:54,460
She's performing Fergalicious on some award show.

1142
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:58,460
And she just like it's the biggest fail of a rap you've ever heard.

1143
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:03,460
She tries to launch and then just kind of like sputters and scrapes the ground.

1144
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:07,460
It's incredible. And the Star Spangled Banner she did Fergie's.

1145
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:10,460
Oh, yeah. She's left quite the body of work.

1146
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:13,460
Yeah. Christina Aguilera is in the show.

1147
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:20,460
And I'm pretty sure Don Pardo accidentally calls her Christina Aguilera at one point.

1148
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:22,460
But he got it right the other time.

1149
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:25,460
So look, it's a lot of names to remember.

1150
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:30,460
Most importantly, she is on the M&M's float with a debut in Green M&M.

1151
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:36,460
You want to see a giant statue of Red M&M in like a director's chair.

1152
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:40,460
And she is doing her hit song What a Girl Wants.

1153
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:44,460
Right. So Green M&M is like a lady M&M.

1154
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:50,460
And I think the idea was she's singing about herself and the Green M&M.

1155
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:54,460
What is the Green M&M wants? What a Green M&M girl wants.

1156
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:56,460
Essentially, I think that was the thought.

1157
00:58:56,460 --> 00:59:01,460
She's been the subject of controversy recently with the replacement of the shoes.

1158
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:05,460
She wore sexy go-go boots.

1159
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:10,460
And this has been eliminated in a very important decision recently.

1160
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:14,460
And I understand because I'm watching this footage.

1161
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:22,460
I mean, like, hey, my juices got flowing looking at Green M&M tilting around slightly.

1162
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:24,460
That happened. Look, that happens a lot.

1163
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:29,460
And like recently, there's been some sort of Tucker Carlson sexual scare about M&M's.

1164
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:31,460
And I can't remember what it was.

1165
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:35,460
But look, everybody has a thing for M&M's. Let's be honest.

1166
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:43,460
Deep down, we all we all have our favorite as far as flavor, color.

1167
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:50,460
I mean, personally, if I'm going to share, it's probably like I like to think of like a sexy blue peanut butter M&M.

1168
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:53,460
That's sort of my favorite. That's your dream.

1169
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:58,460
That's if you got a hall pass for for an M&M's specifically. Yeah.

1170
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:03,460
It would be for peanut blue, specifically peanut peanut butter, excuse me, peanut butter blue.

1171
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:07,460
OK, because I'm that's my favorite M&M is peanut butter.

1172
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:10,460
Was that a character in the line? No, no, it wasn't.

1173
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:14,460
I made her up. OK, you made a head. I invented I invented her.

1174
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:17,460
I invented peanut butter blue.

1175
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:21,460
You did not. But you did not invent melts in your mouth, not in your hand.

1176
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:25,460
No, I did not invent that. That's just that's just a fact.

1177
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:27,460
Yeah, it is a fact.

1178
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:32,460
Jason, if you created your own M&M, your ultimate M&M wife.

1179
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:41,460
Oh, well, I think it would be I used to really like the crispy M&M's,

1180
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:47,460
which they did bring back, but they brought it back in the wrong color packaging than I remembered.

1181
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:50,460
No, but which one do you want to kiss? Yeah.

1182
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:59,460
Well, I was I loved as it's like a preteen, like drinking a tube of M&M's minis.

1183
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:07,460
So I always like that they were like drinking, drinking, drinking, drinking a tube of M&M's.

1184
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:11,460
Because it would it could make a mess if you dumped it in your hand.

1185
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:14,460
So it's just easier to drink it out of the tube.

1186
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:19,460
You call it drinking, though? Well, Scott, when you don't chew, it's called drinking.

1187
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:22,460
I mean, you chew, but it's just like you're I don't know.

1188
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:27,460
And I like that they were like, what would you say, like a parasitic organism?

1189
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:35,460
Like dozens and dozens of them would form objects or hands or you want kind of like a poly thing with a 50 mini M&M's.

1190
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:40,460
Yeah, I want to. Yeah, mine would be a poly cue with a lot of mini M&M's.

1191
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:50,460
You heard it here first. Jason wants a mini poly cue like a like a clay face for Batman sort of situ because they were fed to anything.

1192
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:55,460
So they could become they could become one M&M at a certain point if that's what they were in the mood for.

1193
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:58,460
Yeah. Or they could separate into 50 depending.

1194
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:04,460
And then you could drink them. We could drink each other in like it's a mutual thing.

1195
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:08,460
Jason loves his tiny, crispy poly.

1196
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:13,460
Well, I think trying to shoehorn crispy into the.

1197
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:15,460
All right. I think there's enough for them.

1198
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:18,460
You know, they don't make those. You're right. That's that's fair.

1199
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:21,460
I don't know, Scott. I don't know if you can even follow that.

1200
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:24,460
I like Brown just the way she is.

1201
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:26,460
All right. That's nice. She's got glasses.

1202
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:29,460
She's smart. Old fashioned. All right. Yeah.

1203
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:32,460
Classy, elegant.

1204
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:35,460
So you're timeless. You're too pervert.

1205
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:41,460
I'm looking now. It's there are some blues that exist, but I don't think these are the blue.

1206
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:43,460
There's one that looks like a chauffeur.

1207
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:46,460
And then there's one who seems to be promoting X-Men apocalypse.

1208
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:50,460
Well, that's that's the M&M for me. I tell you what.

1209
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:53,460
I mean, this might be it here. I'll share the screen. Yeah.

1210
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:55,460
This is what you were. Yes.

1211
01:02:55,460 --> 01:02:58,460
M&M dressed as apocalypse Oscar Isaac's apocalypse.

1212
01:02:58,460 --> 01:03:00,460
Oh, my God. That's I love that.

1213
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:03,460
Well, your dream M&M has been here all along.

1214
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:09,460
All right. Well, if we can we want to calm down a little bit, let's although I don't know.

1215
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:15,460
I don't know. People maybe people are excited or about or attracted to ask Jeeves.

1216
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:23,460
And there might be kind of an appeal to ask Jeeves in the ask Jeeves float because he is sitting on a big toilet.

1217
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:31,460
So if that's your thing, you know, you're into butlers, butler toilet play.

1218
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:36,460
It would be a good while before people were like surfing the Internet on a toilet.

1219
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:39,460
Latons are really heavy back then.

1220
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:41,460
Wi-Fi would hot. That would heat your legs up.

1221
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:42,460
That would heat your legs up.

1222
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:46,460
You probably have to have a you know, an ethernet cable running.

1223
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:50,460
You know, you'd have to get like a breakfast in bed type tray and put it on your lap.

1224
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:51,460
And put the computer on there.

1225
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:54,460
Drag the whole unit in with you.

1226
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:57,460
The whole set of the disk drive.

1227
01:03:57,460 --> 01:03:59,460
You're still too horny for the M&M's talk.

1228
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:02,460
You got to scale it back, man.

1229
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:13,460
I'm getting I'm horny for surfing a Gateway 2000 computer on the toilet in the year 1999 presented to you by an elegant, distinguished butler.

1230
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:14,460
Yeah, that's true.

1231
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:16,460
It's great to see you ask Jeeves.

1232
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:22,460
I miss him a little bit, honestly, as far as being having an eye like we all just use Google, I assume.

1233
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:25,460
I don't think any of us are going to ask Jeeves anymore.

1234
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:36,460
It was fun when Ask Jeeves was around like and if you don't recall, it was kind of when there was still a question of what the big search engine is going to be.

1235
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:40,460
Ask Jeeves was definitely a contender and it just became Ask.com.

1236
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:42,460
They just streamlined it.

1237
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:44,460
Much like Max with HBO.

1238
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:48,460
The much cleaner, better, more specific Max.

1239
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:50,460
It tells you everything you need to know.

1240
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:55,460
If you liked HBO Max, but you didn't like all those shows being on it, check out Max.

1241
01:04:55,460 --> 01:04:59,460
But yeah, look, there's no Jeeves anymore.

1242
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:06,460
You know, it was a more playful time before the dot com bust and, you know, with silly characters.

1243
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:11,460
And, you know, it didn't become the Internet that we know today so much.

1244
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:13,460
Yeah, too bad.

1245
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:14,460
Just ask.

1246
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:18,460
I mean, ask.com probably owns Jeeves, but I think they should license him.

1247
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:21,460
I think they should let another company use him.

1248
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:24,460
Let him join the Avengers is what I'm saying.

1249
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:26,460
Did you watch the post credits?

1250
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:28,460
Yeah, wait.

1251
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:29,460
No, who was that?

1252
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:30,460
That was Jeeves.

1253
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:32,460
Yeah, it was Jeeves in the comics.

1254
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:34,460
No, no, I don't know what that was.

1255
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:39,460
No, I don't know why Jeeves is suddenly being teased.

1256
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:40,460
Don't ask questions.

1257
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:41,460
Just enjoy it.

1258
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:42,460
Just enjoy it.

1259
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:48,460
Just he's he's sitting on a toilet, which is apparently a callback to the 1999 Macy's for.

1260
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:52,460
No, it's not literally a toilet, we should say.

1261
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:56,460
But I it is certainly what it looks like to me.

1262
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:57,460
It seems like it.

1263
01:05:57,460 --> 01:06:01,460
It's like that that that Walt statue they're going to put an Epcot where he's.

1264
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:02,460
Yes.

1265
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:05,460
Really on a toilet, but it looks like he's on a toilet.

1266
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:17,460
Now, this was what I didn't realize is Jeeves presence only increased because it went from being a float down towards the ground to a he got a balloon.

1267
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:21,460
The next year he was balloon and they ran that for a couple of years.

1268
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:28,460
So Jeeves was like really, really dominating the Macy's people have affection for Jeeves, too.

1269
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:30,460
I feel like I feel like people liked it.

1270
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:35,460
I feel like I feel like people liked Ask Jeeves at the time, and I felt like that was a fun reference to make.

1271
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:38,460
And I feel like they made a big mistake abandoning him.

1272
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:39,460
Mm hmm.

1273
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:41,460
I don't know what do they got without it.

1274
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:42,460
Right. Nothing.

1275
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:43,460
It's just a red oval.

1276
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:45,460
Ask.com who gives a shit.

1277
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:47,460
It's still running.

1278
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:48,460
I just pulled it up on my phone.

1279
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:49,460
It's still the red oval.

1280
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:50,460
It's wild.

1281
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:51,460
They mean they fucked up.

1282
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:54,460
Yeah, they had it all.

1283
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:56,460
Yeah, it all may squandered it.

1284
01:06:56,460 --> 01:06:57,460
They let it go.

1285
01:06:57,460 --> 01:07:07,460
So similar of a time and this year and only this year it was the pets.com sock puppet.

1286
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:09,460
No, not sock, but it's a dog.

1287
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:14,460
It's a dog puppet who's kind of a who is a sock kind of what is it?

1288
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:15,460
What is he?

1289
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:16,460
He's a dog.

1290
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:17,460
It's a sock puppet.

1291
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:18,460
I don't know.

1292
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:20,460
Like he's got the spot on his eye.

1293
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:22,460
You're looking for specifically what breed?

1294
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:23,460
What do you mean?

1295
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:24,460
What do you question?

1296
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:25,460
Oh, no, no, no.

1297
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:26,460
Just what was the point of him?

1298
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:27,460
He was like a man on the street.

1299
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:29,460
He was like a nice triumph.

1300
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:32,460
Yeah, and triumph tried to take him to court.

1301
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:33,460
Right.

1302
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:34,460
And it was settled.

1303
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:37,460
I don't think it didn't go all the way.

1304
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:39,460
This little moment.

1305
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:51,460
This is one of these little like TIF kind of moments in the parade where Katie Couric has to do the jargon of explaining the pets.com puppet.

1306
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:56,460
Matt, our puppet is also the ambassador for Pets.com commitment.

1307
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:57,460
Pets.com commitment.

1308
01:07:57,460 --> 01:07:59,460
Don't quit your day job, Katie.

1309
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:03,460
Maybe I ought to since I can't read the darn teleprompter.

1310
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:10,460
Pets.com's program to celebrate and support people helping animals and animals helping people.

1311
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:13,460
So, I mean, I don't blame her.

1312
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:19,460
She's like she's she's been talking all morning since she had to get up at 2 a.m.

1313
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:24,460
And now she's reached like in the Bible that they make those hosts read.

1314
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:25,460
I've seen that on the special.

1315
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:26,460
It's crazy.

1316
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:34,460
And now she's hours in and she has to read pets.com commitment and know what she's looking at.

1317
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:37,460
People aren't even used to saying dot com yet, really.

1318
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:38,460
And now she's got to do this jargon.

1319
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:40,460
And then your your lower sweeps in.

1320
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:42,460
Hey, don't quit your day job.

1321
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:43,460
Always a villain.

1322
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:44,460
Always a villain.

1323
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:53,460
They it was I think it was supposed to be like a fun back and forth, but they both seem so annoyed and tired and not into it.

1324
01:08:53,460 --> 01:09:01,460
I probably because also she had to do hours of like now imagine four Volkswagen Beatles stacked on top of each other.

1325
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:05,460
And that's how big the Garfield the cat balloon is.

1326
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:07,460
It's all these these facts.

1327
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:08,460
Yeah.

1328
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:11,460
This is the hallmark of the parade or a lot of parades.

1329
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:22,460
Why you'd have to take why it would take seven hundred belts standing all connected together and go all the way to the sun and back.

1330
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:30,460
And yeah, these Fred, they don't they're fun to say, I guess, but they don't the most that you ever get out of them is like, hmm.

1331
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:42,460
If if these Arthur the art of arcs, jeans were in real life, they would be a size three hundred like something like just really like, oh, yeah, I know.

1332
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:45,460
OK, great. They're big. The big pants are saying, yeah.

1333
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:50,460
And then seven three months later, like remember when I told you about Arthur's pants, we made them.

1334
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:52,460
We made the pants and here they are.

1335
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:56,460
Oh, see, I told you that it would be that it would be big.

1336
01:09:56,460 --> 01:09:57,460
I didn't really care.

1337
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:59,460
Yeah, no, I took your word for it.

1338
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:01,460
Fine. Didn't have to make the jeans.

1339
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:04,460
Here's something I didn't know.

1340
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:06,460
Not that it matters because it doesn't.

1341
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:13,460
The all new Captain Kangaroo was a show in 1997 and it lasted for two years.

1342
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:19,460
And I don't know if you guys know or you remember the original Captain Kangaroo, which was a show before our time.

1343
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:24,460
But I was made aware of it because my mom was obsessed with me reliving her childhood.

1344
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:27,460
Yes, yes. Hence the Archie's and whatever.

1345
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:29,460
Hence everything I talk about.

1346
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:33,460
Yes, all the old character actor.

1347
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:34,460
Yeah, a little a lot. Yes.

1348
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:36,460
So I was very familiar with him.

1349
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:39,460
I don't really I didn't have a lot of affection for original Captain Kangaroo.

1350
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:46,460
He's like kind of an older man in a red suit, some sort of military vaguely military suit.

1351
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:49,460
He was a captain, of course, Navy man.

1352
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:51,460
But I didn't even know this in 1997.

1353
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:52,460
They tried it again.

1354
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:53,460
They tried it again.

1355
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:57,460
They tried to do a new Captain Kangaroo with a different older man.

1356
01:10:57,460 --> 01:10:58,460
Jason, you remember this?

1357
01:10:58,460 --> 01:11:02,460
I faintly remember it being around.

1358
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:08,460
But like I mean, it's notable in the parade because he is on the Caribbean float, standing pretty still.

1359
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:13,460
And then Lou Baga is on the float singing Mambo number five.

1360
01:11:13,460 --> 01:11:16,460
Yes, obviously, people's eyes are going right to Lou Baga.

1361
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:20,460
So I guess this is why people don't remember that they made an attempt with the new Captain Kangaroo.

1362
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:25,460
Because Lou Baga took all the focus because of his hit song that he was singing.

1363
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:28,460
Kind of hat on a hat. Well, you already got Lou Bago.

1364
01:11:28,460 --> 01:11:33,460
Do we all and it's an under the sea float promoting Caribbean tourism.

1365
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:39,460
Yeah. Do we also need a new Captain Kangaroo who I don't think I've ever seen in my life?

1366
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:41,460
It was utterly unfamiliar. I know.

1367
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:44,460
No, he has a blue suit now and instead of a red, the original letter red.

1368
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:46,460
Now this guy's got a blue one on.

1369
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:50,460
They look somewhat similar, but I had never seen this man in my life.

1370
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:54,460
I understand I was a little too old for it, maybe in 97, but I should have been on my radar, I think.

1371
01:11:54,460 --> 01:12:02,460
This is all where you can see the Marionette, the big puppets, the like eight eight foot tall Epcot style.

1372
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:06,460
Yeah. That too. This this float had everything.

1373
01:12:06,460 --> 01:12:12,460
This had everything. Lou Baga. Can I say this? Lou Baga was 24 years old here.

1374
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:15,460
Wow. I always thought he was like a little bit older.

1375
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:21,460
I don't know why. I guess maybe the dress he kind of dresses like an old like kind of gangstery kind of guy.

1376
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:24,460
Yeah, that confuses it. Yeah. He kind of looks the same now.

1377
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:27,460
He's 47 years old. You're not that old now.

1378
01:12:27,460 --> 01:12:30,460
If you told me he was that then I would. I that's right.

1379
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:34,460
Yeah, this was shocking to me as I learned this like a little while ago.

1380
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:41,460
I think everyone again, it's a little a piece of like the dress from the Swing Revival.

1381
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:46,460
And it just it makes you look old. The baggy pants.

1382
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:54,460
The hats. If you want to look, if you want to give yourself 19 years put on these clothes.

1383
01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:59,460
Lou, OK. Lou is still wearing these clothes too.

1384
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:03,460
Yeah, he's still he's still rocking the Zoot suit.

1385
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:09,460
Yeah, it's not really causing riots like the actual Zoot suit riots did cause back in the day.

1386
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:13,460
I know you remember it well because you were there. Yeah.

1387
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:17,460
He beat the shit out of me.

1388
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:20,460
So look, I was like, OK, yeah, I want to check in with Lou.

1389
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:22,460
What is Lou been up to?

1390
01:13:22,460 --> 01:13:25,460
And I think maybe I've already mentioned this on the show,

1391
01:13:25,460 --> 01:13:29,460
but when does that ever stop me from sharing something again?

1392
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:35,460
Lou, of course, Lou Baga sampled the song from Scatman John.

1393
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:39,460
And he it's the song is called Scatman and Hatman.

1394
01:13:39,460 --> 01:13:41,460
And I do I do love it.

1395
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:45,460
He's the hat man and Scatman John rest in peace was the Scatman.

1396
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:48,460
And by the way, the video looks like it's a Chico's commercial.

1397
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:52,460
That's the view. You'll see a clip of it, I'm sure.

1398
01:13:55,460 --> 01:14:01,460
When I will I tour everybody's getting mixed it up to the sound of the mumble.

1399
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:03,460
Yes, it can't be block it.

1400
01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:05,460
Twenty years and more.

1401
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:07,460
Scanning Lou pop it.

1402
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:09,460
Say, but your mama gave you.

1403
01:14:09,460 --> 01:14:10,460
Scatman and Hatman.

1404
01:14:10,460 --> 01:14:11,460
Traveling time.

1405
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:12,460
Scatman and Hatman.

1406
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:13,460
Going online.

1407
01:14:13,460 --> 01:14:14,460
Scatman with Hatman.

1408
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:15,460
Do it in style.

1409
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:16,460
Let's go, go, go.

1410
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:23,460
DJ turn it up was what I would say when I'm in a club.

1411
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:24,460
This is what I want to hear.

1412
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:30,460
And it's archival.

1413
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:32,460
It's the old footage because Scatman John has passed away.

1414
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:40,460
But this, as I've said before, I have a lot of affection for the song Scatman because it was my one of my backyard wrestling entrance music that I used.

1415
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:43,460
Lou is trying to brand himself as the hat man, which I really like.

1416
01:14:43,460 --> 01:14:45,460
And I don't know if that caught on.

1417
01:14:45,460 --> 01:14:50,460
But I like that strange thing to like.

1418
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:51,460
Here you go, everybody.

1419
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:54,460
Scatman and Hatman together at last.

1420
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:55,460
What's Hatman?

1421
01:14:55,460 --> 01:14:56,460
Me?

1422
01:14:56,460 --> 01:14:57,460
I'm Hatman.

1423
01:14:57,460 --> 01:15:03,460
Because also, I mean, look, I love Scatman John and all that stuff, but I don't know that a lot of people know who Scatman.

1424
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:06,460
So, well, and he already established.

1425
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:08,460
Is it scat world?

1426
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:09,460
Scat universe?

1427
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:11,460
Well, that's a different that's Scatman's album.

1428
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:16,460
Yeah, he did establish that it's Scatman's world and that he has a whole universe he's created.

1429
01:15:16,460 --> 01:15:17,460
It's scat.

1430
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:18,460
It's scat.

1431
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:19,460
All right.

1432
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:20,460
It's a bunch of scat.

1433
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:21,460
Scatman and Hatman.

1434
01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:24,460
I mean, extended universe, like just building out the continuity.

1435
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:25,460
I agree.

1436
01:15:25,460 --> 01:15:27,460
Now, Lou is just like, I love it.

1437
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:28,460
I love that he's still at it.

1438
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:31,460
This is Lou Bega's new song called Let's Get the Fiesta Started.

1439
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:36,460
Don't follow Lou Bega into a van.

1440
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:37,460
Girls, what are you doing?

1441
01:15:37,460 --> 01:15:47,460
He just grabbed four women off the street, locked the door, got in the road.

1442
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:51,460
Lou Bega just put four women into an unmarked van and he drove away with them.

1443
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:55,460
And anyway, this is not as good as Scatman and Hatman.

1444
01:15:55,460 --> 01:15:56,460
But anyway.

1445
01:15:56,460 --> 01:16:03,460
Four women, Erica, Monica, a little bit.

1446
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:09,460
But Lou tells me the channel Lou Bega Official is going to be getting a lot of play in the Carlson home this holidays.

1447
01:16:09,460 --> 01:16:11,460
Oh, I think you're correct.

1448
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:13,460
Lindsay, Lindsay, get in here.

1449
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:14,460
Lindsay, Lindsay.

1450
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:17,460
Did you know he released the covers album in 2012?

1451
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:19,460
We have to get we have to get to work.

1452
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:23,460
Five point nine million views on Scatman meets Hatman.

1453
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:24,460
Pretty cool, right?

1454
01:16:24,460 --> 01:16:25,460
Pretty interesting.

1455
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:27,460
He's making some good money off of that.

1456
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:29,460
The ad revenue ain't bad at that level.

1457
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:30,460
Bring me my calculator.

1458
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:32,460
I want to crunch the numbers.

1459
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:34,460
I want to see what he's making.

1460
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:38,460
So so great to see Lou.

1461
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:40,460
I'm glad that he's at it.

1462
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:41,460
And he was young.

1463
01:16:41,460 --> 01:16:42,460
And he was young.

1464
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:45,460
I was so young and I he had a big hit when he was really young.

1465
01:16:45,460 --> 01:16:48,460
Do you know there was a Disney Mambo number?

1466
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:49,460
Yes, I do.

1467
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:50,460
Yes.

1468
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:51,460
Yes.

1469
01:16:51,460 --> 01:16:52,460
Lovita Mickey.

1470
01:16:52,460 --> 01:16:53,460
Oh, yes.

1471
01:16:53,460 --> 01:16:54,460
Yes.

1472
01:16:54,460 --> 01:16:55,460
Yeah.

1473
01:16:55,460 --> 01:16:56,460
This is.

1474
01:16:56,460 --> 01:16:57,460
Oh, yeah.

1475
01:16:57,460 --> 01:16:58,460
No, no, no.

1476
01:16:58,460 --> 01:16:59,460
That everyone knows that.

1477
01:16:59,460 --> 01:17:00,460
No, no, no.

1478
01:17:00,460 --> 01:17:01,460
That for years.

1479
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:02,460
Yes, of course.

1480
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:03,460
I think common knowledge.

1481
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:04,460
Contemporaneous with Devo to the children.

1482
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:05,460
Devo.

1483
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:06,460
Mm hmm.

1484
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:07,460
Diz.

1485
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:08,460
The song hit.

1486
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:10,460
This one is called Disney Mambo number five.

1487
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:13,460
You know, it's just sometimes the easiest to call it what it is.

1488
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:19,460
I believe Lou Baga either played Epcot recently or was on a Disney parade recently.

1489
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:21,460
Like he's all of those things.

1490
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:22,460
Epcot every year.

1491
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:25,460
It's the only place he plays Epcot.

1492
01:17:25,460 --> 01:17:26,460
Mickey.

1493
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:27,460
Mickey Thomas.

1494
01:17:27,460 --> 01:17:29,460
No other venue will accept these performance.

1495
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:30,460
Everclear.

1496
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:33,460
I think Everclear just started playing the Epcot.

1497
01:17:33,460 --> 01:17:36,460
Sugar Ray's been playing for years.

1498
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:41,460
Is this is this become a speed round to say everything that gets said in every episode

1499
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:42,460
now?

1500
01:17:42,460 --> 01:17:43,460
What's missing?

1501
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:44,460
Gerberg.

1502
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:45,460
This is the closest.

1503
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:49,460
No, this is the closest to the talk we've had is listing the artists who do play Epcot.

1504
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:52,460
I'm curious about the song on Lovita Mickey.

1505
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:58,460
They just took all the like Latin invasion, whatever that that trend was called.

1506
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:02,460
And the it's all just live in Lovita Mickey.

1507
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:04,460
Mickey's Cup of Life.

1508
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:06,460
Disney Mambo number five.

1509
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:11,460
Of course, Lou Baga, the only real person from that trend to show up.

1510
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:12,460
Right.

1511
01:18:12,460 --> 01:18:17,460
And then and then there's a track called Enrique, Ricky and Mickey, which I can only assume

1512
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:22,460
something tells me only one of those people in that list is part of the song.

1513
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:24,460
I think that's right.

1514
01:18:24,460 --> 01:18:30,460
There's a float to promote the crocodile hunter with some guy, some Broadway guy, I think

1515
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:32,460
singing crocodile rock by Elton John.

1516
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:36,460
But the funny thing about this is to me is that they say that Steve Irwin is like recovering

1517
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:39,460
from something and then he's not there.

1518
01:18:39,460 --> 01:18:42,460
Not the one that would not the one ultimately.

1519
01:18:42,460 --> 01:18:44,460
But yes, some other accident.

1520
01:18:44,460 --> 01:18:45,460
Yeah.

1521
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:47,460
So so Terry Irwin is there.

1522
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:48,460
Right.

1523
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:49,460
Not Steve Irwin.

1524
01:18:49,460 --> 01:18:50,460
Right.

1525
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:51,460
Well, crocodile.

1526
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:55,460
I remember you remember when rock was young like the most Broadway version.

1527
01:18:55,460 --> 01:18:56,460
Yeah.

1528
01:18:56,460 --> 01:19:00,460
That it doesn't it holds up a little bit better than the BG songs.

1529
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:06,460
I think with the styles slightly, slightly, maybe slightly is still better.

1530
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:09,460
If I can just go back for some part.

1531
01:19:09,460 --> 01:19:14,460
Oh, so this is I mean, this is the part of the parade we're kind of talking about right

1532
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:15,460
now.

1533
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:19,460
But I think it's just Don Par another Don Pardo list.

1534
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:24,460
And what you're looking at on the screen is blue from Blue's crew.

1535
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:33,460
Stay with us for the all new Captain Kangaroo, Big Bang, Voodoo Daddy, Mambo King, Lubega

1536
01:19:33,460 --> 01:19:42,460
and the number from the Broadway musical Ragtime and Santa Claus live here on NBC.

1537
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:48,460
And I think it's just hearing him like say it all in a row and then ending with like

1538
01:19:48,460 --> 01:19:53,460
Santa Claus right after Big Bad Voodoo Daddy and Ragtime.

1539
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:56,460
That was like what I like snapped into attention a little more.

1540
01:19:56,460 --> 01:19:57,460
You know?

1541
01:19:57,460 --> 01:19:58,460
Yeah.

1542
01:19:58,460 --> 01:19:59,460
I mean, that was it.

1543
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:00,460
That Santa's coming.

1544
01:20:00,460 --> 01:20:05,460
I well, no, it's just that combination while staring at the giant blue from Blue's Clues

1545
01:20:05,460 --> 01:20:06,460
float.

1546
01:20:06,460 --> 01:20:11,460
The top of the show is the one where he just on with no break lists everything.

1547
01:20:11,460 --> 01:20:13,460
And then you get you get little chunks of it.

1548
01:20:13,460 --> 01:20:17,460
And it's it is fun because it's if you've ever if you're like us and you regularly do

1549
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:23,460
the Don Pardo voice and say names that weren't that never appeared on Saturday Night Live

1550
01:20:23,460 --> 01:20:24,460
or something.

1551
01:20:24,460 --> 01:20:28,460
So like it's a dream to hear it because it feels like a bit has come to life.

1552
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:31,460
It feels like musical guest Garfield.

1553
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:32,460
Yeah.

1554
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:33,460
Yeah.

1555
01:20:33,460 --> 01:20:40,460
So so anytime anytime you're a regular Pardo impersonator in your daily life, I think you're

1556
01:20:40,460 --> 01:20:42,460
going to get a lot of joy out of this.

1557
01:20:42,460 --> 01:20:46,460
Last night we were watching as it aired the Steve Martin Martin short one.

1558
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:52,460
And in between the eight thirty broadcast and eleven thirty broadcast, they play those

1559
01:20:52,460 --> 01:20:55,460
like edited shortened SNL episodes.

1560
01:20:55,460 --> 01:21:01,460
And it was the 1990 episode with Tom Hanks with the Five Timers Club with Young Conan

1561
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:03,460
and Scott a sketch.

1562
01:21:03,460 --> 01:21:10,460
I think you sent us at some point where Mike Myers plays Carl Sagan hosting a Christmas

1563
01:21:10,460 --> 01:21:11,460
variety.

1564
01:21:11,460 --> 01:21:12,460
How are you?

1565
01:21:12,460 --> 01:21:13,460
Yeah.

1566
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:15,460
That's a global warming like we're pre-luting.

1567
01:21:15,460 --> 01:21:16,460
Yeah.

1568
01:21:16,460 --> 01:21:21,460
It was just and there's also like a wacky game show sketch that Tony Randall just appears

1569
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:22,460
in.

1570
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:25,460
Like it is such a weird episode.

1571
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:29,460
And you and you're saying the Pardo was in you're saying you got a little part of there

1572
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:30,460
as well as well.

1573
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:34,460
Well, you get a little part because he has a big mouthful when he has to go.

1574
01:21:34,460 --> 01:21:39,460
Edie Burkell and the new radicals.

1575
01:21:39,460 --> 01:21:41,460
I believe it's new Bohemian.

1576
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:42,460
Sorry.

1577
01:21:42,460 --> 01:21:48,460
New radicals later in the radicals is that now that one I let now Mike, we've talked

1578
01:21:48,460 --> 01:21:50,460
about a lot of fucking shit.

1579
01:21:50,460 --> 01:21:51,460
Yeah.

1580
01:21:51,460 --> 01:21:52,460
I love New Radicals.

1581
01:21:52,460 --> 01:21:54,460
You only get what you do.

1582
01:21:54,460 --> 01:21:55,460
You like the second.

1583
01:21:55,460 --> 01:21:56,460
I do.

1584
01:21:56,460 --> 01:21:59,460
You like that second single to some someday we'll know.

1585
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:00,460
Yeah, I do.

1586
01:22:00,460 --> 01:22:05,460
I like and that song was covered by a couple of my favorites, Hall and Oates and Todd Rundgren

1587
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:06,460
together.

1588
01:22:06,460 --> 01:22:09,460
Oh, and those guys don't go covering unless it's quality work.

1589
01:22:09,460 --> 01:22:11,460
Do you like those fastball songs?

1590
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:17,460
Those I know the one I don't know multiple fastball fire escape.

1591
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:20,460
You're an ocean that's on the second album.

1592
01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:21,460
No, Mike.

1593
01:22:21,460 --> 01:22:26,460
No one knows that you're the only one diving into the full catalog of fastball.

1594
01:22:26,460 --> 01:22:29,460
I had that for a ball album.

1595
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:33,460
I actually have looked at what fastballs up to lately as far as new songs.

1596
01:22:33,460 --> 01:22:36,460
But I'm talking about the old I'm talking about the glory days.

1597
01:22:36,460 --> 01:22:39,460
Actually, but my surprise is that's fair.

1598
01:22:39,460 --> 01:22:44,460
I have just written down here, Rock-a-Pella, Nesquik Bunny.

1599
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:45,460
Mm hmm.

1600
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:46,460
That's all I have to say.

1601
01:22:46,460 --> 01:22:48,460
I don't have any else to say.

1602
01:22:48,460 --> 01:22:49,460
Just a good pair.

1603
01:22:49,460 --> 01:22:50,460
Yeah.

1604
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:51,460
Killer pairs.

1605
01:22:51,460 --> 01:22:55,460
He got his paws in the cement at Mann's Chinese Theater that year.

1606
01:22:55,460 --> 01:22:58,460
They made sure to mention that was weird.

1607
01:22:58,460 --> 01:22:59,460
What do you mean?

1608
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:01,460
You can't go there and see that.

1609
01:23:01,460 --> 01:23:03,460
There's no way the Nesquik Bunny.

1610
01:23:03,460 --> 01:23:04,460
That's that's bizarre.

1611
01:23:04,460 --> 01:23:05,460
They rotate those slabs.

1612
01:23:05,460 --> 01:23:09,460
There's a warehouse full of the slabs that they rotate them.

1613
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:11,460
So maybe you'll come back around.

1614
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:13,460
I think Nesquik Bunny.

1615
01:23:13,460 --> 01:23:16,460
I think I think it went into the warehouse and stayed in the warehouse.

1616
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:17,460
Yes.

1617
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:18,460
The Ark of the Covenant.

1618
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:20,460
Yeah, they're clamoring.

1619
01:23:20,460 --> 01:23:24,460
Get these get Daniel Radcliffe out of here.

1620
01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:26,460
People want to see Nesquik Bunny.

1621
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:27,460
I'm trying to think.

1622
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:28,460
I mean, everything else.

1623
01:23:28,460 --> 01:23:30,460
I don't have any of my big point.

1624
01:23:30,460 --> 01:23:31,460
I mean, Flores Henderson's involved.

1625
01:23:31,460 --> 01:23:32,460
Barney is involved.

1626
01:23:32,460 --> 01:23:33,460
We didn't say.

1627
01:23:33,460 --> 01:23:37,460
That was one of the assigned things to mention.

1628
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:38,460
Oh, and you know what?

1629
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:39,460
Talk about Don Pardo things.

1630
01:23:39,460 --> 01:23:40,460
That's the throughout.

1631
01:23:40,460 --> 01:23:41,460
Yes.

1632
01:23:41,460 --> 01:23:47,460
It happens a bunch of times that you get to hear Don Pardo say Austin Powers nemesis mini

1633
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:50,460
me for Troy.

1634
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:53,460
What a great clunky phrase.

1635
01:23:53,460 --> 01:23:54,460
Really great phrase.

1636
01:23:54,460 --> 01:23:55,460
Yeah.

1637
01:23:55,460 --> 01:24:00,460
It makes me wish that he had hosted musical guest Austin Powers and the other guys.

1638
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:03,460
Musical guest Austin Powers and Ming T.

1639
01:24:03,460 --> 01:24:09,460
Musical guest Ming T and your host Austin Powers nemesis mini me.

1640
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:14,460
It's it's kind of in a way better than the actual.

1641
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:15,460
I mean, the floats fine.

1642
01:24:15,460 --> 01:24:16,460
There's the go go dancers.

1643
01:24:16,460 --> 01:24:17,460
Vernon is sitting down.

1644
01:24:17,460 --> 01:24:18,460
He's waving.

1645
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:19,460
He's not in.

1646
01:24:19,460 --> 01:24:20,460
It's not.

1647
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:21,460
It's not.

1648
01:24:21,460 --> 01:24:26,460
I feel like the part of part is almost my favorite element of the of the float.

1649
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:27,460
Yeah, I almost forgot.

1650
01:24:27,460 --> 01:24:30,460
That's a great thing to have to hear a bunch of times.

1651
01:24:30,460 --> 01:24:37,460
Also, to tie it together to the other person assigned to us in the list to talk about doesn't

1652
01:24:37,460 --> 01:24:41,460
doesn't current Rudy Giuliani look like mini me?

1653
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:51,460
Not Dr. Evil, but mini me like a blown up mini me barely.

1654
01:24:51,460 --> 01:24:55,460
I feel like he's like almost because he saw hunched over.

1655
01:24:55,460 --> 01:24:59,460
He's wearing this was a thing he would do in the not like late 90s.

1656
01:24:59,460 --> 01:25:05,460
I think when the Yankees were on a home run, a World Series run like it just great seasons.

1657
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:12,460
And he's got the Yankee starter jacket on and he's on the float with the World Championship team.

1658
01:25:12,460 --> 01:25:13,460
Yeah, me too.

1659
01:25:13,460 --> 01:25:14,460
I'm one of these two.

1660
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:15,460
I'm one of them.

1661
01:25:15,460 --> 01:25:16,460
I'm basically them.

1662
01:25:16,460 --> 01:25:18,460
I think of when you think of them, think of me.

1663
01:25:19,460 --> 01:25:25,460
He's there's no he's not leaking hair dye off of his head at this point in this year.

1664
01:25:25,460 --> 01:25:27,460
That was only later.

1665
01:25:27,460 --> 01:25:29,460
He's mutated.

1666
01:25:29,460 --> 01:25:31,460
Yeah, he's not just aged.

1667
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:33,460
This man is like mutated in a way.

1668
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:35,460
And I don't know.

1669
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:40,460
It's like he fell in the sewer and mutagen mixed with him.

1670
01:25:40,460 --> 01:25:46,460
Well, this is where if you could, you know, show somebody in 1999, 99 us some show us.

1671
01:25:46,460 --> 01:25:52,460
Let's you know, flash in the future as America's things wanted us to do.

1672
01:25:52,460 --> 01:25:53,460
We're watching that flow.

1673
01:25:53,460 --> 01:25:54,460
We're watching.

1674
01:25:54,460 --> 01:25:55,460
Wow.

1675
01:25:55,460 --> 01:25:56,460
Really, Giuliani.

1676
01:25:56,460 --> 01:25:59,460
Boy, he seems like a like like a strong upstanding.

1677
01:25:59,460 --> 01:26:02,460
Why he led the Yankees to World Series victory.

1678
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:04,460
The mayor is also the coach of the Yankees, right?

1679
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:06,460
In New York.

1680
01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:11,460
I think he also I think I think you have to do both jobs if you're the mayor of New York.

1681
01:26:11,460 --> 01:26:21,460
We're watching that float and then flash to him at Four Seasons landscaping and his head is melting and he's trying to take his pants off to Borat's daughter.

1682
01:26:21,460 --> 01:26:25,460
And you just show us like a montage of all of that.

1683
01:26:25,460 --> 01:26:36,460
And and and like and then expand then really quickly to say and that is all just the context is this is like the final dissolving days of the bizarre presidency of President Donald Trump.

1684
01:26:36,460 --> 01:26:42,460
Just give us all that information and then we like don't sleep for any of the two thousands.

1685
01:26:42,460 --> 01:26:46,460
We're up every night wondering what is what what do you mean?

1686
01:26:46,460 --> 01:26:47,460
That's what I mean.

1687
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:48,460
That's going to happen.

1688
01:26:48,460 --> 01:26:50,460
I don't want to head into the millennium anymore.

1689
01:26:50,460 --> 01:26:51,460
It's like inception.

1690
01:26:51,460 --> 01:27:00,460
But in a spinning top, the thing bringing you back to the late 90s is 98 degrees on a big train float like you.

1691
01:27:00,460 --> 01:27:01,460
You're haunted.

1692
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:03,460
You're layers and layers down.

1693
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:15,460
It's like I know you guys haven't gotten through the Snyder cut of the Justice League, but at the end I said there's a tease where it's the whole world has just been nuked and there's only a few of the heroes left, including Batman and the Joker.

1694
01:27:15,460 --> 01:27:20,460
And they've like teamed up just because of out of necessity because they're fighting dark side and his minions.

1695
01:27:20,460 --> 01:27:22,460
That's what you're describing.

1696
01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:24,460
Scott is his 20 years ago.

1697
01:27:24,460 --> 01:27:28,460
A hell world that we wouldn't have been able to fathom.

1698
01:27:28,460 --> 01:27:32,460
You just appear in a portal and like look someone dead in the eye.

1699
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:37,460
It's like Joaquin Phoenix is going to win an Oscar for playing the Joker from Batman.

1700
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:38,460
Goodbye.

1701
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:39,460
What?

1702
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:43,460
And he's doing a sequel with Lady Gaga.

1703
01:27:43,460 --> 01:27:47,460
Lady Gaga is one of the biggest recording artists in the future.

1704
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:49,460
Well, that I know her soon enough.

1705
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:50,460
Goodbye.

1706
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:51,460
Makes sense.

1707
01:27:51,460 --> 01:27:55,460
But this will be the second time an actor has won an Oscar for playing the Joker.

1708
01:27:55,460 --> 01:27:56,460
That's right.

1709
01:27:56,460 --> 01:27:58,460
That's another weird.

1710
01:27:58,460 --> 01:27:59,460
Yeah.

1711
01:27:59,460 --> 01:28:00,460
Likely not the last.

1712
01:28:00,460 --> 01:28:01,460
Not the last.

1713
01:28:01,460 --> 01:28:03,460
It'll happen within the first two decades.

1714
01:28:03,460 --> 01:28:05,460
It's look it's confusing.

1715
01:28:05,460 --> 01:28:07,460
You know, how do you what happens in between?

1716
01:28:07,460 --> 01:28:10,460
How do you connect the dots from that Rudy to the Rudy we know today?

1717
01:28:10,460 --> 01:28:12,460
And that's actually something because I'm no history buff.

1718
01:28:12,460 --> 01:28:15,460
So I don't want to throw this to both of you guys to Mike and Jason.

1719
01:28:15,460 --> 01:28:17,460
This is the 1999.

1720
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:19,460
This is a 1999 event in New York.

1721
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:22,460
Did anything else happen in New York like in the subsequent year?

1722
01:28:22,460 --> 01:28:23,460
I've been waiting for it.

1723
01:28:23,460 --> 01:28:25,460
I've been waiting to learn.

1724
01:28:25,460 --> 01:28:28,460
How did things play out in New York for the few years after this?

1725
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:35,460
I believe there was a New York premiere for the movie Shrek in the summer of 2001.

1726
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:37,460
But I'm not 100 percent.

1727
01:28:37,460 --> 01:28:39,460
Maybe they did that at a Universal City.

1728
01:28:39,460 --> 01:28:41,460
Well, could have been in Los Angeles.

1729
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:43,460
It could have been Los Angeles.

1730
01:28:43,460 --> 01:28:44,460
Yeah.

1731
01:28:44,460 --> 01:28:46,460
As far as you know, that is the only thing that happened.

1732
01:28:46,460 --> 01:28:47,460
Major events.

1733
01:28:47,460 --> 01:28:50,460
Oh, well, we've talked about the WWE restaurant.

1734
01:28:50,460 --> 01:28:51,460
Oh, yeah.

1735
01:28:51,460 --> 01:28:53,460
That's what you must have been thinking of, Scott.

1736
01:28:53,460 --> 01:28:54,460
Yeah.

1737
01:28:54,460 --> 01:28:55,460
WWE of New York.

1738
01:28:55,460 --> 01:28:56,460
OK.

1739
01:28:56,460 --> 01:28:57,460
OK.

1740
01:28:57,460 --> 01:28:58,460
You guys have something else.

1741
01:28:58,460 --> 01:28:59,460
I have the game.

1742
01:28:59,460 --> 01:29:00,460
I have my game here.

1743
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:01,460
Oh, yeah.

1744
01:29:01,460 --> 01:29:03,460
So I want you both to pick.

1745
01:29:03,460 --> 01:29:07,460
Well, we'll see how good it ends up being.

1746
01:29:07,460 --> 01:29:09,460
Pick a number.

1747
01:29:09,460 --> 01:29:15,460
Let's just say one, two numbers, both one through 20.

1748
01:29:15,460 --> 01:29:16,460
OK.

1749
01:29:16,460 --> 01:29:17,460
So you'll pick.

1750
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:19,460
So you would say like five and 11.

1751
01:29:19,460 --> 01:29:20,460
OK.

1752
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:21,460
Not nine.

1753
01:29:21,460 --> 01:29:22,460
Jason, go for it.

1754
01:29:22,460 --> 01:29:23,460
Five and 11.

1755
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:24,460
Oh, we know.

1756
01:29:24,460 --> 01:29:25,460
Yeah, we leave it to Jason.

1757
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:26,460
We know what he's doing.

1758
01:29:26,460 --> 01:29:27,460
Six and 17.

1759
01:29:27,460 --> 01:29:28,460
OK.

1760
01:29:28,460 --> 01:29:29,460
Six and 17.

1761
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:36,460
So this is what I, this is not, I haven't made a, I haven't made a program to do this,

1762
01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:38,460
but somebody smarter than I could.

1763
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:43,460
Now, this is a generator for Float and Musical Performer from 1999.

1764
01:29:43,460 --> 01:29:47,460
And I'll try to do it in the Dompardo voice.

1765
01:29:47,460 --> 01:29:58,460
Now, Sixpence Nunn the Richer doing their hit Kiss Me on the Toaster Strudel Float.

1766
01:29:58,460 --> 01:30:01,460
Pillsbury Toaster Strudel.

1767
01:30:01,460 --> 01:30:02,460
All right, Scott, same thing.

1768
01:30:02,460 --> 01:30:04,460
Two numbers.

1769
01:30:04,460 --> 01:30:06,460
One and two.

1770
01:30:06,460 --> 01:30:08,460
One and two.

1771
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:15,460
And now, singing her hit song Believe It's Cher on the Goshers Float.

1772
01:30:15,460 --> 01:30:19,460
Wow, Mike, these really work.

1773
01:30:19,460 --> 01:30:20,460
These are good.

1774
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:21,460
Yeah.

1775
01:30:21,460 --> 01:30:22,460
OK.

1776
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:23,460
Do a couple more then.

1777
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:24,460
A couple more.

1778
01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:25,460
Three and 19.

1779
01:30:25,460 --> 01:30:26,460
Three and 19.

1780
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:27,460
OK.

1781
01:30:27,460 --> 01:30:32,460
This is a good list of snacks from the 90s.

1782
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:33,460
319.

1783
01:30:33,460 --> 01:30:34,460
OK.

1784
01:30:34,460 --> 01:30:36,460
Oh, God, I don't even remember that.

1785
01:30:36,460 --> 01:30:45,460
Now, performing her hit song Angel of Mine, It's Monica on the String Thing Fruit Snack Float.

1786
01:30:45,460 --> 01:30:51,460
And then Katie Couric's introducing it.

1787
01:30:51,460 --> 01:30:58,460
And you're joining on the String Thing Fruit Snack Float.

1788
01:30:58,460 --> 01:30:59,460
Yes.

1789
01:30:59,460 --> 01:31:01,460
Scott, you want to do one more real quick?

1790
01:31:01,460 --> 01:31:02,460
Yeah.

1791
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:04,460
Seven and 18.

1792
01:31:04,460 --> 01:31:05,460
Oh, what's that?

1793
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:06,460
Unless one of those was done.

1794
01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:08,460
Do another one.

1795
01:31:08,460 --> 01:31:10,460
Eight and 18.

1796
01:31:10,460 --> 01:31:13,460
Oh, this couldn't be better.

1797
01:31:13,460 --> 01:31:26,460
And now, performing their number eight hit song Every Morning, It's Sugar Ray, sponsored by Butterfinger Bebe's.

1798
01:31:26,460 --> 01:31:27,460
Perfect.

1799
01:31:27,460 --> 01:31:29,460
Could have easily been Floats this year.

1800
01:31:29,460 --> 01:31:30,460
Be careful.

1801
01:31:30,460 --> 01:31:33,460
We don't want to get Jason imagining being in a polycule.

1802
01:31:33,460 --> 01:31:36,460
Massive Butterfinger Bebe's.

1803
01:31:36,460 --> 01:31:39,460
Where he gets to drink down a bunch of Butterfinger Bebe's.

1804
01:31:39,460 --> 01:31:44,460
A Borg-like Phalanx-like thing of M&M's.

1805
01:31:44,460 --> 01:31:47,460
Drinkable. Jason needs more drinkable candy.

1806
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:53,460
Look, M&M Minis, they might have died down a little, but you still see those tubes.

1807
01:31:53,460 --> 01:31:55,460
And when you see those tubes.

1808
01:31:55,460 --> 01:31:57,460
And you get some ideas.

1809
01:31:57,460 --> 01:31:59,460
Wow.

1810
01:31:59,460 --> 01:32:00,460
Thank you for the-

1811
01:32:00,460 --> 01:32:02,460
Can I make the worst joke I've ever made on the show?

1812
01:32:02,460 --> 01:32:03,460
Yeah, sure.

1813
01:32:03,460 --> 01:32:04,460
Close it out.

1814
01:32:04,460 --> 01:32:06,460
Last joke of the year.

1815
01:32:06,460 --> 01:32:08,460
Jason.

1816
01:32:08,460 --> 01:32:11,460
I'm trying to figure out how to- the grossest way I can say this.

1817
01:32:11,460 --> 01:32:19,460
Jason's version of a Fleshlight is a Butterfinger Bebe's, M&M's mini tube.

1818
01:32:19,460 --> 01:32:20,460
I'm sorry, everyone.

1819
01:32:20,460 --> 01:32:23,460
Well.

1820
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:25,460
You survived.

1821
01:32:25,460 --> 01:32:28,460
I'd guess the ride to globe three.

1822
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:31,460
On that note.

1823
01:32:31,460 --> 01:32:34,460
And all. I think that's everything. For the year.

1824
01:32:34,460 --> 01:32:36,460
I think that'll do it.

1825
01:32:36,460 --> 01:32:37,460
I think so.

1826
01:32:37,460 --> 01:32:38,460
So let that mental image carry you into-

1827
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:39,460
I'm so sorry.

1828
01:32:39,460 --> 01:32:41,460
Not the millennium, but into the next year.

1829
01:32:41,460 --> 01:32:43,460
I'm so sorry.

1830
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:47,460
Your bravery saved the podcast. Well done, Freedom Fighters.

1831
01:32:47,460 --> 01:32:52,460
And genuinely, at the end of the year here, I think launching this new tier has been a big deal for us.

1832
01:32:52,460 --> 01:32:55,460
And a real spark of life in the pod.

1833
01:32:55,460 --> 01:32:58,460
And I've enjoyed all of these topics and the polls.

1834
01:32:58,460 --> 01:33:01,460
And meeting new friends like Nathan Masuri.

1835
01:33:01,460 --> 01:33:04,460
And getting sent down different rabbit holes.

1836
01:33:04,460 --> 01:33:08,460
You know, club three caused my best day of the year.

1837
01:33:08,460 --> 01:33:13,460
Which was taking the flight to go see the riverboat Car Wash in NorCal.

1838
01:33:13,460 --> 01:33:15,460
Oh yeah.

1839
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:19,460
So genuinely, thank you club three subscribers for all of this.

1840
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:22,460
And we appreciate your super support.

1841
01:33:22,460 --> 01:33:23,460
And we hope you'll stick around.

1842
01:33:23,460 --> 01:33:26,460
Yeah, thank you for wanting more bullshit from us.

1843
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:29,460
We appreciate it.

1844
01:33:29,460 --> 01:33:31,460
For many reasons.

1845
01:33:31,460 --> 01:33:39,460
And hey, club three subscribers, we think you're more special even than four and ten.

1846
01:33:39,460 --> 01:33:41,460
Oh, oh.

1847
01:33:41,460 --> 01:33:44,460
This is how much we appreciate you and value you.

1848
01:33:44,460 --> 01:33:46,460
You're better than four and ten.

1849
01:33:46,460 --> 01:33:49,460
And now, doing Heartbreak Hotel?

1850
01:33:49,460 --> 01:33:54,460
It's Whitney Houston featuring Faith Evans and Kelly Price.

1851
01:33:54,460 --> 01:33:57,460
Well, I don't remember that at all.

1852
01:33:57,460 --> 01:34:04,460
Sponsored by Squeeze It Juice Box Drinks.

1853
01:34:08,460 --> 01:34:09,460
Indeed.

1854
01:34:09,460 --> 01:34:10,460
You're more special than that.

1855
01:34:10,460 --> 01:34:12,460
So thank you.

1856
01:34:12,460 --> 01:34:14,460
Classy Chupo, McDonald Land.

1857
01:34:14,460 --> 01:34:15,460
We'll head into next year.

1859
01:34:19,460 --> 01:34:28,460
But as for now, heading into next year, signing off for Mike Carlson and the inventor of fish food, Jason Sheridan.

1860
01:34:28,460 --> 01:34:30,460
Put it in your Twitter bio.

1861
01:34:30,460 --> 01:34:34,460
Have a happy 2023.

1862
01:34:34,460 --> 01:34:35,460
Bye bye.
