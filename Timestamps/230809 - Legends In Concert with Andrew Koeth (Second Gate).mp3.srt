00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,880
Hey, it's Podcast The Ride Sin City Nights.

2
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:29,320
Tonight on the Fremont Gate, we've got a spectacular show, the finest Podcast The Ride impersonators

3
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,840
you've ever heard.

4
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,760
It's gonna make you feel like you're really listening to Podcast The Ride.

5
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,200
I'm Bart Tate and tonight I'll be inhabiting Scott Gardner.

6
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,960
This guy, he's gonna dazzle you as Mike Carlson, it's Nathan Ruiz.

7
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,960
Hey Nathan.

8
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,720
Hey there, I just bought some collectibles and I really enjoy them.

9
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,800
Wow, wow.

10
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,520
It's the voice, it's the affectations and it's the interests.

11
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,120
He manages to put them all together.

12
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,520
That's like juggling and singing and dancing all at once.

13
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:07,120
Hey, and of course, the nation's premier Jason Sheridan impersonator, Kip Finkel.

14
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,120
Hey, it's Kip Finkel, but today you'll just call me Jason Sheridan.

15
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:18,240
I'm here eating far more sugar than a 37 year old man should ingest.

16
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,720
You've been doing your research.

17
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,720
That's right.

18
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,760
Just really work on some of those Pennsylvania.

19
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,240
Whenever we practice in the Pennsylvania vowels, just make sure you got those.

20
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,200
We want to hear at least one through the episode.

21
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,200
Sure.

22
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,120
Sheets versus wah-wah.

23
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,120
They love it.

24
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,080
Hey, I love hearing it.

25
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,680
I don't even know what it means, but it's part of the picture.

26
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,960
It's how you play Jason.

27
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:47,760
All right, well, Nathan, Kip and I are really excited about today's topic.

28
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:56,960
Okay, impersonators, obviously a big part of the Vegas entertainment landscape.

29
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:03,280
What we're talking about today is perhaps the biggest and longest standing impersonation

30
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,080
enterprise, legends in concert.

31
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,280
Now, I say that I give it those credits.

32
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,720
I'm not exactly sure if they're true or if that itself is part of the legend is conjured

33
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,600
up by the man behind the enterprise.

34
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:23,280
You might say a guy will get into it, but we're doing this.

35
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,400
Our guest brought to our attention the importance of this legends in concert corporation, whatever

36
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,880
you want to call it.

37
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:38,840
He himself, a musician, a Twitch streamer, the DJ for the sadly deceased hip hop artist

38
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,840
Bugmane.

39
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,000
Thankfully, he's gotten back on his feet and he is now the DJ for up and coming hip hop

40
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,920
artist Bugmane 2000.

41
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,880
So happy he's here.

42
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,560
Andrew Coates, welcome to the show.

43
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,240
Oh, my God.

44
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,040
Thank you so much for having me podcast.

45
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,560
The ride.

46
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,400
Wow, man, I am excited to have you.

47
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,480
You've been such a supporter for for such a long time.

48
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,400
And one of my favorite folks, we've gotten to meet over the course of doing this and

49
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:11,120
this whole whatever we're doing and bug con ecosystem that we're part of.

50
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,600
And yeah, happy to have you on the mic here.

51
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,400
I'm enthralled.

52
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,240
This is amazing.

53
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,760
I'm looking at Garf like Mike's wearing a pink Mickey shirt.

54
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,360
Like I'm really getting the full experience.

55
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,800
Yeah, you're getting the real deal.

56
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,680
And you're wearing a Steely Dan hat, which makes me happy.

57
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,440
Thanks for representing that and Knott's Berry Farm.

58
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,520
A scary farm.

59
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,920
A scary farm indeed.

60
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:39,440
So you're representing and with that, I mean, that's one thing.

61
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,560
You I know that you're a Knott's guy.

62
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,040
And which I feel like is always bonded, all of us when we've gotten to talk.

63
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,680
But let's let's talk general theme park stuff before we make the drive into Vegas.

64
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,720
Wait, what's what's some important stuff to you on your your theme park plate,

65
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,760
your theme park journey?

66
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,320
Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much, Scott.

67
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,000
So like I'm from Bakersfield, California.

68
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,920
You guys are aware, have any relationship to Bakersfield?

69
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,520
It's always interesting asking anyone out here like, oh, I stopped there for a

70
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,600
sandwich or something on the way to San Francisco.

71
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,440
But like I don't remember.

72
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,560
I don't remember if I've ever done it.

73
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,600
So my parks growing up were mainly weirdly six flags, six flags,

74
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,760
Hurricane Harbor and Knott's Berry Farm.

75
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,800
Like majority.

76
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:26,440
I've maybe been to Disneyland like five, six times my whole life.

77
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,880
Like not that I don't like it.

78
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,920
I love it. It's great.

79
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:33,400
But like not a ton of times, but like six flags more times than I could count.

80
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,120
Oh, sure.

81
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,720
A little closer up because the Bakersfields, I forget what freeways are talking about.

82
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,640
We're like, but it's it's heading up north.

83
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,840
We're talking about the great line.

84
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,480
We're talking about the ninety nine, the five and okay.

85
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,120
So six flags is right there by Cal Arts, and it's pretty close to Bakersfield.

86
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:56,520
And like just yeah, if your standard is like ninety six flags with all that

87
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:03,960
element and theming going like Knott's was huge for me and sure like Mike,

88
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,360
you've talked about in the past, you marched in marching band where again?

89
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,520
Disney World Epcot Center and Magic Kingdom.

90
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,080
Wow.

91
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,760
So yeah, pretty impressive.

92
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,240
No, yeah.

93
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,400
Multi-park marching.

94
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,400
So for me, I got to march in front of the Calico Mine Ride.

95
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,280
I think twice.

96
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:24,600
Okay.

97
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,360
I was either playing trumpet or sousaphone.

98
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,320
They switched me to sousaphone at some point because they needed it.

99
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,920
And like the fingering is the same.

100
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,240
Yeah.

101
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:31,320
Yeah.

102
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:31,960
Okay.

103
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,200
But this is like a massive one that goes all the way around your body.

104
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:36,680
Yeah.

105
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,960
There was one of the roots at a sousaphone player at one point.

106
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,360
So that's my only sousaphone association.

107
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:42,680
Definitely.

108
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,360
I thought that was odd, but cool.

109
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,680
So like Knott's really locked into my head, like marching there.

110
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,680
And you marched in middle school, you said?

111
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:50,920
Yeah.

112
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,040
I believe it was like sixth or seventh grade.

113
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,280
Yeah.

114
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,560
You were marching really because I didn't start marching until high school.

115
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,120
Interesting.

116
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,360
Yeah.

117
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,360
High school is when I stopped marching.

118
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,280
I got into orchestra and I played the upright bass in high school for a little bit.

119
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,440
And then I stopped because I was playing in bands and stuff.

120
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,160
And I was like, I can't do this structured shit anymore.

121
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,840
But yeah.

122
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,480
So in middle school, I marched, I think, six, seven, eighth grade all three years.

123
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,640
And we had to wear these terrible little costumes.

124
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,200
Yeah.

125
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:18,840
Ill fitting.

126
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,680
And there was a cummerbund and all this stuff.

127
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,320
And the hat, it wasn't like a big hat.

128
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,600
It was like a cowboy hat.

129
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,840
Oh, that sounds cool though.

130
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,400
Yeah.

131
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,520
It's more of something.

132
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,000
Marching band uniforms can only be those.

133
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,240
You can't wear any piece of a marching band uniform just around in your day to day.

134
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,320
At least cowboy hat.

135
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,800
The cowboy hat sounds so much better than what I had to wear.

136
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,680
I had to wear a normal marching outfit, which feels like you're wearing snow pants.

137
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,040
I don't know if you California.

138
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,000
Yeah.

139
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,720
Snow pants is what you would wear in the Midwest.

140
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,400
You wore snow pants as a child ever?

141
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,040
Did I watch snow pit?

142
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,280
Where?

143
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:56,520
Where?

144
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:56,520


145
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:56,520


146
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:56,520


147
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:56,520


148
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:56,520


149
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:56,520


150
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:56,520


151
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:56,520


152
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:56,520


153
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:56,520


154
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:56,520


155
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:56,520


156
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:56,600
Where?

157
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,320
I wasn't sure.

158
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:11,320
The way you said it sounded like it was like an 80s movie or a kids thing where it's like,

159
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,200
you know, snow pants.

160
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:12,920
Oh, no, no.

161
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,400
Wearing them.

162
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,440
Yeah, sure.

163
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,240
I had some snow.

164
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,840
I think I had like a snow suit overall thing at some point.

165
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:19,640
Yeah.

166
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,160
They were like overalls basically.

167
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,560
Yeah.

168
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:21,880
Yeah.

169
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,040
Yeah.

170
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,440
Those.

171
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:22,840
Okay.

172
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,000
Yeah.

173
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,880
That's what it felt like to wear the marching band outfit.

174
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,000
I don't know if you had a similar thing.

175
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It was just heavy, like a heavy material polyester or something.

176
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,480
I assume.

177
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:31,640
Yeah.

178
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,560
If you're out there, you're usually doing like a Christmas parade at night.

179
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,160
So like, yeah, you get bundled up, but no, it was just like black slacks.

180
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:44,840
This insane like looked like a like a color band flag type of shirt and like very stiff

181
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,800
with a cummerbund and I had to play trumpet.

182
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,080
But yeah, everything you're describing sounds awesome to me.

183
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,680
So like so much of a better outfit than when I had to wear definitely deep in my parents

184
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:01,640
stuff somewhere is like a VHS tape of like KGET Bakersfield of like me marching by in

185
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,200
a broadcast like Christmas parade.

186
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,400
So I'll have to try to find.

187
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,480
I'm like five years away from wearing a rainbow shirt and a big cowboy hat out in general.

188
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,120
You should.

189
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,960
So you really should just push it leaning.

190
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,520
Yeah.

191
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:12,840
Sure.

192
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,320
Why not?

193
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,280
That's your band chic.

194
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,520
When they started, Captain Neo went back in Disneyland.

195
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,960
They were selling that t-shirt.

196
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,600
I bought it.

197
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:20,760
Yeah.

198
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,560
And I don't know where it is.

199
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,520
Somebody a lot of people.

200
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,480
I lost it somewhere.

201
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,480
That's cooler than what we're describing is I had the rainbow shirt, the rainbow shirt.

202
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:27,800
Yeah.

203
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,240
Now we're talking about marching.

204
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,640
We're comparing that to the swoop.

205
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,000
He brought it into Captain Neo.

206
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,160
I didn't say this part.

207
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,160
I feel we should all wear Captain Eos outfit soon.

208
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,080
We should all start wearing that just casually.

209
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,360
Just casually.

210
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,640
Just running in.

211
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:43,880
Yeah.

212
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,920
Just running in the target to get milk and bread and eggs.

213
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,400
And you're in the full Captain Eo outfit.

214
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:49,800
Yeah.

215
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,640
I did it for Halloween once, so I do have Eo gear around somewhere.

216
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,280
So now it's just a matter of making it a part of the routine.

217
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,040
You add a cowboy hat to it and it's perfect.

218
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,280
Wow.

219
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,160
It sounds like a little Nas X would wear.

220
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:01,640
Yeah.

221
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,200
It's crazy.

222
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:02,520
Yeah.

223
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:02,760
Yeah.

224
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,800
I never did marching band, but I remember a week or two before school started, they would do

225
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:18,040
practice in the parking lot of the school in 100 degree weather.

226
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,440
Yep.

227
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,120
Terrible humidity.

228
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,880
And then everyone was wearing T-shirt and jeans.

229
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,680
But I think it was a point of pride of like, yeah, we're doing it.

230
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,240
We're doing two a days for marching band.

231
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,640
Not for me.

232
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,440
I don't think I would.

233
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,560
I think it was like, this sucks.

234
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:36,680
Yeah.

235
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:36,920
Yeah.

236
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,800
But I'm sure there were...

237
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,680
I'm not saying you're wrong.

238
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,040
I'm sure there were kids that were like, yeah, we're being forged in fire.

239
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,800
This is the trials to prove that I'm the ultimate musician that can also walk while

240
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,360
he plays.

241
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,840
I'm thinking more the instructors were really into it.

242
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,800
And then a handful of kids were probably like, yeah, we're doing it.

243
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,360
We're hard.

244
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:56,680
Yeah.

245
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,800
They saw all the cool.

246
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,600
Did you ever think, oh, and I guess you were, you said you were playing in bands.

247
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,520
I was a roommates with a guy in college who was into drum core.

248
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,240
Oh, wow.

249
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,320
And that's a really intense thing.

250
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,360
Yeah.

251
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,440
Like you're saying, like, you know, if kids are very hardcore into like marching and

252
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,480
doing that thing, the most hardcore of them were the drum people.

253
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:15,720
Yeah.

254
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,280
You know what I mean?

255
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,640
And that was like right around the time of like drum line and stuff, too.

256
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:19,960
Yeah.

257
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,440
That was like very in the cultural guys to be on a drum line.

258
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,760
And I remember the guys with the quads and all that stuff.

259
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:32,360
And yeah, especially in high school, they went on and like, I remember being in the

260
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,880
orchestra with people who ended up going on to like teach that stuff professionally,

261
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,320
like drum line people, legacy drum line people in Bakersfield.

262
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:39,720
I don't know.

263
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,040
Mm hmm.

264
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,520
Good.

265
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,000
Yeah.

266
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,360
I think well, because he would.

267
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,960
Yeah, he was like you could do marching band in college and other but other like

268
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,560
places for competitions.

269
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,560
It was a whole world that I didn't know.

270
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,880
Sometimes it's like a cacophony, but it's like really if you can get into it, like,

271
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,120
yeah, big drum ensembles are very interesting.

272
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,680
This listen.

273
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:04,280
But yeah, there was like a whole like it was it was basically I shouldn't even say

274
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,680
it because I don't know the details, but it was almost like full on marching band,

275
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,800
like competition, almost independent of sporting events.

276
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,840
Like there were just like, yeah, like a few teams and like people would kill to get on

277
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,400
them.

278
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:22,200
And then like once you were done, like you were like, I need to get back.

279
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,160
I need to go back.

280
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,600
This is the highlight of my life.

281
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,100
Yeah.

282
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,200
Wow.

283
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,480
See, wait, because I was thinking you didn't like it really, but you but the thrill of

284
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,200
competition.

285
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,480
You I'm not saying I did.

286
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,720
I'm saying these people are in these like that sort of did it past high school.

287
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,560
And you never got to bring the sticks marching band show that never made it to the big stage

288
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,600
of the competition.

289
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,240
No, no, no, no.

290
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,480
That was Mr. Bada arrangement was not a year.

291
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,760
Yeah, that was a senior year.

292
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:49,240
I listened to that song again, like just to refresh after you had you had said that

293
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,480
it really is all it's like a lot of sweets.

294
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,960
It's like that's that's an intense song to get really builds up and then like ding, ding,

295
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,840
ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,

296
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,360
then it gets like little mysterious.

297
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,920
I remember doing anything even that, you know, as popular of a song as that.

298
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,040
Do you remember what you played in knots?

299
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,840
Do you have any idea?

300
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,720
I I don't.

301
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:10,520
I'm assuming it's just some kind of like I seem to remember doing a lot of like Philip

302
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,440
Sousa style like you know what I mean?

303
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:18,360
Just jaunty like American general sense, it's not too with all the patriotism of knots and

304
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,720
though you got to bring it there.

305
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,240
Yeah, yeah, American.

306
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,240
What I want to say about not generally though is like I love that it's just so much

307
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:31,880
it's it just feels like a dry California history museum and in the best way.

308
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,680
Oh yeah.

309
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,760
Then there literally is what's it called?

310
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:39,880
The Western Trails Museum inside a knots is an old history museum and the guy who

311
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:44,200
generally works there is like this older dude who'll really talk to you if you ask

312
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,080
him a few questions.

313
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,480
Sure.

314
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,240
One time went on about his deceased son with me for a little while.

315
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,240
It's just like that, but that's like going to a real weird museum.

316
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

317
00:12:54,120 --> 00:13:00,920
And then just like all the the the mission like dioramas that are all over not like

318
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,800
is that still there?

319
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,840
Did that ever want to?

320
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.

321
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,360
It's like I think maybe you did it too, but like kids in California, you had to create

322
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,120
a mission in elementary school.

323
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,160
Yeah, school project.

324
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,480
You would have to make a model of a mission of your choice and that was and then you

325
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,240
usually I like did a trip to a mission.

326
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,360
I can't remember which one it was.

327
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,280
I think it was one in San Jose, but like just all that stuff at knots just makes me.

328
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,680
It's like classic California.

329
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,280
It's like I'm living inside a Hewlett-Hauser episode when I'm at not.

330
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

331
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,520
I do that all the time.

332
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,440
He did a he did a knots.

333
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,320
I think he did.

334
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,520
I don't think I came up.

335
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,720
There was so much to talk about on that one.

336
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,320
But he did Gilroy Gardens.

337
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,960
He talked about those twisted trees that we talked about.

338
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,460
Oh, wow.

339
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,800
There was there was discussion of you guys got to do a Hewlett-Hauser and I'm a big Hewlett fan.

340
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,440
I even have I ever said this on the show that I spoke to Hewlett-Hauser on the phone several times.

341
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:59,800
When I got my Funny or Die shot to meet any the biggest stars, the hottest actresses,

342
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:05,720
I instead chose to try to get Hewlett-Hauser and Oslet, which then led to it was the same

343
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,120
situation as where my meeting of Rip Taylor.

344
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,800
So if that's a tea, we can table Hewlett-Hauser.

345
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,440
But yeah, definitely a Hewlett-Hauser here.

346
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,400
He does an episode about the Knott's Chicken Dinner Restaurant.

347
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,000
I have not seen that.

348
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,920
Where he walks in and starts talking to these waitresses and they're all just like a glow

349
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,400
about it.

350
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,560
And then one time my wife and I were in the Knott's Chicken Dinner Restaurant eating

351
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,000
and I mentioned it to our server who's like an older lady.

352
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,840
And I was like, you know, there's a there's a Hewlett-Hauser episode, you know, about this

353
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,200
place. And she was like, yeah, I'm in it.

354
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,960
Just like walked off.

355
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,920
I was like, what?

356
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,680
Like my drop moment.

357
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,160
Yeah, no.

358
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,680
And then people who have those jobs at Knott's like work there for 20, 30 years.

359
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,160
They love it.

360
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,680
Yeah, it's like, geez, I don't know.

361
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,360
Did he heal that he liked it?

362
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,080
He liked it, right?

363
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,960
He said it was amazing.

364
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,200
Of course.

365
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,800
It was amazing.

366
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,920
It was the one place.

367
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,720
He didn't know.

368
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,440
It sucks.

369
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,160
I hate this.

370
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:55,960
Amazing.

371
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,280
Sucks.

372
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:56,760
Shit.

373
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,240
Honestly, though, like Hewlett, I don't think he was eating a lot of fried chicken and

374
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:01,960
mashed potatoes.

375
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,160
Like he's jacked.

376
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:08,040
You ever watch some of those older episodes before he gets into like the yellow shirt,

377
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,720
older Hewlett style, like if they were doing necker toys, a Hewlett, that's like his later

378
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:12,920
yellow shirt.

379
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,120
But it's more billowy.

380
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,600
Just early on, he was in the military.

381
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,280
Like he's like, wow, really jacked in to show it off.

382
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:20,840
Yeah.

383
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,560
Big upper body Canadian tuxedo.

384
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,160
Jack really people.

385
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:25,800
He'll is.

386
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,840
Yeah, you can tell.

387
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,280
I mean, I feel like at some point I must have seen a photo of him in his 20s or 30s,

388
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,720
but yeah, very early.

389
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,160
Yeah, very so.

390
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:33,640
Mm hmm.

391
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,920
Now, he'll he would eat half a plate to be polite.

392
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,920
Like he's got a oh, it's so good.

393
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,320
He's got a pastrami sandwich in his mouth for, you know, wherever he's at.

394
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:41,720
Yeah, yeah.

395
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,680
Historical for research purposes, he has to.

396
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:49,640
Any listeners who do, but does he only people in California know Hewlett-Hauser or was this

397
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,800
because he was like a California historian guy.

398
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,440
California's gold, a PBS perennial.

399
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,480
Yeah, California's gold.

400
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,400
But maybe, but I feel like some of the cult of Hewlett has spread to non-California.

401
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,680
Yeah, certainly.

402
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,920
I didn't know about him until I lived here, though.

403
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,560
OK, yeah, it's definitely would have been somebody on my radar.

404
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:05,800
Sure.

405
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,240
Would have been interested in it before.

406
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,120
Less I think.

407
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:13,320
Yes, so specifically California, not like, yeah, like Rick Steves.

408
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,160
I think his shows are everywhere and he's written a lot of books and stuff.

409
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:17,480
Sure.

410
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:17,880
Travels.

411
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,960
Because he's yeah, he's Mr. Europe.

412
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,200
Yeah.

413
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,680
People are interested in Europe wherever you go is what I've found and what Rick Steves found.

414
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,240
That's right.

415
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,000
Yeah, I love Rick Steves.

416
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,480
I read it.

417
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,840
What was this?

418
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,440
I read it a few years ago.

419
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,040
Travel is a political act and it was like really fascinating.

420
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,440
I'm a Rick Steves stan too.

421
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,840
Yeah, but yeah, but how much can Rick Steves lift?

422
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,320
Oh, I don't know about that.

423
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,640
I'm taking Hewlett.

424
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,120
How big are his biceps?

425
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,800
He keeps himself pretty good shape.

426
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:56,360
I know he really kind of, you know, during the pandemic, he couldn't really travel a lot.

427
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,560
Sounds like you're making excuses for him not being so jacked.

428
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,720
I'm saying you can have weights in your house.

429
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,760
Yeah, you could have.

430
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm sure he was working out a little because he's like, he can't travel, but I think he kept a lot

431
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,840
of his like all of his staff employed and started doing other stuff.

432
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,240
We can get my steps in Europe is what I do.

433
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,440
Yeah, a lot of excuses.

434
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,640
I can't walk around my neighborhood.

435
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,280
We're onto you, Steve.

436
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,240
So we know your deal.

437
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,000
I'll kick Rick Steves' ass.

438
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,200
Hell yeah, you'll get a view.

439
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,400
Might have strong legs from the walking, but if we're fighting up north for fighting

440
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,560
north of the equator, I push them down.

441
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,320
Can't use your legs if you're on the ground.

442
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,480
I can break an apple with one hand.

443
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,800
I can squash it and I'll squash Rick Steves head.

444
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,960
And you'll say it's amazing.

445
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:50,360
We're here in the Huntington Beach wetlands to fight Rick Steves to death.

446
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,240
A perfect place to bury his body.

447
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,280
Yeah, this is where nobody will ever know.

448
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:01,320
These wetlands are acidic, so he'll be dissolved after I whoop his ass.

449
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,520
I wrap my fist in barbed wire.

450
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,120
Well, what else?

451
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,560
Anything else you want to bring to the table here?

452
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,840
Or do you want to talk?

453
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,560
If I can do one more, like you guys have talked about over the first of all,

454
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm just I'm a big fan of this show.

455
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,400
I've been listening since like first five to 10 episodes.

456
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:21,960
Well, thank you.

457
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,600
You're one of the first.

458
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,400
Yeah, absolutely.

459
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,760
I was trying to track down like, did I see you guys in the Craig thing

460
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,280
and then made the connection in?

461
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:30,760
Excuse me.

462
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,560
Complicating.

463
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,280
Complicated.

464
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:32,760
All in.

465
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,240
Yes, that's right.

466
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,000
My complicated pre the show.

467
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,400
Yeah.

468
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,280
Yeah, right.

469
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:40,520
But then I've so I've been to the PTR twenty three show in the Anaheim.

470
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,000
Oh, yeah.

471
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,400
Oh, wow.

472
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,400
Yeah, I was at the fries interactive installation, the legendary.

473
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,760
I mean, that's on the trip.

474
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:52,360
That's the first thing I keep thinking back to it because it was so as an observer,

475
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,520
it was so insane because it was just and then in context now,

476
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,440
it was like so close to the beginning of Covid.

477
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:03,960
So it's like the last thing, the last thing a lot of people did I got to do before Covid

478
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,000
and like coming.

479
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,080
I saw it like when I got out of the car, you were like walking in with the spacesuit.

480
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,360
I was like, oh, he went.

481
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,320
He got the suit, man.

482
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:11,560
Shit.

483
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,720
I had to rerun it because I'd filmed the video long ago.

484
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,120
So I had to do a second to see Chary Chip walk out from the distance.

485
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,960
Like how far away he came.

486
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,440
I was just like, well, it was such a happening for me, too, because I didn't know about that

487
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,480
part legitimately.

488
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:28,280
Yeah.

489
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:34,760
When suddenly the front like to like try to plan a flag and like has anyone ever talked

490
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,120
or thought about fries as themed entertainment at length?

491
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:43,320
And then we put it out there and then we get the greatest gift on the other side of it

492
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,520
you could ever imagine.

493
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:50,200
And also me walking in in a space suit wondering like, did anyone come and then being like

494
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,680
greeted like I'm getting off of a spaceship.

495
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,400
All right.

496
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,920
People actually came to that.

497
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,280
It was so nuts.

498
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,320
And thank you for coming.

499
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:57,960
What a memory.

500
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,080
I like I can't even.

501
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,520
And then also I went to the late night dirty show at the dining.

502
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:08,200
It's inspired that you bought a ticket and you gave us the you said, I can't wait for

503
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,800
some X, X, X and some body nest.

504
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,160
And we're like, wait, that's the idea.

505
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,800
So thank you.

506
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,680
What a body show.

507
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,000
It was so dirty, though we can't release it.

508
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,160
It's too hot for podcast feed.

509
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,160
I want to get into the takes they had.

510
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:21,880
Oh, my God.

511
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,360
The secret.

512
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,280
Oh, the other thing I wanted to say is you guys have talked about how the theme parks

513
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,600
have really influenced your musical taste in some way like the ambient music.

514
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,120
You're always talking about listening to music that's played on a train or so.

515
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:36,600
I'm sorry.

516
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,520
That's correct.

517
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,080
Listen now.

518
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:46,440
And like with your love of all the whatever eighties top hat bands that are play around

519
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,400
Disneyland and so.

520
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:47,880
Oh, yeah.

521
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:54,600
Yes, Alice in Wonderland, a party at knots right under a different name, broader

522
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,240
impersonation.

523
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:00,440
Yeah, yeah, but no, but like okay, so I mentioned Hurricane Harbor, which is the

524
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:07,560
water park attached to six flags in California and like so my my best friend

525
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:15,240
in like elementary school, his mom was dating a rock radio DJ for crab radio

526
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:20,600
Bakersfield, which is like the old rock like sure big radio station and clear

527
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,400
channel radio station.

528
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:29,720
He then through a promotion got like a big stack of like free tickets to Hurricane

529
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,360
Harbor.

530
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:34,760
So for like two summers, we must have gone like I sort of got like eight, ten times

531
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,080
this.

532
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:40,840
We would just drive back and forth, spend all the day in like the lazy river and the

533
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,840
giant wave pool at Hurricane Harbor, which is one of the biggest like wave pools, I

534
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:52,040
think in America and like but specifically the music that was played is like Euro

535
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,200
trance, like 90s club music.

536
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,600
So like I am now completely obsessed with this stuff and I collect these 12 inches

537
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,840
off of the Hurricane Harbor off of Hurricane Harbor, like groups like, you know,

538
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:09,720
or like Hataway or like, oh, you know, a lot of that stuff because I like, yeah, I

539
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:14,200
I think about those, all those bands that only had like two hits and like what else

540
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,360
is going on beyond the hits or like why did those like nobody knows who they are.

541
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:22,040
They're almost like anonymous bands and like nobody could name the members of Quad

542
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:26,920
City DJs or any of them too are just like an Italian guy who's a producer who like

543
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,160
finds a singer and then they make a name for it.

544
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:34,200
That's live and joy or that's like, you know, the real McCoy or like all these

545
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,000
groups, but they have a lot of them, but like hearing like also like the music of

546
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,760
the night of the Roxbury, you know what I mean?

547
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,640
Yeah, exactly.

548
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:48,360
Like that stuff has completely influenced like the music I buy the records I play,

549
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,160
all kinds of stuff.

550
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,920
It's because you have so many good memories associated with it.

551
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,400
Absolutely.

552
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,360
I'm floating around eating expensive chicken tenders, smelling like sunblock, like

553
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,600
putting my stuff in a janky locker.

554
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,280
Could you eat and float at the same time?

555
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:03,960
No, I would.

556
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,640
I don't think I would attempt that because it sounded good when you said it.

557
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,240
Well, you know, it's closely tied.

558
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,440
We would eat the chicken tenders.

559
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,640
Yeah, Lazy River.

560
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:16,520
You know, we would listen to, you know, because I would know another dream, but

561
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,560
I'll raise you.

562
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,200
I have that 12.

563
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:20,600
It should.

564
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,000
Wow.

565
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,760
Well, I got to see more of this.

566
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:27,320
Speaking of that, I just want to say in this time of, you know, Mercurial,

567
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:34,600
Mercurial, you know, CEOs of media companies, I'm a big proponent of physical media.

568
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,120
I think it's maybe the only way that you can really own media.

569
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,800
So I have a few gifts.

570
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:44,760
No, which should we have some other because you've got me stuff before.

571
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,600
This is a 70s, your record.

572
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,080
Yeah.

573
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:47,560
Yeah.

574
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,560
Gosh, this was my thank you for that.

575
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:49,880
Whatever.

576
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,360
Thanks for a little physical media for the good boys.

577
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,120
This one's for Jason.

578
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:54,600
Oh yeah.

579
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,320
Yeah.

580
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:59,320
Oh, this is like a like a 100 years of magic.

581
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:03,400
This is the trip video is a promotional tape that we had that at some point.

582
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,960
I think you said that you might have those already, but you know, a very dry tape about

583
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,720
a boat and a celebration.

584
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,440
I love it.

585
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:10,760
Yeah.

586
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:15,000
No, this box does not look familiar, so I'm excited for this.

587
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,080
Oh, just talking about like, oh, we got to buy a VCR.

588
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,240
Like we got to buy a VCR to fiddle with.

589
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,120
I'm trying to I'm trying to influence a little bit, maybe get a VCR.

590
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:24,680
Yeah, sure.

591
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,120
Yeah, we're moving.

592
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,800
So, you know, it's an excuse.

593
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,080
It's not expensive to get a VCR.

594
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:31,400
I don't know.

595
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,120
It's not really.

596
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,480
Oh, boy.

597
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:33,880
Let's see.

598
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,400
Oh, man.

599
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:37,880
Wow.

600
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,920
Well, geez, you know, you've always like, I feel like we've bonded on the music end

601
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,120
of things and you really.

602
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:44,440
Wow.

603
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:44,680
Okay.

604
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,960
Uh, Toto, holy Anna.

605
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,040
This is like not this is a deep cut song.

606
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,120
When they play this, they say here's a deep cut.

607
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,680
So you got me a deep cut.

608
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,080
Wow.

609
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,040
Single of holy Anna and Mr. Roboto.

610
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:58,360
Wow.

611
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:58,840
There it is.

612
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,560
Single.

613
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,600
My God.

614
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:05,720
I mean, I got Kilroy was here and I got I think I have the DVD of caught in the act.

615
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,960
The live concert.

616
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,880
Let's play from around this time.

617
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,480
Caught in the act.

618
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:17,160
The act of musical righteousness of talking about censorship and oh, and there's all my

619
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:17,880
favorite character.

620
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,520
This is my this might be a shot called in the future is sticks.

621
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:20,920
Oh, yeah.

622
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:25,320
Kilroy was here, so we can talk about the iconic characters like Chuck Pena.

623
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,920
So as Lieutenant Vanish.

624
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:34,440
Well, how are we not said the phrase six years we haven't said the phrase Lieutenant Vanish.

625
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,480
Yeah, yeah, I don't know.

626
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,200
That's that's deep.

627
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,240
It was in the back of my head at one time.

628
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,600
Like in high school, I could have produced that in zero seconds flat.

629
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,800
But now, well, thank you for bringing Lieutenant Vanish back in my life.

630
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,360
Of course.

631
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,000
Thanks, Andrew.

632
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,160
Wow.

633
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:47,480
No problem.

634
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,840
And then like.

635
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,280
Now, I'm a VHS.

636
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,640
Yes, but I'm really into laser.

637
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:51,880
This.

638
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,440
Oh, my God.

639
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,160
I feel like I just have some of the same like brain sicknesses as you guys.

640
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:57,960
Like, sure.

641
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,640
I love Lucy like my parents.

642
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,000
It was just in our household.

643
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,040
It was a second nature.

644
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,480
Like, I don't know, just being completely unrelatable to other kids.

645
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,480
Because I hate to you're into old shit like that.

646
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,920
I hate to spoil it, but I can see the smiling face of Jonathan Frakes.

647
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,400
Look, it's it's.

648
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:13,640
Yeah.

649
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,000
Wow.

650
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,720
First contact.

651
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,080
This is a laser disk for my.

652
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:17,800
Oh, my God.

653
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,680
Thank you so much.

654
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:24,360
And maybe the way I got into laser, I found a copy of Twin Peaks Fire Walk with me at

655
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,280
a thrift store and it's like one of my favorite films.

656
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,000
And I was like, OK, I need to now get a laser display to watch.

657
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,680
How yeah, that's more expensive, right?

658
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,720
To get a laser display.

659
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,560
Yeah, that's a little harder to track down.

660
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:37,800
But if you do, you know, I'm planting seeds of like, yeah, well, this is all you're going

661
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,320
to send us on our little well.

662
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,320
This is a display piece as well.

663
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,320
This is Star Trek First Contact.

664
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,680
This is one of the best Star Trek movies ever.

665
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,600
Maybe the best is up for debate.

666
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,440
Would you say it's your favorite or are you a Star Trek guy or you just know I'm a.

667
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,160
Like Star Trek.

668
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,040
I'm mainly like a next gen guy and I do like this movie.

669
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,800
Did you watch Picard season three?

670
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,720
I'm not up on any of the new shows now.

671
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,560
I like to I like to put on.

672
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,720
It's just I was just next gen mostly.

673
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,040
It's just funny because last night I watched like the second.

674
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:10,280
So I'm just watching scenes from Star Trek Picard and just like as I'm going to sleep

675
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,320
last night and like getting excited all over again.

676
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,720
This is like a 2 a.m. last night is what I was doing.

677
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,240
Now here's the extra special tweet for Vegas month.

678
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:23,160
Mike, why don't you go ahead and check out what the insert is on that laser disc?

679
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,920
Is it Star Trek the experience?

680
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,880
I don't know.

681
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,200
Is it Star Trek the experience ad for it or something?

682
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:28,520
Maybe.

683
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,080
Wait, wait, maybe it is.

684
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,000
Did you leave it in the sleeve?

685
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,800
It's still in the sleeve.

686
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,360
Excuse me.

687
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,960
You got to learn your way around laser discs.

688
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,920
I'm really fumbling here.

689
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,720
It's really like Andrew.

690
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,480
It's an ad.

691
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,760
That was just what was in there.

692
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,040
A poster.

693
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,540
Wow.

694
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,560
This is awesome.

695
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,280
Star Trek the experience Las Vegas Hilton for 30 years.

696
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,520
For 30 years, you wanted to boldly go.

697
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,880
Now you can.

698
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,080
Summer 97.

699
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,200
This is awesome, but also makes me sad too because we didn't get to go.

700
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:56,440
Wow.

701
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,240
It's a teaser.

702
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,520
Look at this content.

703
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,080
Wow.

704
00:27:59,080 --> 00:27:59,400
Wow.

705
00:27:59,400 --> 00:27:59,880
I've seen this.

706
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,720
It's like a movie theater where it's dangling from the ceiling and it like it spins around.

707
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,160
You see both sides of the poster.

708
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,720
This is I've never seen this version of the poster before.

709
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,320
It's the same photo of Patrick Stewart and Brent Spiner, but it's a silhouette of the

710
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,840
Borg Queen, Alice Kriegs Borg Queen, of course.

711
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,400
Borg Queen.

712
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,560
Who seduces data.

713
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,520
Love the Borg Queen.

714
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:18,760
Wow.

715
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,880
Who makes data horny.

716
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,680
And Picard I think gets a little horny too, but it's not as obvious.

717
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,720
This is incredible.

718
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,480
Yeah, thank you so much.

719
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:32,840
You clearly you listen carefully and our specific nerdiness calls out to you.

720
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,800
Yeah, really.

721
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,920
You're able to identify us so well.

722
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:37,720
Yeah.

723
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,000
Holy Ann is blowing my mind.

724
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,680
And your streams, if people haven't seen, check out King Cove's streams on Twitch.

725
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,960
Crazy music selection.

726
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,600
Really good.

727
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,720
Really well curated.

728
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:54,440
Jane and I will put them on, often play them through a gal.

729
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,760
I got her a galaxy light a few years ago.

730
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,680
If you guys remember the galaxy lights.

731
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,680
On the ceiling like.

732
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:00,920
Yeah.

733
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,160
Yeah.

734
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:06,440
Well, when someone would have a viral tweet, people would reach out and go like, hey,

735
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,320
will you put these, will you tweet these?

736
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,680
And the thing and the one was like starlight galaxy light.

737
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,760
Uh, so I, I think it was for Christmas or her birthday.

738
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:21,080
I was like, I'm going to get her a galaxy light and the websites all looked so scammy.

739
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:25,480
And then I found like, oh, you can just buy these things on Alibaba or Amazon.

740
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,000
And it's still working.

741
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,040
It's still working, but it's fun to have colored lights.

742
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:30,600
So cool.

743
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,320
Thank you so much.

744
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,520
Thanks only Andrew for the color.

745
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,480
Oh, sorry.

746
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,360
I should have explained.

747
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,040
It's thanks for the lights.

748
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,360
Andrew.

749
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,360
It's got a Bluetooth speaker in it.

750
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,000
It'll pulse with the light.

751
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,480
Yeah.

752
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,120
That's dope.

753
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,320
Our lights are fun.

754
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,240
So you just run anything through this.

755
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,120
It could be anything.

756
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:54,920
I could play a laser disc of first contact or a King Cove Twitch stream.

757
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,420
Yeah.

758
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,320
That's really sweet.

759
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,120
Thank you, Jason.

760
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:58,360
Yeah.

761
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,720
Follow my Twitch channel if you want.

762
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,960
I DJ vinyl on there.

763
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,960
Sometimes I'll watch a laser disc or two.

764
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,600
Wow.

765
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,120
But yeah, I really enjoy.

766
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,000
Gee, Jan on there.

767
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,720
Thank you for this, this pile of stuff.

768
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,240
Star Trek, the experience, one of the only things we got to before

769
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,920
Sin City Nights here, an outlier.

770
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,080
But now we're in the thick of it.

771
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:19,720
And you're OK.

772
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:27,720
I think you've also proven your love of deep pop culture and deep finds.

773
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:33,720
And that seems to be at the root of your discovery of all this, of legends and concert.

774
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,220
Yeah.

775
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,520
Which we can talk about that documentary and the guy.

776
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:42,440
But like maybe just big picture stuff.

777
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,120
I mean, we could sort of do this together.

778
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:52,680
But this has been an impersonation show that started in Las Vegas in 83 at the then Imperial

779
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,040
Palace, now the Link.

780
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,680
But it's everywhere, too.

781
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,560
This is it's in Branson.

782
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:03,720
It's in Myrtle Beach, Broadway at the beach or on the beach.

783
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,880
Something people have told us to talk about before.

784
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,440
Like their city walk, it seems like you can see it on a Norwegian cruise line.

785
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,800
Oddly, not in Vegas right now.

786
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,920
They do not currently have a home for this show.

787
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,760
It was at the Tropicana.

788
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,680
Now there's it ended.

789
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,640
And now so will the Tropicana that's going away entirely.

790
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,440
And this is also the kind of impersonation show.

791
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:35,560
I mean, the only memory I ever had of it before you brought up to us was just seeing like

792
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,320
if I'm on a trip with my parents in Vegas or somewhere else that had one of these shows

793
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:44,600
and I'm like checking out the pamphlets, I like go rifle through pamphlets so I can

794
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,760
look at them in the room and what the hell is this one does that.

795
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:52,680
I remember seeing the pamphlet for this and it's that kind of show where it's seven mismatchy

796
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:57,720
stars all on stage and all a little bit off because obviously I mean, the makeup and

797
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:01,720
costumes are as good as you can get, but it's still a little it's a little weird, right?

798
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,280
Yeah, a lot.

799
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,480
You're probably getting an Elvis.

800
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,000
You're probably getting a Michael Jackson.

801
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,120
And then I feel like I always remember seeing like a Rod Stewart or a Tina Turner.

802
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,960
And then they change and shuffle out through the years.

803
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,560
But is that a pretty accurate, you know, general summation?

804
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,280
Anything else you want to say about Legends in Concert generally?

805
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,840
Yeah, I honestly I don't even have those memories.

806
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:29,000
My journey with finding Legends in Concert and Johnny Stewart,

807
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,240
Banjo Johnny as he's known and that we'll get into it.

808
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:39,320
But like I at the original, the original Hollywood Amoeba location, not the new one.

809
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,440
Yeah, they've done fine.

810
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,240
It's all right.

811
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,280
It's all right.

812
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,440
But that original one was so fun.

813
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,120
I have very important memories.

814
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,400
High school memories for me, too.

815
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:47,900
Yeah.

816
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,120
My dad's like a graphic designer.

817
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:54,600
So when he would go to like design conferences in L.A., he'd bring me along and just be like

818
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,320
buy some CDs and I'd be in there just like 13 years old.

819
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,880
Like, oh man, hours, hours.

820
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:05,560
I'm with my wife and I are at old Hollywood Amoeba.

821
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,920
She's more she's very my wife is varla vuvum.

822
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:12,920
She's like a very talented, like burlesque costumer and performer.

823
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,400
So she's very into like vintage Hollywood stuff.

824
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,400
So she's really into Marilyn Monroe.

825
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:22,840
Her films, films about her films featuring impersonators apparently, too.

826
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,760
She's really into all the TV movies of like about her life.

827
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,120
Every single there's a million of them.

828
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,680
So I saw this VHS tape.

829
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:34,040
It just says legends.

830
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,160
Just as legends.

831
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,840
Along with some pull quotes and stuff.

832
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,760
Right. And I was like, oh my God, a movie about a Maryland impersonator.

833
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,640
We got to get it, babe.

834
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,920
You know, oh, great.

835
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,800
It's her face mainly, but you got an Elvis in there, too.

836
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,840
And that's kind of all it tells you and some like cursive font.

837
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:53,320
Ironically, not the because the legends in concert font feels iconic to me.

838
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,320
Very, very using that branding.

839
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,640
So it's like obviously that means something.

840
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,760
But we took it home and we watched this and this documentary blew our minds

841
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,840
and it stuck with me ever since.

842
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,160
That may have been like twenty sixteen, twenty seventeen.

843
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:12,360
And yeah, I guess this was this documentary is from I have it written down.

844
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:17,960
I think it was shot in eighty five, but and then maybe like existed or went to

845
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:23,000
festivals and stuff, but wasn't maybe fully released to like ninety two or so.

846
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,240
Says okay, so if you listener at home, if you want to watch this on YouTube,

847
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:32,680
it's called Johnny Stewart's Legend in Concert, the Making of aired on Cinemax

848
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,120
February, Ninety, Ninety Two.

849
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,760
That's the title of the YouTube video.

850
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,480
It's a lot of sloppiest every word in a foster.

851
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,680
Now that's I'm glad.

852
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,720
Thank you, Trina Foster, because I thought I was going to have to like rip this

853
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:47,320
because there's like very little information about this documentary itself.

854
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,720
But eventually somebody did rip it to YouTube.

855
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,680
Watch along if you want.

856
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:54,760
But like this has been in my mind, like this guy just like Andrew.

857
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:59,720
You sent this email, you sent a pile of a bunch of links about the show and you sent

858
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:04,680
the documentary as well and just with the briefest dive into the documentary, it's like

859
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,880
this is completely worth talking about this whole enterprise.

860
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,520
And the documentary is amazing.

861
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:15,240
How you said the same you said what I was thinking, which is how is this not a bigger

862
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:21,560
cultier work because it's like truly facet, like aesthetically cool.

863
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:26,760
The characters you follow are haunting.

864
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,480
Some of you will.

865
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:31,480
Listen, if you watch this documentary, you will not forget the people who you meet.

866
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,200
I want to shout out director Alana Bardin.

867
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,320
Yeah, I don't know anything else about her, but I want to say the name because this is

868
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:41,960
like I didn't know if this was going to be like funny, like an old like, you know,

869
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,360
what they played in the hotel rooms at Disney.

870
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,200
But no, this is like this is true.

871
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,240
Great filmmaking.

872
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,320
Yeah, this is a great documentary.

873
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:49,820
Yeah.

874
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:54,460
You guys, you guys, you guys all check the character, like really pushing, like not

875
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,540
just playing it for laughs the whole time.

876
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,420
Like, you know what I mean?

877
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:57,920
Yeah.

878
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:03,740
When you when you could because the and there are laughs, there are definitely laughs.

879
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:06,060
Yeah, they're fascinating characters.

880
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:10,940
I mean, the main one being you've alluded to the name, Johnny Stewart.

881
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:15,420
If you were at the Groove Blender, if you saw the live stream of the Groove Blender,

882
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,540
it'll be out, you know, soon on the main feed.

883
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:24,940
But the it was a big celebration of Vegas guys and, you know, some more famous, some

884
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:25,580
more obscure.

885
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:30,140
This is maybe on the more obscure end, but this is this is a big old Vegas guy that I'm

886
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,460
glad we're encountering this month.

887
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:36,940
He is like truly and there is no question that he is a guy just from looking at him

888
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:37,500
the first time.

889
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,300
This is a guy who founded Legends in Concert.

890
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:45,020
OK, yes, you go to this is him today, right?

891
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:47,900
He is a he's 15 years ago with that photo.

892
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:51,900
Oh, roughly in the broadest scheme of things today.

893
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,380
Wow.

894
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:52,700
Wow.

895
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,500
This guy.

896
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:59,980
So to describe him physically, it's kind of like like a perm mullet and still today,

897
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,340
like right to some extent.

898
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,940
So yeah, very much so.

899
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:03,260
Yeah.

900
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,180
You can compare it to a lot of people.

901
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,220
Same hair today.

902
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:06,540
Yeah.

903
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:06,860
Yeah.

904
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,180
Great curly hair.

905
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,860
A little goatee.

906
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:15,500
He kind of reminded me of the guy in The Last Dance, the security guard.

907
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:15,820
Oh, yeah.

908
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:20,860
Who Michael Jordan plays quarters against and who Heidi Gardner played in a sketch later.

909
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:25,820
Definitely got a vibe, just like odd vibe and kind of like weird, wiry guy.

910
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:28,940
And the eyes are intense and like and the energy is intense.

911
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:35,900
And so a lot of the documentary is is through his eyes before we talk about him in the 80s.

912
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:41,180
What you just showed is from his website, Johnny Stewart Productions.com.

913
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,300
JSP Productions.

914
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,260
And it's a great website in general.

915
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:48,220
But when you go to websites, yeah, yeah.

916
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:57,100
When you go to the about section, you see a picture of him hunching down at his ranch,

917
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:00,460
Legends Ranch, which still is around.

918
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:04,140
And it basically just is there to do like Christian weddings.

919
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:08,380
If you track that rabbit hole of the Legends Ranch, you can just rent it out to do your

920
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:09,900
godly wedding.

921
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:13,580
That is, I think, important context to mention.

922
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:16,860
And it comes up like 50 minutes in the document.

923
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,540
You're seeing all these impersonators.

924
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:21,580
Everyone's very focused and passionate.

925
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:23,260
And this guy's really intense.

926
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:27,180
And he's talking about putting on this show and the people love to see the show.

927
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:30,700
And he can teach anyone who's really a good singer.

928
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,220
It doesn't matter if they're good or a singer.

929
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,660
They embody the person.

930
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:37,820
And then he goes, and that's what you can do with the power of Jesus Christ.

931
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:43,260
And I was like, oh, yeah, okay.

932
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:47,420
It comes up in a lot of interviews, too, because there's a lot of ephemera of local

933
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,940
Las Vegas interview stuff.

934
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:53,820
And he's got a whole his own YouTube channel of interviews that I didn't really get into.

935
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:57,100
But it's too much professing his Christian views.

936
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:57,740
You laid it out.

937
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:04,460
It's like 50 episodes of a 45 minute public access show that's all on YouTube.

938
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:07,100
If I had the time to watch Johnny Stewart, I would.

939
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,580
These videos have been watched 20 times.

940
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,980
I don't want to YouTube video shame because who knows?

941
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,740
Our videos don't always do so many numbers.

942
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,020
These are viewed four times.

943
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:22,300
That's really the sign you found something in a YouTube rabbit hole is when

944
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,780
we're south of 100 in these views.

945
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,340
Oh, my God.

946
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:30,460
This is one where I wish I could enter a little time warp or something to just sit and not age,

947
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:34,620
but I could watch them all like the hyperbolic time chamber in Dragon Ball Z.

948
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,100
Oh, yeah.

949
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:35,900
Yeah.

950
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,900
You are in the space ship.

951
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:38,540
You are going to.

952
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,900
Yeah, but I won't age.

953
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:44,780
And it's just like a little rip in space time getting ripped.

954
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:48,220
And Mike is there just going like all the Johnny's watching.

955
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:51,820
Oh, Johnny Stewart weighs in on the Oakland A's moving to Vegas.

956
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,940
Is Goku more ripped than Hewlhouser?

957
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:55,580
What do you think?

958
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,820
Well, not in my mind.

959
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,300
Okay.

960
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:58,800
Yeah.

961
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,380
No, I mean, we're talking super saying.

962
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,340
Rowling or whatever.

963
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:11,660
Can I also say by financial metrics, Johnny Stewart is successful.

964
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:12,780
Oh, yeah.

965
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:13,280
Yeah.

966
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:17,580
This Legends show has run for so long.

967
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:20,540
It's so many places, so many iterations.

968
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,180
Mm hmm.

969
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:21,900
Oh, yeah.

970
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,780
No, this is not like a down in dog patch update.

971
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:25,820
Situation.

972
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:26,380
No, no, no.

973
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:26,620
True.

974
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:26,940
Yeah.

975
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,060
He's not all bluster.

976
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:32,940
The thing is really successful, but it's hard to imagine what exact what kind of success

977
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:37,580
would justify what you find when you go to his website, which is this photo of him hunched down.

978
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:45,660
And with the big headline giant font, sometimes father does know best and him looking at you.

979
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:46,940
Hey, hello.

980
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:52,380
And then you go down, especially when it comes to creating a new entertainment genre.

981
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:57,500
Take the case of mastermind slash producer John Stewart, known as the father of what is now the

982
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,900
impersonation empire throughout the world.

983
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:04,140
Then a little bit of the history and it's been Vegas, it's been an Atlantic city and then a long

984
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,420
list of shows you've never heard.

985
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:05,740
I don't know.

986
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,580
We got to focus on Legends or we'll never know.

987
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:07,740
I know.

988
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:12,700
Once you get into the subshows, it's in said, but a long list of shows you have not heard of.

989
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:17,820
And it is it is all funny given that like at most, I don't even know if you guys are similar,

990
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,740
like what I was saying, I've heard of Legends in the concert.

991
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,180
I've seen the pamphlet for it.

992
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:25,980
Then you go into the world of the guy who thought of that name and like, yeah, that's right.

993
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:26,620
That's who I am.

994
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,500
And I'm a legend, too.

995
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,100
And I'm a bigger legend than all of them.

996
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:33,100
And how much is in the bubble once you puncture it?

997
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:36,460
Yeah, no, it seems like something that would just be like, yeah, let's just put up a show.

998
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:40,700
And it's like impersonators and like, that'll be fun for everybody versus a guy who's like,

999
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:43,580
I birthed this from my birth canal.

1000
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:49,740
Like, this is a creation of like, yeah, we basically says that in the document.

1001
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,340
So intense about it.

1002
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:57,020
Yeah, yeah, there's some clips and I have some I don't if we want to like, I mean,

1003
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:02,060
understanding his philosophy a little bit is probably a good thing to do.

1004
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:06,540
And also that, you know, here's a photo of him today and the style isn't as crazy,

1005
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:07,900
but the hair is kind of similar.

1006
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:14,380
But, you know, 80s, 85, it's much more 80s ish mustache.

1007
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:19,660
Perm is crazy or mullets crazy or leather jacket with rattlesnake cowboy hat.

1008
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:26,460
With lists like a skull, rattlesnake skull in the hat and tassels on the jacket.

1009
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,260
He looks a lot.

1010
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:33,020
The wardrobe is a lot like Eli Cash, Owen Wilson's character from Royal Tenenbaums.

1011
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:43,180
And then what's even the first, I mean, maybe a big thing to say about him is that he put the

1012
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:50,780
show together and he hand selected all of these great impersonators, only the best,

1013
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:53,820
and he pushes them to be the best and he's proud of them.

1014
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:57,900
And sometimes he'll say like, and they're a dear friend of mine, they're a real friend to me.

1015
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:04,620
But he also needs to tell you at any moment that they could all be yanked whenever he wants.

1016
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:10,140
This clip might be an important one to play earlier to get his character.

1017
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:17,260
And this comes right after his wife, who was also just in full like denim tassels,

1018
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,940
Dolly Parton, they're still married.

1019
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:20,380
They're still doing interviews together.

1020
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:26,060
All these years later, I almost can't believe that given the general way she's treated in the

1021
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:26,620
interview.

1022
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:27,660
I found some other interviews.

1023
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:33,420
Apparently they met when they were 19 at a church dance in Long Beach, California.

1024
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:34,060
Wow.

1025
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:38,940
And he like within like a year they were married and have been married since they were 19,

1026
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:39,820
apparently.

1027
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:41,500
And have 15 children.

1028
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:44,300
11, two of which are their own, the rest are adopted.

1029
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,420
So they adopt a lot of kids.

1030
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:47,180
Wow, a lot of adopted kids.

1031
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:47,660
Interesting.

1032
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:53,740
So she has just given some compliments to one of the characters, one of the figures in the

1033
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:59,180
documentary, an Elvis named Jonathan Von Brauna, I believe.

1034
00:43:59,180 --> 00:43:59,420
Yeah.

1035
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:02,860
So she said some nice things about him and what I like.

1036
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:03,740
Notable Elvis.

1037
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:09,660
He, you know, there's a lot of Elvis impersonators out there, but this guy seems to be one of the

1038
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:13,660
tops and even like has his own following with his own name as much as an impersonator can.

1039
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:20,220
And after he is complimented, this is what Johnny has to say about him.

1040
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:25,740
But that show in Las Vegas, every single person in that show could be replaced in one day.

1041
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,180
Every single person.

1042
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:31,740
I never allow, I build enough molds and I create enough of the product of those molds

1043
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:34,140
that at any point anyone tries to pull my string.

1044
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:34,860
I cut theirs.

1045
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:38,060
Incredible.

1046
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:38,780
What a clip.

1047
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:41,260
I mean, he's a me.

1048
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:45,980
There's another point where he says, do you think you created you or I created you

1049
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:50,460
like I'm and then he's like I'm going to recreate the recreations.

1050
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:51,660
I'm going to recreate you.

1051
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:56,700
This is what Charles Manson says.

1052
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:57,260
Yeah,

1053
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:01,660
we create you Jack and I'm a city by a new fifty vote.

1054
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:06,060
So I found this if I could expand a little bit on his early life.

1055
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:07,260
Yes, Johnny Stewart.

1056
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:08,300
Now this documentary is great.

1057
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:13,900
Watch it, but like okay, so I found speaking of YouTube, it somehow this video

1058
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:15,260
was just for us.

1059
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:20,060
I think this interview of him of Johnny Stewart, an hour brand new hour long

1060
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:26,780
interview from Las Vegas tonight with Dale Davison, which is another local

1061
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:31,980
Christian interview show, Christian Vegas entertainers love that who also I found

1062
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:37,020
it a Dale Davis and also interviews Kevin Sorbo's wife for like an hour.

1063
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:40,620
What does she do talks about people being snowflakes and stuff?

1064
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:41,020
I don't know.

1065
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:45,500
No, literally in the interview, but like no, she like co produces all those

1066
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,860
terrible Christian movies with Kevin.

1067
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:50,940
So I guess like we're producing a new movie about the blood of Christ or

1068
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:51,180
whatever.

1069
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:51,420
Right.

1070
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:51,900
Sure, sure.

1071
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:56,860
But like so seven days ago, this new interview dropped.

1072
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:58,620
I was the first viewer of it.

1073
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:02,460
I'm like taking all these notes, but Johnny Stewart lays out a lot of these

1074
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,460
things that are a little more unclear.

1075
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:08,380
Let's say there's some inconsistencies in some of the stories that I found

1076
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:10,300
through articles and interviews and stuff.

1077
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:15,260
So basically like he's from a poor family.

1078
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:17,580
It's an entire like singing band family.

1079
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:19,260
Both his parents are singers.

1080
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,100
There's like eleven kids in his.

1081
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,620
He has like nine brothers and sisters.

1082
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:23,900
They're all singers.

1083
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:26,860
He plays banjo since he's seven years old.

1084
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:33,500
He's known as Banjo Johnny, which just feels like, you know, what is it?

1085
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,300
Asbury Jukes.

1086
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:35,820
It just feels like, oh, Southside.

1087
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:37,180
Sounds like Southside Johnny.

1088
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:37,980
Yeah, Joe John.

1089
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:38,300
Sure.

1090
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:38,540
Yeah.

1091
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:38,780
Yeah.

1092
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:44,620
Well, in that clip, they talk about we had a trailer and we traveled around

1093
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:47,420
to like the county fairs and state fairs and stuff.

1094
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:53,100
And my mom had invented like a baby, a seat that you could bounce the baby up

1095
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:53,820
and down in.

1096
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:55,340
And then it would be time for the show.

1097
00:46:55,340 --> 00:47:01,580
And she would leave the exhibition area and come do the show with all 15 of us.

1098
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:03,020
Insane.

1099
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:06,220
Like yeah, they're creating products and selling them on the road as well as

1100
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:06,540
singing.

1101
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:10,940
So I guess they're from Pocotillo, Idaho, and then they moved to California.

1102
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:15,740
After that, he wins an award on the Arthur Godfrey show as banjo.

1103
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:19,740
Johnny at seven or eight years old claims he worked with Burl Ives at the

1104
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:20,860
Sacramento State Fair.

1105
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:22,620
He said he did.

1106
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:25,020
What a boast.

1107
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:26,540
Yeah, lives.

1108
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:32,620
He said he did the Bob Hope Show, the Cliffy Stone Show, getting so cliff.

1109
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:35,020
We're all stumped on Cliffy Stone Jason.

1110
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:40,380
You know, Cliffy Stone, I feel like I don't know Clippy Stone, yeah, quick

1111
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:43,900
Google for me on this one and then okay Scott, are you ready for this one?

1112
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,420
Oh no, I don't know if you're ready for this one.

1113
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:49,420
Oh boy, does Audubon Junior High mean anything to you that school?

1114
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:50,940
I don't think so.

1115
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:56,780
Well, it's the junior high school where Johnny Stewart met his friends, Mike

1116
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:58,700
Love and Brian Wilson.

1117
00:47:58,700 --> 00:47:59,740
What the fuck?

1118
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:01,100
What are you talking about?

1119
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:01,420
What?

1120
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,220
What Audubon?

1121
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:08,300
Yeah, so he went apparently went to junior high with Mike Love and Brian

1122
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:08,780
Wilson.

1123
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:09,580
They went.

1124
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:10,940
They would go to church with him.

1125
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:17,900
Claims that either he see this is what unclear he kind of mushes this, but

1126
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:23,420
basically either him or his brother sang with early incarnations of them pre

1127
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:24,140
beach boys.

1128
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:26,940
This is such a thing that guys try to do is right.

1129
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:29,420
Yeah, I was kind of in the beach boys.

1130
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:29,580
All right.

1131
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:34,060
Oh, my brother did it, but regardless like and then and then okay, so there's

1132
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:35,100
this beach ways connection.

1133
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:40,140
Then he says he goes to Garden Grove High School next where he meets his

1134
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:41,340
friend Steve Martin.

1135
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:42,700
What?

1136
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:46,620
Oh man, I mean I almost buy it in that.

1137
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:48,140
I mean, I don't know about friend.

1138
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:49,420
He like thing is real.

1139
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:54,540
I'll keep going like it's like he so he's the he's the director of the plays

1140
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:56,780
or he puts on the plays at the high school right.

1141
00:48:56,780 --> 00:49:02,300
He then goes on to be the creative director of the Birdcage Theater at

1142
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:03,420
Knott's Berry Farm.

1143
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:07,340
Johnny Stewart was the director with the theater where for like a Martin

1144
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:08,380
got to start.

1145
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,940
He hired Steve Martin at the Birdcage Theater.

1146
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:11,740
Oh, my God.

1147
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:12,140
Wow.

1148
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:18,140
He also claims to have introduced him to Don Galvin, a famous banjo player who

1149
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:20,140
teaches Steve Martin the banjo.

1150
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:22,780
So maybe banjo, Johnny banjo, Johnny.

1151
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:29,180
So like a key figure in the rise of Steve Martin, like one of the biggest ever.

1152
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:30,620
There's your theme park connection.

1153
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:36,620
And this came upon us, my wife and I, because okay, so we found this tape.

1154
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:39,420
We watched it from Amoeba blew our minds.

1155
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:42,940
We're like, I can't find much about this guy or this documentary.

1156
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:45,820
This show is still going on, but it's on him anymore.

1157
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:47,100
We're huge fans of knots.

1158
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:48,860
We have our season passes.

1159
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:52,300
We walk into the Birdcage Theater and it's lined with all these

1160
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:54,540
pictures of shows of yesteryear and stuff.

1161
00:49:54,540 --> 00:50:00,300
And there's a section called Birds Who Have Flown.

1162
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:00,780
Wow.

1163
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:01,340
Okay.

1164
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:04,460
And at the top is Steve Martin and you go, oh, Steve Martin.

1165
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:04,700
Okay.

1166
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:06,140
He performed it very cool.

1167
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:11,980
And then on the bottom, yeah, Johnny Stewart, he's been there this old time.

1168
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:12,220
Right.

1169
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:17,420
We walked in and we were like, wait, that's the fucking guy from the documentary saying

1170
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:18,620
he's going to cut the string.

1171
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:22,060
He the most angry glaring photo.

1172
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,340
I want an energy there.

1173
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:23,660
Wow.

1174
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:24,300
Wow.

1175
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:29,980
He's he there's a photo of this man at Knott's Berry farm that you can see any time you want.

1176
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:37,020
So logistically, Johnny Stewart is a, an in theme park character.

1177
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:37,580
Absolutely.

1178
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:47,500
Like just like Papa Steve or Sad I Joe, you know, this, that's incredible for 1963 to 1969.

1179
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:48,540
He was a creative director.

1180
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:49,900
This is yeah.

1181
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:53,580
So this is like his truly his villain origin story.

1182
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:55,420
He's banjo Johnny.

1183
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,340
Then he hires Steve.

1184
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:57,580
Right.

1185
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:59,580
And then goes on to become banjo.

1186
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:00,780
The famous banjo.

1187
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:00,940
Yeah.

1188
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:02,780
Banjo and close to the beach.

1189
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:06,700
But he's like, he's so close to this like California dream.

1190
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:11,660
These people who really came from just, you know, like run of the mill, no money,

1191
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:14,380
OC and South Bay and whatever.

1192
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:19,660
Who would have thought anybody would be massive global stars who you just ran into in school?

1193
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:25,260
So he must be as the as the seventies or the sixties and seventies are going by and

1194
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:27,580
his friends are getting huge.

1195
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:33,100
Apparently he has a very short, like one line scene in the man with two brains.

1196
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:34,060
Wow.

1197
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:38,540
He talked about like Steve Martin, like invited him on set and like had him do this whole

1198
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:39,740
thing and just gave him one line.

1199
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:43,340
It was like, all right, you're done just like, like, but like that movie's not free.

1200
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:47,100
I couldn't pull the clip, but like he just runs out in front of a car and says, hey,

1201
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:48,380
stop that or something.

1202
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:48,620
Yeah.

1203
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:48,940
Yeah.

1204
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:49,980
It is amazing.

1205
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:54,220
Johnny Stewart is not like a one scene character in licorice pizza.

1206
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:54,860
Oh yeah.

1207
00:51:54,860 --> 00:52:01,420
Oh, you know, he's like John C Riley is yeah, he's always in that he's in the monster outfit.

1208
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:07,100
And then he's also this guy, uh, Johnny Stewart, you know, he came around and he hung out with

1209
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:11,340
young PTA, uh, along with Conway and yeah, yeah.

1210
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:11,660
Yeah.

1211
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:15,980
Stirred to be another one that I found in a different in at the end of the Dale Davidson

1212
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:16,460
interview.

1213
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:18,140
He's like, yeah.

1214
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:20,540
And then, you know, there was a drummer in my band.

1215
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:24,140
He had a little boy about five years old by the name of Bruno Mars.

1216
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:31,660
No, like so like the way the bit in Vegas, uh, honeymoon to Vegas or whatever the

1217
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:36,140
where Bruno Mars appears as a Elvis impersonator as a child.

1218
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:38,140
I knew he was a little Elvis impersonator.

1219
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:39,820
That'd be the connection is like, yeah.

1220
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:43,820
And of Elvis impersonators and then also hit now his son becomes.

1221
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:44,620
Yeah.

1222
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:46,140
How do they have any connection to him?

1223
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:46,620
How does he?

1224
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:47,020
Wow.

1225
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:48,940
So he's part of the Bruno Mars rise.

1226
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:52,460
Maybe apparently too is Bruno Mars almost the biggest impersonator.

1227
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:57,820
Is he the biggest performer who came from impersonator world in any regard?

1228
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:02,300
And the fan he is, I think you could now at at least one of these legends shows,

1229
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:08,460
see a Bruno Mars as part of the starlight bowl had a Bruno Mars cover band already.

1230
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:15,420
So that's gotta be a rare case of impersonator to impersonated.

1231
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:16,060
Right.

1232
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:16,700
Yeah.

1233
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:17,980
Can you just explain?

1234
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:20,460
Cause I, I don't think I know fully about this.

1235
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:23,740
Bruno Mars was doing impersonator acts.

1236
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:25,900
He was a little kid Elvis.

1237
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:26,460
He was in there.

1238
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:32,300
So you can watch of different shows of him at like seven as the littlest Elvis.

1239
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:34,620
The moon, honey, the movie, honeymoon in Vegas.

1240
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:35,820
He appears as little.

1241
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:36,780
As little Elvis.

1242
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,420
I didn't at the end of it have it on laser disc.

1243
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:39,980
Oh, okay.

1244
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:43,420
This is what I thought you were saying.

1245
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:48,140
And I was like, I just want to clarify that he was a little Elvis.

1246
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:48,640
All right.

1247
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:51,100
So, okay.

1248
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:54,140
This guy has crossed paths with all these things.

1249
00:53:54,140 --> 00:54:00,540
And then he I'm going to pull a little bit from a different Vegas interview show that

1250
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:06,060
you sent as part of your link pile, something called Vegas live with Nina.

1251
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:09,580
That was my, I think my favorite of what you said.

1252
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:10,940
I really like anything like this.

1253
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:14,060
It seems like Vegas is a lot of these things where like people just start talking and don't

1254
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:17,260
explain who they are or introduce their guests and like, that's fine.

1255
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:18,380
We don't need to do any of that.

1256
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:19,900
We're in Vegas.

1257
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:21,580
I'm in on that's all you need to know.

1258
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:27,100
And this is a talk show that's filmed in a bar that's not closed while they film it.

1259
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:28,140
This is like,

1260
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:29,260
look good.

1261
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:33,980
There's just like people like people like, you know, putting big trays of glasses down

1262
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:35,900
and cleaning and dropping stuff.

1263
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:40,060
And they'll look into the camera for a long time as if to go like, should I,

1264
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:41,660
do they tell us not to be doing this?

1265
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:43,420
Well, no, this doesn't matter.

1266
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:45,580
This is just Vegas live with Ninon.

1267
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:47,660
Clang, clang, bash, clean sink.

1268
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:50,300
So the loudest talk show you've ever seen.

1269
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:55,820
But he says on the show, speaking of the godliness too, this is also so we're fusing

1270
00:54:56,140 --> 00:55:00,060
near brushes with celebrity with Christianity.

1271
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:05,820
And he is in Hollywood and he drives by a billboard or some, you know,

1272
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:11,660
collage, whatever mural, whatever of like all of the stars that we've lost.

1273
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:13,340
Probably all the ones that ended up in the show.

1274
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:15,660
It's Buddy Holly and Marilyn and Elvis.

1275
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:20,540
And he sees that and goes like, what if you could go to something that was this,

1276
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:23,340
that was like the gates of heaven opening up.

1277
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:24,860
You almost said that one.

1278
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:25,260
What's that?

1279
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:26,300
I think you almost said hell.

1280
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:29,900
Depending on the acts.

1281
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:37,100
The gates of heaven opening up and all of like, and they're all there and they're all here to

1282
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:38,460
perform for us.

1283
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,460
And that's what gave him the idea for the show.

1284
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:42,780
And he'd had like false starts of other things he tried to do.

1285
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:45,820
So I went to state fairs with robots and I don't know what the hell he's talking about

1286
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:46,140
with that.

1287
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:51,660
That shit is crazy because he claims to have created pre the legend show.

1288
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:53,740
He claims to have created robot legends.

1289
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:56,300
He doesn't say animatronics right right.

1290
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:57,260
He says robots.

1291
00:55:57,260 --> 00:55:58,380
I had a robot show.

1292
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:04,780
Well, he was going to show at the Knoxville World's Fair and cool yeah,

1293
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:08,460
and but then he said that like there were all these mob people that like took over

1294
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:13,180
that world's fair and started trying to like tax him for fifty percent of his profits

1295
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:17,100
and stuff, and so he left and he's like and then you know, like nine people got arrested

1296
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:17,820
for that.

1297
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:21,260
It was just like what is dropping these details of the like?

1298
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:21,900
Excuse me.

1299
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:23,980
Story there is real or not.

1300
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:27,980
On X, that doesn't make anything like apparently in eighty one there was a robot show that

1301
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:28,620
he was working.

1302
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:29,020
I don't know.

1303
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:30,380
I mean, what do you mean?

1304
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:34,060
I mean, it does sound easier to hire people and put them in wigs and makeup.

1305
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:36,860
I think we could get this guy an interview.

1306
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:42,140
Listen, I didn't call it, but there's just a number on the web.

1307
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:47,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah, guys, guys, I was going to save it for the end.

1308
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:51,500
Did you call up in on Vegas live with an on?

1309
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:55,980
He's really hyping up a bunch of stuff he's got going and you know, and I got the Jets.

1310
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:57,020
You got to come see the Jets.

1311
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:58,300
The Jets are coming to Jets.

1312
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:03,100
This 80s group who did the Chip and Dale's or a version of the Chip and Dale song like,

1313
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:04,300
wow, he's working with the Jets.

1314
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:05,660
Yeah, it's the Jets and it's their kids.

1315
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:07,900
They got some big family band is that tons of them.

1316
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:09,260
You got to come and is that show going?

1317
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:10,940
Well, it is, but everybody's got to come.

1318
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:12,060
Everybody's got to come see the Jets.

1319
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:12,860
He's really sweaty.

1320
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:16,220
Like maybe they're not doing well on the Jets to the point where he gives out his website,

1321
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:19,340
gives out an email address and he gives out his phone number and just his band.

1322
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:21,980
It's not a 555 or an 800 or anything.

1323
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,500
It's just a regular phone number.

1324
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:26,140
I'm like, I'm sure the number let's see.

1325
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:30,780
And I call and on the other end of it, it's just an answering machine, but it's definitely

1326
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:31,500
Johnny Stewart.

1327
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:35,100
I know the voice at this point and just something like it.

1328
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:36,460
Just leave your name, leave your name.

1329
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:39,020
It's got that intensity and I will call you back.

1330
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:40,220
I'm going to call you back.

1331
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:43,820
And then and then it says the mailbox is full so I don't leave a message.

1332
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:49,900
But as I'm going to bed one night, I get a phone call, two phone calls in a row.

1333
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:50,620
Oh my God.

1334
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:51,420
Las Vegas.

1335
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:51,900
Oh my God.

1336
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:54,540
And I'll just play him.

1337
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:58,700
Call Johnny Stewart.

1338
00:57:58,700 --> 00:57:59,340
Call me back.

1339
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:01,580
Oh my God.

1340
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:02,220
Or what?

1341
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:05,660
Call Johnny Stewart when you can.

1342
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:06,160
Thanks.

1343
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:10,780
So easy to contact.

1344
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:15,500
I elected not to knowing what we would be discussing.

1345
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:22,300
But if we end this with any big questions for him, if there's anything really burning

1346
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,940
that we want to know, we need to make a list.

1347
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:30,940
I got to say that is one of the most efficient voicemail messages I've ever heard.

1348
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:32,460
Jason's impressed.

1349
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:36,380
I was like, it never dawned on me.

1350
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:40,060
It never dawned on me to do that.

1351
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:46,860
I feel like if regular people without the Johnny Stewart flair did that, it'd be like,

1352
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:48,300
oh, he pissed at me.

1353
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:48,700
Did what?

1354
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:49,900
Just say, call me back.

1355
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:50,860
Hi, this is so and so.

1356
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:51,420
Call me back.

1357
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:54,540
At this point, how many messages are you leaving?

1358
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:56,940
Not often.

1359
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:57,660
Not often.

1360
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:03,340
My parents leaving me one or me leaving me one.

1361
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:04,460
They're the only ones I feel like.

1362
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:06,060
You leaving yourself one?

1363
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:06,540
No, no.

1364
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:07,740
Me leaving them a voice.

1365
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:09,260
They're the only ones.

1366
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:13,420
I think now we have to hear a to the point Jason voicemail message.

1367
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:13,500
Yeah.

1368
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,740
How would you do it now from you've been inspired?

1369
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:16,860
Hi, it's Jason Sheridan.

1370
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:17,420
Call me back.

1371
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:18,380
Call me back when you can.

1372
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:19,020
Thank you.

1373
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:23,900
Now, can you do what it would have been like 10 minutes ago before you had this revelation?

1374
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:26,300
Hi, it's Jason.

1375
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:27,340
Just going to say hi.

1376
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:30,700
You're probably out or runs.

1377
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:33,260
Give me a call when you can.

1378
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:35,660
I'm around today until like five o'clock.

1379
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:36,220
Okay.

1380
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:36,620
See you.

1381
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:39,660
You know, I now I kind of understand what you're saying.

1382
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:44,540
We probably all meander on these things and John, but Johnny Stewart's got business to do.

1383
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:48,700
He's running 20 shows at all times, so he doesn't have time to waste doing these messages,

1384
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:50,940
but he does have time to call me twice in a row.

1385
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:57,340
Somebody who didn't leave a message does no idea who this is, but it could be an opportunity.

1386
00:59:57,340 --> 01:00:01,580
It's like one time my wife and I are really obsessed with Angeline as well.

1387
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:02,140
Yeah, of course.

1388
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:03,020
Oh, yeah.

1389
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:08,620
Billboard superstar and we're watching these old black and white like document,

1390
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:13,580
a little documentary clips on YouTube, and one of them at the end has a phone number

1391
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:19,420
for the Angeline fan club and we called it and it was still the same scratchy like Angeline

1392
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:20,540
fan club voicemail.

1393
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:20,940
Wow.

1394
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:23,980
And it's probably like the guy who like runs the stuff for her or whatever, but.

1395
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:24,460
Right.

1396
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:25,580
So isn't there a whole thing?

1397
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:31,580
I've heard if people like try to go down the Angeline rabbit hole that it becomes like

1398
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:33,660
she's trying to like shake you down.

1399
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:38,700
She sells you one of her paintings or shirts are like $50.

1400
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:40,220
Like the pictures $50.

1401
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:41,500
I've seen her on the street a bunch of times.

1402
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:42,380
You guys probably have to.

1403
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:45,660
I've never like gone up to her because I never have cash.

1404
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:46,700
You have to have that cash.

1405
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:48,220
Yeah, that's because that one.

1406
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:48,460
Yeah.

1407
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:49,260
That's a strong one.

1408
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:49,820
Did it.

1409
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:53,260
And then, yeah, she just tries to just all the souvenir shop.

1410
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:53,500
Yeah.

1411
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:56,780
And then there's like videos of people doing it and they just like she just takes him and

1412
01:00:56,780 --> 01:01:00,780
makes him buy her groceries most of the time.

1413
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:01,420
Wow.

1414
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:01,900
Interesting.

1415
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:04,700
Chief, the dream of buying Angeline's.

1416
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:08,220
If you had gotten a hold of Johnny Stewart, he may have had you buy him groceries too.

1417
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:08,620
I don't know.

1418
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:09,340
Possibly.

1419
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:10,620
Well, you know, the dream isn't over.

1420
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:14,220
We can all land on what can be done with this easy way to contact Johnny Stewart.

1421
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:14,540
I love.

1422
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:15,420
Here's what I love.

1423
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:17,340
Because he would have to be 80 years old, right?

1424
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,460
Around there.

1425
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:19,180
Maybe.

1426
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:20,460
He has to have money.

1427
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:22,460
He's not ever had a divorce.

1428
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:23,580
True.

1429
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:24,300
He lives on a ranch.

1430
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:25,580
There's been some lawsuits.

1431
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:26,460
Okay.

1432
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:30,060
There's been a few lawsuits, but he still has like a lot of shows.

1433
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:31,820
And he sold legends in 2005.

1434
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:34,140
He sold the show after doing it for 25 years.

1435
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:36,620
So he probably got a big, big pay off.

1436
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:37,180
You would hope.

1437
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:37,980
I think so.

1438
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:38,220
Yeah.

1439
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:44,140
I'm saying what I think is crazy is he is so still trying to like prove to someone that

1440
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:48,940
he's like that he'll go through all the missed calls on the answering machine and call you.

1441
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:50,540
But how, what, what time was it?

1442
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:52,700
I don't remember that later.

1443
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:53,900
Was it like 11?

1444
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:55,500
I don't remember when the calls came in.

1445
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:56,700
Let me see if it.

1446
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:59,980
I'm just saying there's a drive there at 80 years old.

1447
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:01,180
Night is eight o'clock.

1448
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:01,740
Okay.

1449
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:02,460
There's a drive.

1450
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:03,180
Business hours.

1451
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:04,620
That is impressive to me.

1452
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:05,020
Yeah.

1453
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:05,820
At that age.

1454
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:08,060
Maybe I'm a producer calling to finance something.

1455
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:08,620
Yeah.

1456
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:10,380
That spark is still going off in his brain.

1457
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:11,500
Like this is my shot.

1458
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:17,420
Maybe he thinks like he wants Banjo Johnny to appear to perform finally or something.

1459
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:17,820
So I.

1460
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:18,300
Yeah.

1461
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:18,780
Yeah.

1462
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:21,420
But this is not, I feel like the ins...

1463
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:25,500
It's not an insecurity that it's like tribute acts, a real band.

1464
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:29,740
This is a real act that it doesn't seem like there's much of that.

1465
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:30,860
Oh, like insecure.

1466
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:32,220
No, no, no.

1467
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:36,700
I think he, I think he thinks he achieved his dream of like opening rock and roll heaven.

1468
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:36,940
Yeah.

1469
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:39,820
I think he thinks he's as good as the original acts.

1470
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:40,300
Yeah.

1471
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:42,300
And he pushes them to get there.

1472
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:46,060
You know, but wait, just before I move on from that thought, when I mentioned him,

1473
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:50,300
that rock and roll heaven is the premise, he also says in this interview that literally

1474
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:55,340
when the show started, there was more of that, of the overlay of, he said that actually when

1475
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:57,260
it started, I played our heavenly father.

1476
01:02:57,260 --> 01:03:01,020
I was the voice of God and, and Adam and Eve came out.

1477
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:04,860
And then, so it was, it was like Elvis and Marilyn, but literally it was heaven.

1478
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:05,420
In heaven.

1479
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:08,220
And I guess that the Adam and Eve stuff just sat there.

1480
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:13,020
So now it's just like, it's just magic and there's living people in it now too.

1481
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:15,820
Did Adam like play the banjo or anything?

1482
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:17,980
It was a dance.

1483
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:21,820
I think it was an interpretive of a dance and it may, maybe it represented.

1484
01:03:21,820 --> 01:03:24,860
I mean, if you're going to do Adam and Eve, you maybe want to do like, you know, the,

1485
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:26,380
the dawn of sin.

1486
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:30,380
It's taking a bite and then, you know, and then lightning crashes and, uh,

1487
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:31,260
Oh, it's snake.

1488
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:32,300
Someone's maybe in a,

1489
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:32,540
Yes.

1490
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:33,100
You've got a snake.

1491
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:37,420
I was part of a high school play that was like the Noah to the like Genesis tale that of course

1492
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:43,020
had like the, oh, the snake, you know, the snake song was very sexy in the play, in the high school

1493
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:43,520
play.

1494
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:51,980
It was a perfect number for the girl and like the, like, you know, the, like the Brittany,

1495
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:57,340
mid drift kind of like, like, Hey, Mr. Adam, I've got something for you.

1496
01:03:58,060 --> 01:03:59,260
I remember this place.

1497
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:05,180
So I would love to do an entire podcast about the musical, the original musical Noah that was only

1498
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:05,980
at my high school.

1499
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:06,700
Wow.

1500
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:09,260
There's a, it's a really, it was, it was a masterpiece.

1501
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:11,340
Having to get permission from the principal.

1502
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:13,900
It's like, okay, we want her to wear spaghetti straps.

1503
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:15,100
Now don't freak out.

1504
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:17,420
They had to negotiate.

1505
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:21,660
The Dean had to keep coming out with like, can we get something like a, just a centimeter long?

1506
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:22,700
I only want a centimeter.

1507
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:23,500
That's all I want.

1508
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:24,620
That seemed to be the thing.

1509
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:29,900
The, the disciplinarians at my high school were obsessed with like, you can't wear baseball caps

1510
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:34,380
inside and you've got to cover that spaghetti strap.

1511
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:36,620
Like that was a discussion at our school as well.

1512
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:36,940
Yeah.

1513
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:41,820
I remember a lot of measuring of the girls skirts, which like, you know, so just the thing in high

1514
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:47,580
school where high school girls are wearing skirts and then grow like 50 year old men or walk out.

1515
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:47,820
Okay.

1516
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:52,940
I better get very near your skirts here just for disciplinary purposes.

1517
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:53,740
That's all.

1518
01:04:53,740 --> 01:04:55,500
Nothing weird about me going in.

1519
01:04:56,620 --> 01:04:59,020
It's my job to get very close to your skirt.

1520
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:02,540
I think we had the female teachers that would have to assess that at our school.

1521
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:06,860
Now maybe I'm throwing some people under the bus, but I feel like I remember like

1522
01:05:08,620 --> 01:05:10,380
old bald, mustachioed man.

1523
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:11,260
Let me get in there.

1524
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:16,700
If somebody wants that tape measure on his belt.

1525
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:21,420
If somebody like Batman, somebody wants a list of perv teachers from my high school.

1526
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:22,220
I'll give it to them.

1527
01:05:22,220 --> 01:05:22,620
Oh yeah.

1528
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:23,660
So we've heard.

1529
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:23,980
Yes.

1530
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:24,460
Yeah.

1531
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:26,140
Baker's field is ramp with them too.

1532
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:28,380
No, not Bakersfield too.

1533
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:29,100
Could you imagine?

1534
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:34,060
But this, this whole thing, Jason, what you were saying about like,

1535
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:37,260
it's that it's not just this, it's not in person.

1536
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:41,100
I mean, this is clearly so much of the drive and you saw these clips in the documentary,

1537
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:47,740
which is what I like to play here that he, he demonstrates how much he pushes an Elvis to be

1538
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:53,980
not just a rote filling out the form Elvis because there's Elvis and then there's Elvis.

1539
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:54,700
Right.

1540
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:57,580
And these are two quick clips back to back.

1541
01:05:57,580 --> 01:06:01,740
This is the interview where he's in the tassel jacket and the rattlesnake hat

1542
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:03,500
and it's early on in the doc.

1543
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:04,540
This is really great.

1544
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:09,020
I can go on that stage right now and I can do Elvis Presley and I can do him and there

1545
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:09,660
won't be any problem.

1546
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:13,820
Spray my hair black and go out there and shave my mustache and I know I can do Elvis Presley

1547
01:06:13,820 --> 01:06:15,180
and get the crowd going.

1548
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:17,260
I know I could do it right tonight.

1549
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:18,300
I'm positive I can do it.

1550
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:19,260
What?

1551
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:20,460
Jump up and do Elvis Presley?

1552
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:21,180
Show me some Elvis.

1553
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:24,540
Well, just like that would be hard for me to do.

1554
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:28,060
Then there's a little bit of, you can tell he's going in his head.

1555
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:31,900
He kind of just like fills time with pattern, but then he's going like,

1556
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:33,100
I got challenged though.

1557
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:36,860
I got challenged and I got to prove that I could have been like Brian Wilson and

1558
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:38,300
Steve Martin banjo, Steve.

1559
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:39,420
I could have been my glove.

1560
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:41,020
I could have been me out there.

1561
01:06:42,380 --> 01:06:45,420
Could have been me in 2023 still hustling through.

1562
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:50,620
But then it comes to he's like, all right, I got to do it.

1563
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:51,500
I got to prove it.

1564
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:52,140
Now's my shot.

1565
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:53,260
There's a camera in front of me.

1566
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:56,300
They don't do a situation where a person can stand up.

1567
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:57,340
Can I stand up?

1568
01:06:57,340 --> 01:06:57,820
Okay.

1569
01:06:57,820 --> 01:07:02,700
Or a person can stand up and they're going to say, they can go, you know,

1570
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:06,060
you ain't nothing but a hound dog, you know, and just do it, you know,

1571
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:07,820
or they can get into a situation where you go,

1572
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:11,180
you ain't nothing but a hound dog all the time.

1573
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:16,300
They can get into it, not not like I mean that like doesn't sound like

1574
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:16,780
Elvis.

1575
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:18,860
Yeah, it's just just louder.

1576
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:21,820
He just demonstrated at the end of the documentary.

1577
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:23,020
There's a whole sequence.

1578
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:26,860
The documentary ends with like a guy doing Sammy Davis Jr.

1579
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:29,820
Oh yeah on the stage and like about how you could see him just sitting there

1580
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:33,740
like he's watching him for a long time and then about halfway through the song,

1581
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:37,740
Johnny Stewart jumps in on another mic and just start singing the same song

1582
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:38,460
louder.

1583
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:43,740
Yeah, more like more gaudy like over top of him to like show him or something.

1584
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:47,340
So yeah, and occasionally there'll be a note just like, you know, from here,

1585
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:49,580
stand up straight like ostensibly.

1586
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:50,860
It's like, oh no, I'm teaching you.

1587
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:52,300
It's not me proven that I could do it better.

1588
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:53,340
Just singing over you.

1589
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:55,740
I'm only not Sammy because of the color of my skin.

1590
01:07:55,740 --> 01:07:57,420
I absolutely know I'm a teacher.

1591
01:07:57,420 --> 01:07:57,900
I'm teaching you.

1592
01:07:57,900 --> 01:07:58,620
I could have been him.

1593
01:07:58,620 --> 01:07:59,500
Yeah, I have.

1594
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:00,860
I have just a taste of that.

1595
01:08:00,860 --> 01:08:01,180
Hang on.

1596
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:02,540
Yeah, yeah, go for it.

1597
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:05,580
Oh, it's just Sammy Sammy impersonator.

1598
01:08:05,580 --> 01:08:10,700
I don't give a damn.

1599
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:16,460
And then maybe then I'll know what kind of.

1600
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:24,780
Blowing out the mic.

1601
01:08:24,780 --> 01:08:25,580
Yeah, apologies.

1602
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:26,080
Listener.

1603
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:30,460
And he sings longer than the same.

1604
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:31,500
Yeah, he makes it longer.

1605
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:35,500
You know, that's annoying to if I don't this is one to the I am.

1606
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:37,180
I am in a documentary right now.

1607
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:38,460
This is my moment.

1608
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:41,660
How many seconds can I top this Sammy?

1609
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:43,420
It's so incredible.

1610
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:49,500
The whole thing is a lot like the whatever happens in the British office

1611
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:55,260
that pushes David Brent to do that dance that goes on uncomfortably too long.

1612
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:59,100
And no one's he's not having fun anymore and no one's having fun watching him.

1613
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:01,260
And it's just very uncomfortable for everybody.

1614
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:03,180
It's all a lot.

1615
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:03,980
When he can I stand?

1616
01:09:03,980 --> 01:09:04,700
Can I stand?

1617
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:05,740
OK, let me stand.

1618
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:09,740
It's yeah, boy, this guy's this guy's something.

1619
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:17,260
In the clip with Sammy, he's got like a crisp white dress shirt and a mullet.

1620
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:21,180
But then in the interview segment, he's dressed like.

1621
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:26,140
I feel like I'm just picturing the poster, but I think he wears in the movie, too.

1622
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:28,940
He's dressed like John Voight in Midnight Cowboy.

1623
01:09:28,940 --> 01:09:29,260
Sure.

1624
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:29,820
Yeah, yeah.

1625
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:30,780
Like a tassel.

1626
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:33,340
Jacket and a cowboy hat.

1627
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:37,420
And yeah, it's a it's a very much is that the name of the show Dance Moms,

1628
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:41,100
the reality show or like a pageant, whatever, whatever.

1629
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:42,460
What did Honey Boo Boo come from?

1630
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:43,420
What reality show?

1631
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:45,100
Oh, Toddlers and Tiaras.

1632
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:48,380
OK, yeah, like so much about like the mom in the audience.

1633
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:49,580
It's this is mine.

1634
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:50,940
This is my shot.

1635
01:09:50,940 --> 01:09:53,020
Yeah, actually, what I'm doing everything.

1636
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:57,980
Yes, really, it's all the moms on stage astral projected into the little bodies.

1637
01:09:57,980 --> 01:10:00,860
Yes, I created her and I'm showing her how to dance.

1638
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:03,100
And if she wins, I win, actually.

1639
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:05,420
He's the he's the creator.

1640
01:10:05,420 --> 01:10:06,380
He's the father.

1641
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:07,260
It's on his website.

1642
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:08,940
All the impersonators are him.

1643
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:13,580
Every impersonator is both Elvis or whoever and him, Johnny Stewart.

1644
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:22,140
It's I mean, you can only imagine the day to day of being one of these people under his his tutelage.

1645
01:10:22,140 --> 01:10:23,500
Is also very timely.

1646
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:28,540
There is essentially discussion of a labor dispute in this documentary.

1647
01:10:28,540 --> 01:10:35,580
Basically, the performers, they're like they come to him and they're like, we want our names on the on the marquee, not just Marilyn and Elvis.

1648
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:53,340
We're the performers and he tells them, you know, who created you, I created you and then but also like there's a scene where he's just talking to the whole cast and telling them to remember how good it is to get a paycheck every week and that and basically the main Elvis in the main Maryland,

1649
01:10:54,300 --> 01:11:01,340
Jonathan Von Brana and and Susan Griffith, the Maryland who's actually she's the Maryland and pulp fiction.

1650
01:11:03,580 --> 01:11:05,660
She's the Maryland and Big Mama's House Three.

1651
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:09,100
She's been in Nip Tuck, Sible Splitsville.

1652
01:11:09,980 --> 01:11:17,580
She's the Maryland and in that episode of Curve, I can't remember which one it is, but there's like a Maryland and one or somehow she's a decade on career of.

1653
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:31,020
She actually like has a pretty good career off it anyway, so her and Jonathan Von Brana, they they ask for more money or something and he dumps them and he so they're out of the show and the Judy is very sad and well, they were the originals, but they're gone.

1654
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:47,500
So the new Elvis he brings in like so basically John Stewart, Johnny Stewart has a at some point a Liberace in his show and then he immediately starts doing the Candel Opera behind the Candel Opera thing on this.

1655
01:11:47,580 --> 01:12:01,980
His next, what it is he buys him a nose job. He gets him new teeth, it's fatty tissue removed from his face and like when the new Elvis is breaking it down, he's like you know he put these ideas in my head about my face and I already had him.

1656
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:11,500
I had him years ago and I'm just totally down. He fixed my teeth. It did my nose and like that guy's still an Elvis impersonator. They all are still bettering it at some level at it.

1657
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:22,220
He brings in another one immediately and starts reshaping his face and just like in the same era in 80s with Las Vegas plastic surgeons like imagine what's going on in there now.

1658
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:31,260
I know. Oh my God and the whole sequence with the Jonathan Von Brana fan club in the middle is like you talk about like it's a waiting for government vibe.

1659
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:44,380
That fan club thing is like fucking crazy like every year, two times a year, his Elvis fans have just a party for him where they line up and give him gifts.

1660
01:12:44,380 --> 01:13:01,020
Each one gives him a gift. He opens it. He looks at them and he kisses them and it's like all these like in a big banquet hall in a very like shows up to this a lodge kind of place two hours late and then when he comes to hours late, they say it there because they're all pissed.

1661
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:09,100
They're paying him and they're like he's two hours and seventeen minutes late. They're paying him to be at a birthday party. They're all give him gifts, not a birthday party, just a hat. We love you.

1662
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:27,180
Jonathan party right and then one of the women is just like after seeing Jonathan live with my husband, my husband got on the Navy and we got a divorce and in order to fill that void, I switch the focus to Jonathan and the fan club and like, oh my God, sing tribute songs to him.

1663
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:47,420
They sing Angel Baby. It's like the obsession he's like David Lynch in that moment of like cutting between the woman singing Angel Baby and then his his stare, his like fake caring face that he's somehow too big for like, yeah, okay, I'll let this woman sing passionately to me.

1664
01:13:47,500 --> 01:14:01,660
I guess I'm going to be late and I'm going to be out of here as soon as I can. You can see where they get the idea that like, no, I want my name on the thing because two times a year, fifty people show up and hand him gifts and cry and like talk about their divorced husband to him.

1665
01:14:01,660 --> 01:14:10,940
These people get his name. Yeah, he's not Elvis to them. He's Jonathan Von Brana and he's still around. I think he made it to Hawaii and it gets his rap. Now he's ended up in a big Elvis in Hawaii.

1666
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:25,180
I'm yeah, like there's so much to talk about just with Banjo Johnny, but the phenomenon of this in general of seeing tribute performers and seeing people dressed up as movie stars, I find strange.

1667
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:27,180
Yes, extremely.

1668
01:14:27,660 --> 01:14:41,580
Like like I, you know, I'll go see a Beatles cover band or something, but we've talked about that. I talked about this before. It's too. It's always weird. And like the last time I did it, I mentioned like John was doing imagine in the Beatles band.

1669
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:54,620
You're like, well, he was out of the Beatles by then and he's like, there was a man who knew and he's talking about himself in the third person. If we had a little more love, maybe this man would still be like, this is and it's not.

1670
01:14:55,020 --> 01:15:07,740
It's not fun in a lot of ways because everyone feels like they're in like embodying the spirit of the performers. Like I'd almost rather just see a band play Beatles songs that are not being the Beatles.

1671
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:15,740
And I feel that way about it. I'd rather see a band play a bunch of Prince songs that was just a good band versus Purple Rain or whatever, which I've seen.

1672
01:15:15,820 --> 01:15:29,260
Like my Rudolph's band is really great, but there's no, there's nobody dressing it. You don't need. You can do all the prints. It's probably better to like what you're really focused on is like, got to put my mustache on my eyeliner and then you're not like doing the songs good.

1673
01:15:29,260 --> 01:15:41,580
And the guy when we saw Purple Rain at Planet Hollywood, like six or seven years ago, the guy just seemed annoyed that like the audience wasn't very good and sort of bored. And like they sounded great. But like.

1674
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:43,500
You've seen a Prince impersonator.

1675
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:50,940
That wasn't the legend. Purple Rain. Purple Rain. Yeah. Who still like plays. Spelled Arnie. Yeah. Plays in and around Vegas.

1676
01:15:50,940 --> 01:16:01,980
To their credit. Doug Jones, who was hanging out in Vegas with us, said that the Carpenter's tribute that he went to nearly moved him to tears. He loved the Carpenter's tribute.

1677
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:09,980
I would see that. Yeah. I think they're going to be, they might be here. I'm not saying I wouldn't see it. It's just some of the phenomenon of pretending to be the people.

1678
01:16:10,780 --> 01:16:18,540
Well, yes, it certainly well, as this documentary illustrates, it definitely sends some people into some odd places. Yeah.

1679
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:30,540
When you take somebody who's maybe like had a lack of success or opportunities and the natural, you know, the oddity that comes from that and the weird feelings that come from that.

1680
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:38,700
And then you fuse that with like, now I will fix all of my feelings onto my slight resemblance to one of the biggest legendary stars that ever was.

1681
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:45,260
And you put all this together and creates an odd little, little cauldron in the human body. There's a lot going on.

1682
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:53,100
I think, I think they kind of, it kind of gets like thrown off in the documentary, but I think old Johnny Stewart might have it be a little more.

1683
01:16:53,180 --> 01:17:10,380
I don't want to say predatory, but that's too much, but like he's sniping these people because the Judy Garland, she says that, oh yeah, basically he met her outside of her a meeting and when she started, she's she'd only been sober for like two months and he just came up to her and was like you're Judy Garland.

1684
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:17,100
You look like Judy Garland and like he's just hanging outside a meetings. I would say predatory is fine.

1685
01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:22,540
Now we're expecting a call from this.

1686
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:24,540
He's too busy to go back.

1687
01:17:25,660 --> 01:17:27,020
Paywall helps us.

1688
01:17:27,020 --> 01:17:41,180
That Carpenter's Tribute Act, I believe on their website or their Instagram described themselves as like the only Carpenter's tribute performance ever on Legends of Concert.

1689
01:17:41,180 --> 01:17:47,580
Oh, you don't say. There you go. Well, it seems like Legends is like a thing that you do and then you like try to piece it off into it.

1690
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:54,860
Actually, that seems like fairly common actually made like as if there's something strange about this enterprise that you might ever want to leave.

1691
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:56,620
Yeah, how could that be?

1692
01:17:56,620 --> 01:18:01,580
If the Purple Rain guy started in Legends, maybe and then he started very possibly.

1693
01:18:01,580 --> 01:18:03,580
I just wanted to bring this up to you, Mike.

1694
01:18:03,580 --> 01:18:11,980
So this is the guy now we've been talking about the past of it like the current Legends lineup that is on the website is vast.

1695
01:18:11,980 --> 01:18:12,220
Yes.

1696
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:12,700
Yeah, yeah.

1697
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:14,220
There are so many stars.

1698
01:18:14,220 --> 01:18:16,220
The performers you could see.

1699
01:18:16,220 --> 01:18:17,260
I don't know if you would.

1700
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:19,900
It seems like there's like no more than seven in any show.

1701
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:21,980
This is the Prince Mike.

1702
01:18:21,980 --> 01:18:23,660
It's Tony Torres.

1703
01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:24,540
I see him.

1704
01:18:24,540 --> 01:18:26,300
But I also clip these things.

1705
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:31,660
It says interested in planning your own special event or customized entertainment for.

1706
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:33,580
Here's the thing.

1707
01:18:33,580 --> 01:18:37,660
Take the guesswork out of whether Prince will show up to your birthday party.

1708
01:18:37,660 --> 01:18:38,460
You know what I'm saying?

1709
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:39,820
Oh, good point.

1710
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:40,540
Okay.

1711
01:18:40,540 --> 01:18:41,020
All right.

1712
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:42,060
Okay.

1713
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:44,380
Yes, let's not leave it as a chance anymore.

1714
01:18:44,380 --> 01:18:46,540
I had a big milestone coming up next year.

1715
01:18:46,540 --> 01:18:46,940
Think about it, buddy.

1716
01:18:46,940 --> 01:18:48,940
I'd like to not say out loud, but maybe.

1717
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:51,340
You're going to have to start saying it is the tagline of the show.

1718
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:54,460
Milestone coming up.

1719
01:18:54,460 --> 01:18:57,100
Tony Torres also coming to SoCal.

1720
01:18:57,100 --> 01:18:57,980
Wow.

1721
01:18:57,980 --> 01:19:01,900
I thought about a repeat theme for this next year for my birthday.

1722
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:02,860
So that's a good idea.

1723
01:19:02,860 --> 01:19:03,740
You bring up a good idea.

1724
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:04,380
That's a good idea.

1725
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:06,380
I.

1726
01:19:07,340 --> 01:19:08,700
What have we not made it to?

1727
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:09,500
Oh, okay.

1728
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:10,140
Well, let's talk.

1729
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:11,580
Okay.

1730
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:13,660
Wait a couple of quick things still in the documentary.

1731
01:19:13,660 --> 01:19:16,780
The other, the Maryland who it seems like it made it out a little bit.

1732
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:20,700
And it's kept a career going and it seems like it was the right move.

1733
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:21,740
Yeah.

1734
01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:25,500
What a crazy this coming to a head of like, all right, well then hit the.

1735
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:27,820
I'm just happy these people had some other career.

1736
01:19:28,540 --> 01:19:29,340
Yeah.

1737
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:33,260
But I was just going to say, do you think we could audition for one of the stars?

1738
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:39,740
I had that question of like, who, if sincerely, is there anybody who you think that you could?

1739
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:39,980
Yeah.

1740
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:41,020
Who would you think?

1741
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:47,100
Because I know mine and ironically, it's something that I don't care for, but I think

1742
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:51,500
I think completely I could be an impersonator of Billy Joe Armstrong.

1743
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:54,940
You do the hair you do that.

1744
01:19:54,940 --> 01:19:59,020
I mean, there's people have mentioned my resemblance to him.

1745
01:19:59,020 --> 01:20:01,100
This is I guess I can see it.

1746
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:02,140
I find the right pictures.

1747
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:03,180
I see it.

1748
01:20:03,180 --> 01:20:03,580
Yeah.

1749
01:20:03,580 --> 01:20:05,820
And I, and the whole thing, like, who you impersonate.

1750
01:20:05,820 --> 01:20:06,700
With a black shirt.

1751
01:20:07,660 --> 01:20:13,100
It's I think it's the challenge in thinking of who are new performers who can fit into this.

1752
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:13,500
Oh yeah.

1753
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:17,980
Because, and it's tougher with men, I think especially is that you need costume.

1754
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:22,380
You need, you know, wig, you need a Kutra monst to do it.

1755
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:23,020
But I think you're right.

1756
01:20:23,020 --> 01:20:24,940
You put me in punk wardrobe.

1757
01:20:24,940 --> 01:20:31,580
You put me in, and suddenly I seem as authentic of a real low down, dirty punk as Billy Joe

1758
01:20:31,580 --> 01:20:32,460
Armstrong is.

1759
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:38,380
Now the voice, I don't know, but that almost doesn't seem as long as I can pump my fits

1760
01:20:38,380 --> 01:20:40,220
to get the punk revolution started.

1761
01:20:40,220 --> 01:20:42,380
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1762
01:20:42,380 --> 01:20:43,260
Yeah.

1763
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:46,140
You guys ready for a perfect song from a perfect album?

1764
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:48,060
It's hard.

1765
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:51,260
I know you're talking about American India, but actually that could be one of four albums.

1766
01:20:51,260 --> 01:20:51,500
I know.

1767
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:51,900
No, no, no, sure.

1768
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:52,220
I'm sure.

1769
01:20:52,220 --> 01:20:52,540
Yeah.

1770
01:20:52,540 --> 01:20:53,580
I was gonna say how many perfect albums.

1771
01:20:53,580 --> 01:20:54,380
It's just, yeah, of course.

1772
01:20:54,380 --> 01:20:54,700
Yeah.

1773
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:59,180
Um, you guys, who would you, is there anybody you think you could successfully?

1774
01:20:59,180 --> 01:21:04,940
Well, uh, I guess I gotta get a little more familiar with his go-to songs, but if I wait

1775
01:21:04,940 --> 01:21:12,060
a few years, Cliffy Stone, who has the rights to Cliffy Stone?

1776
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:13,500
Oh, I really like this one.

1777
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:16,940
A cowboy hat and a long pipe coming out of his mouth.

1778
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:17,340
Oh my God.

1779
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:17,580
Yeah.

1780
01:21:18,380 --> 01:21:18,620
Wow.

1781
01:21:18,620 --> 01:21:23,180
Do you think a little, I was going to say like, he's up there maybe with little Jimmy

1782
01:21:23,180 --> 01:21:24,860
Dickens as a recent discovery now.

1783
01:21:25,420 --> 01:21:27,900
I think immediately, I immediately like Cliffy.

1784
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:32,300
Um, I was told a couple of years, this isn't a newer man.

1785
01:21:32,860 --> 01:21:35,420
I was told I look like Burton Cummings from the Guess Who.

1786
01:21:37,020 --> 01:21:37,500
Let's see.

1787
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:44,300
And so I could, I don't know if everyone agrees, but I feel like, I mean, I would wear that suit

1788
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:45,020
for sure.

1789
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:45,820
You could, I guess.

1790
01:21:45,820 --> 01:21:46,700
That's a cool looking suit.

1791
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:47,820
Oh, I see this.

1792
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:48,060
Yeah.

1793
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:48,220
Yeah.

1794
01:21:48,220 --> 01:21:48,620
Yeah.

1795
01:21:48,620 --> 01:21:48,940
Okay.

1796
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:50,780
Burton Cummings.

1797
01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:55,580
So if they need a, a guess who, if they need an American woman or behind, uh, what's,

1798
01:21:55,580 --> 01:21:56,540
what's the other song?

1799
01:21:57,020 --> 01:21:57,660
These eyes.

1800
01:21:58,300 --> 01:21:58,620
Yeah.

1801
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:01,660
So, and he's got a lot of songs.

1802
01:22:01,660 --> 01:22:06,540
So yeah, if they, if I don't know how in demand he is as a tribute before as a character in

1803
01:22:06,540 --> 01:22:09,020
a tribute show, but yeah, perhaps him.

1804
01:22:09,660 --> 01:22:13,660
But I mean, we could also just do green day, the three of us, because there are three core

1805
01:22:13,660 --> 01:22:14,140
members.

1806
01:22:15,020 --> 01:22:18,620
So I didn't think I could be like, I'll be Mike Dern and Jason's tray.

1807
01:22:18,620 --> 01:22:19,180
Cool.

1808
01:22:19,180 --> 01:22:23,980
I can't believe that like I'm here on this episode when green day came, comes up.

1809
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:24,460
You know what I mean?

1810
01:22:24,460 --> 01:22:28,300
I was just like, because I'm with the honest I'm what's got.

1811
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:30,540
Yeah, I was hoping.

1812
01:22:30,540 --> 01:22:30,940
I don't know.

1813
01:22:33,580 --> 01:22:37,500
Mike, maybe go, let's go.

1814
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:41,100
Maybe what other kind of punk bands do you like?

1815
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:43,100
Because you've talked about punk music.

1816
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:50,380
Are you into any like, I don't know, golden age kind of hardcore music from 1977 to like

1817
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:51,260
1986?

1818
01:22:51,260 --> 01:22:55,020
Not saying that's a little more pop, maybe from the nineties.

1819
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:55,500
I don't know.

1820
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:57,900
I'm like, do I like Fugazi?

1821
01:22:57,900 --> 01:22:59,820
Are you Mike still?

1822
01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:03,500
Mike's got a big feud going still with the DC scene.

1823
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:04,140
You know?

1824
01:23:04,140 --> 01:23:06,140
Yeah, yeah, too hard for them.

1825
01:23:06,140 --> 01:23:07,980
Still warring with minor threat.

1826
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:08,700
You know?

1827
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:13,580
Yeah, I have this weirdly that you came too close to one of my things.

1828
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:19,660
I mentioned it to Scott, but like a while back in the rockinist moments of theme park

1829
01:23:19,660 --> 01:23:20,060
history.

1830
01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:20,940
Oh yeah.

1831
01:23:20,940 --> 01:23:26,780
You guys brought up this story about it was like little Stevie and Bruce, right?

1832
01:23:26,780 --> 01:23:27,580
Going to Disneyland.

1833
01:23:27,580 --> 01:23:28,060
Yeah.

1834
01:23:28,060 --> 01:23:29,180
And like there was some kind of.

1835
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:33,580
They weren't allowed in because of how they were dressed is the story that.

1836
01:23:33,580 --> 01:23:37,340
Well, pertaining to punk rock, I have another story very similar.

1837
01:23:37,340 --> 01:23:39,020
Oh, if I may.

1838
01:23:39,020 --> 01:23:39,820
Yeah, please.

1839
01:23:39,820 --> 01:23:40,380
Yeah.

1840
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:40,880
Okay.

1841
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:45,180
This is Ian McKay of the teen idols at this time.

1842
01:23:45,180 --> 01:23:48,620
Minor threat, Fugazi, the evens, the discord records, whatever.

1843
01:23:48,620 --> 01:23:49,340
Yeah.

1844
01:23:49,340 --> 01:23:51,340
Okay, so we all got tickets to Disneyland.

1845
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:54,540
He's with Henry Rollins and other members of teen idols.

1846
01:23:54,540 --> 01:23:56,780
We all got tickets to the evening, took a bus there.

1847
01:23:56,780 --> 01:23:57,980
How long does it take two hours?

1848
01:23:57,980 --> 01:24:00,460
They dropped us off, walked a mile up the parking lot.

1849
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:04,540
We got to the gate and the guy in a suit walked out and says good afternoon, fellas.

1850
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:06,140
Thanks for coming to Disneyland.

1851
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:07,580
We're like, yeah, sure.

1852
01:24:07,580 --> 01:24:09,580
He's like, no, thank you very much.

1853
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:12,460
He put his arms out in a while like he was collecting us.

1854
01:24:12,460 --> 01:24:14,380
He says, have a nice day.

1855
01:24:14,380 --> 01:24:15,820
We're like, no, we're just coming in.

1856
01:24:15,820 --> 01:24:17,020
He says, I'm sorry.

1857
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:18,380
You're not welcome here today.

1858
01:24:18,940 --> 01:24:21,100
It still hadn't done on us that he was rejecting us.

1859
01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:22,060
It was like, wait a minute.

1860
01:24:22,060 --> 01:24:23,260
We can't come in.

1861
01:24:23,260 --> 01:24:24,460
He said, yeah, why not?

1862
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:25,980
He said, I'm sorry.

1863
01:24:25,980 --> 01:24:27,820
We don't allow people with ripped t-shirts.

1864
01:24:28,940 --> 01:24:31,100
Well, we'll go buy a Mickey Mouse t-shirt.

1865
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:32,780
Sorry, we don't allow dyed hair.

1866
01:24:33,660 --> 01:24:37,340
He's like, do you have any women in there with great dyed gray hair?

1867
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:38,460
What are you talking about?

1868
01:24:39,180 --> 01:24:40,620
It's a very good company.

1869
01:24:40,620 --> 01:24:43,980
He points to Henry Rollins, Mohawk, and we say he's a Marine.

1870
01:24:44,860 --> 01:24:45,740
They tried everything.

1871
01:24:45,740 --> 01:24:46,940
He said, I'm very sorry.

1872
01:24:46,940 --> 01:24:48,700
You just don't meet the dress code.

1873
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:50,300
Can I see the dress code?

1874
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:51,660
I am the dress code.

1875
01:24:51,660 --> 01:24:53,820
Oh my God, just like that, huh?

1876
01:24:54,620 --> 01:24:57,980
He says he talks into his walkie talkie and these guys come out in little carts

1877
01:24:57,980 --> 01:24:58,700
with guns.

1878
01:24:59,340 --> 01:25:05,260
They marched us all the way back to the street and gun point.

1879
01:25:05,260 --> 01:25:10,060
Yeah, and then an armored car pulled up and a side door opens with a cop

1880
01:25:10,060 --> 01:25:13,100
sitting there pointing a rifle at them.

1881
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:16,780
What he spread his legs, grabbed himself and then called them

1882
01:25:16,780 --> 01:25:17,260
a slur.

1883
01:25:18,540 --> 01:25:20,700
What we're like, damn, this is terrible.

1884
01:25:20,700 --> 01:25:23,740
So they got back on the bus and went back to downtown L.A.

1885
01:25:24,540 --> 01:25:26,140
Wow, wow, geez.

1886
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:30,700
So this is a true I guess we left this one out.

1887
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:32,220
I never heard this story, but this is off.

1888
01:25:32,220 --> 01:25:36,060
Potentially the rock is sneaking in things that we left behind.

1889
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:36,620
Absolutely.

1890
01:25:38,140 --> 01:25:40,860
They encounter that without even getting in the gate.

1891
01:25:40,860 --> 01:25:41,980
That's nuts.

1892
01:25:41,980 --> 01:25:45,500
That's how much they had so hard they went just in their appearance,

1893
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:47,820
but you still didn't answer what like what are the punk bands?

1894
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:53,500
Well, I don't even Green Day have really transcended punk really for in a lot of

1895
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:55,660
ways, so I don't even think rock and roll.

1896
01:25:55,660 --> 01:25:59,980
That's like a relation IV or like I mean, I've heard some of that stuff and I like

1897
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:00,540
all that stuff.

1898
01:26:00,540 --> 01:26:03,900
But you know, when you really, you know, you start from one place and then you

1899
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:06,780
really just blow it wide open as far as genres concerned.

1900
01:26:06,780 --> 01:26:09,020
I think that's kind of more what's closer to the thing.

1901
01:26:09,020 --> 01:26:14,300
You know, they started out punk, but like why stay here when we could do theater?

1902
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:14,940
Yeah, of course.

1903
01:26:15,580 --> 01:26:18,780
So like the cramps version of Shorten and Bread.

1904
01:26:19,740 --> 01:26:20,780
What you heard this?

1905
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:23,740
I have not heard the cramps do the old ones.

1906
01:26:23,740 --> 01:26:24,780
The cramps.

1907
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:30,460
Yeah, the now Jason finally likes punk rock when he hears short and brass,

1908
01:26:30,460 --> 01:26:33,260
Nick, a classic song like that being interpreted.

1909
01:26:41,420 --> 01:26:41,660
Really?

1910
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:43,100
How long you gonna make us listen to this, Jason?

1911
01:26:43,420 --> 01:26:46,380
Look, they get to it.

1912
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:47,820
They skip ahead a little or.

1913
01:26:53,820 --> 01:26:55,180
Do you like this, Jason?

1914
01:26:55,820 --> 01:26:56,620
I do like this.

1915
01:26:57,420 --> 01:26:58,380
I like the cramps.

1916
01:26:59,500 --> 01:26:59,740
Sure.

1917
01:27:00,860 --> 01:27:02,540
The germs with the germs.

1918
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:03,900
Yeah, those guys are good.

1919
01:27:03,900 --> 01:27:04,540
Very good.

1920
01:27:04,540 --> 01:27:05,740
Yeah, I like to rock.

1921
01:27:05,740 --> 01:27:10,060
Look, I like to rock, but I also like to soar with Green Day.

1922
01:27:10,060 --> 01:27:12,620
Oh, so and address the issues.

1923
01:27:12,780 --> 01:27:13,580
Times.

1924
01:27:13,580 --> 01:27:17,820
Yeah, you know, and the, you know, the mess, the wars that we get into and the messes,

1925
01:27:17,820 --> 01:27:23,180
these politicians when the character St. Jimmy has his important revelation in American Idiot,

1926
01:27:23,180 --> 01:27:28,940
I think that that's kind of more powerful than anything like just a regular song could happen.

1927
01:27:28,940 --> 01:27:29,900
It could tackle.

1928
01:27:31,420 --> 01:27:34,060
OK, let's let's make sure we stick.

1929
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:35,100
Well, you know, you know what?

1930
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:35,580
Why don't you?

1931
01:27:35,580 --> 01:27:37,660
Here's here's maybe something to Mike.

1932
01:27:37,660 --> 01:27:42,460
You talk about people taking these impersonation roles a little bit too seriously.

1933
01:27:42,860 --> 01:27:46,460
And I think there's one guy who is not in the documentary.

1934
01:27:46,460 --> 01:27:47,020
This comes later.

1935
01:27:47,020 --> 01:27:49,100
But there's one guy who I'm like, you know what?

1936
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:50,620
He is having fun with it.

1937
01:27:50,620 --> 01:27:57,500
He does not seem like just a, you know, looking too much into the spirituality side of things.

1938
01:27:57,500 --> 01:27:59,900
And that is a guy named Chris Van Dahl.

1939
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:03,260
And he is Legends official Steven Tyler.

1940
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:07,500
And here's a little taste of him.

1941
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:13,420
He actually he was part of a show like an impersonator episode of Regis and Kelly

1942
01:28:13,420 --> 01:28:15,420
before the passing of Regis.

1943
01:28:15,420 --> 01:28:17,340
And here's a taste of Chris Van Dahl.

1944
01:28:37,660 --> 01:28:42,380
He sounds like David Lee Roth, though, doesn't he?

1945
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:45,580
He has that like David Lee Roth kind of way he speaks like that.

1946
01:28:45,580 --> 01:28:48,300
Like he doesn't sound like Steven Tyler to me.

1947
01:28:48,300 --> 01:28:51,340
Well, look, we're not all experts like you, Mike.

1948
01:28:51,340 --> 01:28:51,820
I don't know.

1949
01:28:51,820 --> 01:28:57,020
As far as I'm concerned, as far as the as far as the tourists are concerned, I think he's

1950
01:28:57,020 --> 01:28:57,740
right on the money.

1951
01:28:58,860 --> 01:29:00,300
Ed, you just had a picture of him.

1952
01:29:00,860 --> 01:29:05,100
I was seeing he looks right.

1953
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:07,500
He looks really good.

1954
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:08,780
I think he looks right.

1955
01:29:08,780 --> 01:29:14,140
There's to honestly though, I found two photos of him and the real Steven Tyler,

1956
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:16,780
and in both cases I went to him first.

1957
01:29:16,780 --> 01:29:19,740
In both cases, I was like there's Steven.

1958
01:29:19,740 --> 01:29:24,700
No wait, there's he like maybe is a little more Steven and even he put up like a picture

1959
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:28,380
of him and Steven Tyler on his Instagram, and he's like rest up.

1960
01:29:28,380 --> 01:29:33,260
Get well soon, brother, like when he went back in the rehab, like he's been going through

1961
01:29:33,260 --> 01:29:37,180
for 30 years, but when it happens to him, it basically happens to me.

1962
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:39,180
I carry that.

1963
01:29:39,180 --> 01:29:40,460
I got to send my physical.

1964
01:29:40,460 --> 01:29:41,820
I got to do the steps myself.

1965
01:29:43,180 --> 01:29:46,380
I have to get sober just to put that energy out back into the world to him.

1966
01:29:47,980 --> 01:29:49,980
How does this sound like Steven Tyler to you, Mike?

1967
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:51,340
Is this pretty close?

1968
01:29:51,340 --> 01:29:52,460
That's good.

1969
01:29:52,460 --> 01:29:53,260
Well, I don't know.

1970
01:29:53,260 --> 01:29:54,140
It's gonna be a little bit.

1971
01:29:54,140 --> 01:29:56,300
But like, okay, that's better.

1972
01:29:56,300 --> 01:29:57,420
Yeah, that's better.

1973
01:29:57,420 --> 01:29:58,700
Okay, so I could do that too.

1974
01:29:58,700 --> 01:29:59,420
I could be a student.

1975
01:29:59,420 --> 01:30:01,500
Andrew, do you like the song jaded by Aerosmith?

1976
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:05,820
No, I'm not a fan of Aerosmith.

1977
01:30:05,820 --> 01:30:11,420
Listen, like when I was like, I made a point to not be like, you know, taste is subjective

1978
01:30:11,420 --> 01:30:13,580
and I can't yuck people's yum.

1979
01:30:13,580 --> 01:30:17,260
And especially with music, I live a lot of weird far out shit that people don't like.

1980
01:30:17,260 --> 01:30:19,980
Yeah, so like now I'm in a better place with it.

1981
01:30:19,980 --> 01:30:24,460
You know, I'm not going to make fun of you for liking Green Day or Aerosmith.

1982
01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:29,020
You know, sugar raise cover of Abra Kadabra is something that is pretty good.

1983
01:30:29,660 --> 01:30:35,820
I did remember, like in high school one time, one of the bands I was in, we went over to

1984
01:30:35,820 --> 01:30:40,620
record at this guy's house who we knew from school, and he had like a little garage studio

1985
01:30:40,620 --> 01:30:45,900
set up and he had all these like Weezer posters up and we like laid into him for it.

1986
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:47,660
And that was before they got bad.

1987
01:30:47,660 --> 01:30:49,660
No, I mean, that's just for Weezer.

1988
01:30:49,660 --> 01:30:53,420
We were just, you know, we were little assholes about stuff like that back then, but not now.

1989
01:30:53,420 --> 01:30:55,260
I wouldn't make fun of you for liking Weezer.

1990
01:30:55,260 --> 01:30:55,760
Sure.

1991
01:30:56,540 --> 01:30:57,180
You wouldn't?

1992
01:30:57,180 --> 01:30:58,140
Are you sure?

1993
01:30:58,140 --> 01:30:58,700
Of course not.

1994
01:30:59,820 --> 01:31:00,700
I mean, just feel free.

1995
01:31:00,700 --> 01:31:01,340
You're our guest.

1996
01:31:01,340 --> 01:31:07,020
And if you if it struck you to do so, I mean, you know, I just have you.

1997
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:09,500
Have you thought about getting tickets to their new to their tour?

1998
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:11,340
You think this is for the new Weezer tour?

1999
01:31:11,340 --> 01:31:12,060
I actually pretty good.

2000
01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:13,740
I was talking to Doug Jones about this.

2001
01:31:13,740 --> 01:31:16,380
They're doing like I just threw out the love of my dreams and stuff.

2002
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:19,260
Some good like Pinkerton B sides and stuff.

2003
01:31:19,260 --> 01:31:20,300
Long time sunshine.

2004
01:31:20,300 --> 01:31:24,380
I think this is an arena tour, you know, they're not doing Billy Jean.

2005
01:31:25,340 --> 01:31:26,220
I got to Billy Jean.

2006
01:31:26,220 --> 01:31:29,660
I don't know if Billy Jean's on the revolutionary cover of Billie Jean.

2007
01:31:29,660 --> 01:31:30,300
I don't think so.

2008
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:32,860
They probably do in Africa, though, because that was actually a hit.

2009
01:31:32,860 --> 01:31:33,660
Africa.

2010
01:31:33,660 --> 01:31:34,460
They're stuck with it.

2011
01:31:34,460 --> 01:31:34,700
Yeah.

2012
01:31:34,700 --> 01:31:36,220
Yeah, that's their song now.

2013
01:31:36,220 --> 01:31:37,580
As far as people are concerned.

2014
01:31:38,460 --> 01:31:43,420
I just made a connection, by the way, talking about Steven Tyler and the Steven Tyler impersonator.

2015
01:31:43,420 --> 01:31:49,180
There was there would have been a short time where Aerosmith is doing a residency at the Dolby

2016
01:31:49,980 --> 01:31:56,060
Live at the Park MGM and a few blocks down Las Vegas Boulevard at the Tropicana

2017
01:31:56,060 --> 01:31:58,700
you could see that Steven Tyler impersonator.

2018
01:31:59,420 --> 01:32:03,180
Like they could run into each other at the CVS in theory.

2019
01:32:03,180 --> 01:32:04,940
They could run into each other.

2020
01:32:04,940 --> 01:32:07,580
Steven Tyler goes to the CVS.

2021
01:32:07,580 --> 01:32:10,140
Only one of them may actually have to do it himself.

2022
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:11,900
I think that's the only difference.

2023
01:32:11,900 --> 01:32:12,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2024
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:13,100
It's possible.

2025
01:32:13,100 --> 01:32:13,500
You're right.

2026
01:32:14,220 --> 01:32:18,780
The Steven Tyler's could meet at the CVS and Prince could have gone to Mike's birthday party.

2027
01:32:18,780 --> 01:32:22,220
Assuming the rock stars are just walking down crowded streets by themselves.

2028
01:32:22,220 --> 01:32:22,620
Yeah.

2029
01:32:22,620 --> 01:32:24,300
Then yeah, these things are possible.

2030
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:25,580
I'm glad we all believe in that.

2031
01:32:25,580 --> 01:32:30,860
Bloxers, you know, they seem sometimes they seem like bigger dividers than they are.

2032
01:32:30,860 --> 01:32:32,220
You know, it could only take a few minutes.

2033
01:32:32,220 --> 01:32:33,900
There's a long sense to do so high.

2034
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:36,380
They seem like bigger dividers than they are.

2035
01:32:36,380 --> 01:32:38,940
You know, sometimes Bloxers.

2036
01:32:38,940 --> 01:32:39,820
Mickey Mouse, yeah.

2037
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:41,260
You asked for it.

2038
01:32:41,260 --> 01:32:46,460
Hey, meet me in front of the New York, New York Statue of Liberty and we'll take a picture.

2039
01:32:47,260 --> 01:32:49,740
People are going to know which is which and they're not going to know if we're in front

2040
01:32:49,740 --> 01:32:51,420
of the real statue, man.

2041
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:52,540
It's a blow in minds.

2042
01:32:52,540 --> 01:32:53,660
It's rock and roll, baby.

2043
01:32:54,300 --> 01:32:56,380
It's equidistant from our venues.

2044
01:32:58,860 --> 01:33:01,980
We can stop in the Shake Shack right next door.

2045
01:33:01,980 --> 01:33:03,180
I want this to keep going.

2046
01:33:03,980 --> 01:33:05,020
What else they talk about?

2047
01:33:05,020 --> 01:33:06,940
What else they do making plans together?

2048
01:33:08,620 --> 01:33:09,980
Do you want to go to Hawkinson?

2049
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:14,140
I got on the list for the Hawkinson nightclub at MGM Grand.

2050
01:33:14,140 --> 01:33:16,620
Is that one equidistant or is that one a little closer to me?

2051
01:33:16,620 --> 01:33:17,120
Yeah.

2052
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:18,620
I need to think about these things.

2053
01:33:18,620 --> 01:33:20,780
I don't want you to have broken up those famous feet, man.

2054
01:33:20,780 --> 01:33:22,780
The longitude and latitude.

2055
01:33:22,780 --> 01:33:23,900
I need a little treat.

2056
01:33:23,900 --> 01:33:25,660
I'm going to the Hershey's store.

2057
01:33:27,420 --> 01:33:29,340
He's sounding a lot like Jason right now.

2058
01:33:31,580 --> 01:33:32,140
Jason.

2059
01:33:32,140 --> 01:33:33,660
Jason could do Steven Tyler, maybe.

2060
01:33:33,660 --> 01:33:34,780
I think that's what we're learning.

2061
01:33:34,780 --> 01:33:35,820
Oh, OK.

2062
01:33:35,820 --> 01:33:37,740
Actually, you'd be surprised.

2063
01:33:37,740 --> 01:33:38,380
Pretty close.

2064
01:33:38,380 --> 01:33:39,500
Just get enough scarves on him.

2065
01:33:40,780 --> 01:33:41,180
OK.

2066
01:33:41,180 --> 01:33:42,780
What else in this world?

2067
01:33:42,780 --> 01:33:50,060
I mean, in terms of the show itself, do we find any other interesting characters or like,

2068
01:33:50,700 --> 01:33:52,860
if you see that show, they have this?

2069
01:33:52,860 --> 01:33:54,460
You're going to find a lot of Gaga's.

2070
01:33:54,460 --> 01:33:55,980
It's going to be like Gaga's for sure.

2071
01:33:55,980 --> 01:33:56,480
Britney.

2072
01:33:58,060 --> 01:33:59,100
For sure, Britney's.

2073
01:34:01,260 --> 01:34:02,300
Let's stay on you, Mike.

2074
01:34:02,300 --> 01:34:03,820
The spotlight's on you.

2075
01:34:03,820 --> 01:34:04,620
There is a Buffett.

2076
01:34:04,620 --> 01:34:04,940
Yeah.

2077
01:34:04,940 --> 01:34:06,060
There is a Buffett.

2078
01:34:06,060 --> 01:34:11,180
Barry Cunningham, who is also a Neil Diamond and sometimes a Neil Young.

2079
01:34:12,540 --> 01:34:13,260
There he is.

2080
01:34:13,260 --> 01:34:14,300
Barry Cunningham.

2081
01:34:14,300 --> 01:34:16,220
I watched a minute of Barry Cunningham.

2082
01:34:16,220 --> 01:34:16,700
Yeah.

2083
01:34:16,700 --> 01:34:22,060
And I have to say, this is the closest an impersonator has ever come to the real thing

2084
01:34:22,060 --> 01:34:22,860
in my eyes.

2085
01:34:22,860 --> 01:34:27,820
This is exactly the same as the same wardrobe on him and the girls.

2086
01:34:27,820 --> 01:34:33,820
It is the same like Jif of a cheeseburger rotating around on the screen,

2087
01:34:33,820 --> 01:34:36,140
display the same looping beach footage.

2088
01:34:36,860 --> 01:34:41,180
The voices it's because Jimmy, especially singing live, like he kind of shouts thing

2089
01:34:41,180 --> 01:34:45,260
like it seems like it would be the easiest one to imitate of all of these performers.

2090
01:34:45,260 --> 01:34:46,460
I was thinking the same thing.

2091
01:34:46,460 --> 01:34:51,020
And like that whole the cottage industry created around the Parrothead people is that

2092
01:34:51,020 --> 01:34:53,660
they all have a steel drum band that plays.

2093
01:34:53,660 --> 01:34:56,460
Yes, they're all chop rock, all of them are chop rock people.

2094
01:34:56,460 --> 01:35:01,660
So it's like it fits so well into his thing the same way like Grateful Dead bands,

2095
01:35:01,660 --> 01:35:03,260
like bands that just play the Grateful Dead.

2096
01:35:03,260 --> 01:35:08,140
Like I've seen quite a few of a Cuban sis and like Owsley's Owls and like all these

2097
01:35:08,140 --> 01:35:11,180
like it goes into the kind of the culture of it.

2098
01:35:11,180 --> 01:35:13,260
So like that stuff is a pretty one to one.

2099
01:35:13,260 --> 01:35:16,780
Like I think Barry Cunningham is probably cleaning up doing.

2100
01:35:16,780 --> 01:35:20,860
Yeah, well, especially because he's got genuine members of the coral reefer band.

2101
01:35:21,020 --> 01:35:24,380
As part of his show, he's got Roger Bartlett and Fingers Taylor.

2102
01:35:25,260 --> 01:35:26,860
You tell me he got fingers Taylor.

2103
01:35:26,860 --> 01:35:28,060
You got fingers.

2104
01:35:28,060 --> 01:35:31,820
Yeah, he got when you hear that guitar, you hear those fingers.

2105
01:35:31,820 --> 01:35:33,340
Those are from those are fingers fingers.

2106
01:35:33,340 --> 01:35:34,540
I fired fingers.

2107
01:35:36,940 --> 01:35:38,060
That's the board nation.

2108
01:35:39,740 --> 01:35:43,340
Anybody in the coral reefer band, they could go just like that.

2109
01:35:43,900 --> 01:35:46,940
They pass off to me and I pull the strap, cut the strings.

2110
01:35:47,740 --> 01:35:49,660
He ain't he ain't using catch it.

2111
01:35:49,660 --> 01:35:51,660
The right catch up when he's eating dinner.

2112
01:35:51,660 --> 01:35:52,300
So he's gone.

2113
01:35:52,860 --> 01:35:53,980
I cut the strings.

2114
01:35:54,540 --> 01:35:57,020
Did you say he's working with an impersonator now?

2115
01:35:57,020 --> 01:35:59,260
That son of a bitch still making money off of me.

2116
01:36:00,380 --> 01:36:05,660
I got Roger Bartlett refused to get his face refashioned in mine.

2117
01:36:05,660 --> 01:36:10,620
He refused to get his hair shaved to be mostly bald like me and Frank.

2118
01:36:10,620 --> 01:36:11,980
Like me, my best friend Frank.

2119
01:36:11,980 --> 01:36:16,380
I've been trying to get my backup singers to get plastic surgery to look like parrot women

2120
01:36:16,380 --> 01:36:23,500
and to get a beacon installed on my ladies will get their noses reshaped into beaks.

2121
01:36:24,220 --> 01:36:26,620
I say it makes you more beautiful.

2122
01:36:26,620 --> 01:36:28,060
Everybody thinks bird is beautiful.

2123
01:36:28,060 --> 01:36:30,700
Everybody thinks one is beautiful and putting together a beauty.

2124
01:36:30,700 --> 01:36:33,260
I got a mad doctor on an island who will do it.

2125
01:36:33,260 --> 01:36:34,940
Yeah, they won't.

2126
01:36:34,940 --> 01:36:36,140
They won't take me up on it.

2127
01:36:36,140 --> 01:36:36,940
I can't go fix it.

2128
01:36:36,940 --> 01:36:38,620
So you lay eggs too.

2129
01:36:38,620 --> 01:36:41,900
Yeah, no one wants to meet on the road.

2130
01:36:41,900 --> 01:36:43,740
No one wants to meet Dr. Muro.

2131
01:36:47,180 --> 01:36:51,740
Yeah, Jimmy, you know, he has had a couple of health issues in the last few years, so

2132
01:36:52,300 --> 01:36:53,900
he may just have to hire Barry.

2133
01:36:53,900 --> 01:36:56,620
Is Barry Cunningham praying for him on his Instagram?

2134
01:36:56,620 --> 01:36:59,420
Barry, oddly quiet about Jimmy's health issues.

2135
01:36:59,420 --> 01:37:01,180
Barry, how much do you do?

2136
01:37:01,180 --> 01:37:04,460
Are you only playing him because you look like him and you'll switch to Neil Diamond

2137
01:37:04,460 --> 01:37:05,740
at the drop of a hat?

2138
01:37:05,740 --> 01:37:07,180
How in how in are you?

2139
01:37:07,180 --> 01:37:08,220
Disgusting.

2140
01:37:08,220 --> 01:37:11,100
In your adventures in Parrot Dice, your show.

2141
01:37:11,740 --> 01:37:12,700
Is it Parrot Dice?

2142
01:37:12,700 --> 01:37:13,980
Parrot Dice.

2143
01:37:13,980 --> 01:37:14,480
Nice.

2144
01:37:15,180 --> 01:37:16,140
That's the funniest thing.

2145
01:37:16,380 --> 01:37:19,340
Great name and a great idea for a product for Jimmy.

2146
01:37:19,340 --> 01:37:20,940
Dice with parrots on them.

2147
01:37:20,940 --> 01:37:21,340
Yeah.

2148
01:37:21,340 --> 01:37:22,620
Oh, I rolled a six.

2149
01:37:22,620 --> 01:37:23,580
Squawk, squawk, squawk.

2150
01:37:23,580 --> 01:37:24,860
Here it is, parrot, hey.

2151
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:27,660
Or like how to describe like one of their salads.

2152
01:37:28,300 --> 01:37:30,220
It's parrot dice, tomatoes.

2153
01:37:30,220 --> 01:37:31,180
Oh, that is good.

2154
01:37:31,180 --> 01:37:31,680
Yeah.

2155
01:37:36,220 --> 01:37:43,500
We also got, Andrew, I know you went down the rabbit hole of an important area that

2156
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:47,260
they've long represented in this show and that is the Blues Brothers.

2157
01:37:47,980 --> 01:37:49,980
We love our Blues Brothers impersonators.

2158
01:37:50,860 --> 01:37:52,700
We love them in the original Groove Blender.

2159
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:57,420
We love them anywhere because, you know, you're talking impersonations.

2160
01:37:57,420 --> 01:37:59,420
You know, you're the ones that you see all the time.

2161
01:37:59,420 --> 01:38:03,020
You're you're Michael Jackson's, you're Whitney's, you're Freddie Mercury's.

2162
01:38:03,020 --> 01:38:04,060
Big deal.

2163
01:38:04,060 --> 01:38:05,420
Dime a dozen.

2164
01:38:05,420 --> 01:38:09,020
Anybody can, you know, get up there and put a mustache on and.

2165
01:38:09,980 --> 01:38:18,220
But to be two out of shape guys hopping around asymmetrically to hop on one leg and shake

2166
01:38:18,220 --> 01:38:26,860
your hands with the other in a raw way and to go like, you know, like I will always love you.

2167
01:38:26,860 --> 01:38:28,460
We've been watching this song for anybody.

2168
01:38:29,100 --> 01:38:31,260
We could all do it after the show's over.

2169
01:38:31,260 --> 01:38:33,900
But to go like dip, dip, dip, dip.

2170
01:38:33,900 --> 01:38:34,400
Yeah.

2171
01:38:36,060 --> 01:38:37,980
This is otherworldly talent.

2172
01:38:37,980 --> 01:38:42,540
And it's just, you know, being that we've lost John, we lost brother John, we lost John.

2173
01:38:42,540 --> 01:38:47,180
So I'm so that people that people are keeping the franchise alive is so important.

2174
01:38:47,180 --> 01:38:51,180
So this is a different though tribute band than the official Dan Aykroyd

2175
01:38:51,180 --> 01:38:53,020
owned Blues Brothers tribute band.

2176
01:38:53,020 --> 01:38:53,740
You might know this.

2177
01:38:53,740 --> 01:38:55,660
You know, the man of the lineage.

2178
01:38:55,660 --> 01:38:56,700
I think it seems different.

2179
01:38:56,700 --> 01:38:58,780
What's the legal breakdown?

2180
01:38:58,780 --> 01:39:01,420
I think you're right because when you guys had talked about it before,

2181
01:39:01,420 --> 01:39:07,020
I think it was that like Belushi like licenses or does something.

2182
01:39:07,020 --> 01:39:08,060
There's an official.

2183
01:39:08,060 --> 01:39:10,780
Yeah, there is because they have Blues Brothers con that was in Illinois.

2184
01:39:10,780 --> 01:39:12,220
And we talked about that, I think last year.

2185
01:39:12,220 --> 01:39:12,700
Yeah.

2186
01:39:12,700 --> 01:39:16,060
And on the website, it's he does the Blues Brothers revival.

2187
01:39:16,060 --> 01:39:16,220
Right.

2188
01:39:16,220 --> 01:39:18,620
So this is an unofficial Blues Brothers.

2189
01:39:19,420 --> 01:39:20,460
Parade and our parody.

2190
01:39:20,460 --> 01:39:24,380
Well, look, it's before they set up the rules, you know, before they put up these,

2191
01:39:24,380 --> 01:39:28,140
before the Belushi estate put up these limits and laws.

2192
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:32,380
So, so yeah, they, I'm not sure if these people have been personally

2193
01:39:33,180 --> 01:39:36,780
selected and supervised by Judith Belushi.

2194
01:39:36,780 --> 01:39:37,900
Judith and Danny.

2195
01:39:37,900 --> 01:39:38,700
Yeah, I don't know.

2196
01:39:39,420 --> 01:39:41,180
But if you're looking for that, I don't think they have.

2197
01:39:41,180 --> 01:39:43,660
So I think there's you're going to you're not going to get that authenticity.

2198
01:39:43,660 --> 01:39:48,700
You will because we've also noticed that Dan and Jim will still go on the road as the

2199
01:39:48,700 --> 01:39:53,180
Blues Brothers, but they will also officially send out their tribute act.

2200
01:39:53,180 --> 01:39:56,540
So you have to make sure when you're looking at whatever casino they're playing,

2201
01:39:56,540 --> 01:40:00,780
you have to make sure it's Jim and Danny versus just a tribute.

2202
01:40:00,780 --> 01:40:02,140
Now, maybe you don't care about seeing that.

2203
01:40:02,140 --> 01:40:03,900
You just want to see this great songs.

2204
01:40:04,860 --> 01:40:06,060
The great songs.

2205
01:40:06,060 --> 01:40:11,340
So, but so there are many blues brothers, soul man, all the great blues brothers.

2206
01:40:11,340 --> 01:40:13,100
Sweet home Chicago.

2207
01:40:13,100 --> 01:40:14,460
The great blues brothers songs.

2208
01:40:14,460 --> 01:40:14,940
Yeah, right.

2209
01:40:14,940 --> 01:40:18,700
To hear a two note harmonica solo, you know.

2210
01:40:18,700 --> 01:40:18,940
Yeah.

2211
01:40:20,460 --> 01:40:24,780
So, so I think, yeah, I think this is not official and.

2212
01:40:24,780 --> 01:40:27,420
So are you banning it from being discussed further?

2213
01:40:27,420 --> 01:40:29,740
Yeah, I'm a little upset actually, the more I talk about it.

2214
01:40:29,740 --> 01:40:31,020
This is an oddly.

2215
01:40:31,260 --> 01:40:33,580
Money out of Dan Danny's mouth.

2216
01:40:33,580 --> 01:40:38,300
It means less vodka crowd seed money for everybody.

2217
01:40:38,300 --> 01:40:38,540
Right.

2218
01:40:39,260 --> 01:40:43,740
In terms of impersonation, they're doing like two levels because they were impersonating

2219
01:40:43,740 --> 01:40:47,740
the characters, but also the actors doing the characters.

2220
01:40:47,740 --> 01:40:48,460
No, exactly.

2221
01:40:48,460 --> 01:40:50,860
That's why that's exactly why it's it's harder.

2222
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:52,380
The moonwalk.

2223
01:40:52,380 --> 01:40:53,500
That's a magic trick.

2224
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:56,620
You spend enough time watching tutorials.

2225
01:40:56,620 --> 01:40:57,740
You'll figure that out.

2226
01:40:57,740 --> 01:40:59,260
You figure it out at the end of the day.

2227
01:40:59,260 --> 01:41:01,820
When he leans really hard, that's just he's got a thing.

2228
01:41:01,820 --> 01:41:03,420
He's got a little peg that comes up.

2229
01:41:03,420 --> 01:41:04,140
It's got a peg on his shoe.

2230
01:41:04,140 --> 01:41:04,460
We all know that.

2231
01:41:04,460 --> 01:41:05,420
We've seen it bring the diagram.

2232
01:41:05,420 --> 01:41:07,340
Yeah, you can just buy that, but the blues.

2233
01:41:07,340 --> 01:41:13,420
You can't buy the ability to run at each other and chest bump half a foot off the ground.

2234
01:41:13,420 --> 01:41:13,980
Yeah.

2235
01:41:13,980 --> 01:41:15,020
Yeah, that's why.

2236
01:41:15,020 --> 01:41:17,340
That's why you need the official John and Danny magic.

2237
01:41:17,340 --> 01:41:20,700
Do I think John and Dan, are there any Jim and Danny, are these,

2238
01:41:20,700 --> 01:41:25,340
we think there's a date on the schedule or they think like, are they still going to play?

2239
01:41:25,340 --> 01:41:25,980
I would love to.

2240
01:41:25,980 --> 01:41:26,540
I, I.

2241
01:41:26,540 --> 01:41:27,660
What are you asking?

2242
01:41:27,660 --> 01:41:31,660
I'm saying is there like, if I look right now in the future, in the next few months,

2243
01:41:31,660 --> 01:41:34,700
do you think Danny and Jim are going on the road as the Blues Brothers?

2244
01:41:34,700 --> 01:41:35,900
I don't know the answer to this.

2245
01:41:35,900 --> 01:41:40,460
Well, Jim's got a weed business now and a TV show about that weed business.

2246
01:41:40,460 --> 01:41:41,180
That might be.

2247
01:41:41,180 --> 01:41:42,620
Have any of you tried to watch that show?

2248
01:41:43,420 --> 01:41:44,940
I've seen bits and pieces.

2249
01:41:44,940 --> 01:41:45,420
Is it?

2250
01:41:45,420 --> 01:41:47,260
Yeah, it's not interesting.

2251
01:41:47,260 --> 01:41:50,140
I find that a piece of media starring Jim Belushi.

2252
01:41:50,940 --> 01:41:52,140
I'll never believe it.

2253
01:41:52,620 --> 01:41:53,120
Hmm.

2254
01:41:54,220 --> 01:41:59,020
Someone very nicely offered to send me some once and I'm like, please don't mail marijuana

2255
01:41:59,020 --> 01:42:01,900
across eight lines for the sake of a podcast bed.

2256
01:42:01,900 --> 01:42:04,540
I do not want you to get in trouble, friend.

2257
01:42:06,220 --> 01:42:10,380
You guys got to see this, this particular, this is the Blues Brothers revival performing at a,

2258
01:42:11,020 --> 01:42:13,740
uh, a Christmas event in 2016.

2259
01:42:14,540 --> 01:42:20,300
And if Blues Brothers weren't good enough, then what if you add a children's choir and what if

2260
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:22,540
you add them singing, I think about candy.

2261
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:28,860
Oh my God, Jason could be in this.

2262
01:42:31,580 --> 01:42:34,540
It's mostly kids with the Blues Brothers are clapping on the side of them.

2263
01:42:50,300 --> 01:42:58,860
I think some of the audience is up and doing the twist like a candy cane.

2264
01:42:58,860 --> 01:43:02,860
Only some of the audiences is, uh, returning with their nachos.

2265
01:43:03,660 --> 01:43:05,980
The kids are all wearing white and red.

2266
01:43:05,980 --> 01:43:09,820
So then it just, with the Blues Brothers on the side, it looks like there's just two

2267
01:43:09,820 --> 01:43:11,260
undertakers dancing.

2268
01:43:13,900 --> 01:43:16,620
What are on stage dancing with a children's choir?

2269
01:43:16,620 --> 01:43:19,260
Gotta be prepared if any kids drop dead.

2270
01:43:19,260 --> 01:43:21,580
Don't know if I haven't been scanned for heart conditions.

2271
01:43:22,700 --> 01:43:26,460
The Blues Brothers on the website says the Blues Brothers with the sacred hearts,

2272
01:43:26,460 --> 01:43:29,500
which is Jim Belushi's band.

2273
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:30,300
My God.

2274
01:43:30,300 --> 01:43:34,780
But then when you go down, it does, there's no dates on the schedule for this act.

2275
01:43:34,780 --> 01:43:37,740
But so, so it's, it's listed as a possibility.

2276
01:43:37,740 --> 01:43:39,740
Guys, you don't have forever.

2277
01:43:39,740 --> 01:43:42,060
I mean, look, those guys are in great health.

2278
01:43:43,900 --> 01:43:46,060
I think they're probably going to make it another 50 years,

2279
01:43:46,060 --> 01:43:47,660
but even then clocks ticking.

2280
01:43:47,660 --> 01:43:50,220
Look, you know, Jim Belushi, of course, remember what his name is.

2281
01:43:51,100 --> 01:43:52,060
His Blues Brothers name.

2282
01:43:52,060 --> 01:43:53,980
Do you remember Zee Blues?

2283
01:43:55,580 --> 01:43:57,020
And it's an evening.

2284
01:43:57,020 --> 01:43:59,820
Cause he's a different character than John's character.

2285
01:43:59,820 --> 01:44:02,060
He is different than John Goodman's character.

2286
01:44:02,060 --> 01:44:02,940
Mighty Mac.

2287
01:44:02,940 --> 01:44:03,660
That one I know.

2288
01:44:04,540 --> 01:44:05,980
There's more media to support it.

2289
01:44:05,980 --> 01:44:06,620
The film.

2290
01:44:06,620 --> 01:44:08,060
This is very much.

2291
01:44:08,060 --> 01:44:13,500
This is like the boomer version of the, um, death cab and postal service splitting the bill.

2292
01:44:14,380 --> 01:44:15,740
You've got the Blue Brothers.

2293
01:44:17,740 --> 01:44:18,460
Entire me.

2294
01:44:18,460 --> 01:44:21,980
I was sort of, you got to double Chris, Chris Gaines growth Brooks concert.

2295
01:44:21,980 --> 01:44:23,580
Very excited to see people.

2296
01:44:23,580 --> 01:44:27,820
I go to that Hollywood Bowl show and see people I haven't seen in years.

2297
01:44:27,820 --> 01:44:29,020
It's like, Oh, you're here too.

2298
01:44:29,020 --> 01:44:33,020
What do you think about Jason's love of his music that he listened to for one year in college,

2299
01:44:33,020 --> 01:44:34,220
death cab for QD,

2300
01:44:34,220 --> 01:44:34,860
It is clear.

2301
01:44:34,860 --> 01:44:35,660
And new pornographers.

2302
01:44:35,660 --> 01:44:37,900
Jason's time is definitely like 2004, 2005.

2303
01:44:39,340 --> 01:44:41,500
I mean, you say you like the Pixies and stuff like that.

2304
01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:42,780
No, no, but I'm asking these three.

2305
01:44:42,780 --> 01:44:43,420
Those three.

2306
01:44:43,420 --> 01:44:44,060
Those three.

2307
01:44:44,060 --> 01:44:44,940
I'm fine with that.

2308
01:44:44,940 --> 01:44:45,580
Fine with them.

2309
01:44:45,580 --> 01:44:47,020
Doesn't sound like an endorsement.

2310
01:44:47,020 --> 01:44:49,260
Listen, I'm not, like I said, I'm not going to make fun of it.

2311
01:44:49,260 --> 01:44:51,580
Pixies, Pixies had a lot more albums.

2312
01:44:51,580 --> 01:44:53,420
So I was able to stretch them out more.

2313
01:44:53,420 --> 01:44:58,860
I saw the first reunion tour, but there's only one postal service album and some live records.

2314
01:44:58,860 --> 01:44:59,740
Yeah, there's only the one.

2315
01:44:59,740 --> 01:45:01,660
You can only play that so many times.

2316
01:45:01,660 --> 01:45:03,100
Like at the time I was very popular.

2317
01:45:03,100 --> 01:45:06,380
Are you thinking like that they might be controversial to say you like those bands,

2318
01:45:06,380 --> 01:45:09,340
that those bands are better than Aerosmith and Green Day.

2319
01:45:09,900 --> 01:45:14,060
Do you think that's going to be like people will spit as they listen to the podcast?

2320
01:45:14,060 --> 01:45:15,260
They might spit about it.

2321
01:45:16,780 --> 01:45:20,940
The incredibly controversial take of, oh, yeah, these bands meant a lot to me.

2322
01:45:20,940 --> 01:45:22,860
My freshman year of college.

2323
01:45:22,860 --> 01:45:23,660
Yeah, of course.

2324
01:45:23,660 --> 01:45:28,060
That's not at all a time when things imprint on your gray matter.

2325
01:45:28,060 --> 01:45:32,380
Are you more of an Owl City guy as far as like you think they kind of approved on

2326
01:45:32,380 --> 01:45:33,820
the postal service stuff?

2327
01:45:33,820 --> 01:45:34,700
I don't know.

2328
01:45:34,700 --> 01:45:36,220
I mean, like I feel like.

2329
01:45:36,220 --> 01:45:40,940
Like I don't know, like just like listen to craft work or something.

2330
01:45:40,940 --> 01:45:44,700
If you want like some cool, so I have Tronica or something.

2331
01:45:44,700 --> 01:45:46,780
Yeah, that's always going to be what I'm going to say.

2332
01:45:46,780 --> 01:45:47,420
That's a good point.

2333
01:45:47,420 --> 01:45:52,780
Is this the just sorry I'm so mired in the is this is a different or is this the same

2334
01:45:52,780 --> 01:45:53,020
one?

2335
01:45:54,780 --> 01:45:57,260
My pitch for you guys is that you've got a perfect.

2336
01:45:57,260 --> 01:45:59,740
You three have the perfect Blues Brothers Two Thousand Act.

2337
01:46:00,540 --> 01:46:01,900
Yeah, I'm the kid.

2338
01:46:01,900 --> 01:46:02,700
You're the kid.

2339
01:46:02,700 --> 01:46:04,300
Yeah, no offense, but like you.

2340
01:46:04,300 --> 01:46:05,260
No, no look.

2341
01:46:05,260 --> 01:46:05,740
Come on.

2342
01:46:05,740 --> 01:46:07,580
Yeah, the Heights, too.

2343
01:46:07,580 --> 01:46:11,340
Like, yeah, the tall one, Acro or Acro.

2344
01:46:11,340 --> 01:46:12,140
You're Acro.

2345
01:46:12,140 --> 01:46:12,460
Okay.

2346
01:46:12,460 --> 01:46:13,100
I'm Belushi.

2347
01:46:13,100 --> 01:46:19,020
We need our own names then, which would be really hard.

2348
01:46:19,020 --> 01:46:22,220
And then you need to hire a Johnny Lang impersonator.

2349
01:46:23,020 --> 01:46:24,060
The blues thing.

2350
01:46:24,060 --> 01:46:26,620
Remember when Johnny Lang was going to be the future of the Blues?

2351
01:46:27,340 --> 01:46:28,700
You know, that is the white guy.

2352
01:46:28,700 --> 01:46:30,780
It's like, yeah, vaguely.

2353
01:46:30,780 --> 01:46:31,100
Yes.

2354
01:46:32,060 --> 01:46:34,380
The great white hope for the Blues.

2355
01:46:34,460 --> 01:46:38,620
Well, I think we could get these little soul patches going.

2356
01:46:40,300 --> 01:46:42,780
And I think, yeah, we could do it.

2357
01:46:42,780 --> 01:46:47,580
I mean, still a moment in the podcast that blew me back, blew me out of my chair was when

2358
01:46:47,580 --> 01:46:51,740
you two were discussing, are we going to be, could we be a trivia Blues Brothers?

2359
01:46:51,740 --> 01:46:53,980
And Mike questioned which was which.

2360
01:46:53,980 --> 01:46:55,980
Well, the only reason.

2361
01:46:55,980 --> 01:46:59,820
Mean, obviously, height wise, yes, there's a specific.

2362
01:46:59,820 --> 01:47:01,580
The one thing that matters.

2363
01:47:01,580 --> 01:47:02,300
Yeah, visual.

2364
01:47:03,100 --> 01:47:04,620
The only thing that matters.

2365
01:47:04,620 --> 01:47:06,700
Well, but you can do a lot with Apple boxes.

2366
01:47:06,700 --> 01:47:07,580
You're paying black.

2367
01:47:07,580 --> 01:47:07,900
Okay.

2368
01:47:08,620 --> 01:47:11,500
You're going to dance in Apple boxes that you taped to your legs.

2369
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:14,620
Well, you need to make a no, you make a robe Apple boxes.

2370
01:47:14,620 --> 01:47:16,780
I'm ready to be up on a.

2371
01:47:16,780 --> 01:47:19,180
This is like a muppet stage.

2372
01:47:19,900 --> 01:47:21,100
I need a riser.

2373
01:47:21,100 --> 01:47:21,340
Okay.

2374
01:47:21,340 --> 01:47:23,980
I need a personal rise to get you all the way up.

2375
01:47:23,980 --> 01:47:28,780
So now it's a Blues Brothers act with where the short Belushi is what?

2376
01:47:28,780 --> 01:47:29,340
Six foot.

2377
01:47:29,340 --> 01:47:36,460
But yeah, I want to rise and Mike's on a whole like, yeah, and up on boxes.

2378
01:47:36,460 --> 01:47:41,500
Our rider involves a very complicated riser and a very complicated on stage.

2379
01:47:41,500 --> 01:47:45,260
Did I'm a soul man.

2380
01:47:46,140 --> 01:47:48,380
It does sound more interesting than the typical.

2381
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:53,020
I think literally the kid wears converse in the movie.

2382
01:47:53,020 --> 01:47:57,580
That's part of his like that he wears the suit and the hat, but he has chucks on.

2383
01:47:58,540 --> 01:47:59,340
Wow.

2384
01:47:59,340 --> 01:47:59,840
Yeah.

2385
01:48:01,180 --> 01:48:06,300
Well, you know, I mean, it'll be very exciting when Mike and I immediately hurt ourselves

2386
01:48:06,300 --> 01:48:11,420
trying to get in a ditch and Mount a riser, but that adds to the show.

2387
01:48:11,420 --> 01:48:15,180
You start the show with you guys attempting a chest bump, but it doesn't work great because

2388
01:48:15,180 --> 01:48:16,780
you're up on blocks.

2389
01:48:16,780 --> 01:48:18,540
So you fall back.

2390
01:48:18,540 --> 01:48:23,020
You fall off the stage entirely from now on, from a combined height of 12 feet.

2391
01:48:23,020 --> 01:48:24,700
Yeah, it's a Kelsey grabber.

2392
01:48:25,340 --> 01:48:25,980
Who does it?

2393
01:48:26,940 --> 01:48:30,140
I would love the blues brothers concert that starts with ladies and gentlemen,

2394
01:48:30,140 --> 01:48:30,540
first talk.

2395
01:48:30,540 --> 01:48:31,020
I got my leg.

2396
01:48:31,020 --> 01:48:31,820
I don't want to know.

2397
01:48:31,820 --> 01:48:32,620
I got a rosero.

2398
01:48:32,620 --> 01:48:33,820
But I'm a dead.

2399
01:48:36,620 --> 01:48:37,020
Shit.

2400
01:48:39,820 --> 01:48:41,020
The three second.

2401
01:48:44,380 --> 01:48:47,500
But we all have to laugh about what I said is saying I'm a soul man.

2402
01:48:47,500 --> 01:48:49,660
I say I'm the gash man.

2403
01:48:51,260 --> 01:48:53,180
Because I have a huge talking about I have a gas.

2404
01:48:53,180 --> 01:48:55,820
I've got a huge gas on my leg, just like Kelsey.

2405
01:48:55,820 --> 01:49:00,220
When I do when you did that, when I did the ball, you guys know you were making like

2406
01:49:00,220 --> 01:49:04,540
the oh, no, no, you gotta earn that.

2407
01:49:04,540 --> 01:49:06,540
No, I talk about it.

2408
01:49:09,740 --> 01:49:10,780
Now that's punk.

2409
01:49:10,780 --> 01:49:16,540
I'm talking about our rific leg gas that sent him to an arch county emergency room.

2410
01:49:16,540 --> 01:49:20,780
The most aggressively sexual thing is you never make said, unfortunately, that's your

2411
01:49:21,020 --> 01:49:21,180
freedom.

2412
01:49:21,180 --> 01:49:23,180
It's a banner with Jason.

2413
01:49:23,180 --> 01:49:23,820
Gash me.

2414
01:49:25,500 --> 01:49:26,380
Placents plate.

2415
01:49:27,900 --> 01:49:28,620
I'm sorry.

2416
01:49:28,620 --> 01:49:33,740
I remember the specifics of Kelsey Grammer's traumatic injury.

2417
01:49:33,740 --> 01:49:34,620
You had a gas.

2418
01:49:34,620 --> 01:49:35,260
I don't remember.

2419
01:49:35,260 --> 01:49:35,900
I guess I remember.

2420
01:49:35,900 --> 01:49:38,380
I remember that he cut his leg falling off the stage.

2421
01:49:38,380 --> 01:49:40,620
Not so in my head.

2422
01:49:40,620 --> 01:49:43,340
I think I've always heard the cut was very bad.

2423
01:49:43,340 --> 01:49:47,740
Like it was like, oh, yes, I wouldn't laugh to this injury, but it's like, yeah, it sucked.

2424
01:49:47,900 --> 01:49:49,180
I'm a gas.

2425
01:49:52,460 --> 01:49:54,380
I need gas gas gas.

2426
01:49:56,220 --> 01:49:58,940
I'm going into shock as I'm singing that.

2427
01:49:58,940 --> 01:50:01,740
So the flop sweat and the paleness.

2428
01:50:02,300 --> 01:50:02,540
Yeah.

2429
01:50:02,540 --> 01:50:06,700
So it's actually pretty impressive that I managed to make it topical in that moment.

2430
01:50:06,700 --> 01:50:09,500
Did you know that's actually an Aerosmith song too?

2431
01:50:09,500 --> 01:50:10,620
That's I'm a gas.

2432
01:50:12,620 --> 01:50:14,460
They don't do that one as much anymore.

2433
01:50:14,460 --> 01:50:15,020
It's an old one.

2434
01:50:15,020 --> 01:50:15,580
Yeah.

2435
01:50:15,580 --> 01:50:18,540
The original version was ash on an escalator.

2436
01:50:18,540 --> 01:50:19,100
Yeah.

2437
01:50:19,100 --> 01:50:19,820
They cleaned it.

2438
01:50:19,820 --> 01:50:21,020
They cleaned it up a little bit.

2439
01:50:21,020 --> 01:50:23,420
Well, you can get really fucked up on escalator too.

2440
01:50:23,420 --> 01:50:23,920
Yeah.

2441
01:50:24,700 --> 01:50:25,500
There was a gas waiting.

2442
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:26,140
That's potential.

2443
01:50:26,140 --> 01:50:27,100
Yeah, that's true.

2444
01:50:27,100 --> 01:50:30,860
OK, there's one other in the end, just as we're doing a grab bag here.

2445
01:50:30,860 --> 01:50:35,260
This one really spoke to me, Andrew, when you sent the email, just getting the vibe

2446
01:50:35,260 --> 01:50:36,220
and getting the magic.

2447
01:50:36,220 --> 01:50:39,580
You know, most of these acts do their separate acts, right?

2448
01:50:39,580 --> 01:50:42,780
Now here's now here's Michael Jackson.

2449
01:50:42,780 --> 01:50:44,540
Now here's Donna Summer, whatever.

2450
01:50:45,100 --> 01:50:47,260
But they don't they maybe doesn't.

2451
01:50:47,260 --> 01:50:48,060
I actually I don't know.

2452
01:50:48,060 --> 01:50:48,780
I've never seen a show.

2453
01:50:48,780 --> 01:50:50,540
Maybe at the end they all do something together.

2454
01:50:51,260 --> 01:50:54,780
But what you'd like to see is the cross pollination of living.

2455
01:50:54,780 --> 01:50:57,980
And what does Lady Gaga sound like with Steven Tyler?

2456
01:50:58,700 --> 01:51:02,300
But you get it in this a clip that you sent from their YouTube channel.

2457
01:51:02,300 --> 01:51:05,740
This show also used to happen on the Atlantic City Boardwalk.

2458
01:51:05,740 --> 01:51:06,240
Hey.

2459
01:51:08,060 --> 01:51:11,820
Which experienced a rough time with Hurricane Sandy.

2460
01:51:11,820 --> 01:51:17,820
And they entertain all the great entertainers knew they had to lend in helping and and lift

2461
01:51:17,820 --> 01:51:18,860
spirits again.

2462
01:51:18,860 --> 01:51:22,780
So we ended up with this song that came out in the wake of Hurricane Sandy.

2463
01:51:22,780 --> 01:51:28,700
And this is being performed by Elvis, Steven Tyler, Michael Jackson, Donna Summer, Lady Gaga,

2464
01:51:28,700 --> 01:51:29,420
maybe blues.

2465
01:51:29,420 --> 01:51:31,260
But I don't recognize half of them, to be honest.

2466
01:51:31,260 --> 01:51:33,500
But it's more about the message and what they're singing.

2467
01:51:41,820 --> 01:51:43,820
Yeah.

2468
01:51:43,820 --> 01:51:48,620
Reason for the victims of Sandy is where he will be.

2469
01:51:51,580 --> 01:51:53,180
Back on the boardwalk.

2470
01:51:53,900 --> 01:51:55,660
It wasn't destroyed.

2471
01:51:55,660 --> 01:51:57,660
Back on the boardwalk.

2472
01:51:57,660 --> 01:51:59,660
He can still be enjoyed.

2473
01:51:59,660 --> 01:52:01,660
Back on the boardwalk.

2474
01:52:01,660 --> 01:52:03,660
It wasn't destroyed.

2475
01:52:03,660 --> 01:52:05,660
He can still be enjoyed.

2476
01:52:05,660 --> 01:52:07,660
Very good.

2477
01:52:07,660 --> 01:52:09,660
Very good.

2478
01:52:10,300 --> 01:52:12,300
OK, so some context for that.

2479
01:52:12,300 --> 01:52:15,740
One, Atlantic City certainly had some flooding.

2480
01:52:15,740 --> 01:52:17,740
And yeah, there was some slight damage to the boardwalk.

2481
01:52:17,740 --> 01:52:22,780
I'm glad they're fundraising for victims.

2482
01:52:22,780 --> 01:52:23,900
That's very noble.

2483
01:52:23,900 --> 01:52:26,700
The Atlantic City Boardwalk held up pretty well.

2484
01:52:26,700 --> 01:52:27,740
And I think the reason.

2485
01:52:27,740 --> 01:52:28,300
That's what they're saying.

2486
01:52:28,300 --> 01:52:29,420
It wasn't destroyed.

2487
01:52:29,420 --> 01:52:30,380
It wasn't destroyed.

2488
01:52:30,380 --> 01:52:36,460
And they're like, come back to the boardwalk, which that picture appears to show fall or

2489
01:52:36,460 --> 01:52:37,180
winter.

2490
01:52:37,180 --> 01:52:42,140
And the casinos certainly stay open and the boardwalk is open to an extent.

2491
01:52:42,140 --> 01:52:45,900
But it's like, I feel like they haven't come back because it's November.

2492
01:52:46,540 --> 01:52:48,460
Jason, I'm going to toss something out.

2493
01:52:48,460 --> 01:52:50,220
And here's just a thought exercise.

2494
01:52:50,220 --> 01:52:50,940
What if?

2495
01:52:50,940 --> 01:52:57,100
What if they didn't care if the boardwalk was saved or about the victims?

2496
01:52:57,100 --> 01:53:01,740
What if they just wanted people to come see Legends in Concert live?

2497
01:53:01,740 --> 01:53:05,020
And they saw all their favorites together.

2498
01:53:05,020 --> 01:53:05,900
Yeah, that's true.

2499
01:53:05,900 --> 01:53:07,420
They thought they were like these.

2500
01:53:07,420 --> 01:53:10,140
Perhaps they are fundraising for themselves.

2501
01:53:10,140 --> 01:53:12,220
It's as good as if they were alive.

2502
01:53:12,220 --> 01:53:15,260
When they're all together, that's, I think, my favorite.

2503
01:53:15,260 --> 01:53:19,660
There's tons of pictures on the website where they're all on stage at the end, I think,

2504
01:53:19,660 --> 01:53:20,700
waving goodbye.

2505
01:53:20,700 --> 01:53:24,780
And it's just so many impersonate.

2506
01:53:24,780 --> 01:53:26,540
That's where you got rock and roll heaven.

2507
01:53:26,540 --> 01:53:28,860
To see current one that we've got.

2508
01:53:30,140 --> 01:53:32,380
Justin Timberlake, however the hell you do that.

2509
01:53:32,380 --> 01:53:33,580
It's like a Fedora.

2510
01:53:33,580 --> 01:53:34,380
Does that do it?

2511
01:53:34,380 --> 01:53:34,940
I don't know.

2512
01:53:35,020 --> 01:53:39,100
But then other ones that are a little more clear cut, like a Rod Stewart or the big crazy wig.

2513
01:53:39,100 --> 01:53:39,660
That's funny.

2514
01:53:39,660 --> 01:53:41,660
I think the Rod Stewart's are my favorite.

2515
01:53:41,660 --> 01:53:42,220
I didn't watch any.

2516
01:53:42,860 --> 01:53:45,580
There's been Rod Stewart's in every pamphlet they've ever made.

2517
01:53:45,580 --> 01:53:50,460
People's hunger to see someone else be Rod Stewart inexplicable to me.

2518
01:53:50,460 --> 01:53:54,220
But I love, I'll look at photos of fake Rod Stewart's all day.

2519
01:53:54,220 --> 01:53:55,500
Like Kevin Spacey's brother.

2520
01:53:57,500 --> 01:54:04,220
In another interview, Johnny Stewart tells a story of getting a call from a high up

2521
01:54:04,220 --> 01:54:10,860
producer at a casino to go audition somebody on the spot that day.

2522
01:54:10,860 --> 01:54:13,020
And he's like, it's a big producer, so I go do it.

2523
01:54:13,020 --> 01:54:14,620
I call him back right away.

2524
01:54:15,340 --> 01:54:19,980
And he shows up to this hotel pool and he's like, OK, here's the Rod Stewart.

2525
01:54:19,980 --> 01:54:23,340
And he's like, hey, can I just sing for you here?

2526
01:54:23,340 --> 01:54:25,740
And he's like, well, if you come back to the theater, blah, blah, blah.

2527
01:54:25,740 --> 01:54:28,380
And then the people start laughing around him.

2528
01:54:28,380 --> 01:54:30,860
And it's like, it's the real Rod Stewart.

2529
01:54:30,860 --> 01:54:33,660
They had just brought him out to goof on him.

2530
01:54:33,660 --> 01:54:35,980
And like play like he was.

2531
01:54:35,980 --> 01:54:42,700
And then he tells this other story that like so Kenny Rogers was also he knew

2532
01:54:42,700 --> 01:54:44,220
because also he's in Pigeon Forge.

2533
01:54:44,220 --> 01:54:46,940
There's all this Pigeon Forge stuff with Johnny Stewart, too.

2534
01:54:46,940 --> 01:54:48,220
He like runs.

2535
01:54:48,220 --> 01:54:53,100
He runs a show at a theater in Pigeon Forge with Ricky Nelson's twin sons now.

2536
01:54:54,220 --> 01:54:56,300
The one the fame and Nelson, the band.

2537
01:54:56,300 --> 01:54:56,800
Yeah.

2538
01:54:58,700 --> 01:55:02,780
But then also he knew like Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton from there, too.

2539
01:55:02,780 --> 01:55:06,940
But like Kenny Rogers wanted to come in and do his show as an impersonator,

2540
01:55:07,660 --> 01:55:09,420
but he's Kenny Rogers, right?

2541
01:55:09,420 --> 01:55:14,460
So like and then he also Jay Leno is tied into this because I apparently when Jay

2542
01:55:14,460 --> 01:55:19,020
would do Las Vegas, he would have the legends come out as like his closer.

2543
01:55:19,020 --> 01:55:19,820
Really?

2544
01:55:19,820 --> 01:55:21,900
What that's what he says in the interview.

2545
01:55:21,900 --> 01:55:26,540
And then also so like Jay Leno was like, if you do, he tells Kenny Rogers,

2546
01:55:26,540 --> 01:55:30,860
if you do like fake you, they're not going to like you as much as the real fake you,

2547
01:55:31,740 --> 01:55:35,500
which ended up being true because he like practice with them all week and

2548
01:55:35,500 --> 01:55:40,940
John Johnny Stewart didn't tell them until the very end that it was the real Kenny Rogers.

2549
01:55:40,940 --> 01:55:45,020
And like everybody was pissed off and started like being like, oh yeah, I'm the real

2550
01:55:45,020 --> 01:55:45,980
Marilyn Monroe, too.

2551
01:55:45,980 --> 01:55:47,260
I'm glad you finally said it.

2552
01:55:47,260 --> 01:55:51,580
And like Kenny Rogers got offended and walked off and almost didn't do the show.

2553
01:55:52,220 --> 01:55:53,740
And like it was his whole thing.

2554
01:55:53,740 --> 01:55:57,020
So like he's he's having real celebrities do fakes.

2555
01:55:57,020 --> 01:55:59,020
It's like a lot of levers.

2556
01:55:59,580 --> 01:56:00,940
That's really strange.

2557
01:56:00,940 --> 01:56:01,340
Wow.

2558
01:56:01,340 --> 01:56:01,660
Wow.

2559
01:56:02,460 --> 01:56:04,940
I'm trying to get anything to get to before you wrap it up.

2560
01:56:04,940 --> 01:56:06,220
I figured out what we have.

2561
01:56:06,220 --> 01:56:06,460
Okay.

2562
01:56:06,460 --> 01:56:11,660
I figured out for Jason, we call Johnny Stewart and we say we have an idea death cab for QT

2563
01:56:11,660 --> 01:56:12,220
tribute.

2564
01:56:12,220 --> 01:56:14,460
Jason plays a Ben Gibbard.

2565
01:56:14,460 --> 01:56:15,020
You're Gibbard.

2566
01:56:15,020 --> 01:56:16,140
Oh, yeah.

2567
01:56:16,140 --> 01:56:18,780
That he looks like a little Gibbard.

2568
01:56:18,780 --> 01:56:19,580
Yeah.

2569
01:56:19,580 --> 01:56:20,940
So it's all about hair.

2570
01:56:20,940 --> 01:56:22,140
I think you do the right hair.

2571
01:56:22,140 --> 01:56:23,100
Oh, you know what?

2572
01:56:23,100 --> 01:56:23,420
Yep.

2573
01:56:23,420 --> 01:56:23,660
Yep.

2574
01:56:23,660 --> 01:56:23,900
Yep.

2575
01:56:23,900 --> 01:56:24,140
Yep.

2576
01:56:24,140 --> 01:56:24,940
I see this.

2577
01:56:24,940 --> 01:56:25,260
Okay.

2578
01:56:25,260 --> 01:56:27,740
So we get a death cab postal service.

2579
01:56:27,740 --> 01:56:29,260
We'll have to find a Jenny Lewis.

2580
01:56:29,260 --> 01:56:29,500
Okay.

2581
01:56:29,500 --> 01:56:32,540
So now we so we're putting together we have his numbers.

2582
01:56:32,540 --> 01:56:36,060
So now we could put together an official new legends.

2583
01:56:36,060 --> 01:56:37,580
And what does our legends have?

2584
01:56:37,580 --> 01:56:39,500
We got Ben Gibbard.

2585
01:56:39,500 --> 01:56:45,180
We got Burton Cummings from the guest who we have a Billy Joe Armstrong who hates Billy

2586
01:56:45,180 --> 01:56:46,060
Joe Armstrong.

2587
01:56:47,100 --> 01:56:52,780
And then at the end, we all do quick wardrobe changes and come back as the Blues Brothers

2588
01:56:53,340 --> 01:56:55,340
from the movie with the kid.

2589
01:56:55,340 --> 01:56:55,820
Yeah.

2590
01:56:55,900 --> 01:57:00,060
Unless you want unless it has to be the originals, in which case, I don't know, I guess one of

2591
01:57:00,060 --> 01:57:03,660
us could get up on a bunch of risers and hope that we don't fall and get a big gash.

2592
01:57:04,540 --> 01:57:07,500
Our songs are about gashes separately from that.

2593
01:57:07,500 --> 01:57:11,420
And then the parody of Scatman John's I'm a Scatman called I'm a Gash man.

2594
01:57:13,180 --> 01:57:16,700
And then that's what Jason does is you should bring up the Scatman.

2595
01:57:16,700 --> 01:57:19,500
I have this is our biggest departure.

2596
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:24,860
And you are saying that I'm really on board with the Steely Dan and hating on Green Day.

2597
01:57:24,860 --> 01:57:28,540
But I have a clip now in the world of impersonators.

2598
01:57:28,540 --> 01:57:32,700
You know, there's clips that people love to impersonate and check this out.

2599
01:57:32,700 --> 01:57:38,380
This is a Japanese game show and you'll see someone impersonating.

2600
01:57:38,380 --> 01:57:38,860
Oh, my God.

2601
01:57:38,860 --> 01:57:39,740
Scatman John.

2602
01:57:39,740 --> 01:57:41,500
Let's take a look.

2603
01:57:54,860 --> 01:57:56,140
He's got the outfit on to.

2604
01:58:02,700 --> 01:58:03,820
That is amazing.

2605
01:58:04,460 --> 01:58:05,260
Wow.

2606
01:58:05,260 --> 01:58:06,220
Now, just wait.

2607
01:58:06,220 --> 01:58:07,500
It gets better.

2608
01:58:16,700 --> 01:58:21,500
Oh, horse.

2609
01:58:24,860 --> 01:58:30,540
I'm Scatman.

2610
01:58:31,180 --> 01:58:31,820
Is it the real?

2611
01:58:33,900 --> 01:58:35,100
Wait a second.

2612
01:58:35,100 --> 01:58:36,060
Who's coming out?

2613
01:58:39,020 --> 01:58:40,220
Everyone is in rapture.

2614
01:58:40,220 --> 01:58:42,380
Oh, my God.

2615
01:58:42,380 --> 01:58:44,860
This looks like it was shot in 1985.

2616
01:58:44,860 --> 01:58:47,100
This is the loudest audience ever recorded.

2617
01:58:47,820 --> 01:58:49,340
I would have lost my mind.

2618
01:58:49,340 --> 01:58:50,140
Is he lip syncing?

2619
01:58:51,340 --> 01:58:53,500
Sounds like he's lip syncing to the track.

2620
01:58:53,500 --> 01:58:54,300
Well, he's nervous.

2621
01:58:54,300 --> 01:58:56,220
He's worried he's not going to top fake Scatman.

2622
01:58:56,860 --> 01:58:57,820
Yeah, he's lip syncing.

2623
01:58:58,540 --> 01:58:58,940
That's right.

2624
01:58:58,940 --> 01:59:01,020
The real Scatman John comes out.

2625
01:59:01,020 --> 01:59:02,060
Holy shit.

2626
01:59:02,060 --> 01:59:09,580
Scott, does it help you at all to know that the origin story of the Scatman John song

2627
01:59:09,580 --> 01:59:14,940
is because he stuttered as a child and that he uses scatting to get over stuttering

2628
01:59:14,940 --> 01:59:17,820
and he wants other children to not have a problem with that?

2629
01:59:17,820 --> 01:59:20,380
I honestly, it is kind of nice.

2630
01:59:20,380 --> 01:59:21,180
It's nice to hear.

2631
01:59:21,180 --> 01:59:22,220
He seems like a nice man.

2632
01:59:22,620 --> 01:59:25,580
I don't have a stutter, but I'll get caught on words here and there.

2633
01:59:25,580 --> 01:59:28,060
And it's something you don't feel the best about sometimes.

2634
01:59:28,060 --> 01:59:29,340
You stammer.

2635
01:59:30,140 --> 01:59:35,260
If I could weaponize stammering somehow, then I could make a hit song off of that.

2636
01:59:35,260 --> 01:59:35,980
So you know what?

2637
01:59:35,980 --> 01:59:36,700
I do like that.

2638
01:59:36,700 --> 01:59:41,180
I do like weaponizing your quote unquote flaw.

2639
01:59:41,180 --> 01:59:45,580
Scatman's world is a utopia that was just like he wanted us to live in.

2640
01:59:46,380 --> 01:59:46,940
Scatland.

2641
01:59:46,940 --> 01:59:47,980
He wanted us to live in Scatland.

2642
01:59:47,980 --> 01:59:48,940
Scatman's world.

2643
01:59:48,940 --> 01:59:50,540
I'm calling out from Scatland.

2644
01:59:50,540 --> 01:59:52,540
I'm calling out from Scatman's world.

2645
01:59:52,540 --> 01:59:52,940
You're right.

2646
01:59:52,940 --> 01:59:53,980
Yeah, that is what they say.

2647
01:59:53,980 --> 01:59:58,380
And then also when I was Googling Scatman, I just, you know, you like Google

2648
01:59:58,380 --> 02:00:01,340
and it's like one of the popular questions.

2649
02:00:01,340 --> 02:00:03,980
What was Scatman John's last words?

2650
02:00:07,500 --> 02:00:07,900
Was it?

2651
02:00:07,900 --> 02:00:10,620
We follow up.

2652
02:00:10,620 --> 02:00:11,740
Were they scattered?

2653
02:00:11,740 --> 02:00:16,700
Apparently his last message, whatever God wants is fine by me.

2654
02:00:16,700 --> 02:00:18,380
I've had the very best life.

2655
02:00:18,380 --> 02:00:19,820
I have tasted beauty.

2656
02:00:20,300 --> 02:00:23,500
Scatman John's last public words before his death.

2657
02:00:23,500 --> 02:00:26,700
And then it's then it's like he and then he woke up a little bit right before he died.

2658
02:00:26,700 --> 02:00:27,900
He said, I'm a cash man.

2659
02:00:31,340 --> 02:00:32,540
Oh, we're in there.

2660
02:00:32,540 --> 02:00:36,540
He had to like a surprise appearance on the variety show.

2661
02:00:36,540 --> 02:00:37,740
He had to get one in there.

2662
02:00:37,740 --> 02:00:38,460
The dirty joke.

2663
02:00:39,100 --> 02:00:39,820
I can't think.

2664
02:00:43,260 --> 02:00:45,980
I don't know where to go from Scatman John's last word.

2665
02:00:45,980 --> 02:00:49,180
Well, you know, actually here, while we're staying to stay a little bit like

2666
02:00:50,060 --> 02:00:57,580
a heavenly mortality and also a little bit dirty, I think we all we know that

2667
02:00:58,940 --> 02:01:01,580
Johnny Stewart sold the franchise, but he's still around.

2668
02:01:01,580 --> 02:01:02,460
He's calling me.

2669
02:01:02,460 --> 02:01:05,740
He's looking for his next opportunity and people are maybe worried.

2670
02:01:05,740 --> 02:01:07,900
People are worried about what happens to this guy.

2671
02:01:07,900 --> 02:01:08,700
But you know what?

2672
02:01:08,700 --> 02:01:12,620
You don't have to worry because he's not worried and neither is Ninon,

2673
02:01:12,620 --> 02:01:15,180
the person he's talking to in the functional bar.

2674
02:01:15,820 --> 02:01:16,060
Bar.

2675
02:01:17,020 --> 02:01:20,620
So I'm really living for the life here after more than this life.

2676
02:01:20,620 --> 02:01:22,380
So you're not afraid to die.

2677
02:01:22,380 --> 02:01:23,980
I'm not at all afraid to die.

2678
02:01:23,980 --> 02:01:26,860
So you and I have something in common because I'm not afraid to die.

2679
02:01:26,860 --> 02:01:29,740
In fact, I'm quite interested in what's what's going to go on up there.

2680
02:01:29,740 --> 02:01:30,460
And I can't wait.

2681
02:01:30,460 --> 02:01:34,140
But it's getting so bad since you're not afraid to die and I'm not afraid to die.

2682
02:01:34,780 --> 02:01:37,500
It wouldn't be bad for us to plan to kill each other.

2683
02:01:42,060 --> 02:01:42,700
Didn't happen.

2684
02:01:43,500 --> 02:01:44,700
Make a little mixture up.

2685
02:01:45,740 --> 02:01:48,940
We would just do mouth to mouth and not let either one of us go.

2686
02:01:50,300 --> 02:01:51,260
I'm quite like that.

2687
02:01:53,100 --> 02:01:54,540
I like that idea.

2688
02:01:54,540 --> 02:01:55,340
But not many.

2689
02:01:56,860 --> 02:02:01,260
That was said in the same room as his wife since he was 19.

2690
02:02:01,260 --> 02:02:02,220
Oh, my God.

2691
02:02:03,340 --> 02:02:05,180
So he's not afraid to die.

2692
02:02:06,060 --> 02:02:12,460
And until he and Ninon fulfill their mutual destruction and lock lips

2693
02:02:12,460 --> 02:02:17,580
until they run out of air, I think we can expect a lot of great more shows

2694
02:02:17,580 --> 02:02:19,020
from Johnny Stewart to come.

2695
02:02:20,620 --> 02:02:22,380
He wants to kiss another woman.

2696
02:02:22,380 --> 02:02:25,500
That's the only way he can even vocalize it.

2697
02:02:25,500 --> 02:02:26,700
It was me as Elvis.

2698
02:02:26,700 --> 02:02:27,500
It wasn't Johnny.

2699
02:02:29,500 --> 02:02:31,980
I get into it as a you're a better dog.

2700
02:02:31,980 --> 02:02:35,180
And then I plant them plant one on you and I suck all the life out of you.

2701
02:02:35,180 --> 02:02:37,740
For some you wanted it because you weren't afraid to die.

2702
02:02:37,740 --> 02:02:39,980
So I figured let's just take care of it together.

2703
02:02:39,980 --> 02:02:41,260
And I sucked your soul in.

2704
02:02:41,900 --> 02:02:42,780
That's what happens.

2705
02:02:43,660 --> 02:02:46,220
If you ask me, I suck your soul in and I kill you.

2706
02:02:46,220 --> 02:02:49,340
And if you say you want your name on the marquee, I snip your strings.

2707
02:02:50,540 --> 02:02:55,500
When I get behind the wheel of an automobile, I always whisper, I'm not afraid to die.

2708
02:02:55,500 --> 02:02:57,900
And then I turn the key and get on the road.

2709
02:02:58,540 --> 02:02:59,260
Oh, my God.

2710
02:02:59,260 --> 02:03:00,140
This is what we're going to do.

2711
02:03:00,140 --> 02:03:03,180
We're going to film a video of you doing the death cab for cutie song.

2712
02:03:03,180 --> 02:03:06,060
I will follow you into the dark, which is about dying.

2713
02:03:06,060 --> 02:03:10,220
And then we'll send it to Johnny and see if he thinks it's good enough for a tribute show.

2714
02:03:11,260 --> 02:03:13,740
You know the song I'm talking about, right?

2715
02:03:13,740 --> 02:03:14,620
Yeah, I know it's something.

2716
02:03:14,620 --> 02:03:15,120
Okay.

2717
02:03:16,060 --> 02:03:16,540
Wow.

2718
02:03:16,540 --> 02:03:18,220
Well, I guess we have our mission.

2719
02:03:18,220 --> 02:03:19,980
We know what to go to him with.

2720
02:03:20,860 --> 02:03:22,380
Andrew, you're a musical person.

2721
02:03:22,380 --> 02:03:23,660
Maybe you could help put it together.

2722
02:03:23,660 --> 02:03:25,420
Sure, I'm available.

2723
02:03:25,420 --> 02:03:27,740
Yeah, put some beats together for Jason's show.

2724
02:03:27,740 --> 02:03:29,020
We'll all put a demo together.

2725
02:03:30,220 --> 02:03:33,580
But for now, I think, Andrew Cothe, you survived podcast The Ride.

2726
02:03:33,580 --> 02:03:34,620
Sin City Nights.

2727
02:03:34,620 --> 02:03:35,500
Oh, my God.

2728
02:03:35,500 --> 02:03:37,020
What a thing you brought to us.

2729
02:03:37,020 --> 02:03:37,500
Thank you.

2730
02:03:37,500 --> 02:03:42,140
Saying something, one of the craziest guys, and we would not been on our radar

2731
02:03:42,140 --> 02:03:43,900
and in my voicemail without you.

2732
02:03:43,900 --> 02:03:45,740
I can't believe he called you back.

2733
02:03:47,100 --> 02:03:47,260
Thank you.

2734
02:03:47,260 --> 02:03:49,580
It was a thrill hearing the voicemail and then getting one back.

2735
02:03:49,580 --> 02:03:50,220
Oh, my God.

2736
02:03:50,220 --> 02:03:50,540
Two.

2737
02:03:50,540 --> 02:03:51,020
You got two.

2738
02:03:51,900 --> 02:03:53,260
Yeah, thank you so much for having me.

2739
02:03:53,260 --> 02:03:54,220
I really appreciate it.

2740
02:03:54,220 --> 02:03:55,980
And you guys are great and keep doing your thing.

2741
02:03:57,020 --> 02:03:58,060
My favorite podcast.

2742
02:03:58,060 --> 02:03:58,620
I'll be honest.

2743
02:03:58,620 --> 02:03:59,740
Oh, thank you.

2744
02:03:59,740 --> 02:04:01,020
Thank you for supporting.

2745
02:04:01,020 --> 02:04:02,700
And hey, let's exit through the gift shop.

2746
02:04:02,700 --> 02:04:03,660
Anything you'd like to plug?

2747
02:04:04,220 --> 02:04:05,900
Yeah, follow my Twitch channel,

2748
02:04:05,980 --> 02:04:07,580
Twitch.tv slash Andrew Cothe.

2749
02:04:07,580 --> 02:04:09,420
I DJ one or two times a week.

2750
02:04:09,420 --> 02:04:15,500
I DJ all vinyl records, all genres, jazz, funk, hip hop, drum and bass, all kinds of stuff.

2751
02:04:16,940 --> 02:04:18,700
Check out my work with Bugman.

2752
02:04:18,700 --> 02:04:19,980
We haven't touched on a little bit.

2753
02:04:19,980 --> 02:04:22,860
And funny enough, like I saw a comment recently on one of your posts.

2754
02:04:22,860 --> 02:04:27,260
It's just like, I still don't you never explained what Bugman is on the show.

2755
02:04:27,260 --> 02:04:29,340
You mentioned I was going to ask you this exactly.

2756
02:04:29,340 --> 02:04:32,940
Yeah, it seems like a good opportunity maybe to keep the vague.

2757
02:04:32,940 --> 02:04:34,700
Listen to the music of Bugman.

2758
02:04:34,700 --> 02:04:38,140
I have produced many, many of the songs on our four albums.

2759
02:04:38,140 --> 02:04:39,500
We have four albums out now.

2760
02:04:40,700 --> 02:04:42,300
We've done a lot of shows.

2761
02:04:42,300 --> 02:04:44,300
Scott, you've been to three shows.

2762
02:04:44,300 --> 02:04:48,460
Yeah, there was a time, I think I said on the show, where I've been to four concerts

2763
02:04:48,460 --> 02:04:50,700
since COVID and three of them were Bugman.

2764
02:04:50,700 --> 02:04:52,380
Yeah, you were at the first one even.

2765
02:04:52,380 --> 02:04:54,140
You were at BugCon 2021.

2766
02:04:54,140 --> 02:04:55,580
Was that the first show you ever did?

2767
02:04:55,580 --> 02:04:56,700
That's the first show we did.

2768
02:04:56,700 --> 02:04:57,580
Wow, geez.

2769
02:04:58,300 --> 02:04:59,660
Well, it's something.

2770
02:04:59,660 --> 02:05:00,460
Must be seen.

2771
02:05:00,460 --> 02:05:02,380
We also have you to thank for the Space Las Vegas.

2772
02:05:02,380 --> 02:05:03,420
You guys did a show there.

2773
02:05:03,420 --> 02:05:04,060
Oh, yeah, that was great.

2774
02:05:04,060 --> 02:05:08,780
Nice presented by Sabato Mobile and you helped get us to that venue, which was wonderful.

2775
02:05:08,780 --> 02:05:10,540
Shout out to Emily Boss Bitch.

2776
02:05:10,540 --> 02:05:14,060
She was the one who set that up with the space and we had a great time with them and with her.

2777
02:05:14,060 --> 02:05:15,420
And you guys crushed it.

2778
02:05:15,420 --> 02:05:16,460
I watched the live stream.

2779
02:05:16,460 --> 02:05:17,260
Oh, thanks for saying that.

2780
02:05:17,260 --> 02:05:19,500
It was the first episode back after the groove.

2781
02:05:19,500 --> 02:05:22,300
Yeah, we haven't recorded since the Las Vegas trip.

2782
02:05:22,300 --> 02:05:25,100
Yeah, we're all bleary, still recovering.

2783
02:05:25,980 --> 02:05:27,260
But yeah, I don't know.

2784
02:05:27,260 --> 02:05:29,340
I think we successfully blended some groove.

2785
02:05:29,340 --> 02:05:30,700
I think so.

2786
02:05:30,700 --> 02:05:32,300
I think we did.

2787
02:05:32,300 --> 02:05:32,940
Check out Bug.

2788
02:05:33,180 --> 02:05:33,740
Check out Bug.

2789
02:05:34,380 --> 02:05:35,340
Did you do BJs?

2790
02:05:35,340 --> 02:05:36,220
Are you part of BJs?

2791
02:05:36,220 --> 02:05:38,860
I mean, I like mix and master all of them.

2792
02:05:38,860 --> 02:05:41,260
I didn't make the B for BJs, but I love BJs.

2793
02:05:41,260 --> 02:05:42,220
BJs are really good ones.

2794
02:05:42,220 --> 02:05:43,740
Yeah, it's a strong one.

2795
02:05:43,740 --> 02:05:45,100
Anyone you want to shout out in particular?

2796
02:05:45,100 --> 02:05:47,980
Is there like what's been happening lately?

2797
02:05:47,980 --> 02:05:50,460
Oh, man, just always working on songs.

2798
02:05:50,460 --> 02:05:55,020
I'm always in the group chat with him and Van and they're constantly sending things

2799
02:05:55,020 --> 02:05:58,700
all the hours of the night and we're always like sending songs back and forth to each other,

2800
02:05:58,700 --> 02:06:00,140
trying to work on like a live DVD.

2801
02:06:00,140 --> 02:06:02,540
We have like a lot of our shows shot.

2802
02:06:02,620 --> 02:06:06,220
So we're trying to edit something together and do some different stuff.

2803
02:06:06,780 --> 02:06:11,340
Yeah, but to understand the Bug main, listen to the Bug mains music.

2804
02:06:11,340 --> 02:06:13,100
Listen to the beats I've worked on with Bugman.

2805
02:06:13,100 --> 02:06:16,060
You know, and then go to the show because if you're looking for themed immersive

2806
02:06:16,060 --> 02:06:22,300
entertainment with a mind expanding visual content courtesy of Pest Guest Van Robich show.

2807
02:06:22,300 --> 02:06:23,340
Yeah, Van is a master.

2808
02:06:23,340 --> 02:06:27,020
Van does our live visuals and he really he kills it.

2809
02:06:27,020 --> 02:06:29,180
Yeah, no revelatory.

2810
02:06:29,740 --> 02:06:32,300
Well, I hope we hope to get some dates on the books.

2811
02:06:32,300 --> 02:06:37,180
Get that calendar a little more loaded than the current Blues Brothers calendar.

2812
02:06:38,380 --> 02:06:39,100
I'm concerned.

2813
02:06:40,060 --> 02:06:40,700
Get out there.

2814
02:06:41,820 --> 02:06:42,540
Get us some guys.

2815
02:06:42,540 --> 02:06:43,260
We want to see you again.

2816
02:06:43,900 --> 02:06:45,980
Otherwise, we got to get Jason up on some risers.

2817
02:06:45,980 --> 02:06:47,260
Yeah, and that's going to be scary.

2818
02:06:48,380 --> 02:06:49,980
That's a one way ticket to Gash.

2819
02:06:49,980 --> 02:06:52,140
Yeah, and I'm losing some blood.

2820
02:06:52,140 --> 02:06:52,700
Trust me.

2821
02:06:53,740 --> 02:06:55,180
The Gash man.

2822
02:06:55,180 --> 02:06:56,620
Jason's got to go to Gash City.

2823
02:06:56,620 --> 02:06:58,540
Yeah, I don't mind if I do.

2824
02:06:58,540 --> 02:07:00,540
I tell you, I'm going to Gash City later.

2825
02:07:02,620 --> 02:07:08,300
Dennis Miller is talking about a last little thing.

2826
02:07:08,300 --> 02:07:08,620
Oh yeah.

2827
02:07:08,620 --> 02:07:11,660
Oh, I contacted the Bono for legends.

2828
02:07:11,660 --> 02:07:12,220
Oh yeah.

2829
02:07:12,220 --> 02:07:17,020
Oh, Pavelle, Sephora, Mike.

2830
02:07:17,020 --> 02:07:18,780
I asked a question on your behalf.

2831
02:07:18,780 --> 02:07:19,820
I said Pavelle.

2832
02:07:19,820 --> 02:07:23,020
If I may ask, have you ever appeared as Mr McPhisto?

2833
02:07:23,020 --> 02:07:25,580
Oh, good morning to you, Sir.

2834
02:07:25,580 --> 02:07:28,140
I have not appeared as Mr McPhisto.

2835
02:07:28,140 --> 02:07:29,980
I keep my and he wrote parents.

2836
02:07:29,980 --> 02:07:32,140
I think he meant he's just misspelling.

2837
02:07:32,140 --> 02:07:37,020
I keep my characters as to the updated version of Bono himself.

2838
02:07:37,020 --> 02:07:38,380
No characters.

2839
02:07:38,380 --> 02:07:39,180
Thank you, Pavelle.

2840
02:07:39,900 --> 02:07:40,460
Dist.

2841
02:07:40,460 --> 02:07:41,500
Dist by Pavelle.

2842
02:07:41,500 --> 02:07:42,540
So no McPhisto.

2843
02:07:42,540 --> 02:07:43,820
No Mirabell Man.

2844
02:07:43,820 --> 02:07:44,380
No Fly.

2845
02:07:44,380 --> 02:07:45,980
He hasn't played him in a while, I guess.

2846
02:07:46,940 --> 02:07:48,700
Or on tour he hasn't because he played him, of course,

2847
02:07:48,700 --> 02:07:50,060
in the Jimmy Kimmel episode.

2848
02:07:50,060 --> 02:07:51,100
But maybe he didn't even see it.

2849
02:07:53,740 --> 02:07:54,540
What a good of course.

2850
02:07:54,540 --> 02:07:55,900
So we're all thinking about it.

2851
02:07:55,900 --> 02:07:56,380
We all remember it.

2852
02:07:56,380 --> 02:07:59,100
The people who were here for the episode about it definitely remember when he was on

2853
02:07:59,100 --> 02:08:00,780
the Jimmy Kimmel.

2854
02:08:00,780 --> 02:08:02,140
Well, you got to be Mike Phisto then.

2855
02:08:03,100 --> 02:08:03,900
It's on you.
