1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,240
Warning, the following podcast is not meant to offend any religious listeners, but we're

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,040
certainly okay if it offends any crooked televangelists.

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:19,200
If you are sensitive to goth satans, chickens rising from the dead, or major themed mini-golf,

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,760
do not proceed into the Holy Land experience on podcast The Ride.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:47,400
A very solemn Good Friday to you all.

8
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,560
Welcome to podcast The Reverent Ride.

9
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:55,600
I'm somber Scott Gardner, joined by mournful Mike Carlson.

10
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,160
Hello, I'm Michael.

11
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:05,520
Thank you for joining us, Michael, and also a quite joyless Jason Sheridan.

12
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,240
Forgive us, Father, for we know not what we do.

13
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,920
We know not what we do.

14
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,200
We know exactly what we do, I suppose.

15
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,560
We know not what those people thousands of years ago did to Jesus our Lord.

16
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,720
It is Good Friday, if you're listening to this, on the day that it is released, and I'm being

17
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,960
especially sad in keeping with my parents' wishes as I grew up.

18
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,440
As I may have mentioned long ago on the show, they always told me that I needed to be very

19
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:42,120
sad on Good Friday because that's the day that Jesus died, particularly peak sadness

20
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:49,520
from noon to three because those were the hours that the events of the Passion took

21
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,520
place.

22
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:59,000
While we do owe a theme park podcast today, it's going to be as mournful as I had to be

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
as a child.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,960
Scott, can I ask a question?

25
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,920
I sense I am not I was not raised nearly as religiously.

26
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,560
Was it Western Time?

27
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,280
Was it Pacific Time?

28
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,120
One to three? Or were you just it was that sort of a symbolic

29
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,680
Yeah, it was a symbolic time.

30
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,720
Are you on Jerusalem time?

31
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,400
Were you on Judea?

32
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,600
The Judea time zone?

33
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,160
I don't know. I mean, yes, that's a very good point.

34
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:33,320
And I was not raised in the kind of religious way where I think that Jesus lived in Utah.

35
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,280
So it was not it was not mountain time.

36
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,440
I think it's, you know, it's a very good point.

37
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,520
You have to switch it to New Year's rules, I think.

38
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,520
Right.

39
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,520
We have midnight.

40
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,040
You know, it's not it's New Year's one time zone at a time.

41
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,800
And Jesus suffered one time zone at a time.

42
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,160
Right. I'm not trying to be a wise acre here or anything.

43
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,840
I'm just I was just asking questions.

44
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,080
I'm just asking questions like I often do on the show.

45
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,800
I'll be the wise acre, as usual.

46
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:10,160
So I was raised Presbyterian, but like a very chill, like kind of Protestant ism.

47
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:16,520
Like there's branches of Presbyterianism that deal a lot with Calvinism, which says,

48
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:21,000
like, when you're born, it's already pre-decided that you are good or bad.

49
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,840
And we didn't really get into any of that.

50
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,360
It was more like Church on the Simpsons or whatever, where they just went every Sunday.

51
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,960
And our pastors were usually pretty chill and would go to great lengths to try to fit

52
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,800
topical thing, like not scary topical news stuff.

53
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,880
But like, you know, I was at the mall this weekend and I.

54
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:45,200
I saw kids having a good time together and it reminded me of the apostles, you know,

55
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,200
like that kind of shit.

56
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,640
They were always talking about how they were at the ball.

57
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,160
It wasn't like Jeannie at California Adventure when he would be like, well, I was watching

58
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,200
Snooki on the television and she reminded me.

59
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,520
I, you know, I think every now and then they'd be like, you know, I'm no.

60
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,800
Yeah, I'm no Snooki like, you know, a little bit, a little bit.

61
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,880
He was around when you were a kid.

62
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,600
Yeah.

63
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,000
Whoever Snooki was when you were a child.

64
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,520
I yeah, like Tonya Harding, Lorraine Bobbitt.

65
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:25,480
Yeah, was it Lorraine? Yeah, I was watching Lorraine Bobbitt on the television the other night.

66
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,600
And I, I feel like even that would have been like too bawdy.

67
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,880
My main memories of Church was a lot of nice older people who occasionally would get very

68
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,160
frustrated by like, can you believe who's at Deacon now?

69
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:46,560
Like, you know, that sort of like inner inner inner personal politics sort of of stuff.

70
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:54,800
But I don't think I ever had the big rebellion against like the big like a lot of people

71
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,400
our age, I feel like, you know, bought a Richard Dawkins or who was the other who was the

72
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,960
other shithead? The one who died?

73
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,960
Hitchens, Christopher Hitchens.

74
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,520
Yeah, we get those like I never went in for that garbage.

75
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:14,520
Well, don't don't forget that today's topic that there was a scene filmed at the Holy

76
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:20,080
Land Experience in Orlando at in Bill Maher's documentary, Religious.

77
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,080
I did forget that.

78
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,400
I also I actually also forgot that.

79
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:30,080
But once you said a scene filmed, I knew exactly how that sentence was going to end.

80
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,120
Bill Maher meets Jesus.

81
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,720
I mean, that's cool. That's your trailer right there.

82
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,160
Yeah, that's highly absurd.

83
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,560
I have not seen Bill Maher's Religious.

84
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,320
I haven't. I mean, he's a scumbag, too.

85
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,480
That was my thinking in not rewatching it for this episode.

86
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:54,800
As much as I wanted to experience all Holy Land Experience media, I didn't watch the

87
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,320
Bill Maher clip because I don't hate myself.

88
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,680
Yeah. Yeah, fair.

89
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,080
I the only thing we really did on Good Friday was just not eat meat and not the whole

90
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,640
month. Just Good Friday.

91
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,320
That that sticks out in my mind.

92
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,680
And the other thing that sticks out, you know, because you said like, yes, it's a

93
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,000
somber. It's Good Friday.

94
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,560
I was very concerned. Yes.

95
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,920
Were we being sacrilegious in this episode?

96
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,400
But then the freaks who the multiple freaks who have owned this theme park.

97
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,840
This might be the most sacrilegious thing I've ever seen.

98
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,160
This establishment.

99
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,240
It kind of the entire thing is what Jesus would have torn down, you know, everybody

100
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,360
selling their wares in the church.

101
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:48,400
You know, if he got into that big rage fit, tearing apart the merchandise stands or

102
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,520
whatever that was.

103
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,800
Yeah, he'd go ape shit at the Holy Land Experience.

104
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,160
Oh, owners who I believe would often say that Jesus wants you to be rich.

105
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,840
I believe that was the sentiment.

106
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,760
So probably still is what you're talking about, Michael, is called the prosperity

107
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,080
gospel. And this is a big thing with televangelists.

108
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,720
Now, yes, I you know what?

109
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,480
Let's establish again.

110
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:20,760
Yes, we're talking about the Holy Land Experience in Orlando, the now pretty much

111
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:25,320
defunct Holy Land Experience because they fired everyone back in February.

112
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:31,120
They fired everyone before it became trendy to fire everyone.

113
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,200
What was the covid-19 and all?

114
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,360
But even before several months before, yeah, they had pretty much like shut down

115
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,800
operations and the people they fired were all the people in the shows.

116
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,680
And I think they're bread and butter are the shows because if you've never been to

117
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,480
this place or don't know anything about this place, there's no rides.

118
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,120
There's no 3D movies there.

119
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,320
You know, it's it's it's shows, it's passion plays and stuff.

120
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,200
So you get rid of the actors and you got nothing.

121
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,040
Yeah, so that means they would have had to fire multiple Jesus's.

122
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,520
And I feel like they wouldn't have been excited to turn the other cheek when they

123
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,600
were getting fired.

124
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,120
Because I know, I mean, there's a circuit, there's a circuit, there's a scene in

125
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,200
flow like people make careers working in the parks in Florida.

126
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,640
And like, I'm sure plenty of people who worked here were just, you know, actors

127
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,320
were just professional actors.

128
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,240
I think so.

129
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:30,160
I know. So I even there was a a vice article that I looked at about this place that

130
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:36,960
made mention of that one of the primary Jesus's that they use there had

131
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:42,200
transferred. He was originally led to Orlando to be an actor and worked for

132
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,240
several years as Gaston at MGM Studios.

133
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,480
So, yeah, somebody moved from from Gaston to Jesus and sometimes in a shortage of

134
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,880
actors would for the day play Satan.

135
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,840
Oh, my gosh. Yeah, same as a guy.

136
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,320
I'm not going to say I'm not going to say OMG with Geo.

137
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm going to say gosh today, by the way.

138
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,760
That's a declaration. Oh, got it.

139
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,480
That's good. I appreciate that for Good Friday.

140
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:13,120
Just for today, I was going to say with the people playing Jesus, is it all fake

141
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,920
beards? Do we know this?

142
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,040
The picture I saw in the I think it was the Tampa Bay Times looked like a pretty

143
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,440
real beard like he had grown the long hair and grown the beard.

144
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,480
I could be wrong, but that's pretty good.

145
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,400
Yeah, you have to really commit to that character.

146
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,560
You can't you can't jump around playing Jesus and then go over into the into the

147
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,280
Disney parks. I don't know who that was.

148
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,680
There a bearded character even they would allow you to play.

149
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:47,400
Well, I can't flame rider from Tangled kind of has that like 2000 shins strap

150
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,880
kind of. Yeah, but that's not that's not Jesus.

151
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,600
Jesus doesn't know that Jesus.

152
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,720
No. Who's the most Christ like Disney character?

153
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,400
That's a good point. Does anybody?

154
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,960
Yeah. Do we have long hair and facial hair on anybody?

155
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,120
I mean, I'm trying to think like Christ like looks wise.

156
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,200
Huh? That's a good question.

157
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,560
I mean, because we're not talking personality wise, it's obviously Mickey Mouse.

158
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,520
Well, I was going to say Scrooge McDuck.

159
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,200
It's the most Christ like.

160
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,200
Yes, because he has a lot of money and obviously he helps everyone with his money.

161
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,800
I'm assuming. Yeah, but I mean, it's more likely a camel's got to get through the eye

162
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,440
of the needle than Scrooge is going to, you know.

163
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,080
All right. Good point.

164
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,880
I wait. I have some I have some thoughts.

165
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,560
I Google Disney character beard.

166
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,320
And besides just a strange trend of people putting beards on characters like Jasmine

167
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:47,920
and Ariel, the characters with beards, we got Triton.

168
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,280
We OK, we got.

169
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,440
Oh, and somebody did a Photoshop of Triton without a beard.

170
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,200
And he looks exactly like Jay Leno.

171
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,600
Whoa, really? Yeah.

172
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,880
The chin they filled in for him is.

173
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,720
Yes. Yeah.

174
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,960
Just look at Disney character beard.

175
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,360
You'll see it. So Leno-esque.

176
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,320
You'll see a little a little Bill Clinton, too.

177
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,520
May you know, maybe even a little more Bill Clinton, but big gray eyebrows.

178
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,160
Yeah, maybe maybe more Leno body wise.

179
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,400
I think Leno is in better shape than Clinton.

180
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,920
And and obviously Triton is ripped.

181
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,160
Oh, yeah, he does. You're right.

182
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,520
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, doesn't he?

183
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,600
Yeah. So now, you know, yeah, you shave that beard off of Triton and he's Jay Leno.

184
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,160
And on the ride, though, of course, we've talked about this.

185
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,560
He is jacked and he looks like young and handsome on that ride.

186
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,360
And this Little Mermaid ride.

187
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,160
I can't help but stop and stare at that six pack, 12 pack.

188
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,480
It's a big pack.

189
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,520
It's at least six, if not eight.

190
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,360
Who else with beards? Zeus.

191
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,480
I don't think I don't think we got a Zeus walk around in the parks anywhere. No.

192
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,880
Yeah. Does Mufasa technically have a beard?

193
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,280
I guess it gets complicated when you get into the animal kingdom.

194
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,840
Yeah, but that's not going to work.

195
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,080
That's not going to you're not going to be able to apply a human beard

196
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,520
to a Mufasa walk around.

197
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,000
Now, very odd.

198
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,600
And thank God, by the way, that it's just plush looking characters

199
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,960
that they haven't like put on that.

200
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,280
I'm so glad that we don't have Zubali zoos walking around

201
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:23,560
the Disney parks like cats level, a bunch of fur taped to people's faces.

202
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,680
I don't want to assume animals.

203
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,560
I don't want those at Disney parks, but I do want them somewhere.

204
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,200
And I don't know where maybe it's Halloween Horror Nights.

205
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,000
Maybe there's a Zubali zoo, Halloween Horror Nights maze.

206
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,600
I mean, that honestly, now that I say it is a great idea.

207
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,520
Well, cats universal.

208
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,000
The oh, good point.

209
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,720
Mays at Halloween Horror Nights would be.

210
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,200
Oh, my gosh. Wow.

211
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,760
Oh, I said, oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. It'd be huge.

212
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,720
Yeah. Wow. That's such a good idea.

213
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,120
And like Ghostbusters, Ghostbusters is like, you know,

214
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,280
it has got scary elements, but mostly a comedy.

215
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,120
And they did a maze last year.

216
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,920
If there's ever if there's ever a Halloween Horror Nights again,

217
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,000
if there's a theme park open,

218
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
cats should definitely be on the list for those mazes. Geez.

219
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,200
Yeah, that's Instagram City.

220
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:18,520
I mean, everybody just embracing the the frighteningness of cats, admitting it.

221
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,080
And then like it'd be fun to just acknowledge that like, you know,

222
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,600
like to like litter the the the maze of the set or whatever

223
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,920
with unwanted prints of cats or just, you know, the decaying sets

224
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,480
because nobody nobody wants to touch them again.

225
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,000
They're all cursed items.

226
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,600
Oh, yeah. Wow. That would be the hit.

227
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,000
That would be the hit, honestly. Yeah. Yeah.

228
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,920
They got to do it. Love that. Yeah. Yeah.

229
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,800
All right. We're just giving that out for free.

230
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,080
Yeah. Do your cat's maze.

231
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,400
Embrace the embrace the fright and amaze.

232
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,320
I don't think it's they'd have to buy the rights to this,

233
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,080
but amaze with original Sonic.

234
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,120
Just do Sonic with the teeth with the teeth.

235
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,600
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

236
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,920
They should just give a lot of I mean, they should just be amazed

237
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,240
with like a random assortment of cartoon characters with those teeth.

238
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,000
Like whatever. Yeah.

239
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,800
That's the thing I've seen online where people do that face

240
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,440
app where they put the teeth on the Disney characters, the human teeth.

241
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,800
What's the group?

242
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,120
What's the what's the name of the group that owns the all the comic strips

243
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,000
on Toon Lagoon?

244
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,040
Oh, is that King Features?

245
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,800
King's Features features

246
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,000
sending a kid. Yeah.

247
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,080
King Features Syndicate maze, but all with human teeth.

248
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,680
So like Beetle Bailey, but then with like actual human teeth.

249
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,120
And that's in the maze because they have they obviously have a deal with Universal.

250
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,800
Does he not have to?

251
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,080
You're just saying with like realistic teeth.

252
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,440
Yeah, realistic teeth and Heathcliff with realistic teeth.

253
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,440
Who else? I mean, there's a lot of Marmaduke with real human teeth.

254
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,000
Um, yeah, I just Googled Beetle Bailey teeth

255
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,040
just kind of without thinking while you were talking.

256
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,240
And there's there's a lot of results.

257
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,840
He's like dealt there's there's dental work comes up frequently in Beetle Bailey.

258
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,400
Does he have those rounded teeth? Am I wrong?

259
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:15,240
No, they have just kind of like dumb like squares and only like three of them, you know.

260
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,880
Oh, OK, I got it.

261
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,480
Well, he's he'll have human teeth soon enough.

262
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,600
Is Beetle Bailey the chubbier one? Who is Beetle Bailey?

263
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,760
No, no, he's skinny.

264
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,560
He's skinny. The chef is the chubby one.

265
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,440
That's who I'm looking at with a green chef's hat.

266
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,440
Yeah. OK.

267
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,960
Beetle was Beetle Bailey.

268
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:39,520
Was he a rip off of Gomer Pyle or was he based or was Gomer Pyle based on him?

269
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,520
You know, it's hard to tell.

270
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,080
You know, everyone had funny stories from the war days.

271
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,720
So so you think it was all just based on funny war stories?

272
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,480
Got it. They were all they were both derived from the same source.

273
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,560
I think so. Yeah.

274
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,240
Well, we'll do that on the Jim Neighbors slash Beetle Bailey episode.

275
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:04,280
And by the way, who you referred to as the chef, we're talking about Sergeant Snorkel.

276
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,160
It is. What do you mean, chef?

277
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,480
Isn't he a chef?

278
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,040
He's got a hat that's kind of like a chef's hat.

279
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,520
Oh, that's what I think.

280
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,080
But Beetle Bailey is constant.

281
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,640
Like he's always being punished by peeling potatoes.

282
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,880
I think I just conflated the two.

283
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,840
Yeah.

284
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,840
I don't know where Sergeant Snorkel works on the base or whatever.

285
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,960
So it could be. Yeah, not sure.

286
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:31,000
Well, again, a thing that we'll get to because we have nothing but time.

287
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:36,160
But Sergeant Snorkel is actually he ends up getting killed by Vincent D'Onofrio.

288
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,320
Old metal jacket.

289
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,240
That's just metal jacket.

290
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,240
They went very realistic with the blood just for that one,

291
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,920
just for that one, Beetle Bailey.

292
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,480
And he did have human teeth in that one, too.

293
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,120
That they identified him.

294
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:05,680
Oh, dear. Oh, my gosh.

295
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,960
This is getting upsetting.

296
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:12,760
We better switch it back to let's let's go back to a holy place, to the to the holy land.

297
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,760
As we said, it's you know, it's Easter weekend right now.

298
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,120
It'll be Easter very soon.

299
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,440
And I I thought it'd be fun to cover a religious park.

300
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,280
There's a couple of those. I wasn't sure which was which.

301
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,120
You know, at some point, I'd love to get to the the Jim Baker Park

302
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,240
that still sits abandoned wherever that is.

303
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,520
I'd love to do that one.

304
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,720
But this one felt relevant because all year it's been teetering on,

305
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,440
is this going to is this going to stay open or not?

306
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,680
It feels relevant to me personally, too, because I don't think I knew it existed.

307
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:46,760
But when we all went to Orlando a couple of months ago, we passed by it a few times

308
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,200
because it's it's pretty close to Universal Studios.

309
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,880
You're definitely seeing it off the side of the road

310
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,600
if you're going to Universal or to the Orlando airport.

311
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,640
Yeah. Yeah.

312
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,240
And there's like apartments and stuff close,

313
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,360
but there's a target across the street from this place.

314
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,880
It's right in the mix.

315
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,600
Yeah. The problem is, we really like you need like three weeks in Orlando.

316
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,520
That's the the issue is like I was there for like

317
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,680
we were there for like five days.

318
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:18,320
You got to hit all the big stuff, but you need an extra week for stuff like this.

319
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,680
And honestly, as theme park journalists, we should have gone there.

320
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:26,840
We who knew suggested it, but I think our our like swing day,

321
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,240
we kind of used to find our street in Margarita Village.

322
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,920
Yes, for sure. No regrets there.

323
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,360
No, no regrets.

324
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,560
And of course, like, who knows how long that'll be there.

325
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,000
So we needed to get there then. Yeah.

326
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,440
Oh, yeah. How are they doing in virus world?

327
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,240
Yeah, I mean, it might be fine because it's empty.

328
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,680
So yeah, boy, it's eerie.

329
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,400
I've been people have been sending me those helicopter shots of

330
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,960
seeing Margaritaville, Orlando, and nobody's walking around.

331
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,560
Construction has just stopped.

332
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:06,640
So off putting me staying inside, there's no sign that anyone actually lives there.

333
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,160
So weird. There's nobody in bonkers.

334
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,640
There's no line waiting to get into bonkers.

335
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,560
There's nobody. I think they I hate to say it.

336
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:23,240
I think they may have ended the influencer program at Island H2O Live.

337
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:28,480
We might not get to sponsor an influencer, and it's entirely because of the virus

338
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,600
and certainly would not have just happened in a week anyway.

339
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,840
Yeah. What if they get like a big amount of bailout money from the government

340
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,400
that allows them to continue and they blame because they blame everything on the virus.

341
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,760
But in reality, Michael, it's funny you say that because the Holy Land

342
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,840
website does have a banner at the top saying like due to Corona,

343
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,080
we're going to be closed from March 10th to April 14th.

344
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,120
And I can't help but think that's not accurate.

345
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,320
I mean, obviously, it's too soon to reopen.

346
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:07,080
But also, like, I feel like after you fire everyone,

347
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,240
you can't really put up warnings like that. Right.

348
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,720
Well, I mean, what does that really mean?

349
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:18,960
That means that they can't open and like you can't go to the restaurant or the gift shop, really.

350
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,360
Is there a restaurant? Right.

351
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,080
There's four restaurants. Yeah.

352
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:29,120
Yeah. And I mean, I think they would probably reopen the.

353
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,480
Is it I believe it's called the Church of All Nations?

354
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,480
It's got a very unsettling cross logo.

355
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,440
Coen Coen Church of All Nations.

356
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,480
It looks real like handmade.

357
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,720
It's still well, and one of the restaurants is related to that.

358
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,280
And it's next to it.

359
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,400
So it's called Coen Bistro.

360
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,240
And we'll we'll get to the restaurants later.

361
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,480
I will get to the restaurant because there is a really good one.

362
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,200
Oh, good, good. OK, OK.

363
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,120
I think maybe we owe just a really

364
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,400
cliffhanger explanation of what this place is.

365
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,000
I don't even feel qualified to do it exactly.

366
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,760
I mean, there's when you look at it from the side of the road, a lot of it is very

367
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,800
gaudy and palatial.

368
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,920
But if you actually go into this themed experience,

369
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,720
they sometimes kind of called a theme park.

370
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,080
But as I said, there's no rides.

371
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,240
I don't know how accurate that is.

372
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,320
But a lot of it is recreating

373
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,480
the you know, the old the old Bible world.

374
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,920
What city are we talking Jerusalem?

375
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:44,880
Jude, I I forget what year I did have it, but it's Judea.

376
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,520
OK, I see. Uh huh.

377
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,480
Yeah, because they have I was just going to say they.

378
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,920
It says there's a there's a thing that says on the map.

379
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,240
I'm looking at the map now and one of the exhibits or whatever you would call it,

380
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,520
Jerusalem model AD66.

381
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,000
But I don't know if that's the whole I don't think that's actually representative

382
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,680
of the entire land.

383
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,880
No, that's like a tabletop model.

384
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,000
That's just a model of Jerusalem.

385
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,560
AD66. Oh, I have it.

386
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:16,320
It is it's recreates the architecture and themes of the ancient city of Jerusalem

387
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,280
in first century Judea,

388
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:25,560
which one of the articles I read pointed out how that requires people to be the

389
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:31,160
theme requires all the employees who used to be there to like, you know,

390
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:37,400
where a lot of, you know, very intense, thick, old fashioned headwear,

391
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,080
like everybody's head is is wrapped up.

392
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:43,920
And that includes when it's, you know, the dead heat of August,

393
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:49,600
the guy at the like the coffee shop has to have his his head wrapped up a bunch of

394
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,560
times, just sweating bullets.

395
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,360
So fun place to work.

396
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,800
Yeah, I'll say this.

397
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:00,560
I don't think the costumes are convenient for the actors, but the costuming is very

398
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:04,720
good. I mean, there's a lot of great seamstresses down in Orlando's, you know,

399
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,760
people who make costumes and all.

400
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:13,120
So that makes sense to me that they went all out on the costuming.

401
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,920
Yes, that's all that's all pretty strong.

402
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:23,360
There's maybe some some squabbling you could do about Satan's wardrobe.

403
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,000
But we'll get to that a little bit.

404
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,120
But so, yeah, you got to know you.

405
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,440
You go there for a couple of hours.

406
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,040
I think like probably a lot of church groups would go out of school groups would go.

407
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:41,520
And it's, you know, partially you're we're recreating what life was like in the first

408
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,240
century. And then there's a couple of big show venues.

409
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:50,600
There's a giant indoor one that I think also doubles as a place where they can tape

410
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,760
Praise the Lord because this place is owned by the Trinity Broadcasting Network.

411
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,080
But, you know, we'll cover the history there, but also like an outdoor amphitheater.

412
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,400
So it's it's a lot of live entertainment and then something called the Scriptorium,

413
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:11,760
which is a collection of biblical related artifacts.

414
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,480
Yeah, I have a lot of questions about the Scriptorium.

415
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,160
Where where did you get a hold of these gang?

416
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,200
And how did you get a hold of these?

417
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:27,720
Because like, what country what country are these all from?

418
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,280
Because I don't think they're native to central Florida.

419
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:37,280
Like, you know, you know, Indiana Jones saying stuff belongs in a museum.

420
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:42,440
I think we've come around now a little more towards like as the years go on, people,

421
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:48,160
people are a little more going like most of the stuff in the British Museum should be

422
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,280
returned to the countries they was founded.

423
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,880
Well, they didn't. OK, so it looks like it.

424
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:59,880
This was a preexisting collection by Robert von Campen

425
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,080
that was around, has been around since 1986.

426
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:08,080
So they like they bought a collection, moved it from Minnesota, sounds like.

427
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:13,720
OK, where where Jesus may have been, if he was if Jesus was that if all the Jesus

428
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,560
stuff happened in Utah, he might have made it up to Minnesota at some point.

429
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,440
So, yeah, a private collection.

430
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,160
I mean, that feels a little better than like Hobby Lobby pillaging, you know,

431
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,000
artifacts in Iraq.

432
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,600
So better. So.

433
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:33,080
So for me, who is, you know, was not so raised religious religiously,

434
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:39,480
this is kind of like a Doc on Dars situation where there are relics

435
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,760
from the past, from the history of the land.

436
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,920
That's sort of what I'm dealing with here.

437
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,120
I think so. Yeah. Yeah.

438
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,200
I didn't look too carefully at what's in the scriptorium, to be honest.

439
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,800
I see. Sorry, scriptorium fans.

440
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,720
If there was an I.G. 88 style robot or anything in there,

441
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,040
I don't I don't believe so.

442
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,160
There are robots around.

443
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,400
I think there is a robot in the scriptorium.

444
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,960
But again, I'll say I want to just do the overview first.

445
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,200
Got it. Got it. Got it. Sorry.

446
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,960
Can you just one one robot?

447
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:15,120
I'll explain. But I just as we're getting out like headlines and bullet points

448
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,240
about it, I think I think a big thing to say, like we said, it's unlike the,

449
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,920
you know, it's it's really near universal.

450
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,920
It's definitely designed to attract people who were there for for,

451
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,320
you know, for the tourists to try.

452
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,840
And if you're there for a little longer and you're doing your off the beaten

453
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,880
path stuff, your Gator lands and if you're a religious person,

454
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,760
this is a good place to go.

455
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:37,000
And because of just the way it's designed and that it is a religious place,

456
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:42,080
this is a a nonprofit tax free

457
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,040
theme park. It somehow qualifies.

458
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:49,160
It's sometimes described as a theme park, but also is nonprofit and does not pay taxes.

459
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,280
How did they get away with it?

460
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,080
Because they have one free day every year.

461
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:57,000
Just one. And the lines are out the fucking door.

462
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,360
Sorry, I'm swearing.

463
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,280
Oh, yeah.

464
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,240
I it's yeah.

465
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,280
Yeah, it gets really crazy on the free day.

466
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,280
And besides the free day, it is fifty dollars, fifty dollars,

467
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,440
which they don't pay any taxes.

468
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,800
I mean, they don't pay any taxes on.

469
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,760
Yeah. When it first opened, it was 1750.

470
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,880
Pretty cheap. Wow. Yeah.

471
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,360
They jacked it up to 50.

472
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,320
Oh, my God. I guess in the TBN era,

473
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,600
you're getting that that, you know, you're paying a TBN premium.

474
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,120
I was going to say, like, you know, I was just start to compare.

475
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,520
I initially when I saw that I was going to be like, oh, that's crazy.

476
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,200
And then like, you know, there's I have some maybe opinions on tax

477
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,840
exempt status for certain institutions that get a ton of money.

478
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,000
And where does that money go anyway?

479
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
That being said, there's a lot of stuff Disneyland doesn't pay taxes on in Anaheim.

480
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,400
Like, are you mean our church? Yes.

481
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,880
They are all good. Go for it.

482
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,560
They had the city of Anaheim build that parking structure

483
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,200
and they pay like a dollar to like,

484
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,160
I think I forget what it is like.

485
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,360
Disney owns it, right?

486
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,800
But they had Anaheim buy like pay for it and then Disney collects all the money

487
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,920
they make from the parking structure, I believe.

488
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,200
Yeah, something like that.

489
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,040
Something like that.

490
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:22,040
Anyway, I'm not saying I'm not saying Holy Land is off the hook for something like this.

491
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,400
I'm just saying, oh, wait a minute.

492
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,440
OK, yeah, that's all a bummer, I guess.

493
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,480
But I still I found it very moving when the white smoke was released from

494
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,200
from Cinderella's Castle to anoint Bob Chapek

495
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,960
and say goodbye to Pope Bob Iger the third.

496
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,640
It's a good yes. We all well, we were all we were all outside.

497
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,120
We were waiting, bated breath.

498
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,160
We all cried.

499
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,480
We all we all wiped.

500
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,600
We all cried and then wiped our faces with towels and saw Christ's face in each towel.

501
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,800
We were wearing our religious garments, which were retro Epcot shirts.

502
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,280
Basically the same thing.

503
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,120
I said Christ, I meant Triton.

504
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,760
We all saw Triton's face in our.

505
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:08,120
Oh, yeah, yeah. The Shroud of Triton.

506
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,880
Yes. Easy to confuse.

507
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:17,200
Yeah, really very strange place, this place, and that they're able to

508
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,640
to operate it that way.

509
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,240
It's it's been around since when.

510
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,600
When did it get to when did it get built?

511
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,560
Was it the 90s sometime?

512
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,920
2001. Oh, not until 2001.

513
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:32,520
OK, yeah. Property purchased in 89 and nothing was there until 2001.

514
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,080
Nothing was there until 2001.

515
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:39,600
And it was it was opened by a man named Marvin Rosenthal,

516
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,640
who was the founder of a group called Zion's Hope, which

517
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:49,200
the L.A. Times says strives to convert Jewish people to Christianity.

518
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,400
This was a fun flashback.

519
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:56,240
You know, you haven't heard about the Jews for Jesus a lot in the 20 in the 2000s.

520
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:00,720
You know, is a but the Jewish Defense League

521
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:05,560
was not wild about this guy and this organization and this theme park.

522
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,040
When it opened the same article,

523
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,360
Marvin Rosenthal was quoted as saying otherwise.

524
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,320
Are we targeting Jewish people with any kind of exclusivity?

525
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,640
The answer is absolutely no.

526
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:21,400
Nor do we believe that we are in the conversion business, said Rosenthal.

527
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,560
But for the first visitors to the park, followers of Rosenthal for years,

528
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,920
the exact opposite is true.

529
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,960
There are people coming to Christ through this ministry, said D.

530
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,440
Locklear, who added that Jews are the primary target.

531
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:40,040
Yes, that's mainly what he's trying to do is to try to reach the Jewish people.

532
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:45,000
So kind of a weird way to open a theme park.

533
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,240
A theme park meant for Jewish people to go to.

534
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,440
And hopefully by the end of the day, they have seen the Jewish people's

535
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,360
role in biblical events and gone, well, there's so many Jews in all these stories.

536
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,600
Maybe I should just be around also.

537
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,520
Yes, I'm a Christian now. Yeah.

538
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,680
Do you think there's one person that was converted from this?

539
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:12,920
I heard a story of the exact opposite of someone who had gone to Israel

540
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:16,760
and had been very moved at the Wailing Wall,

541
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,520
very holy site where people pray.

542
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,080
And the replica Wailing Wall

543
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,640
was so shitty at the Holy Land, they were very upset.

544
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:34,600
And, you know, not to not to jump around too much, but yes,

545
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:40,160
there's a replica Wailing Wall at this place where you.

546
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,360
And it looks like shit.

547
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,800
I know we say there's no bad fake rocks, but it looks like shit.

548
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,360
So the Wailing Wall would not have made it to the final four last year.

549
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,480
No, even now that we know about this place.

550
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,960
No, I don't think it's in there.

551
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,280
And I would not nominate the rock that moves out of the way

552
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,560
so Lazarus can come out of his tomb.

553
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,240
I'm not I'm not putting that one in there either.

554
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,720
Yeah, there's a there's a fake Wailing Wall.

555
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,960
But you like the real Wailing Wall,

556
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,680
you write prayers onto pieces of paper and slip them into the cracks.

557
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,000
And then the Holy Land experience gathers all of the prayer slips

558
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,920
and sends them to Jerusalem, where volunteers insert them

559
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,080
into the real Western Wall.

560
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:28,720
Insane that you can't enter office envelope prayers to the Wailing.

561
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,040
What the hell?

562
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,400
There should be like a bank pneumatic tube that takes it from Orlando

563
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,920
to the actual Wailing Wall.

564
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,920
It may as well be.

565
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:42,640
So that means like people they got to send somebody from Orlando

566
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:47,960
once a month has to fly to Jerusalem with a huge bag of slips.

567
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,280
Like you see people, you know, it's a very emotional experience for them.

568
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,640
And they're writing their note and praying for their loved one.

569
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,160
And then some guy walks up with several huge garbage bags

570
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,880
make way out of the way.

571
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,520
Letters to letters to Santa Claus.

572
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,360
Here's my question, though.

573
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,600
Do we have any proof that these actually make it?

574
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,600
No, no, no way.

575
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,200
These things get dumped right in the trash.

576
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,320
Let's be honest. Yeah.

577
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:20,240
Straight in the right behind the Holy Land experience into the marsh of Orlando.

578
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,040
The people who run this place seem like the type that they wouldn't pay for dumpsters.

579
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,960
They would just wait until Target closed and then Jimmy Thur's open like

580
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,240
nothing seems above board about this place.

581
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,240
I the other the other thing to consider, I don't think there

582
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,080
is there a replica of the Temple Mount

583
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:47,200
in this park, which is is adjacent to the Wailing Wall

584
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,160
in Jerusalem.

585
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:54,520
And it is a holy site for Christians, Jews and Muslims.

586
00:33:55,160 --> 00:34:00,000
But I have to imagine this park, if it mentions it, does not do a good job

587
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,480
about talking about the other valid or, you know, the other important world religions.

588
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:08,080
You know, that would be a good guess.

589
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,440
I would I would venture.

590
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,680
But I don't have a confirmation of that.

591
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,240
Yeah, probably not so concerned with representation.

592
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,000
I wouldn't imagine.

593
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,520
I also say I don't know the the exact borders of where the Wailing Wall falls.

594
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:29,560
So when I said that person went to, I guess I should have said that person went to Jerusalem.

595
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:33,360
I please do not yell at me if I got the borders wrong.

596
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,640
We may be getting things wrong left and right.

597
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:39,160
Keep in mind, this is not a journalism podcast.

598
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:43,800
Yes, I do not know what good tides Jared Kushner has done this week

599
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,160
for the borders of Israel and Palestine.

600
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,760
Has he fixed it yet?

601
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:52,840
We might be it's we're recording this a couple like a week or so out.

602
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,480
So forgive us if it's out of date and Jared fix the Middle East.

603
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,560
Yeah, he's fixing Corona.

604
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,120
He's that's he's he can do both, though.

605
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,720
He's a Wunder kind.

606
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,960
Sure. Yeah, for sure.

607
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,240
So Marvin Rosenthal runs it for a while.

608
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:17,360
And I don't know a lot about what was happening then or how which which of the structures

609
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,560
and attractions were there then.

610
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:25,600
But in 2007, this place was taken over by TBN, the Trinity Broadcast Network,

611
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:31,440
which I don't know how exactly anybody's watching TBN today

612
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,520
because I don't have cable anymore for me in my head, a cable

613
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,560
mainstay, maybe not even cable.

614
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:41,400
You might have even you might have gotten it at one point, just like a regular channel.

615
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:46,880
But I definitely recall this just being so ubiquitous on TV,

616
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,200
not that my parents were watching it or anything.

617
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,920
It's you know, it's not a Catholic station.

618
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,600
And even they raised me in sort of a way like, yeah, these people are kind of quacks.

619
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,920
You know, so I wasn't super raised with this.

620
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,840
But I I do remember TBN on so aggressively, though.

621
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,960
I believe you can you can stream it on the Internet now for free.

622
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,640
Oh, for sure. Yeah.

623
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,680
And then it's odd. It is still carried by a lot of cable providers.

624
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,880
And yeah, they they believe me, if you go to the website,

625
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,560
you'll be able to find

626
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,320
all sorts of information about where to watch TBN.

627
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:26,200
Well, and I'm pretty sure people in the low 20s, high teens,

628
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,160
you'll probably come across a grip of televangelist.

629
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,160
I think so, yes.

630
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:36,520
And I could be wrong not to get on this tear again, but I believe TBN

631
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:40,160
is the home of my favorite talk show, Huckabee.

632
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,920
I'm pretty sure that's where Huckabee emanates.

633
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,800
Yeah, let me double.

634
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,840
I think so. Is that OAN?

635
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,920
Is that one America News?

636
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,760
Could be. Could be.

637
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,720
I forget. Huckabee is listed as a personality for TBN.

638
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:01,360
They list such they have like the big pastors like Rick Warren or Joel

639
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:05,400
Osteen, the Grahams, Billy and Franklin Graham.

640
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,920
Billy Graham, you might remember from telling Richard Nixon to bomb

641
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:12,880
the dykes in North Korea, which would have potentially resulted

642
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,120
in a million dead and the destruction of a country's economy.

643
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,960
Oh, but yeah, that that kind of came.

644
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,720
But Billy Graham, complicated man, also bailed Martin Luther

645
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,480
King out of jail once.

646
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,720
Billy Graham was very like they called him the people's pastor.

647
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,120
My grandmother loved him.

648
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:34,600
He was very, very media savvy.

649
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,800
But a weird guy, Franklin Graham

650
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,600
is in charge of a medical group, one of the medical groups

651
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,600
that has set up the field hospital in Central Park for Corona.

652
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:51,120
OK, and they are for making doctors sign

653
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:56,080
religious declarations that they believe homosexuality is a sin.

654
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,280
So you're talking about really? Yeah.

655
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,800
Oh, no.

656
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,120
Uh, this what is that?

657
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:09,520
That organization is also has Zion in the name.

658
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,240
Sorry, I got a bunch of links about the Graham family open.

659
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,440
Volunteers have to agree that transgender people don't exist.

660
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,160
Same sex marriage is a sin and gay people should be celibate

661
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,840
or risk damnation and eternal punishment.

662
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,000
No, no, no, no, no. Excuse me.

663
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,680
Samaritan's Purse, an evangelical Christian group.

664
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,120
That he is in charge of.

665
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:35,680
It's one of the people I believe in New York Hospital,

666
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,400
one of the groups mainly running that.

667
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,240
But this group is also involved in that field hospital.

668
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,720
Dear God, you want to change the topic right now

669
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,480
and make the rest of this episode about like creamsicles or something?

670
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,040
Yes, please. This is terrible.

671
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,160
Dear God. Now, hold on.

672
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,440
You don't think TBN, which once had a host say,

673
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,960
get Jesus on that credit card.

674
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,320
You don't think that's cool?

675
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,120
Well, I think TBN is very cool.

676
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:10,880
And I I actually have a personal story to tell about TBN

677
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,800
and its its flagship show, Praise the Lord,

678
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:18,440
which is able to be taped at the the Holy Land Experience.

679
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,240
So the in the night when was this?

680
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:28,200
This was, you know, the late 90s, I used to my family hung out in Newport Beach

681
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,680
a lot in Orange County.

682
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,160
And whenever we were driving down there on the 405,

683
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:38,640
very near the Mall South Coast Plaza and probably about 20 minutes south of Disneyland,

684
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,840
we we would on the 405 see this really crazy,

685
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,680
gaudy palace on the side of the road.

686
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,440
And if anyone listening is from Orange County, you definitely know this

687
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,920
as the headquarters of TBN.

688
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,560
A really bizarre to look at looks.

689
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,120
They do a good job with Christmas lights if you're driving down there at night.

690
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,880
During the Christmas season.

691
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,160
But we always pass by this and like, oh, weird.

692
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,880
What is that? Oh, it's TBN.

693
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,520
And it's like if you look at the photos of its offices,

694
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,920
it's just an office building in a TV studio that has the like

695
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,160
gross Trump idea of opulence.

696
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:20,320
It's like, you know, it's it's fountains and gold trim and paintings everywhere.

697
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,800
You can jam a painting.

698
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,840
There's big crazy thrones in the bathroom and, you know,

699
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,800
sheriffs pissing and fountains everywhere.

700
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,040
It's so crazy.

701
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,040
And I always wanted to go.

702
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,680
And I'd watch TBN and watch kind of like the kookier

703
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,480
televangelists, you know, people will be will be talking about

704
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,280
in relation to the Holy Land experience.

705
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:44,880
And and sometimes you'd see like, oh, you know, praise the Lord tapings are free.

706
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,280
And sometimes there are celebrity guests.

707
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:53,360
And I'm no, I'm like, oh, my God, I got to go to a praise the Lord taping.

708
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,320
And it just seemed like, oh, this could be a fun in between

709
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,440
activity for me and my mom, who is a very religious person,

710
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,840
but also knows like televangelists are kind of silly.

711
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,840
And we can go laugh at it a little, but also it'll be a religious thing.

712
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,480
And so let's be respectful and let's dress nice.

713
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:13,200
And then me, who we already was like this kitchmeister in middle school.

714
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,680
So I called and like, we got to go.

715
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,600
And I remember like nice old lady answers the phone and

716
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,640
all the next taping is on Tuesday.

717
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,480
OK, sounds good.

718
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,400
And do you know if there'll be any guests at that taping?

719
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,560
And she said, why? Yes.

720
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:32,080
That episode will have Tia and Tamara Mowry and Hammer.

721
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:37,120
Oh, I thought it was going to be some fake celebrities.

722
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:41,640
Hammer, I get to go to for free to a palace and see Hammer.

723
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,000
So I am psyched.

724
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,280
This was so fun to do.

725
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,000
I mean, the thing itself was exceedingly boring.

726
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,040
But I got Hammer's autograph.

727
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,600
I mean, wow, incredible.

728
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,560
Is what I like.

729
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,680
I like we'd leave.

730
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:01,880
He was on one side of a little, you know, like marble gate or whatever.

731
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,040
And I couldn't got his autograph.

732
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,760
So that was all really exciting.

733
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,840
I discovered our friend Ryan Perez also at some point went to a Praise

734
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,920
the Lord taping. And we had the we're talking about this.

735
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,480
We had the same memory of how no one was there.

736
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,080
So they had to scrunch all the audience member.

737
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:20,880
You know, it's it's a insane theater meant for 200 people.

738
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,640
And they have to jam the 30 who were there into like one little space

739
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,840
to make it look like it's full.

740
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:31,480
So I was I was fondly recalling all this and realized like,

741
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:36,360
wait a minute, I've never attempted to find that episode of Praise the Lord.

742
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:42,320
And especially to see if it ever cuts to me in the audience.

743
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,720
And I did some searching and I found the episode.

744
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:49,320
The full two hours is uploaded to YouTube.

745
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:53,640
And it is from July 14th, 1999.

746
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,960
You can look it up yourself. You can watch Hammer.

747
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,880
Hammer does not perform. He just talks.

748
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:03,520
But you do get a lot of performances by someone named Clifton Davis.

749
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,880
And I didn't know who that was.

750
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:09,480
I just like watching, you know, seven songs worth of a law.

751
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,280
And this is boring.

752
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,000
But then I discovered the guy who was hosting that episode

753
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,680
wrote The Jackson Fives Never Can Say Goodbye.

754
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:21,000
It's a guy named Clifton Davis, who's the star of the show. Amen.

755
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,760
So I was a little more like, oh, my God, I got to see that guy perform.

756
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,120
That's weird. So I scoured the entire two hours.

757
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,480
And I was mostly disappointed and it would cut to the audience.

758
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:34,680
And like I could tell I could see my mom, but not me.

759
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,720
There'd be a pillar just right in front of me.

760
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,720
But I did find a single shot.

761
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:43,760
And if you guys check your text messages and I'll post this on Twitter to

762
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:48,520
I found the one shot in the two hours where you can see me.

763
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,560
So we'll throw that up on Twitter.

764
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:54,600
You get a little bit of Clifton Davis hitting the last note.

765
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,440
And then I hear I hear you guys playing it. Great.

766
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,440
Oh, yeah, I see. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

767
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,320
There we are. Hallelujah.

768
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:08,160
My mom, I feel like, is in shoulder pad city.

769
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,520
She's she's dressed in the night. Unbelievable.

770
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,080
Yeah. Yeah.

771
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,720
Very excited to find that.

772
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,720
I've been saving that till it till we talked about some religious stuff.

773
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:22,960
So, yeah. Hey, I'm I'm a praise the Lord supporter.

774
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,960
I know all about it.

775
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:29,400
You tie the 10 percent.

776
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:33,840
Hey, if they if they put hammer in front of me, I'll I'll tie it wherever they need.

777
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,240
I wish he did. Can't touch this, though.

778
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,240
Oh, yeah, of course.

779
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,360
Or pray the Prince sampling.

780
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,880
Oh, yeah, yeah. Religious.

781
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,440
I guess that would have been more appropriate.

782
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,200
Or if they or I mean, the ultimate would have been some, you know,

783
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:55,880
religious themed scrub of his dirty gangster era song, Pumps in a Bump.

784
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:01,960
I don't know what I don't know what religious rhymes, you know,

785
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,640
hosts and a cup, maybe

786
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,320
like communion wafers and wine.

787
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,840
Hosts and a cup.

788
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,680
I want the priest with the host in a cup.

789
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,240
Seats in a seat in the pews.

790
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,080
Get on your feet.

791
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,000
Seats in the pews.

792
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,400
It's in the pews.

793
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,320
Seats.

794
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,320
Oh, seats. Yes, that's right.

795
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,320
Seats.

796
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,600
But they were I think any religious listeners appreciate our use of seats

797
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:34,080
rather than dirty or words for yes, for.

798
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,880
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

799
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,360
So anyway, I believe they still.

800
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,480
That's great.

801
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,760
I think they still list Hammer under their like secular

802
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:46,960
personality hammer, Mike Huckabee and of course, Kirk Cameron.

803
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,440
Well, we call them secular.

804
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,600
Well, like the I am describing the list as like here.

805
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:58,840
The Wikipedia had the list of pastors and then the list of like more

806
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,640
personality kind of hosts.

807
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,280
I see. Gotcha.

808
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,480
So there's still I guess just because they aren't like

809
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,200
they aren't ordained.

810
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,600
Yeah. Although is hammer a camera is a minister, right?

811
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:14,240
Yeah, I mean, you know, they they actually all three of them

812
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,800
might be ordained for all I know.

813
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:19,880
But I feel like her camera goes pretty far.

814
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:24,800
OK, so I started to say a little earlier, the whole thing about TBN,

815
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,360
which they they claim this isn't their main thing,

816
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:32,640
but it's kind of their main thing is what's known as the prosperity gospel.

817
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,880
Again, this is a different L.A.

818
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,920
Times article, the prosperity gospel is rooted in the idea that God wants

819
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:44,160
Christians to prosper and that believers have the right to ask him for financial gifts.

820
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,920
TBN has woven this notion into its round the clock programming,

821
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:53,240
as well as thousands of fundraising letters it mails every day.

822
00:46:53,920 --> 00:47:00,200
So that's why you see people saying things like put Jesus on the credit card

823
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:04,480
or if you're broke, that's all the more reason to send us money

824
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,640
because God will pay you back tenfold.

825
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:11,720
Right. No, I don't think that's the best idea.

826
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:17,560
Like, I'm not I don't begrudge anyone their faith, but yeah, no, this

827
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:20,640
this stuff sucks. Like, this is bad. Don't do this.

828
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:25,440
It does. I kind of like that in this case, because of this park

829
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:29,920
that people's donations led directly to,

830
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:38,000
you know, an animatronic of an old theologian or to a or to a laser show.

831
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,880
I mean, I guess that's not good, but, you know, usually donations.

832
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,400
That's better. Yeah.

833
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,400
But, you know, yeah, your donations.

834
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,880
I hope people got repaid tenfold in lasers, too.

835
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:54,680
Yeah. And not the people who paid for Jan Crouch's private jets.

836
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,440
God. So, yeah, Jan Crouch,

837
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,240
one of the main people behind TBN and one of the main hosts.

838
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,120
Praise the Lord.

839
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:05,600
The director and CEO of the Holy Land Experience.

840
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:09,600
And if you're wondering, is Jan Crouch the big pink haired lady?

841
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,120
Yes, that is the big pink haired lady.

842
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:16,280
You know who I'm talking about, if you've ever flipped on TBN for a second.

843
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,560
Yes, she's the pink hair.

844
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:23,720
I was reading, I believe her origin story has something along the lines of

845
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:28,640
she a chicken got hit and almost died, but then she prayed and it was resurrected.

846
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,560
Yeah, I have that.

847
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:33,160
She was she was 12 years old.

848
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:36,160
Her chicken got hit by a car.

849
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,680
One of its eyes was dangling out of its socket and then she prayed.

850
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,080
And then the bird recovered.

851
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:46,680
Yeah, so that's the sort of like that's, I guess, how you justify.

852
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,880
Well, obviously, she has an experience

853
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:53,440
that like would justify that she has this deep connection to the Lord.

854
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:58,600
Yeah. So then with this,

855
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:02,600
if the basis of her faith is on bringing chickens back to life,

856
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:07,400
then how does she justify selling chick filet at the Holy Land Experience?

857
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:10,600
That's one of the first.

858
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,560
Yeah, there's a Daily Beast article about this, and that's one of the first things

859
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:16,280
they say in there is that as soon as you walk in, you can get chick filet

860
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:19,040
or a naked juice.

861
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,920
Really weird. I think the chick filet is in like a Greek thing.

862
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:27,120
It's like what used to be the front of a Mediterranean restaurant.

863
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,560
And now you just get chick filet there.

864
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:32,480
Yeah. And I think not fresh chick filet.

865
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,240
Like if you drove probably half a mile away,

866
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:38,240
you would get new current chick filet.

867
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:41,920
But instead, at the Holy Land Experience, you're getting three day old chick filet.

868
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:48,040
That's also right by the coffee establishment. Holy coffee.

869
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,440
What is that? Is that a pun or not?

870
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,600
I don't know. I don't know the answer to that.

871
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,680
I don't know what their thinking was behind it.

872
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:03,280
Well, the best restaurant, my favorite restaurant, is called Last Snack.

873
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,840
That is that's actually pretty funny.

874
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:10,640
And the picture on the website is just a big hot dog.

875
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:14,400
So, well, you know why I like it.

876
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,200
But like and then you got Martha's Kitchen.

877
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,160
That's got a big turkey leg picture.

878
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:22,680
Then Esther's Banquet Hall, which is just a picture of a burger.

879
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:26,720
A really crappy, really awful.

880
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,480
You know, all that stuff about food styling about, all right,

881
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:33,480
you prop it up with the cardboard and, you know, you may put a little fake

882
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:37,040
glue glisten on it that looks like it's shining or something.

883
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,440
They just didn't do any of it.

884
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:42,720
This is the most this is like if McDonald's just took photos of the real food.

885
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:47,200
Yes. Like if it was just like an iPhone, an old generation iPhone photo

886
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:52,120
of like the actual like hamburger, you would get it like 11 p.m.

887
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,920
Should we arrange this burger to be symmetrical?

888
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,080
No, I don't worry about it.

889
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,400
No, it doesn't matter. It's fine.

890
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:03,000
I have I have I have done a few fast food commercials and the way they shoot those.

891
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:04,840
It's it's insane.

892
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:07,960
It's like you can't have anything like squirting out of it.

893
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:12,160
You can't have any sort of it just has to look truly perfect.

894
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:17,280
Like I had to bite into a Wendy's chicken sandwich and the avocado like couldn't

895
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:22,000
like couldn't encroach on certain parts of the lettuce and the bun.

896
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,600
While the bite was happening.

897
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:28,480
Wow. Wow. Weird like border rules seeming.

898
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,040
Yes. Yes. Very similar to what's going on in the Middle East.

899
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,320
Yes. If that's what you're going.

900
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:38,360
We do. Yes. Do not encroach.

901
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,040
That's that's bizarre.

902
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:45,160
Did you learn anything about how like, you know, that, you know, lettuce is actually this or,

903
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:50,960
you know, the tomatoes are plastic or is there some some revelation?

904
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:56,480
No, just a woman in gloves with like about 50 different chicken sandwiches,

905
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:01,040
like sternly telling me what to do and me not really having many questions.

906
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Hmm. The Stern Burger Lady.

907
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:11,400
I've I found a listing for I think when I referred to a Mediterranean restaurant

908
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:14,720
that is now just a Chick-fil-A, I think maybe what it might have been before.

909
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,640
I found this in kind of an older guidebook.

910
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,200
There was something called the Oasis Palms Cafe.

911
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:24,680
And I think this might be this is what we're looking for,

912
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:29,000
because I'm sure we all checked around to see like where are there like themed item names?

913
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,240
Because that's that's what you want in in any themed restaurant scenario.

914
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,360
And almost not at all in Martha's Kitchen or Last Snack or any of those.

915
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,480
But we got them at the Oasis Palms Cafe, the sadly retired Oasis Palms Cafe.

916
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,800
Let's see. Goliath burgers like that.

917
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,680
Jaffa hot dogs.

918
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,760
Anyone know what Jaffa refers to?

919
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:58,560
I don't. Jaffa was a place with a location, I believe.

920
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,880
Yeah, I just typed it into Google and it's all news results about like riots

921
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,400
and people dying in Jaffa.

922
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,640
So anyway, you can get a hot dog.

923
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,560
It's themed after it.

924
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,480
Oasis chicken,

925
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:15,320
Bedouin beef, Tabgha tuna.

926
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:16,760
That's another word I don't know.

927
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:17,960
Is that a city?

928
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:23,040
Do we know or is it a or is it a type of what is the type of tuna?

929
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,280
Could be. Yeah.

930
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:29,040
Tabgha is a place that is a sea of Galilee adjacent place.

931
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:33,160
Arabian chicken, Centurion salad.

932
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,480
That might be the winner for me.

933
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,400
That is good. Yeah.

934
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,040
Shepherd soup.

935
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,240
Shepherd soup.

936
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,640
Does that mean it's lamb soup for?

937
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,280
Hmm.

938
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,800
Not sure.

939
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,240
It doesn't it doesn't.

940
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,000
Yeah, not shepherd's pie.

941
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,120
Right. That's yeah, that's what I'm familiar with, of course.

942
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:58,080
And then Caesar's delight.

943
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,760
I'm confused by that.

944
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:04,280
Is that a Caesar salad or is that just something else that Caesar would have liked?

945
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:08,440
Is it is that Caesar have like a familiar is there like is it kind of like the Walt

946
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:11,240
Scotch mist, like Caesar's favorite meal?

947
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,920
Is that documented anywhere?

948
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,520
Yeah. Which back then is what?

949
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,920
Like some grapes with flies on them.

950
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,520
Yeah. Well, but like less flies, less flies.

951
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,200
Yes. Like a peasant would have to eat like, you know,

952
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:30,640
20 to 23 flies per pile of grapes.

953
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,960
But Caesar would only have like four.

954
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,080
They'd pick them out for him.

955
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,880
I've got a good sense of historical food, I think.

956
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,920
But it's recreated for you here at the Holy Land Experience.

957
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:49,720
I had not to move completely past Jan Crouch.

958
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:55,160
She because she got a lot of damage done in all her time in Orlando.

959
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:59,760
There was a lot of accusations of misappropriating network funds,

960
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:03,360
expensive homes, private jets, massive custom wigs,

961
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:08,360
a hundred thousand dollar air conditioned mobile home solely for her dogs.

962
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:13,040
For well, like this as universal fans,

963
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:17,440
for nearly two years, she rented adjoining rooms for herself

964
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:21,720
and her two Maltese dogs at the Lowe's Portofino Bay Hotel.

965
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,640
While she was building, it says while she was building

966
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:27,320
the Holy Land Experience, it was built, she's bought it.

967
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,920
So I don't know what she's talking about.

968
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:33,720
And which, by the way, I mean, again, if you can get it,

969
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,920
if you have the means, I think we'd all love to hang out with a couple

970
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,400
dogs at the Portofino Bay for two years.

971
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,200
Oh, yeah. Especially religious dogs.

972
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:45,120
Blessed dogs. Yes. Yeah.

973
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,960
It is the most expensive hotel at Universal.

974
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:52,240
So and very close to this area.

975
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:57,880
Was she more of it was Jan more of a universal person or a Disney person?

976
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,080
I guess universal.

977
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:01,200
But I guess it's maybe just proximity by living there.

978
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:01,960
And that's proximity.

979
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:05,000
I also asked earlier,

980
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,960
who is the most Christ like Disney character?

981
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:13,240
Do we have a character if we if we remind ourselves what Jan Crouch looks like?

982
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:19,320
Does it does it does she strike you as being similar to any any Disney walkarounds?

983
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,840
She's I guess maybe my knee jerk is Cruella DeVille.

984
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:27,720
Yeah, this she she doesn't look like this, but honestly,

985
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:31,760
the first cartoon character that jumps into my mind is the woman,

986
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,440
the bad guy woman in the Chipmunks movie.

987
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:39,040
I know that's not completely the looks right, but I feel like the vibe is similar.

988
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:41,360
What was that character's name?

989
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:44,000
I don't know the game of the character, but I will never forget

990
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,240
just the way they drew those human characters in that chipmunks movie.

991
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,360
Oh, way too like rotoscopy.

992
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:51,280
I like to like drawn right on top.

993
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,360
And yeah, very disturbing. Absolutely.

994
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,000
I'll send a photo.

995
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,440
Miss Miller is the name.

996
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,320
Yes. Yeah.

997
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:03,240
I believe that the Chipmunks are in her custody.

998
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,440
Yes. Yeah.

999
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,120
Here's the photo incoming.

1000
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:09,120
If Jason, if you know, Jason, you know, I'm talking about.

1001
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,720
I believe I do.

1002
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,680
Wait, Miss Miller isn't the villain, is she?

1003
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,040
Does she just make it?

1004
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:16,640
Miller is.

1005
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:20,440
Mrs. Miller is like the like nice, but like maybe a little dopey.

1006
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,320
Oh, I messed up. OK. Yeah, it's not.

1007
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:24,440
Who's the villain then?

1008
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:28,400
Well, these two people, this is just the first Steins.

1009
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:32,400
I guess it's the further two people, this a man and a woman.

1010
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,320
Claudia and Klaus Ferkstein.

1011
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,000
Yeah. Do you have a picture of them?

1012
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,720
I will soon.

1013
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:40,360
All right. I think I got I think I got it here.

1014
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:41,120
Yeah, here we go.

1015
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:42,120
It's going to send twice.

1016
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:44,960
You're going to get two pictures of the Klaus Steins. Mm hmm.

1017
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,080
The first Steins, Klaus is the first name.

1018
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,560
I see. OK.

1019
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:51,400
Mm hmm.

1020
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,640
I'm excited. Yeah.

1021
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,120
Yes. Yes. Oh, yeah.

1022
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:57,440
She has kind of the Joan Crawford hair a little bit.

1023
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,600
It's not they don't look exactly like her, but that I don't know.

1024
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,280
That was the character that jumped in my mind.

1025
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,440
Yeah, that's a pretty cool.

1026
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:08,840
I I don't I think I did not look closely at the pictures of the crouches.

1027
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:12,280
So I am just getting the full Jan Crouch hair experience

1028
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,680
on Google right now.

1029
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:18,560
And the rich are so dull.

1030
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:22,160
The rich are so gaudy like

1031
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:26,600
it's like Medusa from the Marvel universe, the inhuman

1032
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:29,520
with the giant hair that she could use as a weapon.

1033
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,880
Yeah, she does not. Yeah.

1034
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:36,040
I mean, like it's like almost like she saw Dolly Parton

1035
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:40,320
and was like, I'm going to do it my way, but then like had no actual style or anything.

1036
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:44,280
I think I'm sure there are exceptions to this rule.

1037
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:46,040
And tell me if you can think of them.

1038
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:47,440
Dolly herself might be.

1039
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,760
But I feel like colored hair

1040
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:56,440
past 65 is a dicey area.

1041
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:01,360
Hmm. You mean on natural like in like a purple, which is not a natural color.

1042
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:04,160
Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1043
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,800
Yeah, I don't know.

1044
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:09,080
But I somebody might be able to point out a very good example of somebody

1045
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:12,640
who's very cool with bizarre wig colors at an older age.

1046
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:15,800
Yeah, I can't off the top of my head, Jason. Yeah.

1047
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:20,080
Well, as punk rockers age, like I'll be cool.

1048
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,960
I'd be cool with it if like Kim Gordon was doing it.

1049
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,480
You know, sure.

1050
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,400
You have to have like red. You have to have some cred.

1051
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,280
Yeah. Mm hmm.

1052
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:31,760
But if it's just because like, you know, because I'm fun,

1053
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:34,280
because I got I got spirit.

1054
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:37,720
I don't know how I feel about that.

1055
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:41,120
She's very confusing also, because when you sometimes when you say

1056
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,960
the lady with the crazy hair, the religious, the televangelist

1057
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:47,320
lady, the crazy air, you're tempted to think that's Tammy Faye Baker.

1058
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:50,680
Like it was easy for me to confuse these two.

1059
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,760
And and now it's that just makes it a type.

1060
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,520
I don't know if there are other crazy wig televangelists like this.

1061
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:59,560
There probably are, but just like of the five famous ones,

1062
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:02,080
two of them are crazy wig ladies.

1063
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:05,840
Yes. I mean, Tammy Faye is the name recognition because I did not.

1064
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:08,400
I'm sure I've seen a picture of Jan before, but I was not.

1065
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,800
I wouldn't have known her name.

1066
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,160
I don't think I did either. No, no.

1067
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:16,440
Now we know it would be interesting, like the sort of like

1068
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:20,760
maybe like local regional version version of this.

1069
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:24,200
Are there like 50 crazy hair wig ladies

1070
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:27,080
trying to be the next Tammy Faye or Jan?

1071
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:31,200
I'm not sure, but that's a reality show I would enjoy watching.

1072
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:33,000
Yes, I think that's a good idea.

1073
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,120
Well, again, we're giving these things away for free.

1074
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:41,080
Just looking at her, I feel like Jan probably definitely terrorized

1075
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:45,360
the room service waitstaff at the Portofino, right?

1076
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:47,840
Like she was definitely a pill.

1077
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:48,920
There's no way.

1078
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,160
Where's my wedding woodpecker pancakes?

1079
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:54,680
I would imagine.

1080
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:57,440
I mean, look, there's there's some really dark stuff

1081
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,920
if you really want to go down a rabbit hole, which I don't.

1082
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:01,480
I don't. Yes.

1083
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:04,480
Up to you if you want to Google Jan Crouch lawsuit.

1084
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:09,520
It's so bad. I don't want to devote the show to it, but she's like she's horrible.

1085
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:14,040
I will not feel bad about shitting on her poorly themed coffee stand.

1086
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,880
Yeah, it's the least she deserves.

1087
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:18,960
Only coffee is stupid.

1088
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:23,320
Also, I had an affair with a Holy Land Experience employee.

1089
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:26,600
Lots of fun stuff going on on the plus side.

1090
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:31,280
On the brighter side, I believe that this place was designed by a place called

1091
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:35,840
ITEC Entertainment that, according to their website, also designed Marvel Mania.

1092
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:40,600
Yeah. I mean, you could feel you can feel the DNA.

1093
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:43,480
You can feel it, I think, if you look at some of the photos.

1094
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:44,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

1095
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:47,560
And her resemblance to Medusa might have helped

1096
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:51,760
the ITEC get on board.

1097
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:55,960
And also the like, if you look at the map for like the layout,

1098
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:59,840
it is so funny because it's clearly like done by a theme park designer.

1099
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:04,640
Like it's it looks exactly like like if it didn't have a religious aspect

1100
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:07,240
to the map, you'd be like, oh, yeah, this is some sort of theme park. Got it.

1101
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:10,000
Yeah. Yeah, I like the water feature.

1102
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,040
The landscape architecture looks nice.

1103
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:15,280
I would feel very stressed out if I had to be the guy

1104
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:18,680
who had to keep up the he is risen

1105
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,200
floral arrangement every day.

1106
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,880
That feels like too much pressure. Mm hmm.

1107
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:32,200
Yeah. Keeping flowers alive, like making Jesus be reborn over and over.

1108
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:35,280
I'm already it's very warm in this room, so I'm forgetting.

1109
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:38,040
Did we actually go through a list of everything on the map yet?

1110
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:40,600
Not yet. No.

1111
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:44,640
Yeah. Maybe it's time to talk about what you do at the Holy Land experience.

1112
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:49,000
Yeah, because it kind of breaks down to shows and exhibits. Mm hmm.

1113
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:52,640
Are we are we going to the list or do we just want to call out?

1114
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:55,480
I think well, yeah.

1115
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,720
I mean, there's one thing I just want to say first.

1116
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:03,920
It's number 11 on the map and it's smile of a child adventure land.

1117
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:07,400
I didn't want to take a screen grab of that

1118
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,320
because I was afraid I'd get on a list.

1119
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:13,880
Well, I'm sure as we're doing this through Zoom, we have now been placed

1120
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:17,760
on various lists by the spyware inside it.

1121
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:20,600
But I will look with the context of we have to talk about it.

1122
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:23,400
We have to talk about the smile of a child.

1123
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,840
Yeah, I know a little about what's in there.

1124
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:30,200
I mean, the the one that really jumps out is that

1125
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:35,000
there is a little exhibit where you go inside

1126
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:38,680
the whale that swallowed Jonah. Right.

1127
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:43,080
And it seems like up on the in his innards,

1128
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:47,320
like kind of up on his stomach wall linings, there's

1129
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:52,480
he's also swallowed an octopus and a starfish.

1130
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:58,120
And don't quote me on this, but it seems like they have mouths that that would move

1131
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:02,640
like they look like kind of flappy mouths like the the Tiki masks

1132
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,680
in the in the Enchant Tiki room.

1133
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:07,680
Yes, that is that's there.

1134
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:10,600
You can play miniature golf.

1135
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:14,240
Well, I think what I was I figured out the entomology here.

1136
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:18,560
I think it was just a it was just like walk arounds and there wasn't anything

1137
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:20,640
to like tactile to do.

1138
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:23,280
So I think they added mini golf as like something to do.

1139
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:27,240
And so now you can I believe now you put through the whale's belly.

1140
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,160
They like left everything.

1141
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:30,960
Oh, I see. I see. And turned it into mini golf.

1142
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:33,560
Wait really quick before you say it, because we're going to we need to say

1143
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:35,160
the name of the mini golf.

1144
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:37,400
One video I saw where you go into the whale's belly.

1145
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,120
You hear a voice.

1146
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:40,800
And I don't know if it was Jonah or a starfish or what it is.

1147
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:44,200
But this gives you the kind of the tenor of the smile of a child area

1148
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:49,400
that I just heard, like a very silly cartoon voice say, God, my father,

1149
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:51,800
forgive my stubbornness.

1150
01:04:56,120 --> 01:05:00,080
The funnest place for kids in Orlando by far.

1151
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:03,760
Hey, kids, come to the park.

1152
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:05,960
Ask for forgiveness from God.

1153
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:11,960
Forgive me for coloring out of the lines at the coloring station

1154
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:14,200
at the smile of a child adventure land.

1155
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:21,080
I did not finish my terrible hamburger at Esther's banquet hall.

1156
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:28,360
Forgive me for going over par at the Trinity mini golf.

1157
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:30,320
Yeah.

1158
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:34,680
That's what it's called, the Trinity mini golf.

1159
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:39,600
Trin-i-t-e-e mini golf.

1160
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:45,720
A mini golf place where the hole that I saw involved,

1161
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:51,640
you know, the obstacles kind of along the way are barnyard animals,

1162
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,000
donkey and such.

1163
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:56,440
And then at the end, right, right behind the hole

1164
01:05:56,680 --> 01:06:00,840
is a manger with the baby Jesus and Joseph and Mary around.

1165
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:04,600
So if you overshot it, if you hit really, really hard,

1166
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:07,760
you would just smack newborn baby Jesus right in the face.

1167
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:12,960
Yes, you have to be very careful on this thing, because, yeah,

1168
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:17,040
if you were to hit it like a drive, you could knock Joseph's head right off.

1169
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:20,280
Like these flats don't even look that straw.

1170
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:21,920
Like, they don't look like they could withstand.

1171
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,680
So if a kid like, say, you know, you know, like it's one of those kids

1172
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:27,440
that like extra aggressive, that like hits the ball too hard,

1173
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,160
could do real damage here.

1174
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:31,760
You really could.

1175
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:34,000
And I would wait if I had done this

1176
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:39,880
and somehow damaged the Holy Family, I think I would have wept and wept.

1177
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:43,760
I'm going to hell. I killed Joseph.

1178
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,400
And then they'd like the people, also the workers,

1179
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,360
that would probably been like, you're right.

1180
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:51,720
Yes, that's right. We're very sorry, son.

1181
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:57,120
Yeah, you're going to need to say 200 Hail Marys and eat five

1182
01:06:57,240 --> 01:07:00,360
last snack hot dogs.

1183
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:06,920
Mustard can't save you now.

1184
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:13,440
Where's your relish now?

1185
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:16,800
Is your relish now, Jesus?

1186
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:22,080
There is there is one where you're supposed to hit Goliath with a golf ball.

1187
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:26,080
You like want to. It's like David and the slingshot.

1188
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:29,960
There's also a smile of a child theater.

1189
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:33,000
Did you OK, wait, did you find the shows here?

1190
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:34,520
No, no, go for it.

1191
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:37,360
I believe it's the Roman soldier training camp.

1192
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,440
No. Yeah. Yeah.

1193
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:42,040
Jason, you found that?

1194
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:46,320
Yeah, I was going to say the the the smile of a child play area.

1195
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:49,760
Not the only thing for kids, because you can go to the Roman

1196
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:53,200
soldier training camp and unleash your inner warrior

1197
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,760
as you enlist in our Roman soldier training camp.

1198
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:59,600
Give us your loudest war cry and show us if you got what it takes

1199
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:02,160
to be a certified defender of Rome.

1200
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:04,840
That's wild.

1201
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:06,000
Whoa.

1202
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,760
Do we want to be Roman soldiers?

1203
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:12,240
Like, what point did Roman soldiers shift from

1204
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:15,760
pagan gods to Christianity?

1205
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:19,840
Because, yeah, when didn't they hurt Jesus?

1206
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:22,280
Yeah. Yeah. What?

1207
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:26,120
I don't. Yeah. Do they like teach you to like, all right, here's a stab a hand.

1208
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:29,000
Like, you don't want to be them, do you?

1209
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:32,120
The flattening of history.

1210
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:35,760
My my religious education did not do a good job about like

1211
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:41,600
contextualizing what was going on in the world and like who was ruling

1212
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:44,440
what parts of it at the time, you know.

1213
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:46,200
Yeah. Yeah.

1214
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:48,320
I'm an idiot when it comes to this.

1215
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:50,720
I've just sent you a photo from this this

1216
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,760
like pamphlet I'm looking at with all the shows that has a picture of a Jesus

1217
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:56,640
that looks very close to Will Forte.

1218
01:08:57,640 --> 01:08:59,040
Yes.

1219
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:05,200
Well, bless you.

1220
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:07,600
He really does.

1221
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:11,000
It could be like, could be.

1222
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,120
Did he do a run at

1223
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:15,000
once this photo?

1224
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:19,960
Yeah, he was actually discovered for SNL at the at the Smile of a Child Theater.

1225
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:24,200
Lauren and Marcy Klein go down to the Smile of a Child Theater

1226
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:26,960
once a year to see all the talent, the Jesus talent.

1227
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:31,480
You know, we ask them for three characters and too many of them

1228
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:37,040
just do Jesus, Satan and Lazarus and, you know, just variety is what we're after.

1229
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:39,920
I swear, if I see another fucking Mary Magdalene.

1230
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:45,080
Since you bring that up,

1231
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:49,120
I feel like a lot of Mary Magdalene in this park, right?

1232
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,080
I don't I don't recall.

1233
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:53,760
Well, she shows up at

1234
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:55,680
OK, which show is it?

1235
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:59,600
Simeon's House to watch Jesus's feet.

1236
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:04,640
She shows up at Lazarus's house

1237
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:07,520
because she is Lazarus's sister, I believe.

1238
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:08,520
Is that right?

1239
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:11,120
I think I think I read that

1240
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:15,920
Lazarus House is the one that struck me the most just because of this description

1241
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:18,080
that's on the website, multiple locations.

1242
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:21,720
Visit Lazarus's home and meet his beloved sisters,

1243
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:24,800
witness the unique dynamic of this family.

1244
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:26,840
And I don't know what it is.

1245
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:30,240
That phrase has just been ringing in my head for days.

1246
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:33,040
Like visit Lazarus's house, meet his sisters,

1247
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:35,680
witness the unique dynamic of this family.

1248
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:39,200
It's really it's a lot of nothing, huh?

1249
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:41,280
A unique family dynamic.

1250
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:46,160
I think the family dynamic is they yell at Mary Magdalene

1251
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:47,960
for being a sinner.

1252
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:50,960
Right. Am I wrong?

1253
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:53,840
Possibly could be sounds right.

1254
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:57,040
Could be. I'm looking at this and there's a longer description

1255
01:10:57,040 --> 01:11:01,920
that says enjoy live singing in a comical twist on one of the Bible's well known stories.

1256
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:07,160
Oh, so I'm not you know, maybe there maybe there's a little improv.

1257
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:09,400
Maybe they ask for a word in the middle of the show.

1258
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:14,080
They also call her Maria Magdalene or Maria Magdalena,

1259
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:18,720
which I know is I think it's some translations call her that.

1260
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:23,720
And if you need to make a telephone call in Lazarus's house,

1261
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:27,720
use the Dan. Yeah.

1262
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:32,720
If you come back to life and need to make a telephone call to say you're alive,

1263
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:35,520
you've risen from the dead. Use the Dan.

1264
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:40,080
The shows at Lazarus's house are so good,

1265
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:43,040
it'll have you coming back again and again.

1266
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:45,000
Is it hot outside?

1267
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,720
A little air condition sitting Lazarus's house will bring you back to life.

1268
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:51,480
The coolest cave in town.

1269
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:52,880
Coolest cave in town.

1270
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,880
But it's like it's like carousel of progress.

1271
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:58,400
Yeah, you can go there and sit down and get air conditioned 20 for 20 minutes.

1272
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,160
I would hopefully.

1273
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:02,560
And he lists all the inventions they don't have yet.

1274
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:06,800
Washing machines. Nope.

1275
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:09,880
Automatic air dryers. Not in our dreams.

1276
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:12,720
Quibi. No way.

1277
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:16,440
Do you realize this episode is the first post Quibi episode?

1278
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:17,880
Oh, yeah, you're right.

1279
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:21,280
Wow. We did. I mean, that means what that means is no one's listening.

1280
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:24,160
We're talking to no one because everyone is quibbling right now.

1281
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:26,880
That's a good point. That's that's that's a bummer.

1282
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:30,240
This is going to sit on listen to for for years. What are we doing?

1283
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:31,800
Let's just give up. It's a good man.

1284
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:34,840
It's fine that we're getting all these things about the Holy Land wrong.

1285
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,440
Yeah, no one's going to hear it.

1286
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:40,360
Judge Chrissy Teigen is going to put us in solitary.

1287
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:46,200
And then Chance the Rapper is going to punk our asses.

1288
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:50,240
We would be so lucky to get punked by Chance the Rapper.

1289
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,440
Oh, as long as he's got that hat.

1290
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,200
As long as he's got that hat on.

1291
01:12:55,200 --> 01:13:00,560
It was a being punking was a luxury only available in pre virus times.

1292
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:04,040
Now, the vast majority of punkings

1293
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:07,680
are considered gatherings of more than 10 people.

1294
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:08,680
So

1295
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:10,760
you could still do a zoom punking.

1296
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,160
The ultimate punk would be

1297
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:16,920
to reveal that there's like 200 people hiding in your house

1298
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:18,720
and they all come out and cough.

1299
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:21,920
Oh, yeah. What a what a hilarious punk.

1300
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:24,520
Ha ha ha. You got me.

1301
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:29,960
Well, in terms of perhaps disappointing attractions,

1302
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:34,240
one of these articles I read, forgive me for not knowing the name of the book,

1303
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:35,800
but it's called The Ripper.

1304
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:39,160
One of these articles I read, forgive me for not knowing the source,

1305
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:40,960
but they phrased it beautifully.

1306
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:45,520
Number 18 whipping post was just a wooden post

1307
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:49,160
with a cardboard cut out of a bloody Jesus being whipped to red paint,

1308
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:51,400
literally smeared all over it.

1309
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:55,080
Whipping post fun whipping post.

1310
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:56,320
Where was that?

1311
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:56,880
Where was that?

1312
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:58,080
Thank you.

1313
01:13:58,080 --> 01:13:59,720
It was number 18 at the time.

1314
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:03,120
I don't know if it was in the script or next to you or in the smile.

1315
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:06,960
Probably not in the smile of a child area, but no, I would hope not.

1316
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,560
But the child, the children can still go to the scriptorium,

1317
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:11,360
and I'm sure they would.

1318
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:12,240
Yeah.

1319
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:18,680
There was another fun sounding one is the day in the life,

1320
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:24,320
a day in the life of a monk, which is just it's just a room with an empty cot.

1321
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:28,520
What? Just a small little room.

1322
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:32,280
It's not minimal because we had no money.

1323
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:34,760
It's minimal because that's how the monks lived.

1324
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:39,160
You see, would you could you go in there for like a day or a week?

1325
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:42,120
I assume they wanted you in and out, though, because they had moved people.

1326
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:43,640
Yeah, I don't think so.

1327
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:47,040
I don't think you can room and board in the in the monk room.

1328
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:50,000
This is the monk in the life.

1329
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,000
This is the monk's home and meet his beloved cot.

1330
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:55,360
Witness the unique dynamic of his job.

1331
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:58,480
His beloved cot.

1332
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:00,040
That's my that's it.

1333
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:04,480
So I thought you were reading realistic enough.

1334
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:06,440
Yeah, really?

1335
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:08,760
One man in the cot, he loved dear.

1336
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:12,040
I was just swapping in the monk's specifics,

1337
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:15,440
swapping out laser specific, swapping in monk's specifics.

1338
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:16,800
Sure.

1339
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:20,040
I couldn't find a lot of information about the Ark of the Covenant,

1340
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:22,000
smoke and laser laser show.

1341
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:25,480
Yeah, I know there was.

1342
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:27,320
Did you look for a video?

1343
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:30,600
No, videos are a little sparing for this entire thing.

1344
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:33,640
I do know video policy or anything.

1345
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:35,760
Like do they say not to do video?

1346
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,160
Probably.

1347
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:39,280
Guys, I'm just like looking at the

1348
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:44,760
like map a little more or the one one of the pages of the map.

1349
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:49,480
And it did not dawn on me that the Empire

1350
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:56,240
and the Kingdom is a three part show at 1230, 215 and 315.

1351
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:00,560
And the parts range from 40 minutes to 45 minutes.

1352
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:02,400
Oh, that's it. Yeah, you're right.

1353
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:02,920
That's interesting.

1354
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:06,360
So it's it's it's not the same show over and over again during the day.

1355
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:09,280
No, you follow Peter's journey through Rome.

1356
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,200
Interesting.

1357
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:13,440
Oh, wait, wait a minute.

1358
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:17,120
The park closes seems to close around six o'clock every day.

1359
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:20,760
But the resurrection of Lazarus is at 525.

1360
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:24,080
So that's the equivalent of a Renaissance fair

1361
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,880
that has a joust as the last thing of the day.

1362
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:32,000
Is that the big is that the phantasmic?

1363
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,200
Is that the fireworks show is Lazarus rising?

1364
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:39,080
Well, I think the phantasmic is the passion.

1365
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:42,080
That's obviously the main draw.

1366
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:43,760
Oh, right, right, right, right.

1367
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:46,560
And they highly encourage everybody to see the passion.

1368
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:49,440
And, you know, even if you're experiencing another exhibit,

1369
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:51,560
I think they tell you, you know, the passion is beginning right now.

1370
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:53,480
So they really they really try to push everyone to that.

1371
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:56,360
What time is the passion?

1372
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:01,520
Well, if it's like the hours that I had to be sad, then it's from 12 to three.

1373
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:04,600
Which those those hours, Jason, you just listed were kind of in that window.

1374
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:07,760
Yeah. Yeah.

1375
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:10,160
I mean, it looked pretty like during the day to me.

1376
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:11,600
And it was funny watching.

1377
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:15,760
I did. There is some sparing video of the of the passion show.

1378
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:18,960
And, you know, because it's this little, you know,

1379
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:22,040
Middle Eastern town and there's like, you know,

1380
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:24,400
here's this little structure and some scenes happen up there.

1381
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:27,960
And then there's there's fighting and you're watching it in stands.

1382
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:31,800
It all reminded me so much of the Indiana Jones stunt spectacular.

1383
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:36,480
Oh, and actually, I just realized, including the abuse of whips.

1384
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:42,160
In this case, for much darker purpose.

1385
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:43,440
Yeah, that's a good point.

1386
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:47,440
Yeah, yeah. They have to like coordinate the sound effects like, you know,

1387
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:51,200
it's all the stuff you have to do in any theme park, you know, in the Waterworld

1388
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:54,960
show, you have to like make all the gun sound effects or whatever.

1389
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:58,680
So somebody's got to be watching the watching the guys whip

1390
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:01,640
and hitting the catcher every time.

1391
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:07,240
I mean, it would have gotten a lot more.

1392
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:10,680
It would have got a lot more guests if Indiana, like one of the Romans,

1393
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:14,400
had thrown off their their garb and it had been Indiana.

1394
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:17,160
Jesus, we got to get out of here.

1395
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:20,360
Do you have any idea what they're going to do to you, Jesus?

1396
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:25,400
And who are you?

1397
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:29,000
I'm from the future.

1398
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:31,880
I time travel in part five.

1399
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:33,520
You'll see. You'll see.

1400
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:35,600
It comes out in 2030.

1401
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:39,800
Marion or Mary or Marie, whatever your name is, come on.

1402
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,920
I'm 90 years old.

1403
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:47,760
I will say this, all the pictures of the live shows,

1404
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:50,400
they look like they're pretty well produced.

1405
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:55,400
Definitely. Maybe maybe maybe it's deceptive in just

1406
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:59,280
they've obviously taken pictures that look good, but it doesn't look chintzy.

1407
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:00,880
I will say that.

1408
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:03,480
No, I think I think it's plenty well done.

1409
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:04,680
Yeah, you're getting a show.

1410
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:07,120
You're getting I'm just saying, I think, you know, to give it a compliment,

1411
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:08,920
you're getting a show, at least.

1412
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:10,880
Yeah, it feels like certainly.

1413
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:15,440
I also let me do really let me do another specific quote here,

1414
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:18,440
because this really I mean, this explains Holy Land experience

1415
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:20,400
better than than anything I've seen.

1416
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:25,320
Atlas Obscura framed it as thus at Orlando's Holy Land experience.

1417
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:28,240
Jesus is crucified daily for your viewing pleasure.

1418
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,040
It's really strange.

1419
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:33,400
It's definitely very strange.

1420
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:37,600
And again, like I said, there's this whip sound effects and they at every

1421
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:42,960
step at every station of the cross where he is, he is abused and tortured.

1422
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:45,480
He gets bloodier and bloodier. It's crazy.

1423
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:49,120
This is the thing that they actively encourage kids to come to.

1424
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:55,480
And it's it is just a full on really gory passion, just like the film is.

1425
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:58,280
It is gorier than any horror nights thing.

1426
01:19:58,280 --> 01:20:00,160
The picture I saw, at least.

1427
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:03,160
Sorry, I was going to say you could also meet the living Christ

1428
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:05,040
at the miracle of the upper room.

1429
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:07,040
Did you guys come across that?

1430
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:09,320
Not sure I did. No, I didn't.

1431
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:11,720
It's offered four times a day.

1432
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:15,600
It's about 15 minutes and participants in this experience

1433
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:20,400
participate in a communion service with an actor playing Jesus.

1434
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:24,200
Huh? Yes, yes.

1435
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:28,000
And I saw somewhere that you get

1436
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:31,840
you get a wafer or a little piece of bread or something,

1437
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:34,000
and then you get like grape juice.

1438
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:37,320
Yes, Protestants use grape juice. That's correct.

1439
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:38,280
OK, yeah.

1440
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:41,320
So Protestantism, not for me, clearly.

1441
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:47,040
So there's multiple we were saying there's multiple Jesuses.

1442
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:50,800
Is it is it a situation, though, where like when you're in Disneyland

1443
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:52,880
and you see, oh, there's Mickey in a tuxedo,

1444
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:54,880
but then there's Mickey in his regular clothes.

1445
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:58,440
And then like, is there ever like our kids going to be a little confused

1446
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:01,720
if they see different Jesuses during the day?

1447
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:04,200
I have to imagine they would be.

1448
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:07,680
Yeah. And is it do you go by San Francisco?

1449
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:10,880
You go by Santa rules and one of them's Jesus's helper.

1450
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:14,800
You're right. Is that yeah, when the kid gets a little older, is it like,

1451
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:17,160
well, that one's beard is bigger than the other one.

1452
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:18,080
That one's taller.

1453
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:19,640
Like that's not the same.

1454
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:23,840
The same one covered in blood is not the same one that I met and got away from.

1455
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:26,960
That nice man gave us a snack earlier.

1456
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:32,040
And now those mean men are beating him up within to within an inch of his life.

1457
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:36,600
Mom, can we go back and see Muppet Vision 3D instead?

1458
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:39,240
No, we cannot.

1459
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:44,520
I and speaking of important and importance, the I think the

1460
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:48,920
the most important act that occurs at the Holy Land Experience.

1461
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:50,000
This is so crazy.

1462
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,240
I cannot believe this is true.

1463
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:55,720
Kind of related to the have a community having communion with Jesus.

1464
01:21:56,200 --> 01:22:00,360
I mean, I had to check multiple sources to discover if this was real and it is.

1465
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:04,680
OK, the sermon on the Mount occurs.

1466
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:07,640
That's another like mini show that Jesus does.

1467
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:11,400
After delivering a brief speech and pronouncing a blessing

1468
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:13,600
on what appeared to be plastic loaves and fishes,

1469
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:17,120
Jesus solicits costume cast members to feed the crowd

1470
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:19,640
in lieu of real bread and fish.

1471
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:24,720
Jesus's disciples deposit a handful of processed cheddar goldfish

1472
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:27,320
crackers into each visitor's hand.

1473
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,200
I can't believe that's real.

1474
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:32,800
They don't give you fish.

1475
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:35,240
They give you goldfish crackers.

1476
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:40,240
That is that's where like, you know, budget like budget

1477
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:46,240
and maybe like health concerns like really get in the way of making something authentic.

1478
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:48,800
I think so. Yeah, it's OK.

1479
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:52,600
It's really important for authenticity that everybody wear like really

1480
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:55,440
heavy fabric on their head.

1481
01:22:55,440 --> 01:23:00,240
But we can just give everybody, you know, pizza flavored goldfish.

1482
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:05,720
I mean, I guess, yeah, I guess I wonder if I wonder if it's always been that.

1483
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:09,120
I wonder if they ever actually tried to do the real thing.

1484
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:12,280
Well, look, you got to think about the wholesale rates here.

1485
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:15,720
OK, you're going to your money's going to go a lot farther getting wholesale

1486
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:19,320
processed goldfish than trying to buy cans and cans of sardines

1487
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:22,080
to give everyone a little fish, you know.

1488
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:25,080
Yes, yes. I mean, yes. Budget concerns.

1489
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:27,680
Oh, sardines, dear God.

1490
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:29,160
Yeah, that's fine.

1491
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:31,320
Let's stick with the goldfish.

1492
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:32,760
Jason, do you like sardines?

1493
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:34,280
I do like sardines. Yeah.

1494
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:37,720
But a bunch of canned fish when we all start going crazy at the grocery store

1495
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:40,600
about canned smoked oysters about sardines.

1496
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:42,760
Canned smoked oysters.

1497
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:44,280
I don't know about oysters.

1498
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:46,720
We always had smoked oysters growing out.

1499
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:49,200
Wow. I do like sardines, actually.

1500
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:51,360
I think it's an underrated.

1501
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:54,280
I think I liked it also because Michelangelo would put it on a pizza

1502
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:55,760
and I wanted to be like him.

1503
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:57,600
Yeah, I like you can.

1504
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:01,200
If you if you cook them in the pan a little, if they're already in olive oil,

1505
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:04,320
you cook them in a pan, toss in some tomato sauce, serve it over pasta.

1506
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:05,200
Delicious.

1507
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:10,200
Also, as I eat less meat, as I get older, it is just crazy.

1508
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:12,760
There is just literally like a whole fish.

1509
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:16,760
What do you think is the most

1510
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:21,440
if we're going for accuracy, what how do we make the goldfish more?

1511
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:24,000
If it's just plain cheddar, I don't know.

1512
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
I mean, first of all, you're going to want the mouth.

1513
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,400
Do all the goldfish have mouths at this point or are some of them still just plain?

1514
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:30,800
Oh, that's a good question.

1515
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:33,120
I don't know. I haven't had goldfish crackers in a long time.

1516
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:34,200
I haven't either.

1517
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:37,400
I should treat myself to a quarantine treat.

1518
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:40,920
But I'm trying to think.

1519
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:44,040
I mean, what's like the fishiest goldfish?

1520
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:49,600
Are the like I'm looking at their varieties and like, you know,

1521
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:52,960
s'mores flavored goldfish grams.

1522
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:58,320
What flavor blasted extra cheddar jacked?

1523
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:01,520
I don't know. They don't have really have like a fish.

1524
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:04,840
They don't have like a salmon flavored goldfish cracker, do they?

1525
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:06,640
It doesn't look like they do.

1526
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:08,920
No, there's no goldfish products that offer

1527
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:11,880
the taste of fish besides the shape of fish.

1528
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:14,800
Well, I found a I think it's probably fan.

1529
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,160
It's a Etsy type thing.

1530
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:22,160
But there's a goldfish crackers sweatshirt that I think Jason should get.

1531
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:25,600
Oh, yes, I mean that is it just the logo?

1532
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:26,800
What's going on with it?

1533
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:28,600
I'll send it right now.

1534
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:31,560
Jacked might be good because everyone's jacked to enter

1535
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:34,160
the kingdom of heaven when they accept Christ's blessings.

1536
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:39,080
Well, and a cracker being blasted with that much

1537
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:42,000
jacked, that much jacked cheddar.

1538
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,160
I mean, that seems like a miracle that only Christ could achieve.

1539
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:51,640
Maybe this maybe look, maybe it's the maybe you don't even have

1540
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:54,440
to have it be fish, maybe it's literally just in the morning.

1541
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:57,720
All of the goldfish crackers are blessed by a priest.

1542
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:01,120
Yeah, that would that would suffice. Yeah. Yeah.

1543
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:05,880
In the way the way the wafers become the body of Christ,

1544
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:09,960
the goldfish crackers become the bodies of real fish.

1545
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:11,640
Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

1546
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:14,880
So that makes sense.

1547
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:16,760
This apparently doesn't actually say goldfish.

1548
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:18,600
It has a different it has a different name on it,

1549
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:20,400
but it's basically the crackers and you'll see it.

1550
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:21,440
I just sent it.

1551
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:23,360
So I'm guessing it just is black.

1552
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:26,000
I'm guessing they maybe they bless maybe that maybe.

1553
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:29,480
So all the food is blessed in the morning.

1554
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:31,840
The chick filet is blessed.

1555
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:34,520
The naked juices are blessed.

1556
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:37,200
Caesar's favorite food item is blessed.

1557
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:38,160
Whatever that was.

1558
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:41,560
God's tidings upon this citrus sea monster.

1559
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:47,640
Right. This Coke Zero Mountain Dew Baja Blast

1560
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:50,640
turn water into Mountain Dew Baja Blast.

1561
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:56,880
The many daily miracles here at Holy Land Experience.

1562
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:01,600
I am another

1563
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:07,640
another daily miracle is the defeat of Satan

1564
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:10,760
within the passion performance.

1565
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:16,440
And this, you know, I again, I really regret that there isn't more good video

1566
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:19,560
or photographs because

1567
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:23,880
I saw several sources alluding to that their Satan

1568
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:27,960
is kind of a well to quote.

1569
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:31,040
This is from Jacob Silverman and the Baffler.

1570
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:34,800
The Satan of the Holy Land Experience is a marvelous creation

1571
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:39,520
knitted out in or kitted out, I guess, in ripped leather,

1572
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:42,240
a tank top, runny eyeliner and chains.

1573
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:46,200
They're like it's like a like a hot topic.

1574
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:50,520
Satan, I think it's like it is like a modern.

1575
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:53,760
It's like what they would cast in like a made for TV movie

1576
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:55,760
where it's like modern day Satan.

1577
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:57,560
Yeah, absolutely.

1578
01:27:57,560 --> 01:28:03,000
I think this it seems like their Satan could play in the Hollywood vampires.

1579
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:08,680
Alice Cooper, Johnny Depp, Satan.

1580
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:11,440
Johnny Depp, Satan.

1581
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:17,000
Is that still sort of if if like we're doing like a psychoanalysis

1582
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:20,920
of the people who put that together, are they still scared of like

1583
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:27,640
aging in their 60s, rock and rollers, 60s in their 60s and 70s, rock and rollers?

1584
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:30,680
Yeah, do they think that the rock stars are still like

1585
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:33,320
putting backwards messages in the music?

1586
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:35,600
Yeah, that might that's what I'm getting at.

1587
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:40,000
It's like, well, Ozzy Osbourne is public enemy number one still to this day.

1588
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:44,680
Like they've got an old school way of thinking.

1589
01:28:44,680 --> 01:28:48,280
And they're like, well, there's no better representation of state

1590
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:51,200
of modern Satan than Ozzy.

1591
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:53,640
I think so.

1592
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:56,720
Yeah, I think there's definitely people on this earth who are like

1593
01:28:56,720 --> 01:29:00,000
a thousand percent on board with everything Trump is doing,

1594
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,320
but they're still really mad about Bart Simpson.

1595
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:03,920
Right.

1596
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:10,760
Alice Cooper throwing up the devil's side, like the or the,

1597
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,440
you know, devil horns with his hand is still.

1598
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:16,360
They're just mad because he's a man who wears eyeliner.

1599
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:19,920
Yes. Also, his name is Alice.

1600
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:21,640
Woman's name.

1601
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:24,800
God does not want the genders to be confused.

1602
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:29,480
He doesn't know how to classify them once they arrive at Heaven's Gate.

1603
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:34,400
Meanwhile, like all these guys have done like Citibank commercials for credit cards.

1604
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:37,240
Like they're so far from.

1605
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:39,920
Alice Cooper is the right wing is guy.

1606
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:46,240
And the crouches, the people behind it are the most deviant psychopaths,

1607
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:52,920
the most upsetting lawsuits and affairs and money laundering.

1608
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:58,440
Like, yeah, got to watch out for kids listening to monkey's records.

1609
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:04,680
The true danger is anyone who dresses like Adam Lambert.

1610
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:06,840
Oh, yeah.

1611
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Chains, little spikes on a wristband.

1612
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:13,000
Not in the kingdom of heaven.

1613
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,800
Kids today have 21 pilots,

1614
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:19,360
but they should only have one pilot and his name is Jesus Christ.

1615
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:24,800
You really, Jason, you should write sermons for these people.

1616
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:27,160
I should write sermons for them.

1617
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:29,640
You'd make a little yeah, make a little money, make a little side money.

1618
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:35,520
The apparently then what happens is that this

1619
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:42,560
this goth Satan gets just walks up to Jesus and they just start punching each other.

1620
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:45,040
It's just a just a fist fight.

1621
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:47,360
And then and then Jesus wins, of course.

1622
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:53,240
And that makes sense because I think he has been training as evidenced by a photo,

1623
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:58,680
which I'll try to take quick and send to you guys where he it's a

1624
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:04,200
the corner of a boxing ring and Jesus is shirtless

1625
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:10,440
and in just shorts and his boxing gloves are hanging off of his arm.

1626
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:16,600
And he is super ripped, really well backlit.

1627
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:17,640
That's kind of true.

1628
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:20,840
That's one thing that makes Jesus always in every every painting and everything.

1629
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:22,320
He always finds his light.

1630
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:25,760
That's how you know he's special.

1631
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:28,080
But he was a star. He knew.

1632
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:31,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah. He he knows he knows his best side.

1633
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:33,520
He knows where his hair looks the most luxurious.

1634
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:35,560
But yeah, check out this photo.

1635
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:40,600
Jesus hanging out in the corner of the ring and the the the the side of the ring.

1636
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:43,160
It says Savior down the side.

1637
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:48,960
So in this painting, you can get Jesus like boxes.

1638
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:52,080
He trains. That's weird.

1639
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:54,960
Really strange. Yeah.

1640
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:58,600
Especially weird in the show that Jesus defeats Satan

1641
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:01,560
Satan by biting a chunk of his ear off.

1642
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:07,120
Well, they wanted it to be topical.

1643
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:10,240
Yes, but they never cut it out.

1644
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:11,120
They never cut it out.

1645
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:14,920
They tried doing a bit where Jesus hits him with a steel chair,

1646
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:19,120
but they messed it up and messed up the guys back so they couldn't do that anymore.

1647
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:20,600
You know what I will say, though?

1648
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:25,280
This is there's still more like activity going on here than in Galaxy's Edge.

1649
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:31,000
There's still more fighting and action that the fans demand here.

1650
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:35,880
Then, you know, Kylo Ren walks around, but he never fights Ray.

1651
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:38,040
Yeah. So I give them kudos.

1652
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:39,440
I give them credit. Yeah.

1653
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:43,880
Which is is funny, because if Bob Chaypack had followed the prosperity

1654
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:49,720
doctrine, the prosperity gospel and just put that little extra money

1655
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:53,520
to the people mover system, it would have paid off tenfold.

1656
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:56,320
And he wouldn't have had to take a 50% pay cut

1657
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,280
during these hard economic times.

1658
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:03,040
If you're saying that if he had put that third ride into Galaxy's Edge,

1659
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:07,720
he would have been able to have his full salary during the coronavirus outbreak.

1660
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:12,080
Yes. As like they say, the Holy Land experience, karma is a bitch.

1661
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:19,280
Another great mode you can see Jesus in is there's a cardboard cutout

1662
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:23,960
where he's just he's riding a big motorcycle.

1663
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:25,760
He's riding a big hog.

1664
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:27,680
Yes, I know. That's wild.

1665
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:29,400
Yeah. Yeah.

1666
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:32,040
And he's got angel wings.

1667
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:34,880
Why? Jesus has and Jesus isn't an angel.

1668
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:38,080
I mean, he's a lot of things, but he's not an angel.

1669
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:42,160
They may as well have like the buddy Christ from dogma.

1670
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:44,480
It's exactly like that.

1671
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:47,240
He's pointing. He's smiling a big smile and pointing.

1672
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:49,280
It's really wild.

1673
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:50,920
Yeah, I don't know what the thinking is.

1674
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:53,240
Is this like what we have, you know, because like,

1675
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:56,640
I guess we read that there's a little humor in the Lazarus show.

1676
01:33:56,920 --> 01:33:59,400
So is this like, you know what? We have fun, too.

1677
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:01,160
Jesus has fun.

1678
01:34:01,160 --> 01:34:03,000
It's not all blood and guts.

1679
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,160
Not too much fun, though.

1680
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:08,840
Not too much fun.

1681
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:11,000
But some fun.

1682
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,560
Some some fun, some fun.

1683
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:16,880
Firmly in the category of some fun is the one

1684
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:21,880
animatronic that I could find evidence of at the Holy Land Experience.

1685
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:26,000
And is it, you know, one of our our buddies from the Bible?

1686
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:29,680
Is it Noah? Is it Abraham?

1687
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:33,680
Or is it the scary snake for the bother Danimeneve?

1688
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:35,720
No, better.

1689
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:39,280
It is an animatronic of John Wycliffe,

1690
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:45,040
the 14th century English theologian, of course.

1691
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:49,040
And you can listen to him explain

1692
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:54,280
how he translated the Bible from Latin to English in 1382.

1693
01:34:55,640 --> 01:34:59,800
Oh, oh, OK.

1694
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:05,680
As my son, you don't seem especially excited to meet John Wycliffe.

1695
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:08,160
Oh, no, I am.

1696
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:10,120
Well, oh, very good.

1697
01:35:10,120 --> 01:35:12,240
I'm glad you're excited. Sit down.

1698
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:16,720
He has 25 minutes worth of explanation

1699
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:20,560
of translating from language to language.

1700
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:23,360
He knows many languages. He'll tell you all about it.

1701
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:26,760
These shows are so long.

1702
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:31,400
Yeah, yeah, they're all I mean, well, if that doesn't sound interesting.

1703
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:34,440
He is wearing like a floppy Magellan kind of hat.

1704
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:37,040
So, oh, OK. Yes.

1705
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:38,720
All right. I'm back on board.

1706
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:39,880
Sit down. We're good.

1707
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:41,360
Now we're going for your own safety.

1708
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:42,520
We have to buckle you in.

1709
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:47,240
So strap in and the straps will only come loose automatically 25 minutes from now.

1710
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:48,520
Are there straps?

1711
01:35:48,520 --> 01:35:50,000
I know. Hopefully so.

1712
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,200
But again, you have to ask.

1713
01:35:53,360 --> 01:35:57,920
Yeah, it's hard to tell in any of these places.

1714
01:35:58,240 --> 01:36:00,720
Yeah. So go here. Go see John Wycliffe.

1715
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:06,040
Go. You can go operate a claw machine.

1716
01:36:06,040 --> 01:36:07,720
That's a fun thing for a kid to do.

1717
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:10,560
And your ward may be a prayer bear.

1718
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:13,920
Yes. Oh, I love the prayer bears.

1719
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:18,720
They have a little like couch, like a kangaroo, and you slip a little prayer inside.

1720
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:25,520
Do you speaking of like prayer bears and plush, do we know about the camel?

1721
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:27,160
No, I don't.

1722
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:28,520
Nope. Go on.

1723
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:32,440
OK. Well, I was looking through eBay at different merch,

1724
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:37,480
and I believe the whole they it's a little bit hard to tell

1725
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:41,280
if it's like from Trinity Broadcasting specifically,

1726
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:45,320
or they just like I'm not sure where the origin of the camel is.

1727
01:36:45,320 --> 01:36:49,560
But there's a camel named Quaboo Q.A.B.O.O.

1728
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:54,240
the camel, and he is available at the Holy Land Experience.

1729
01:36:54,240 --> 01:36:58,600
But I think you also can probably get him on maybe like a home shopping network.

1730
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:02,720
I think if you actually pledge, you can get Quaboo the camel.

1731
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:05,480
But he's a very cute camel.

1732
01:37:05,480 --> 01:37:11,440
And he is you can get you can get a version of him on eBay for fifty dollars.

1733
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:15,560
Wow. And incidentally, I would like to congratulate

1734
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:17,800
Jeffrey Katzenberg on the launch of Quaboo.

1735
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:21,160
Yes, we're very excited about the Quaboo series.

1736
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,160
Quaboo of the pride.

1737
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:28,720
There's various there's like

1738
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:30,920
it's interesting looking at the merch, too, on eBay,

1739
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:33,560
because it's like there's sort of one off things.

1740
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:36,720
I'll see like lamb sheep plush soft toy.

1741
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:38,760
It looks very dirty, though.

1742
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:41,800
It looks I mean, I mean, like just like covered in soot.

1743
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:45,840
Like it's ashes. It's Ash Wednesday.

1744
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:50,680
Right. But they have, you know, pins like pewter pins.

1745
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:54,040
They have decorative glasses.

1746
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:59,800
They have candle frankincense and myrrh handpoured Christian faith candles.

1747
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:05,560
Wow. So you can spend a lot of money at the Holy Land Experience.

1748
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:09,240
Yes. And then there's also just, you know,

1749
01:38:10,240 --> 01:38:14,960
a lot of T-shirts, which, you know, maybe we want to get one or two.

1750
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:18,240
Yeah, sure. You think Quaboo is kind of the item to get?

1751
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:20,600
I think he seems like the number one.

1752
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:24,200
But I think he I just want to I need to do a little more investigating

1753
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:29,240
and seeing if he's more of a Trinity icon than an actual Holy Land icon.

1754
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:30,800
Oh, OK. OK. Yeah.

1755
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:34,720
That's what I'm suspecting is that he might be more of a Trinity mascot,

1756
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:37,080
which I'm less excited about.

1757
01:38:37,080 --> 01:38:39,640
He's a look. He's a cute camel. Cute camels, a cute camel.

1758
01:38:39,640 --> 01:38:43,160
But I want to make sure he's more associated with a theme park.

1759
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:46,720
And I have a suspicion he's a little bit more Trinity based.

1760
01:38:47,480 --> 01:38:49,400
Yeah. You want him to be original theme park.

1761
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:51,360
I.P. Absolutely. Right.

1762
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:54,920
And when this folds, I would have liked to own Quaboo

1763
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:57,520
when this park closes for good.

1764
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:00,240
I feel like everything's up for sale soon. Right.

1765
01:39:00,280 --> 01:39:02,440
I think you get a steal on Quaboo.

1766
01:39:02,440 --> 01:39:05,360
I think everything maybe in America is up for sale soon.

1767
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:11,640
To to negative here.

1768
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:18,000
I wonder what have we not discussed?

1769
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:20,160
Oh, one thing I missed about the devil is that

1770
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:23,720
it's at some point in time.

1771
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:26,880
This quote, this one, the Vice article, they

1772
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:29,800
they did break the reality.

1773
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:31,920
They break the fourth wall with the devil a little bit.

1774
01:39:32,120 --> 01:39:35,720
And somebody explains that now this is this his name is Eric.

1775
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:36,880
He's just an actor.

1776
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:40,520
I say this because a couple of weeks ago, we had a woman slap the devil.

1777
01:39:42,640 --> 01:39:47,080
Well, my people get so invested in it and the devil's being mean to Jesus.

1778
01:39:47,080 --> 01:39:50,240
Some people would walk up and how dare you beat him up?

1779
01:39:51,120 --> 01:39:55,040
What's really funny about that, like we've heard stories and I still don't know.

1780
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:57,360
I haven't heard firsthand, but we've heard stories of like,

1781
01:39:57,360 --> 01:40:00,880
oh, they had to take Captain Jack out of the park because women were flashing him.

1782
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:03,320
Like I've heard that before.

1783
01:40:03,320 --> 01:40:05,440
I don't know if that's just sort of an urban legend.

1784
01:40:06,120 --> 01:40:10,880
But if people thought because because the reason being people like

1785
01:40:11,120 --> 01:40:15,160
associated him with Johnny Depp so much, they needed to flash Johnny Depp.

1786
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:18,760
So I like the idea that they would go up to who they think is Satan

1787
01:40:18,760 --> 01:40:22,160
and just slap him and not try to murder him, not to try to destroy him.

1788
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:25,320
Yeah, they believe enough that he is the devil.

1789
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:27,240
This is the devil right here.

1790
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:31,360
But I just want to, you know, just just give him a little warning.

1791
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:35,760
You're yes, like like, yeah, like you're challenging him to a duel.

1792
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,640
Hit him with a little glove. You jerk.

1793
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:42,480
You are very uncouth, sir.

1794
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:46,680
I've read about some of the things you've done over the years and I do not approve.

1795
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:51,360
Does that mean there's like supporters of the devil to like are there

1796
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:56,000
hashtag devil innocent supporters as there are with John?

1797
01:40:56,760 --> 01:40:58,960
Free the devil.

1798
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:00,360
Oh, yeah, I'm sure there are.

1799
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:01,280
I would be interested.

1800
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:04,920
Is there any like kind of like edgy teens that go here

1801
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:09,080
just to go see the devil every day because they love the devil and cheer him on?

1802
01:41:09,080 --> 01:41:10,960
Yeah, he needs he needs our support.

1803
01:41:12,200 --> 01:41:14,480
Yeah, they're like they're devil stands.

1804
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:18,800
Do you think devil worshippers petition the Holy Land experience

1805
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:22,440
to sometimes let him win like the Washington generals?

1806
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:26,360
I would imagine, yeah, they should.

1807
01:41:26,360 --> 01:41:30,000
They should like once once a year, like they do with the free admission,

1808
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,600
they should let the devil win.

1809
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:37,680
It's only fair, you know, there's no stakes if Jesus always wins.

1810
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:42,440
Right. You need you need to have that possibility that the devil will win

1811
01:41:42,440 --> 01:41:46,040
for that drama, because if not, you know where the story is going to how it's going to end.

1812
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:50,000
And you guys, your big wrestling fans, you love a good heel.

1813
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,840
I mean, if they want this to be a good show,

1814
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:57,840
you got to build up the heel to be a significant challenger to the face.

1815
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:02,800
So, yes, sometimes the heel has to win in order to make him or her more of a threat.

1816
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:06,520
Yeah, that is what I thought of when you said someone slapped the devil,

1817
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:09,760
is that someone pulled a gun on who was it, Mike?

1818
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:12,080
Was it the ultimate warrior back in the 80s?

1819
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:16,880
Oh, my God. I a lot of wrestlers have a story in the 70s and 80s

1820
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:21,400
about getting a gun pulled on them because people thought that was all like

1821
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:22,840
they were actual villains.

1822
01:42:22,840 --> 01:42:24,920
They were actually that mean and cruel.

1823
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:30,200
Well, I think Andy Kaufman had a lot of what they like people really angry at him

1824
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:31,360
when he was feuding with Lawler.

1825
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:32,360
I don't know that he had a gun.

1826
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:34,240
Oh, yeah. I think a lot of those people.

1827
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:38,160
The idea was you would rile up a crowd so much that you would have to run to your car

1828
01:42:38,160 --> 01:42:41,240
so they wouldn't kick the shit out of you.

1829
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:45,360
Wow. Well, so I mean, that speaks to the quality of the devil performance

1830
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:46,960
that they were buying it that much.

1831
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:49,120
Yes. Right. Yes. Yeah.

1832
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:50,120
They're edgy. Yeah.

1833
01:42:50,120 --> 01:42:51,960
And there's a lot of wrestling in Orlando.

1834
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:54,720
So he should like, you know, he should do a little speech.

1835
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:57,440
It's a like tonight. I'm taking on the ultimate warrior.

1836
01:42:57,800 --> 01:43:02,120
Mm hmm. Well, the devil could pop into any of the different wrestling

1837
01:43:02,120 --> 01:43:03,960
taping in Orlando.

1838
01:43:03,960 --> 01:43:06,560
Yeah. Yeah. This is the best merger worlds they could do.

1839
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:09,560
Get the Holy Land experience devil

1840
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:12,680
in the in the next raw is really raw tape there.

1841
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:14,720
No, that's on the road.

1842
01:43:14,720 --> 01:43:16,760
But there's an NXT tapes there.

1843
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:18,480
And it's a term. OK. OK.

1844
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:20,440
Impact. Oh, no. Impact might tape in Canada.

1845
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:22,320
Anyway, I don't know. He's going to need work.

1846
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:26,200
So, yeah, when you get the devil up for grabs,

1847
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:28,920
wrestling, take note.

1848
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:31,920
Or you can just like join a

1849
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:34,520
cover, a black Sabbath cover band.

1850
01:43:34,760 --> 01:43:37,280
Either way, he's already he already dresses the part.

1851
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:40,000
Yes, he can bring his own eyeliner.

1852
01:43:40,640 --> 01:43:41,600
Yeah, exactly.

1853
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:44,240
Um, I what a place.

1854
01:43:44,240 --> 01:43:47,600
My God. My my God.

1855
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:50,040
My gosh. My gosh.

1856
01:43:50,040 --> 01:43:51,040
My gosh.

1857
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:55,200
Are we going to miss it if it if it does not fully come back?

1858
01:43:55,200 --> 01:43:56,480
I wish we went.

1859
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:57,760
I do wish we went.

1860
01:43:57,760 --> 01:43:59,840
So I will miss not having gone.

1861
01:44:01,080 --> 01:44:02,080
50 bucks.

1862
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:05,160
50 bucks is as rough, though, I'll say.

1863
01:44:05,160 --> 01:44:07,360
I don't mind not paying 50 dollars.

1864
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:08,520
I could have sent an email.

1865
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:10,440
We could have seen what we could have done.

1866
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:13,640
But when they have like asked us to make it a donation,

1867
01:44:13,640 --> 01:44:17,440
like it's it's against the Lord's will to get press comps.

1868
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:18,760
That's a good question.

1869
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:21,600
But if we said Patreon exclusive episode.

1870
01:44:22,600 --> 01:44:24,480
Perhaps this is Patreon.

1871
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:26,040
Yeah, it is. Right. That's what we're doing.

1872
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:27,040
No, no.

1873
01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:28,040
No, it's regular.

1874
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:30,640
It's the main feed right now.

1875
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:31,640
I'll cut it out.

1876
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:32,640
I'll cut the.

1877
01:44:32,640 --> 01:44:33,640
Whatever.

1878
01:44:33,640 --> 01:44:35,640
We don't know what we don't know what day it is.

1879
01:44:35,640 --> 01:44:36,640
We don't know what we're doing.

1880
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:39,160
Truly from being in this room, I had the door closed

1881
01:44:39,160 --> 01:44:42,640
and I literally felt like I've been losing my mind

1882
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:43,880
the whole time we're recording.

1883
01:44:43,880 --> 01:44:46,160
I need to figure out an air circulation in here.

1884
01:44:46,160 --> 01:44:47,640
It's getting hot for me, too.

1885
01:44:47,640 --> 01:44:49,560
Well, hey, no one's making us do it.

1886
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:52,080
We could we could end any time.

1887
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:54,600
Any final thoughts about the Holy Land experience?

1888
01:44:56,600 --> 01:44:58,600
I just again, I wish I went.

1889
01:44:58,600 --> 01:44:59,600
I wish I went.

1890
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:00,600
Again, I wish I went.

1891
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:03,600
I wish honestly I wish that they had poured more money

1892
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:05,600
from Trinity Broadcasting into this

1893
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:08,600
because it feels like Trinity has a ton of money

1894
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:10,600
and they should have really upgraded.

1895
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:12,600
Let's get a ride in there.

1896
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:14,600
Let's get more animatronics.

1897
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:16,600
Let's up the production even more.

1898
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:19,600
Let's you know, let's make it a five part series,

1899
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:21,600
not a three part series.

1900
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:23,600
I forget which show that was.

1901
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:25,600
I just wish the budget was higher.

1902
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:27,600
I just wish they really went nuts

1903
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:31,600
and it was like much more of an epic like shutting down now.

1904
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:33,600
Yeah, yeah.

1905
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:36,600
That they yeah, that they would go all out.

1906
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:39,600
I mean, the opportunity to have like full on religious dark rides.

1907
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:46,600
They definitely have not really made good on that that possibility.

1908
01:45:46,600 --> 01:45:48,600
And if this is all we're going to get,

1909
01:45:48,600 --> 01:45:51,600
this is kind of the biggest religious theme park.

1910
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:53,600
Definitely, definitely a bit of a letdown.

1911
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:54,600
Unless there's things we don't know about

1912
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:56,600
that have had full on religious dark rides.

1913
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:59,600
Yeah, but I don't I think we've we've asked before

1914
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:02,600
and no one's produced an example.

1915
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:11,600
So they should license the journey to Jerusalem thing

1916
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:14,600
from the the pavilion at Epcot, the Millennium.

1917
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:17,600
Oh, yes, that's floating around somewhere.

1918
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:19,600
Yeah, that's a good idea.

1919
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:21,600
Yeah, we talked about that on the second gate.

1920
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:24,600
There was a weird ride where you go to Jerusalem.

1921
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:28,600
Yeah, that's like begging to be here from the Millennium village,

1922
01:46:28,600 --> 01:46:35,600
although that might be a little too not Jews for Jesus see enough for the for this gang.

1923
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:40,600
Like that might be a little too like, well, OK, that's the first half of our book.

1924
01:46:40,600 --> 01:46:43,600
But the second half is where the real ticket is.

1925
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:48,600
You know, that's where your real ticket to ride is right in the heavens.

1926
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:53,600
I don't know.

1927
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:58,600
We've talked about what religious rides might be, I guess, before.

1928
01:46:58,600 --> 01:47:01,600
Is there something from Jesus's life that would make an especially good

1929
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:05,600
maybe if maybe some kind of like bumper car scenario where, you know,

1930
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:08,600
that they were he's like getting rid of the shopkeepers in the temple

1931
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:13,600
where you're like mowing over shopkeepers in a Mr. Toad madcap fashion.

1932
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:16,600
Oh, that's good. Huh?

1933
01:47:16,600 --> 01:47:21,600
Like 40 days and 40 nights in the desert.

1934
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:24,600
There's there's so many water ride opportunities.

1935
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:27,600
Noah's Ark, Jesus walking on water.

1936
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:32,600
I feel like those are givens. Yeah, right.

1937
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:38,600
I think there should be there should be more of a of a crucifixion.

1938
01:47:38,600 --> 01:47:43,600
It should be really like it doesn't go far enough here is what I'm saying.

1939
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:49,600
They should really like you should get like you should have that sheet like at the front row of a Gallagher concert.

1940
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:52,600
Like really the blood, I'm saying. Oh, I see. Oh, the blood.

1941
01:47:52,600 --> 01:47:55,600
Oh, gotcha. Yeah. Yeah.

1942
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:58,600
I mean, they should provide that just as a courtesy. Yes.

1943
01:47:58,600 --> 01:48:01,600
And they should have Gallagher do it.

1944
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:06,600
Like doing so many people do special runs as the devil this month. Gallagher.

1945
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:11,600
Yeah, you got a super. Yeah, you get like like older road like Jimmy JJ Walker.

1946
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:13,600
They'll do it one month. Yeah.

1947
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:17,600
Carrot top. Carrot top. Sure. Props involved in that one.

1948
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:21,600
That'll be kind of a sillier crucifixion. Yeah, but that's OK.

1949
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:26,600
Again, they have a sense of humor. So that's why you get these these guests.

1950
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:32,600
Satan's and Jesus. Yeah, I guess they're going to want to be Jesus's hammer.

1951
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:40,600
Obviously, hammers around hammer doing a stint as Jesus and doing his little hammer dance,

1952
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:44,600
his parachute pants dance on water. Oh, wow. There we go.

1953
01:48:44,600 --> 01:48:49,600
He not only survives the crucifixion, but he comes back to hammer dance

1954
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:54,600
because he is too legit to quit. Yeah.

1955
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:58,600
And that's such a great guy. Somebody's going to draw that.

1956
01:48:58,600 --> 01:49:00,600
Yes, please. Yes. Yes. Yes.

1957
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:05,600
The hashtag Jesus is hammer or hammer is Jesus. Hammer is Jesus.

1958
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:08,600
But for now, what's the worst that could happen?

1959
01:49:08,600 --> 01:49:10,600
We're already in the middle of a plague.

1960
01:49:10,600 --> 01:49:14,600
If we do something sacrilegious, we're going to get another plague.

1961
01:49:14,600 --> 01:49:18,600
I think Jason, Jason, daring the Lord now.

1962
01:49:18,600 --> 01:49:21,600
This is we're causing it by doing this episode at all.

1963
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:26,600
It's I'm sorry, everyone. It's no, we're calling out the money lenders in the temple.

1964
01:49:26,600 --> 01:49:29,600
We're overturning the tables now with these hypocrites.

1965
01:49:29,600 --> 01:49:31,600
That's correct. We did.

1966
01:49:31,600 --> 01:49:35,600
And I don't think it'll be a problem anymore because we yeah.

1967
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:37,600
Yeah. They look a whole experience.

1968
01:49:37,600 --> 01:49:41,600
I think it's safe to assume willfully close in the near future.

1969
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:45,600
You know, maybe it was the virus. Maybe it was them firing everybody.

1970
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:48,600
But who's to say podcast wasn't wasn't part of that?

1971
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:51,600
Don't mess with us. We'll take we'll take a little credit.

1972
01:49:51,600 --> 01:49:56,600
Yep. Yep. So get on our good side and offer us comps.

1973
01:49:56,600 --> 01:50:00,600
If you hear we're coming to Orlando. Fly us in.

1974
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:03,600
Fly us in on a private on your private jets.

1975
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:08,600
Put us up at the Portofino Bay Hotel with two Maltese dogs.

1976
01:50:08,600 --> 01:50:13,600
Yes, please. And then please like sterilize the planes before.

1977
01:50:13,600 --> 01:50:17,600
Yes, that would help. Yes, please. More important than holy water.

1978
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:22,600
Sterilize. It would be funny if they send us like three coach tickets.

1979
01:50:22,600 --> 01:50:25,600
Hey, when this is all over, we are the episode.

1980
01:50:25,600 --> 01:50:28,600
We want to make you happy. And they're like, no, no, no, no, no.

1981
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:30,600
Now you're coming now.

1982
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:34,600
Yeah, coach tickets are fifty dollars. Right.

1983
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:42,600
All right. Well, yeah, we'll revisit this if they do give us comps.

1984
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:46,600
That truly is the way into the kingdom of heaven, giving podcasters comps.

1985
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:51,600
But but for now, you know what? It's just for changing up the ending.

1986
01:50:51,600 --> 01:50:53,600
I will say podcast. The riot has ended.

1987
01:50:53,600 --> 01:50:58,600
Let us go in peace to love and serve Jan Crouch for more.

1988
01:50:58,600 --> 01:51:05,600
For more podcast, the ride visit the Holy Trinity, Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

1989
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:11,600
And for only five dollars a month, you can pass into the kingdom of podcast.

1990
01:51:11,600 --> 01:51:14,600
The ride, the second gate.

1991
01:51:14,600 --> 01:51:20,600
All are welcome for three bonus episodes every month at Patreon dot com slash podcast.

1992
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:24,600
The ride. Put the second gate on a credit card.

1993
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:26,600
Yeah, it's considered a write off, right?

1994
01:51:26,600 --> 01:51:28,600
Just like this park. I think it is.

1995
01:51:28,600 --> 01:51:30,600
Yeah, I know. Yeah.

1996
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:32,600
So think of it as a religious donation.

1997
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:41,600
If Florida can have tax exempt status for locations that display biblical artifacts,

1998
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:47,600
California should have a law that podcasters get all sorts of tax tax exempt,

1999
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:49,600
you know, benefits.

2000
01:51:49,600 --> 01:51:52,600
We're keeping this economy of California afloat.

2001
01:51:52,600 --> 01:51:59,600
Anyone who wasn't a podcaster before the virus certainly is now.

2002
01:51:59,600 --> 01:52:01,600
So and they're also good.

2003
01:52:01,600 --> 01:52:06,600
They're all great. And yeah, you know, you know, I usually I just like to plug what we're doing.

2004
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:12,600
But I, you know, in the spirit of Easter kindness, we should promote another podcast

2005
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:14,600
and say, please go check out the podcast.

2006
01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:20,600
I wish it promoted another podcast and say, please go check out Zach Braff

2007
01:52:20,600 --> 01:52:24,600
and Donald Faison's Scrubs Revisited podcast.

2008
01:52:24,600 --> 01:52:28,600
That also will assure your passage into the into the kingdom of heaven.

2009
01:52:28,600 --> 01:52:34,600
I would like to also announce Jason Sheridan and I are doing a podcast where we revisit old heralds that we did.

2010
01:52:34,600 --> 01:52:39,600
Oh, God. Don't we do that enough when we hang out?

2011
01:52:39,600 --> 01:52:41,600
Yeah, now we're recording it.

2012
01:52:41,600 --> 01:52:43,600
This is this is the content we need.

2013
01:52:43,600 --> 01:52:47,600
This is what will cheer up everyone in these troubled times.

2014
01:52:47,600 --> 01:52:52,600
Do you think also I don't know, no spoilers, but do you think that your guys

2015
01:52:52,600 --> 01:53:01,600
I know you guys were real bros in a lot of your heralds, but is your real life broship going to kind of come out in this podcast, too?

2016
01:53:01,600 --> 01:53:09,600
I would think that everyone will be able to finally experience our real life broship in their living room.

2017
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:11,600
So, yes, I guess the answer is yes.

2018
01:53:11,600 --> 01:53:14,600
That's sort of that's a mission statement.

2019
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:15,600
It's just I have it.

2020
01:53:15,600 --> 01:53:19,600
I have it written down right here.

2021
01:53:20,600 --> 01:53:27,600
It's just so it's so crazy that you guys played friends in improv shows and our friends in real life.

2022
01:53:27,600 --> 01:53:28,600
I agree.

2023
01:53:28,600 --> 01:53:33,600
And we're so happy to bring it to people's, you know, podcatchers.
