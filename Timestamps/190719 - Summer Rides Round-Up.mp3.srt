1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Forever.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,680
Dog.

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,780
Warning, the following podcast contains

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,960
critters moving around in a circle,

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,220
a banquet table filled with pie,

6
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,560
Jason interrupting a teenage date,

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,240
and a special look at three newish,

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,140
recently opened attractions.

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,440
It's the Summer Rides Roundup on Podcast The Ride.

10
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,520
["Summer Rides Roundup Theme Song"]

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,560
Welcome to Podcast The Ride,

12
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,640
where we have somehow gone months

13
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,920
without telling our audience that we got invited

14
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,600
to a free theme park pie buffet.

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,040
I'm Scott Garner, joined by Jason Sheridan and Mike Carlson.

16
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:56,880
Hi, yes.

17
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,280
How have we not, I mean, we were just looking

18
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,320
for a place to talk about it, I guess.

19
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,160
Yeah.

20
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,760
But how have we possibly sat on this

21
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,960
white hot information for so long?

22
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,300
We were trying to play it cool, I think, you know?

23
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,360
You try to, when you get invited to a cool thing,

24
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,840
when your status rises, you try to be like,

25
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,440
oh, we belong here.

26
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,280
Sure.

27
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,120
I was at the Vanity Fair Oscar after party.

28
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,960
Yeah.

29
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,960
And there was a Knott's unlimited pie table

30
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,720
surrounding the opening of Galico River Rapids.

31
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,960
Yeah, you know, no big, you know, it's just,

32
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,820
you know, I just don't want him to laugh me

33
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:32,660
out of the room, you know?

34
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,040
Yeah, so just act like you've been here is the phrase,

35
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,880
I think.

36
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,800
So that's what we were trying to do

37
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,000
and that's what we've been doing for months.

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,200
But we have to brag about it a little bit,

39
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,000
because that's really, as I said,

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,240
at the start of doing this show, I want free stuff.

41
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,320
I want to be invited to places.

42
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,720
That's what I want from this.

43
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,560
Access, sure.

44
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,920
Access, selfish, I just want to go.

45
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,480
Access to boys and berries.

46
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,480
And any other berries that we don't know are delicious

47
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,320
that are coming to us.

48
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,160
Yeah, any berries.

49
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,180
So that still goes.

50
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:03,000
If you have a berry-based festival or treat or pie

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,480
at your theme park or themed area, invite us.

52
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,640
Let us have it for free.

53
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,080
Or Berry Farm.

54
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,920
Or Berry Farm, sure.

55
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,640
If you just do a berry festival.

56
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,440
Is there another berry farm that we could go to like Knott's?

57
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,560
Is there, like, is another berry farm exist?

58
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,880
Well, they need to grow them somewhere.

59
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,080
But is it like fun?

60
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,920
I'm gonna make sure there's hay rides and like, you know.

61
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,240
Well, there's also, there's Knott's,

62
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,200
wherever the berries are actually made today,

63
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,080
which is not Knott's, because it's all a theme park now.

64
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,920
Right.

65
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,000
So we're at an actual farm.

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,680
Facilities are, and I don't know,

67
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,760
I don't have a bag of Knott's cookies in front of me

68
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,600
to be able to tell.

69
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,420
Right.

70
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,680
Well, okay, out there, listeners, let us know

71
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,800
if you know of any fun berry farms, real or fake,

72
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,480
if it's just like Knott's in a theme park,

73
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,200
or if it's an actual berry farm

74
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,640
where you can have loads of fun,

75
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,440
please let us know on Twitter.

76
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,280
I'm gonna forget that you asked for that

77
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,640
and one day wake up and go like,

78
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,460
why are people just telling us about assorted berry farms

79
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,600
throughout the country?

80
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,160
We should do a tour of berry farms.

81
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,000
Close enough.

82
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,200
Yeah, close enough.

83
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,040
So yeah, let's, we haven't really said

84
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,680
what we're talking about exactly yet.

85
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,000
Oh yeah, well today, this is a little like,

86
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,200
we're compiling, I realize that you could unite

87
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,840
all of these rides that we're talking about today

88
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,720
and call it the reskins of summer.

89
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,560
Oh yeah.

90
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,640
Sure, that's true.

91
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,880
Three, obviously the big theme park story this summer

92
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,080
is Star Wars Galaxy's Edge, which in its,

93
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,640
is really, I mean, is also a billion dollar reskin

94
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,200
of a goat ranch.

95
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,040
Sure.

96
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,880
Yeah.

97
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,880
Really extensive reskin.

98
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,680
That apparently has the same attendance as the goat ranch.

99
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,840
Yeah, I guess so.

100
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,840
It's not a failure.

101
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,720
It's just a room to graze.

102
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,960
No, aesthetically great, great reviews from people.

103
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,800
Mm-hmm.

104
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,840
Blocked out, too many passes blocked out.

105
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,680
Too many passes blocked out.

106
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,200
It'll be interesting to see that, yeah,

107
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,560
that's a whole other debate.

108
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,720
Is this another one of these Disney Star Wars conspiracies?

109
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,560
But I don't know, I think it does have something to do with,

110
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,400
I'm not sure.

111
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,440
Also, they just jacked up prices,

112
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,180
they jacked prices at least once this year significantly.

113
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,940
Maybe a second time more quietly.

114
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:22,300
Have they considered lowering prices to get people in?

115
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,140
Lowering?

116
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,420
They're raising them while the attendance is going down.

117
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,460
They have that deal, which I just utilized with my parents.

118
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,300
Oh, yeah.

119
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,780
Which is the $99 park hopper ticket for a day.

120
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,620
Oh, nice.

121
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,460
If you have an annual pass.

122
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,900
I may do the same with my mom.

123
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,260
Do you have to do it in advance

124
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,420
or can you buy it on the day?

125
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,260
How does that work?

126
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,180
You do it on the day.

127
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,020
Okay.

128
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,140
So you just go to the ticket booth in the morning and do it.

129
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,620
Okay, I agree.

130
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,700
So very easy, yeah.

131
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,860
And obviously.

132
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,500
So the talk of the theme park world is,

133
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,980
Galaxy says it's the $99 bring a buddy pass,

134
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,180
but we're gonna manage to step away from this

135
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,260
and talk about some other things.

136
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,940
There is a new Rapids, not a totally new Rapids,

137
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,260
but a redone Rapids ride at Knott's Berry Farm,

138
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,660
Calco River Rapids.

139
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:08,660
And then the two final missing components of Pixar Pier,

140
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,040
Jesse's Critter, Carousel,

141
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,200
and the inside out emotional whirlwind.

142
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,600
These are, they're, you know,

143
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,440
they're not as big of stories,

144
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,000
but I think worthy of us talking about a little bit.

145
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,880
I'm going to go out on a limb and say

146
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,080
the most successful elements of Pixar Pier in my eyes,

147
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,880
having seen these both now.

148
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,840
You think more than the Incredicoaster, really?

149
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,240
Yeah.

150
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,920
More than the Cookie Num Nums?

151
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,200
No.

152
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,640
The Cookie Num Nums has significant operational issues.

153
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,880
Namely, it's in a weird spot.

154
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,600
It's hard to deliver fresh deep dish cookies that quickly.

155
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,960
Have you had one since we tried them last year?

156
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,560
I don't think I have.

157
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,400
Wow.

158
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,720
And you were a big fan too.

159
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,040
I was a big fan, but like,

160
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,440
I don't get back there that often.

161
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,080
Would you want to try, what do you mean?

162
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,720
We go on the Incredicoaster pretty often.

163
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,960
I guess so.

164
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,240
So you're just breezing right by the cookie cart.

165
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,400
Yeah, because there's like a line with no shade

166
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,600
for like a hot cookie in the middle of summer.

167
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,440
Right.

168
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,280
So would you want it to trade places

169
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,520
maybe with like the churro, the Buzz Churro?

170
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,720
Or maybe the chicken stand.

171
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,280
Like that's supposedly bad, right?

172
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,720
The chicken stand should go.

173
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,560
Yeah.

174
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,160
I mean, aesthetically, I like that.

175
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,920
I actually would disagree.

176
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,120
I don't really like the aesthetic.

177
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,200
I don't like the big box.

178
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,040
Yeah, it looks cheap to me.

179
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,800
I kind of like the box.

180
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,120
Well, you gotta go at night is what you do

181
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,760
where the whole, everything is shaded.

182
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,600
The whole world is shaded.

183
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,440
That's true, yeah.

184
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,280
I mean, it all does look good at night.

185
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,160
Have your hot cookie at night.

186
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,000
Yeah.

187
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,040
Perhaps a better time anyway.

188
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,520
Does Jack Chex close during World of Color?

189
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,360
Good question.

190
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,200
I don't know the answer.

191
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,040
Not sure.

192
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,360
Jesse's Critter Carousel I think does.

193
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,640
I saw a sign.

194
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,200
That's one of, there's not a lot to talk about

195
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,040
with any of these things.

196
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,480
There's like four, so when there's a sign

197
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,400
in front of one of the rides, that's one of the five things.

198
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,680
So that's off my list.

199
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,520
Right.

200
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,760
Yeah, these things are all a lot of fun.

201
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,800
I will say there's another, obviously,

202
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,320
a major, another reskin of summer,

203
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,280
the Jurassic World attraction,

204
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,200
which we have not gotten to do yet.

205
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,040
Yeah.

206
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,480
We're not prepared on that,

207
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,720
so we will hit that at a later date.

208
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,040
We were starting to question,

209
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,200
is this gonna open in a very long time from now,

210
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,080
and then suddenly it just came together,

211
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,440
and we're caught with our pants down.

212
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,280
Yeah.

213
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,100
We're not gonna be there.

214
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:30,940
Not gonna be there.

215
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:31,780
I mean, we could.

216
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,920
We could go later today if we wanted.

217
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,760
I guess we could.

218
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,600
Do we want to?

219
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,420
Spend our own money.

220
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,540
We'll pass.

221
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,300
We're waiting on a media invite.

222
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,140
I think we got snubbed for that.

223
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,100
Do you, did it happen?

224
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,180
I think it's...

225
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,380
Is that true?

226
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,220
I believe so.

227
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,340
When?

228
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,460
I think it's end of July.

229
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,340
And there's a, but there is a media preview?

230
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,180
Yeah.

231
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,220
Should I email?

232
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,540
You could try. I'm gonna have to email.

233
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,380
All right, I didn't know.

234
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,200
I'll tell you more off mic.

235
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,040
We'll talk off mic.

236
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,420
Past guests of the show are going.

237
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,660
Like, already heard about it.

238
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,340
Past guests of the show?

239
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,180
What the heck?

240
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,020
And not us?

241
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,360
How many?

242
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,520
Just one that I know of.

243
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,360
One?

244
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,200
Well, that's different.

245
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,720
You added us and asked that all of our guests are going.

246
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,980
You said past guests.

247
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,080
Oh, sorry.

248
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,160
You should have said, a past guest is going.

249
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,640
A past guest is going.

250
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,480
You made it seem like very different.

251
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,320
We're more legitimate.

252
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,800
You made it seem like Sheer was going.

253
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,840
Kyle Mooney's going.

254
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,120
Justin Michael's going.

255
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,400
Jeff Garland's bringing my wife?

256
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,560
How dare he?

257
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,040
Wow, everyone's going.

258
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,080
All right, just the one.

259
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,640
Interesting.

260
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,880
Okay, well, we gotta sort this out then.

261
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,120
We'll figure this out.

262
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,680
Well, one past guest of the show went as a lay person.

263
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,560
Matt Mazzani, who was on our episode

264
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,180
about Jurassic Park, the ride,

265
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,480
went on it this morning, texted me,

266
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,000
really liked it, rave reviews.

267
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,440
Yeah, a lot of people I'm seeing really like it.

268
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,280
Mm-hmm.

269
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,120
Yeah.

270
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,960
Seemingly.

271
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,800
So yeah, that's exciting.

272
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,720
Yeah, we're not gonna talk about that,

273
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,840
that you're maybe like more wanting us to talk about.

274
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,680
Oh, yeah.

275
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,720
We're gonna talk about a carousel with some new critters

276
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,120
and the...

277
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,520
We're gonna talk a lot about critters, honestly, today.

278
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,360
Yeah, a lot of critters.

279
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,200
There's a lot of critter talk.

280
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,040
Yeah.

281
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,240
I'd say I was surprised. Critters of the mind

282
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,480
and inside out. That's true.

283
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,360
Reading about all of these, there's a lot of details.

284
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,760
Like they put a lot of thought into all of these

285
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,600
is the thing that ties them all together.

286
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,440
The Pixar ones you're talking about?

287
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,920
And Calico.

288
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,760
Oh, okay.

289
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,160
And the Rapids.

290
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,000
Where do we wanna start?

291
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,840
Do we wanna start with Calico?

292
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,680
Yeah, where do we wanna start?

293
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,800
Which one has the least thought put into it?

294
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,400
What has almost no thought put in?

295
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,240
I don't know.

296
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,080
A lot of thoughts being put in with inside out,

297
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,920
obviously.

298
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,040
It's all about putting thoughts in places.

299
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,880
I don't know.

300
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,200
Well, you wanna get to this pie?

301
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,040
Maybe that's...

302
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:40,880
Yeah, let's start with that.

303
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,720
Oh, sure. Let's start with that.

304
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,560
Let's start with the exciting thing.

305
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,960
So we got invited.

306
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,760
I've been begging on this podcast for a long time

307
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,560
for Knots to invite us to something.

308
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,800
We did get to go to that haunt,

309
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,640
but that was through Doug Barnes.

310
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,360
That was through Doug Barnes in season pass,

311
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,120
which was very nice of Doug.

312
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,680
But we had not gotten an official invite via Knots

313
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,160
until this Calico River Rapids opening.

314
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,080
Which, by the way, so that's a ride

315
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,840
that's been in the park for a long time since the 80s,

316
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,640
but it was a relatively unthemed rapids ride.

317
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,640
A very nice rapids ride, good greenery and everything,

318
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,480
but no particular anything to it.

319
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,280
And this was their attempt to do...

320
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,840
It's a spiritual sequel or companion to these rides

321
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,760
that we're very fond of,

322
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,440
the Timber Mountain Log Ride and the Calico Mine Ride,

323
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,200
which have gotten this influx of new animatronics.

324
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,040
Right.

325
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,920
Opened originally in 1987 as the Bigfoot Rapids,

326
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,360
which someone from Knots pointed out,

327
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,080
did not feature Bigfoot in any way.

328
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,920
Yes. And now it does.

329
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,760
And now it does feature Bigfoot.

330
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,720
But it's not called Bigfoot Rapids anymore.

331
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,560
Right.

332
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,840
Which I think they're trying to go with a Calico branding,

333
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,760
which makes sense, but it is funny,

334
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,000
because Bigfoot, you're like, oh cool,

335
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,040
I'm gonna go see Bigfoot.

336
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,280
And now if you were a kid and you heard just Calico Rapids,

337
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,520
you'd be like, oh, that doesn't invoke maybe,

338
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,360
oh my gosh, we're gonna see a monster.

339
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,200
Yeah.

340
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,880
I forget where I got caught with no...

341
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,320
I got caught being a dumbass when I was talking about...

342
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,280
Somebody asked me to explain what the word Calico is,

343
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,080
and it was one of the where I started the sentence

344
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,600
thinking I had an answer and then it collapsed as I went down.

345
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,040
It's the town.

346
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,840
Yeah, but what's that word mean?

347
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,720
You know Calico, it's like one of those,

348
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,200
it's like old, it's when old time,

349
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,960
it's like a spur factory.

350
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,800
I don't know, what does Calico...

351
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,640
Is it a cat?

352
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,880
Is it a type of cat, Calico?

353
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,080
I guess so.

354
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,120
I'm looking it up now.

355
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,760
I did not know the answer to it.

356
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,600
Oh yeah.

357
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,440
Right?

358
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,280
I was talking it up, like adding Calico

359
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,480
to the name of this ride gave it a lot of meaning.

360
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,040
What is that meaning?

361
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,600
Definition of Calico according to Merriam-Webster.

362
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,480
A, cotton cloth imported from India.

363
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,600
B, British, a plain white cotton fabric

364
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,480
that is heavier than muslin.

365
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,680
Is that a fabric?

366
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,080
M-U-S-L-I-N.

367
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,920
Yeah.

368
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,760
Okay.

369
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,160
Any of various cheap cotton fabrics with figured patterns.

370
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,480
And then the second definition is a blotched or spotted animal.

371
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,120
Well then why is everything in the old west called Calico?

372
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,200
Why is every state in America have a Springfield?

373
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,000
Like, I think it was just kind of a go-to.

374
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,640
But Springfield doesn't have like a definition like this.

375
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,120
Springfield is just a name.

376
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,760
This seems to be like either having to deal with

377
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,800
patterns or cloth or an animal.

378
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,840
So maybe just like a fun, it's a fun word.

379
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,280
I guess there was patterned cloth around.

380
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:45,360
There was underneath the pie, aforementioned.

381
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,400
Does Mike Nesmith have a song called Calico Girlfriend?

382
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,360
Is it a monkey song?

383
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,640
Oh, please look it up.

384
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,040
Jason's disdained for a classic rock.

385
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,480
That seems pretty random to me.

386
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,200
I think you pulled that out of nowhere.

387
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,040
Yeah, it is Mike.

388
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:58,880
It is.

389
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,920
Really my question was, was it a monkey song?

390
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,360
But it's a Michael Nesmith solo song.

391
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,640
He was one of the monkeys.

392
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,360
Yeah, so I don't know what that means.

393
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,520
It doesn't cloth girlfriend or spotted girlfriend?

394
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,920
What does that mean?

395
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,520
It's about him dating a rag doll.

396
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,920
Or a cat.

397
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,800
Filthy Michael Nesmith or a cat.

398
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,320
Michael Nesmith dating a cat.

399
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,400
None of the answers are good.

400
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,400
Unless the song was somehow fictional.

401
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,240
I can't imagine it was.

402
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,080
I feel like in the old west,

403
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:31,160
they were just naming stuff because they needed to.

404
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,240
I'm rewatching Deadwood right now.

405
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,640
And like, Deadwood, I don't,

406
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,880
what does that fucking mean?

407
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,720
Deadwood?

408
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,540
This is an odd logic to me.

409
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,520
They were naming stuff because they needed to.

410
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,440
Everything is named because it needs to be.

411
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,280
Was there a higher rate of things

412
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,080
needing to be named in the old west?

413
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,240
I mean, they were just churning stuff out

414
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,480
and claiming stuff and setting up camps and all.

415
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,960
So I don't know that they were,

416
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,880
what I'm saying is Deadwood, Calico,

417
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,560
I don't know that they were putting much thought

418
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,600
into any of the naming.

419
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,240
But Deadwood's also made up.

420
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,400
Or is Deadwood a real place?

421
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,080
No, Deadwood was a real boom town.

422
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,760
Deadwood is, a lot of the show is inspired by real,

423
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,280
while Bill Hillcock was shot dead in Deadwood.

424
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,120
Okay.

425
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,080
Was Deadwood though,

426
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,800
referencing to like just trees that were dead though?

427
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,520
Cause that would make total sense to me.

428
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,960
If it was like they settled a place

429
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,760
where it was like there were just old trees.

430
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,760
Deadwood, you go, great.

431
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,440
I know what that means 100%.

432
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,520
I'm sure there was plenty of splotched animals

433
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,240
wandering around the woods.

434
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,360
So splotched animals.

435
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,520
Plenty.

436
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,680
Yeah.

437
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,160
I guess, okay, so bears,

438
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,360
let me go through the animals on the Calico.

439
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,720
Bears, splotched.

440
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,400
But those are, that's more,

441
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,600
the salmon's included cause it's being caught by a bear.

442
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,440
Yeah.

443
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,280
I'm sure it's not a Calico salmon.

444
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,600
No, not a Calico salmon.

445
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,440
There's a bear.

446
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,800
There's a, what's the thing hanging out above us

447
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,760
on the Calico ride?

448
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,360
What am I, why am I forgetting what it is?

449
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,400
Oh, the mountain line?

450
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,600
The mountain line, yes.

451
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,160
Is he splotched?

452
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,000
Not really.

453
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,360
Not really.

454
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,200
Not a ton.

455
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,520
Well, so some listener will tell us what we're missing here.

456
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,360
I think there's a piece of the puzzle with Calico.

457
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,200
We're missing a lot.

458
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,920
The fact that I didn't know what Deadwood,

459
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,480
Deadwood was a real place.

460
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,680
Al Swearegin was a real guy.

461
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,520
What's that?

462
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,960
Al Swearegin, the guy,

463
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,560
the main antagonist in the show, Deadwood,

464
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,760
played by, what's that guy's name?

465
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,960
Yeah, he was in.

466
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,800
John Wick and stuff.

467
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,640
I know.

468
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,480
He runs the Continental.

469
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,000
No, we have no information for anyone.

470
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,040
He's the guy who swears on the ice.

471
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,880
He's great.

472
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,720
Really good at cursing.

473
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,800
Why can't I think of this man's name?

474
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,640
I see his face.

475
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,480
Well, I wasn't gonna argue that that.

476
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,320
I haven't even watched the show.

477
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,160
He played Blackbeard.

478
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,880
I wasn't gonna argue that that guy wasn't real.

479
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,720
People are so mad.

480
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,360
I'm not questioning the events of Deadwood in general.

481
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,480
I'm sleepy right now,

482
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,800
and I can't think of this guy's name,

483
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,480
and I know his name.

484
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,320
He was in.

485
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,160
People are so mad at us right now.

486
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,000
We could shave.

487
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,200
No one, they'll look it up themselves.

488
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,520
We owe the listener nothing.

489
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,200
We could talk about anything else.

490
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,560
That's true.

491
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,720
Jason, are you looking his name up?

492
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,560
Why can't I think of his fucking name?

493
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,400
Yeah, I don't.

494
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,080
I love him, and I can't pull.

495
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,920
I have him right here.

496
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,400
His name is, hold on.

497
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,240
Here we go.

498
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,080
I can picture him so vividly.

499
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,560
I have a photo of him right now.

500
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,960
I know him.

501
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,800
Ian McShane.

502
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,640
Oh my god.

503
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,200
That's who we were after was Ian McShane?

504
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,040
So embarrassing.

505
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,040
He kicked his ass.

506
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,320
Okay, well, let's get back to the event.

507
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,680
We were invited to an event at Knott's Berry Farm finally.

508
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,480
At Knott's Berry Farm in the ghost town,

509
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,240
in Calico ghost town,

510
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:38,080
which is for the sake of Knott's continuity.

511
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,920
Calico is their ghost town where the mine,

512
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:47,920
yeah, as you said, the mine train is and the log ride

513
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,080
and where the ghost town alive,

514
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,760
you meet the towns folks, you interact.

515
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,440
We met a lot of towns folks.

516
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,520
Yes, so they basically, they had an event

517
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,040
and they had all the actors

518
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,040
who play different roles in the town.

519
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,080
If you've never been to Knott's,

520
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,960
they have a fully immersive land essentially.

521
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,640
What they're talking about with Star Wars land,

522
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,680
where it's like Batuu and they say certain phrases,

523
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,880
and Knott's has been doing this for a little while longer

524
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,720
of like they're fully in character.

525
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,200
The phrase howdy.

526
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,040
Howdy.

527
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,800
You gotta learn all these phrases.

528
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,000
There's like a whole, there's a mayor.

529
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,360
There's a mayor, but then there's like a power structure

530
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,400
in the government, remember?

531
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,160
There's like a vice mayor or something.

532
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,080
I looked this up.

533
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,280
There's a deputy mayor.

534
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,120
Oh, that's right.

535
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:33,920
That's the one we met.

536
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,800
Yes, yeah, we talked to the deputy mayor for a little bit.

537
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,480
So everyone who was part of this press event

538
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,480
got led in by a specific person from the Calico town.

539
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,320
Yes.

540
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,320
Under the guise of there's a celebration,

541
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,520
but on the way, there's enough time to talk about.

542
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,800
Have you heard rumors of this creature apparently?

543
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,160
Yeah, so that was real fun.

544
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,880
They, and I forget the two brothers.

545
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,520
They're like, oh, have you seen these two brothers

546
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,480
hanging around?

547
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,280
The, well, I wrote these all down.

548
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:11,280
The brothers are John Potts and John Coulter, two Johns,

549
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,520
and they, like Lewis and Clark, opened up a new path

550
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,800
for expeditions, and that's what this rapid ride is.

551
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,280
And there was a big opening ceremony with a,

552
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:26,280
what, here, a more unfocused what are words conversation.

553
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,520
What kind of music was that music?

554
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,520
Kinda like little brass band, old Westie.

555
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,400
Oh, yeah, like John Philip Sousa shit.

556
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,680
Like marching band garbage.

557
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,760
Yeah, marching band garbage.

558
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,760
Are you not a Sousa fan?

559
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,000
You don't like the Sousa marches?

560
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,200
I would think you as a child would love the Sousa marches.

561
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,560
I have my limits.

562
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,320
Really, not a Sousa guy.

563
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,120
Scott, you seem like you would be a Sousa fan as a child.

564
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,400
Yo, because I liked history and stuff.

565
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,320
I think I must have written a report about him or something.

566
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,840
I remember looking up that everywhere said

567
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,720
that the great, all the great American music,

568
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,240
the greatest American musician was Aaron Copeland.

569
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,080
Oh, sure.

570
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,600
Made the great stirring American,

571
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,560
and I was never, I did not get into Aaron Copeland.

572
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,320
Which is probably, I think I'd be a hard to relate to

573
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,280
person today.

574
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,680
My favorite musical artist was Aaron Copeland.

575
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,360
I in band.

576
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,640
No offense, I.

577
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,720
Yeah, no, those are all, I was in band my whole,

578
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,880
whenever fifth grade to high school,

579
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,040
so all the band teachers just fuckin'

580
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,640
had a big boner for Sousa and Copeland.

581
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,480
Guys, Sousa.

582
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,480
I gotta go Sousa.

583
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,120
I gotta go Sousa, yeah.

584
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,080
And then other jazz musicians probably.

585
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,640
So I got, I didn't relate to it.

586
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,400
I still thought the best song I've written

587
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,080
was the Ninja Turtles theme by Chuck Lorre.

588
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,400
Did you lobby to play that in the marching band?

589
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,400
No, I never, honestly, I never lobbied.

590
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,040
They would let us play this theme to the Simpsons

591
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,680
once in a while, and I was just fuckin' thrilled.

592
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,760
I don't know why I'm saying the F word so much,

593
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,080
I'm so sorry.

594
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,040
I was so thrilled.

595
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,360
Because you're trying to make it bad ass

596
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,920
that you were playing the Simpsons theme

597
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,960
with your marching band.

598
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,080
Yeah, it was like eighth grade,

599
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,440
and they like, because they would hand out the music,

600
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,960
and you wouldn't know what it was,

601
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,680
so they'd hand out the music, and everyone would just be,

602
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,800
oh, you hear the kids gasp a little bit

603
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,880
as it would go down if it was a cool thing,

604
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,000
which was just a TV or movie theme.

605
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,720
Getting to play the Jurassic Park theme

606
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,000
was just like, oh my God.

607
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,120
We got to play the Jurassic Park theme in a concert,

608
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,120
this is great, and then it would be like a Sousa march,

609
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,720
and I was like, who gives a shit?

610
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,360
Also playing the Simpsons as a marching band song

611
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,680
is, that's transporting you into the opening sequence.

612
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,520
Oh yeah, that's a good point.

613
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,560
That is the diegetic use of it,

614
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,920
and if one girl had gotten up,

615
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,360
played a pretty complex saxophone solo,

616
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,720
and spun out of the room.

617
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,360
That would have been exactly the same thing,

618
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,280
but that didn't happen, nothing fun like that happened.

619
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,120
Interesting, yeah.

620
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,160
There was no one that good, no one as good as Lisa.

621
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,960
Lisa was one of the most gifted musicians,

622
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,160
maybe of all time.

623
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,720
Yeah, at eight years old.

624
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,000
She's seven, and that's the level she played.

625
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,840
Certainly in Springfield.

626
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,760
I always thought eight, I thought Bart was 10.

627
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,600
She was eight.

628
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:15,120
I think you see Bart turn 10 in the Wally Weasel episode.

629
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,200
Oh yeah, right.

630
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,080
So you do see him turn an age.

631
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,600
But they're not necessarily chronological.

632
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,640
At this point we've seen Bart turn 10,

633
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,840
and won a Nintendo, and then turn 10 again,

634
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,400
and won Google Glass.

635
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,360
And there's also lots of, there's like,

636
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,720
Simpsons multiverses of what their futures are.

637
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,480
Some where Lisa's the president,

638
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,880
and others where Bart sounds different.

639
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,400
He sounds like an old man in one,

640
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,520
but he just sounds like regular Nancy Cartwright in others.

641
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,360
Yeah, yeah.

642
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,040
It's the most complex timelines is the Simpsons verse.

643
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,200
Yeah, I don't wanna get too off track here,

644
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,680
but Jim Hill was floating,

645
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,520
I mean Jim Hill floats a lot of stuff around,

646
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,720
but he was floating the idea that

647
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,960
Disney wants to get Simpsons in the parks perhaps.

648
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,320
So I don't know what the,

649
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,040
he wasn't talking about the legality of that

650
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,760
versus Universal, but it really,

651
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,680
that for whatever reason hit me weirder than

652
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,520
almost any other.

653
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,880
Well the way he was describing it felt craven.

654
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,640
Like we gotta get this in there

655
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,840
to start paying off this Fox purchase.

656
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,680
Well I think a lot of things you could argue were craven

657
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,440
when it comes from the management side.

658
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,080
Yeah, yeah.

659
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:22,920
They wanna make, yeah.

660
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,920
But I'm saying like even putting any Fox property

661
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,200
like Alien or something,

662
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,280
I'd be like oh that could fit here and there.

663
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,800
But the Simpsons in California Adventure,

664
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,080
I was like that's straight up weird, that's bizarre.

665
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:35,920
Yeah.

666
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,760
But it will happen,

667
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,080
and we'll also, we'll never not have the Simpsons,

668
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,440
like now that Disney owns them,

669
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,600
it'll, we'll be every,

670
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,840
we'll never not have a new Simpsons in our lifetime.

671
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,880
Oh yeah, if there was ever any chance of it disappearing.

672
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,720
That's what I'm saying, yes.

673
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,640
Yeah, we're heading to season 78.

674
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,480
Oh yeah, for sure.

675
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,520
Should I be the first century long series?

676
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,680
I think that's, I think that's right.

677
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,400
We'll outlive all of us.

678
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,800
Mm-hmm, 120 year old Al Jean is show running.

679
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,680
He's the only one that'll make it, yeah.

680
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,560
But we'll be like, we'll all be,

681
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,400
like one of the last things we see before we die

682
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,080
is we'll be really sad to watch the passing

683
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,680
of Bart number four.

684
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,520
Oh no.

685
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,240
I thought she was gonna make it.

686
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,080
Yeah.

687
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,040
We'll be like, yeah, we'll be 100.

688
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:28,120
We've seen 200 Lassie's, five Barts.

689
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,120
There's Disney on Iron Man's.

690
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,520
Does Disney own Lassie?

691
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,000
I think Lassie's still the one that's owned

692
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,880
by a weird like other company, like.

693
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,160
Yeah.

694
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,880
There's at least one person at Disney in charge

695
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,080
of like sneaking around, following whoever owns

696
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:49,000
the copyright and trying to like snipe a Mercyan item.

697
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,360
Where ever any property in the world

698
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,480
is at least one Disney person on it.

699
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,920
Right, there's an assassin that,

700
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:57,960
or like even just waiting for the person to die.

701
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,240
So there's an heir to the Lassie fortune

702
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,560
and they're like 80 and then there's one person

703
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,920
just stalking them and as soon as they go,

704
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,080
or maybe the play is to like make them fall in love

705
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,080
with them and put Lassie in the will

706
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,480
to be left to that person.

707
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,320
Yes, yeah.

708
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,480
And then they'll sell it to Disney.

709
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,360
There's a lot of Disney agent seductions going on.

710
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,040
Yeah, widows and yeah, whoever owns.

711
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,320
Harvey comics, someone's trying to seduce that person

712
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,400
right now and fall in love with them

713
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,760
so they can sign all the rights to hot stuff,

714
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,920
the little devil.

715
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,840
And just like off the, you know,

716
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,080
whoever owns the copyright of the book Great Expectations,

717
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,360
Disney is planted in the family,

718
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,120
pretending to charm the pants of.

719
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,520
Yeah, yeah, I guess it'd be Dickens, yeah.

720
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,320
I guess you could do Dickens all at once.

721
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,520
Whatever Schmuck wrote.

722
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,360
I have no idea.

723
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,520
It's an unpleasant, in all fairness,

724
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,800
it's an unpleasant book to read.

725
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,680
I always liked it as a kid.

726
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,200
I always thought it was fun, yeah.

727
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,040
I always thought it was such a downer.

728
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,880
It is.

729
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,320
Miss Aversham scared me.

730
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,880
I like, but she turns out to have more

731
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,920
of a heart of gold than you think.

732
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,760
I suppose.

733
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,520
This is why Disney's gotta get their hands on this story.

734
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,440
Yeah, we already have this fan debates.

735
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,280
People are gonna be talking about.

736
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,480
Dickens shared universe does seem like something

737
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,080
that will happen in our lifetime.

738
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,840
I'll be arguing on some movie internet show

739
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,840
about if Maleficent is better than Miss Havisham.

740
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,400
Both played by Angelina Jolie.

741
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,840
Like Havisham, like a movie called Havisham.

742
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,440
Oh, it's just called the last day.

743
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,120
Yeah, Havisham.

744
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,520
Angelina Jolie is Havisham.

745
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,760
The sequel's just called Pip, right?

746
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,600
Yeah, yeah.

747
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,440
That's the kid.

748
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,280
Yeah.

749
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,160
You'll be on movie fights 4.0,

750
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,600
arguing with a robot that's been implanted

751
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,200
with the soul of Nick Mundy.

752
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,040
He's like.

753
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,600
I'm worried it's actually mad at me

754
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,480
because I said that robot's ideas weren't as good.

755
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,240
Like, I know, Mundy robot's mad at me.

756
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,880
It's gonna fire lasers at you from its eyes.

757
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,520
So, Calico Ghost Rapids.

758
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,360
Calico Ghost.

759
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,640
Now, similar to our Deadwood discussion,

760
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,400
the Calico does pull some real life stuff.

761
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,680
Coulter and Potts and Coulter were

762
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,720
on the Lewis and Clark expedition.

763
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,560
What?

764
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,360
That's fun.

765
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,200
They are real life people,

766
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,000
and I think some of the other residents of the town

767
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,600
are inspired by or have the names of real life people.

768
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,520
Gotcha.

769
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,240
I think the deputy mayor we met

770
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,240
is more a commentary on schmoozing politicians.

771
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,440
He's very full of himself.

772
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,400
Very cuts off the mayor a lot and that sort of thing.

773
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,920
The thing in the opening presentation

774
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,600
is that he, in his introduction of the mayor,

775
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,600
ruined everything that the mayor was going to say.

776
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,480
He's like, given the cliff notes of what it's gonna be

777
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,760
and the mayor himself almost doesn't get to talk.

778
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,840
So, for all of you keeping track of character names,

779
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,080
deputy mayor, Milton C. Howell,

780
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,280
and the mayor is Horton Parnell.

781
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,000
But we met Milton C. Howell.

782
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,840
Right, and we have a photo of Jason

783
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:06,120
and a video of Milton C. Howell with you.

784
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,560
So, we wanted two mayor related people to get together.

785
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,400
Sure.

786
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,200
If you don't know, we've been waging a campaign,

787
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,040
quietly of course, now in the last so many months

788
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,240
for Jason to become mayor of Disneyland.

789
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,280
Doesn't have to happen right away,

790
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,240
but at least in the next 20 years.

791
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,760
But we were given, we asked him for a little bit of advice

792
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,080
about playing the political game

793
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,960
and I don't remember it now.

794
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,360
This was a while back.

795
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,200
Yeah, hey, we have the video.

796
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,280
Well, never spend your own money.

797
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,120
He's right there.

798
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:34,940
Is that what he said?

799
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,780
Yeah, he said never spend your own money.

800
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,360
Was he talking about making a movie?

801
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,520
Uh-huh.

802
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,600
No, he's like, always spend other people's money

803
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,840
to spend your own.

804
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,680
Dress nice.

805
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,080
Free Knotts event, eating their pies.

806
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,920
Yeah.

807
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,760
Yep, so you're off to a race.

808
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,480
Yeah, we were and I was on good behavior

809
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,920
with a rival mayor, but we were guests,

810
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,120
so you know, you have to have good manners.

811
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:54,960
Yeah, you gotta be cordial.

812
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,360
Especially in the old west.

813
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,640
I will say what Knotts is doing,

814
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,120
Knotts has had some problems, I think,

815
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,400
identity problems over the last probably decades.

816
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,760
Tony Baxter alluded to them when we interviewed him

817
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,080
because he said that one of his things

818
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,940
that he does with his friends for fun

819
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,660
is to think about how to fix Knotts.

820
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,660
Maybe the greatest moment of the whole interview.

821
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,620
Yeah, yeah, that's pretty cool.

822
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,060
Because they were like, oh yeah, this guy's hardcore.

823
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,860
They're just like, they don't work for Knotts.

824
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:26,860
They're just imagining how to do.

825
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:31,860
That's what theme park veterans' Slack channels are talking

826
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,180
about, it's probably not a literal race.

827
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,220
Oh, if those leaked, if only those leaked.

828
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,420
We gotta get on that.

829
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,580
Yeah.

830
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,340
But like, so yeah, so Knotts had,

831
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,060
Knotts was a quaint little ghost town and some rides

832
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,260
and then all of a sudden they just wanted

833
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,340
to catch up to Six Flags.

834
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:49,140
So most of the park, I guess, is all just big coasters

835
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,220
and kind of a jumbled.

836
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,060
That's like a very 90s 2000s.

837
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,740
I think it still has some of that charm.

838
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,860
We talked about the Berry Tales

839
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,940
and even Legends of the, or Kingdom of the Dinosaurs

840
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,100
is very original IP.

841
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,860
It still had some of that charm for a little bit.

842
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,300
But yeah, then you just, I mean,

843
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:09,620
it is an aesthetic mishmash at this point.

844
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,660
And you see it as you're approaching the park,

845
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,420
if you're driving up from the outside,

846
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,340
it's just a lot of like coasters

847
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,940
that don't really go together.

848
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:17,780
Right.

849
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:18,620
All rising up and out of it.

850
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,420
So yeah, I think they lost their way a little

851
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,020
in terms of what is this place.

852
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,540
Yeah, it reminds me of like, yeah,

853
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,340
driving up to a Six Flags.

854
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,980
It's not bad, I think that some of the coasters are fun.

855
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,940
No, and they made a big move.

856
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,180
They yanked a lot of coasters.

857
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,260
There are at least some of them.

858
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,500
A few, yeah, a few.

859
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,060
When they got bought by Cedar Fair,

860
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,460
they kind of, I think we're given a little more

861
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,860
of a budget to sort of go back to a more classic

862
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,020
Knott's experience.

863
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:44,940
Yeah, which I was just gonna,

864
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,100
I think I've praised them before,

865
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:49,380
but it does seem like everyone involved now knows

866
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,420
like what people like and what maybe stands

867
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,260
the test of time a little bit more.

868
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,940
So they're trying to build out the character

869
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:58,260
and the immersion for this ghost town.

870
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:01,160
And it's good, I mean, they are on a limited budget

871
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,860
versus Disney, but what they're doing seems like

872
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,580
they're trying to just expand the footprint

873
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,500
of this cool place that's immersive.

874
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,020
And it's just like anything you'd like at Disney

875
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,700
where it's like, you just like, I like being there.

876
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,100
That's really what you like.

877
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,540
The rides are great, but you wanna feel like,

878
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:19,380
I just wanna be here, which is I think Disneyland's trick,

879
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,860
which you don't even think about necessarily

880
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,740
because you think about rides,

881
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,860
but it's like, I just like sitting here.

882
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,380
I wanna sit here.

883
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,380
Yeah, yeah.

884
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:31,860
Which is, and look at Batuu under that lens

885
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,980
that I think we've all said,

886
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,780
that's like the main thing is being there.

887
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,220
And not like the ride's cool

888
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,660
and the individual things are cool,

889
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,740
but just, man, I just wanna walk around that place.

890
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,580
Yeah.

891
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:45,380
It's definitely, I mean, they don't have unlimited money

892
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,700
like Disney, and even with Cedar Fair backing,

893
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,280
there's still a budget to work within,

894
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:53,260
but everyone seems very passionate and very hungry.

895
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,100
Yeah.

896
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,380
And they hustle, and everyone was,

897
00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:00,320
it seemed like, it feels like a very family environment.

898
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,780
It felt almost like a theater,

899
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,140
like there's all these actors,

900
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,260
the families were all there, everyone,

901
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,180
people were eating in costume.

902
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:10,500
It felt like a theater company.

903
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,340
Yeah.

904
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,100
And I like that it's a little more chill than,

905
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,340
Disney would lose their minds

906
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,940
if someone sat down at the picnic table

907
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:21,740
with guests and ate a pork rib dinner like we were,

908
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,880
but there were cow,

909
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,580
we were sitting next to cowboys and stuff,

910
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:29,300
also eating while they were eating character and stuff.

911
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,180
That was fun.

912
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,020
Yeah, yeah.

913
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,620
Yeah, it was very fun.

914
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:35,180
So yeah, I think that it feels like what they'll do,

915
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,640
and I don't know this to be a fact,

916
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,880
but it feels like they'll just kinda keep taking money

917
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,040
and expanding out,

918
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,920
and maybe that's the best way you can fix knots,

919
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,840
is just sorta try to expand the lands here

920
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,040
and the narrative and the, I guess the story,

921
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,000
because it's all some interlocked story now

922
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,320
they're trying to tell, which is fun.

923
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,160
Yeah.

924
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,980
Yeah, well and these rides all now tie together.

925
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,720
I love that there's three of these.

926
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,540
Yeah.

927
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,680
The Timber Mountain Calico Mine

928
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:04,680
and Calico River Rapids are all existing attractions

929
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:09,440
with just a great overlay of animatronics

930
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,400
all made by, all three of them,

931
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,920
with animatronics by Garner Holt, this amazing studio,

932
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:18,200
that it doesn't feel like a thing,

933
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,520
an obvious thing for a theme park to do,

934
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,360
but you're putting in a new coaster, that makes sense,

935
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,520
charming up all of these rides with really

936
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:33,040
very 50s, 60s Disney feeling animatronics, I think,

937
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,160
with all of these, they like, I don't,

938
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,960
it's almost like as Disney gets more modern

939
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,560
and away from what they started as,

940
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:44,040
it's almost like Knots is trying to occupy

941
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,040
the mental real estate of early,

942
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,000
more limited charming Disneyland.

943
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,080
Yeah, they're at least succeeding in that regard.

944
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,400
Yeah, they're leaning into the quaintness of it

945
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,720
in a way too, where it's like, yeah,

946
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,360
if we can't compete with spectacle,

947
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,520
let's compete with charm and quaintness,

948
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,360
and warmth, I guess too.

949
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,880
And pulling from their own history,

950
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:09,800
because the actual Knots jam and berry,

951
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,480
the Preserve line is owned by Smuckers now,

952
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,800
the Knots you see in grocery stores are known by Smuckers,

953
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,760
but they have a marketplace line of jams and jellies

954
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,480
they sell at the park, because at some point,

955
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,400
they realize, oh, people are asking us

956
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,120
where they buy the jam, and we haven't sold jam in years

957
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,160
because Smuckers owns the rights,

958
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,880
so we should probably sell boysenberry products.

959
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,800
But also, crazy to me that they would take the time

960
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,880
to put a bunch of robots in the park,

961
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,560
that's a dream for us.

962
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,400
This Knots super loaded park is gonna put in

963
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,120
a ton of great robots every year, that's amazing.

964
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,320
Yeah, I'm impressed with-

965
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,840
Not every year, every other year.

966
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,720
I'm impressed with whoever is in charge of management

967
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,440
approving this, because it feels like they go,

968
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,880
well, the right is there,

969
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,000
is this really gonna be that much better?

970
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,720
So it does feel like a move I'm impressed

971
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,760
that somebody greenlit, because it's still expensive,

972
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,360
it's still probably, what, hundreds of thousands of dollars?

973
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:14,360
Yeah, and you end up having to refresh logos in everything.

974
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:19,400
And I think the loading area and the house

975
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,840
that you wander through on the way in,

976
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:25,080
and a ton of other stuff got redone,

977
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,960
and it feels like those, it's plus ups that are subtle,

978
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,080
but that are akin to what they did to California Adventure,

979
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,920
where now there's so much more charm to the place

980
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,480
than there used to be, it's not as obvious

981
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,800
as putting a big ride in, but I'm really glad they did it.

982
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,560
Yeah, I mean, it feels like they should've used the money

983
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,440
to make one of their roller coasters not kill your neck

984
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,480
when you go on it, but that's, I mean, what is that,

985
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,280
Mesa Manta Sumas revenge?

986
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,000
Or, I mean, I don't know, ghost rider,

987
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,040
I remember being a little rough when I did it,

988
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,640
maybe a lot of them.

989
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,240
There was that, whichever one shoots you up backwards

990
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:06,240
is the one where I went, oh my, oh my neck, it's horrible.

991
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:10,040
We rode a Pony Express, though, we rode a lot.

992
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,800
So the event, basically, real quick to sum up,

993
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,520
is we got there, and there was just a spread,

994
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,960
and we were just blown away, we're a bunch of rubes,

995
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:22,960
we were just like, wow, dinner, holy crap,

996
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,360
and there was beer, it was amazing, this is a press.

997
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,680
Beer and wine, baby.

998
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,520
Oh yeah.

999
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:33,520
And we were just about, or I think we did a genuine cheers,

1000
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,440
we all were like, let's toast,

1001
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,240
and then there was a guy with a camera who was like,

1002
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,680
hey guys, wanna do that one more time?

1003
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,400
And then they put us in the official video,

1004
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,800
we'll post this, but I was searching around on YouTube,

1005
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,840
and there was a video made of the press event,

1006
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:56,840
and there's a really, it's a very cheesy commercial toast

1007
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,640
between the three of us.

1008
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,480
Very funny.

1009
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,200
We didn't even have to be coached to do it.

1010
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,520
Yeah, we knew what they were after.

1011
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,040
Sure.

1012
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,040
Yeah, I mean, do you guys feel like,

1013
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,640
is it almost harder to do the podcast now,

1014
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,960
coming in with all the celebrity that we have?

1015
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,120
When we started this thing, we were nobodies,

1016
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,000
and now we're in an official Knott's internal use video.

1017
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,280
Yeah, it is, the fame has skyrocketed.

1018
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,400
Just shoveling tamales down my gullet.

1019
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,560
I can't, yeah, I've been different since the event,

1020
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,840
just in general.

1021
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,560
I've just been different to deal with, I think.

1022
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,560
I've been a different person.

1023
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,520
Which I think is just, it's kinda what the podcast

1024
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,960
is gonna be about from now on,

1025
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,800
it's just kinda like coping with, you know,

1026
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,320
where are we at now that we're not stars?

1027
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,120
Yeah, it'll be like an entourage kind of thing.

1028
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,320
That's the narrative entourage,

1029
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,440
like how does he cope with being this big of a star?

1030
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,760
Too many offers, I'm getting pulled every which way,

1031
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,000
too many girls, too many offers.

1032
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,480
I'm really into sneakers now for some reason.

1033
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,120
Like what happened?

1034
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,920
Like turtle, yeah, that's what a turtle's thing.

1035
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,080
Did you just make yourself turtle?

1036
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:01,920
Yeah.

1037
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,000
Yeah, that's sad, oh, that's sad that I had my option

1038
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,800
to pick which one I was, and I just went,

1039
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,040
oh, I got some turtle.

1040
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,560
You gravitated to turtle on your own.

1041
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,440
Yeah, there's four of them too.

1042
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,320
So we really, yeah, we could've left turtle behind.

1043
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,680
Sure.

1044
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,240
But I guess you don't wanna be Johnny Drama.

1045
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,200
Which one's Edwin?

1046
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,720
Hmm, he's E maybe.

1047
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,320
Oh, he makes all the money moves?

1048
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,800
Yeah, he's just lying right now on the floor,

1049
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,280
like a flat pancake.

1050
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,280
That one dog that Edwin likes up the street is Sloan.

1051
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,120
Oh, his girlfriend.

1052
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,640
His girlfriend, he's on it all again.

1053
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,480
Sure.

1054
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,760
On again, all again girlfriend.

1055
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,360
I think your leg is Sloan.

1056
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,640
Every time someone comes over, my leg is Sloan for Edwin.

1057
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,440
Oh, damn it, my leg's Sloan again.

1058
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,160
Edwin's girlfriend is my leg.

1059
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,480
Oh, that's cute.

1060
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,480
Anyway, I would go.

1061
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,040
All right, so yeah, great event,

1062
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,120
and as we said, big spread of pies.

1063
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,040
Big spread of pies.

1064
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,680
I made the same joke I make all the time

1065
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,720
when there's a big spread, I was like,

1066
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,840
Jason has a garbage bag, he's gonna just fill it up

1067
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,040
and take it to his car.

1068
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,760
I had gone back for seconds from the regular food,

1069
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,560
and every time we'd get off a ride,

1070
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:20,320
you would needle me, like, you gotta get that pie.

1071
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,640
And I did eat it, I did not feel terribly good after.

1072
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,440
We rode, I was starting to say we rode the Pony Express,

1073
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,680
which is a launch coaster that you sit on

1074
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,080
as if you were riding a speeding horse.

1075
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,400
There were two rides open, the Calico Ride

1076
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,400
and then Pony Express, and we rode both five times each.

1077
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,360
At least, yeah.

1078
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,320
Well, and at one of those events,

1079
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,960
you get to just live a 12-year-old's dream

1080
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,400
and say, hey, you guys staying on?

1081
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,720
Hell yeah, we are.

1082
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,560
One more time.

1083
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,840
We would change cars, for the Pony Express specifically,

1084
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,480
we would change positions.

1085
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,760
We tried it from the back, we tried it from the front.

1086
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,160
There were like, there's probably.

1087
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,680
We mounted it in many different positions.

1088
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,040
We mounted the ponies from different positions.

1089
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,800
It is an under, it clasps your leg in,

1090
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,800
and then the back comes up on you.

1091
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,000
One of my least favorite things

1092
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,640
is a dangling leg on a theme park ride,

1093
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:21,000
and I felt like my right leg was exposed.

1094
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,760
After I got off, I realized I had been tensing my right leg

1095
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,640
to try to hold it closer to the pony, to the fake pony.

1096
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,440
But we did it, we did a lot.

1097
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,160
There was only a couple people on it,

1098
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,040
and that ride has the capacity, I'm sure,

1099
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,560
for 40 people, something like that.

1100
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,400
And there were never more than six of us on it once,

1101
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,880
which made it even weirder and cooler.

1102
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,000
We got to do it in this bizarre position.

1103
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,280
I think we switched both ways,

1104
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,880
where it was you guys all the way in the front,

1105
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,840
and me all the way in the back.

1106
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,440
And I'll post a couple pictures of this,

1107
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,840
but it was really unsettling

1108
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:57,840
to be on an otherwise empty coaster vehicle,

1109
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,760
also having been shoved in by the back.

1110
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,360
Yes, that's also my favorite thing is that happened,

1111
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,800
is that we didn't know how it was gonna work,

1112
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,320
and you were a little late getting in there.

1113
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,920
I was a little bit more in position,

1114
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,640
and you sat down next to me,

1115
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,600
and I don't think you realized that this...

1116
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:19,600
This HR Geiger sort of device comes up and closes you.

1117
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,400
Yeah, traps you in,

1118
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,400
it basically traps you in a staple remover.

1119
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,560
Basically, yeah.

1120
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,600
And all of a sudden this thing comes up,

1121
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,440
and you're like, ah!

1122
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,400
It crushed you a little bit inside.

1123
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,240
It's a little bit of an unwanted touch.

1124
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,520
It's a pad on the back,

1125
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,520
it's a hug that lasts a little too long.

1126
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,080
And this ride goes over the Calico Rapids.

1127
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,640
It travels above it.

1128
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,400
You go through a shed above the Rapids ride at one point,

1129
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,560
which is cool that the rides tie together,

1130
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,160
and it has a nice energy.

1131
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,760
Yes, absolutely.

1132
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,720
Very interweaving and interactive.

1133
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:06,600
So yeah, we had unlimited food, we had...

1134
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,440
At some point we were just trying

1135
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,000
to make our audience jealous.

1136
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,960
I think that is what's happening.

1137
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,320
And then...

1138
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,160
We're just trying to be honest also.

1139
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,120
And then we got to be the stars of a video,

1140
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,520
and I had a lot of wine.

1141
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,520
We're just trying to tell our truths, our honest truths.

1142
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,640
And also, yeah, I'm just thrilled

1143
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,080
that Knott's finally acknowledged us.

1144
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:27,920
Sure.

1145
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,600
What else about the Rapids ride?

1146
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,440
Oh yeah, lots of road rides.

1147
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,280
So we haven't really talked about the ride.

1148
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,160
You know what's good about it?

1149
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,520
It doesn't soak you.

1150
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,880
If you're thinking about going to Knott's

1151
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,720
and going on this ride,

1152
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,400
you have that hard block of like,

1153
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,400
I don't want to get on something like that Popeye's ride

1154
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,160
where you end up drenched.

1155
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,680
You probably won't end up drenched on this thing,

1156
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,520
which is nice for Rapids ride to not just

1157
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,920
the recce water-wise.

1158
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,760
And I just went on the Grizzly River Rapids

1159
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,840
a couple days ago.

1160
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,040
I haven't been on it in a couple years.

1161
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,560
And the robots make a difference.

1162
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,800
They really do.

1163
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,400
Because there are no robots on Grizzly River Rapids,

1164
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,520
and there are bear noises in the caves on that ride.

1165
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,640
This is the ride at California Adventure.

1166
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,880
There are bear noises trying to make you feel like

1167
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,200
there are bears in this part,

1168
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,680
but there are no robots.

1169
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,280
There are no robot bears.

1170
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,320
Give me some Grizzly swiping at me.

1171
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,200
Yeah.

1172
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,040
Let's have that.

1173
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:24,880
So yeah.

1174
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,360
Do you think this makes it a better ride now

1175
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:30,080
than Grizzly Rapids at California Adventure?

1176
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,720
I would say that it does.

1177
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,560
I think it might.

1178
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,400
I think it does.

1179
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,200
Certainly there's a fun drop or two

1180
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,080
that doesn't exist on this Calico ride,

1181
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:43,000
but drops versus robots.

1182
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,640
I guess it all depends on your preference,

1183
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,080
and I'll probably take robots.

1184
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,200
90% robot animals.

1185
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,800
There's a bear, there's a mountain lion.

1186
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,160
Very interesting fiberglass animatronics,

1187
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,080
presumably so that they can withstand

1188
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,720
getting wet over and over.

1189
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:01,440
There's one unhinged human animatronic.

1190
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,720
And there's little gags.

1191
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,560
That's what's good.

1192
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,400
Gags, yeah.

1193
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,080
There's little gags.

1194
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,680
Yeah, there's a man with a musket that's shooting,

1195
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,040
which is fantastic.

1196
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,800
Which also I was like, that wasn't here before, right?

1197
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,920
Because it feels like, oh, that was a holdover

1198
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,000
where a man with a musket shoots at you.

1199
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,640
But no, that's new, that's great.

1200
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,480
Yeah.

1201
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,520
And then it culminates in a Bigfoot,

1202
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,360
which is neat, but it's,

1203
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,800
I don't think it's meant to be just stared at for a while.

1204
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,640
And you don't get to.

1205
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,120
This chaos is missed, you're swirling around.

1206
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:40,120
But I think it is a tough area to portray a Bigfoot

1207
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,280
in something when you've got the Expedition Everest Yeti

1208
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:47,440
and you've got the Matterhorn, a Bonobo snowman.

1209
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,760
Yeah, I think in the promo art,

1210
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,960
he looks massive like the Yeti.

1211
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:53,800
Yeah.

1212
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:54,640
And then I think we went by it.

1213
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,840
And he's like, yeah, he looks great in the promo.

1214
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,320
Yeah, that's not really what they did.

1215
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,720
Yeah, that's not accurate.

1216
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,400
It's cool, it's just, it's like,

1217
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,320
he's probably my height.

1218
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,160
Yeah.

1219
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,200
He's probably 6'3".

1220
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,520
We wrote it so many times, once or twice,

1221
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,000
they started doing the please stay in the car

1222
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,680
while we unload spiel, right as we hit the Bigfoot.

1223
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,600
That didn't happen most times.

1224
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,760
It seemed like they were still trying to figure it out.

1225
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,600
Yeah, right, right, right.

1226
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,360
But then other times, the fog went off

1227
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,160
and the Bigfoot screened, and we had lights,

1228
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,000
and it was great.

1229
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,920
At night, especially, because we wrote it in the day,

1230
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,160
we wrote it at night.

1231
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,560
It sounds like we were there for 12 hours.

1232
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,240
We were just there at dusk.

1233
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,060
We were there at sunset, yeah.

1234
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:37,920
Yeah, so in the dark, yeah, I think it looked cooler.

1235
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:38,960
But it is a good animatronic.

1236
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,000
I think I was just expecting a massive,

1237
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,440
I don't know why I was thinking there was gonna be

1238
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,720
a three story Bigfoot.

1239
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,360
The concept art, I guess, yeah.

1240
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,320
They implied something a little crazier.

1241
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,760
But if, I don't know, yeah, if you just wanna go on,

1242
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:56,920
and like, a quaint's a good way to put it,

1243
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,480
just a very charming ride that I think now

1244
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,800
that it has more character and more of a story

1245
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,040
in Grizzly River Rapids.

1246
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,880
And boy, would that be a good one, too,

1247
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,440
for Disney to add something to.

1248
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,640
If there's ever the right property to do an overlay,

1249
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,600
and really turn that into something, that'd be great.

1250
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,800
Well, obviously the answer, and many people have said,

1251
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,960
and it's not my idea, is put some goddamn

1252
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,360
country bears on it, for God's sake.

1253
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,880
Because those California ones have gotta be somewhere.

1254
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:26,000
Well, yeah, but they have a different skin now, probably.

1255
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:30,040
I think, as we said when the Trump was built,

1256
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,160
it's like Big Al from.

1257
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,400
They turned him into, yeah.

1258
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,040
He turned Big Al into Trump.

1259
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,760
Big Al and Oogie Boogie.

1260
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,600
Yeah, right.

1261
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,080
That's where they went on each ghost.

1262
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:42,440
So yeah, put some new country bear animatronics on this.

1263
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,200
The Simpsons, whatever.

1264
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,640
That's what it'll be, they'll just jam the Simpsons

1265
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,560
in one of the camping episode.

1266
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,760
Oh, the Camp Crusty episode.

1267
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,800
Episode six of the seven million.

1268
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,080
Sure, I mean, fine, I guess.

1269
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:00,600
So I also wanna say they have a fun thing where you can,

1270
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,240
what do you call the dynamite box

1271
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,320
when you push the lever down?

1272
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,800
They have that, you know, where you could shoot water

1273
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,640
at people, basically.

1274
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:08,680
It's a calicometer.

1275
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,440
A calicometer.

1276
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,280
You know, the old.

1277
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,120
A detonator.

1278
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,280
I guess it's a detonator, yeah.

1279
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:17,440
It's like Wiley Coyote would lay the dynamite

1280
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,080
and then the trail of gunpowder.

1281
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,800
And then, so you can.

1282
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,040
That concept art, very accurate.

1283
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:23,880
Yeah. Sure.

1284
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,960
Outside of the right. That is where it is, yes.

1285
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,600
So yeah, outside of the ride, you can do that

1286
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,280
and you push it down and it shoots water.

1287
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,640
And that's very fun.

1288
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:33,640
Very fun to do that.

1289
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,160
So I like that a lot.

1290
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,080
Yeah. Hey, good job, Knott.

1291
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:39,640
They had to, you know, the odds are stacked against them.

1292
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:42,800
They know people are, they're not gonna steal anyone away

1293
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,480
from Galaxy's Edge.

1294
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,360
All they can do is hope that while people are

1295
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:49,600
in the theme park resort vicinity,

1296
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,160
that maybe they head up the road,

1297
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,160
they take a little break from Disney.

1298
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,960
And I hope people have.

1299
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,520
And I hope people, I tell everybody go to Knott.

1300
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,920
If there's like some, you got a random Saturday or Sunday,

1301
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:03,000
burn a hole in your pocket, wanna have a fun day.

1302
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,600
No, it's a great place to go.

1303
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:05,880
Yeah. Yeah.

1304
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:06,720
Do it.

1305
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:07,560
Well, is that it?

1306
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:10,280
Do we have any other facts about the Kelico?

1307
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,880
Talk about some other critters?

1308
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,960
No, I think that, I think we about covered everything.

1309
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,160
Then yeehaw, off we go.

1310
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,000
Off we go.

1311
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:19,960
And hey, howdy hey.

1312
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,080
Let's see.

1313
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:23,400
Another Wild West friend.

1314
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,480
It's Jesse from Toy Story.

1315
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:28,080
Jesse the cowboy has our own carousel.

1316
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:28,920
Let's see the cowboy.

1317
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,280
Jesse the cowboy?

1318
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,640
Jesse the cowgirl.

1319
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,440
Jesse the cow person.

1320
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,280
Yeah, what is that?

1321
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,120
Jesse the rustler, what's that?

1322
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:38,160
The cow person, thank you.

1323
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,000
Lindsay's monitoring.

1324
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:39,840
Thank you, Lindsay.

1325
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:42,120
Cow person just rolls off the tongue.

1326
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,960
Cow gender is a construct.

1327
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,680
So, right, Jesse's critter carousel.

1328
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:51,840
Yeah, this is a reskin of a,

1329
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:55,000
this used to be a King Triton carousel.

1330
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,200
This is an opening day attraction at California Adventure.

1331
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,560
And it's, you know, it's a ride.

1332
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,640
It was there as a people eater.

1333
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,200
People were questioning at the time.

1334
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,760
So just, there's also a carousel in this park.

1335
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,360
There's a Disneyland one and then there's this one,

1336
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,800
which by where they put it,

1337
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,320
I saw this observation in this complaint

1338
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:19,680
that the King Arthur carousel,

1339
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,520
you spin around and you see,

1340
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:24,120
it's a big swirl of everything that there is to see

1341
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,360
in Fantasyland.

1342
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,960
And then this one, you see,

1343
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,640
half for half of it you see the lagoon

1344
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,640
and for the other half you see a wall.

1345
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:34,520
A concrete wall that is designed to basically be

1346
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:37,680
like the barrier between Incredicoaster area.

1347
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:38,520
And the bathrooms.

1348
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:41,960
And the, yeah, well then, yeah, the bathrooms as well.

1349
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,560
Yes, that's fair.

1350
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,560
Because right now what's,

1351
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,440
they're doing a meet and greet for the Incredibles

1352
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,800
behind that wall.

1353
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:51,640
So I guess they were figuring.

1354
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,560
And they made the wall look cool too

1355
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,960
with the Incredibles logo.

1356
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,040
Yes, the wall does look cool on the Incredicoaster side.

1357
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:58,880
Cool wall.

1358
00:48:58,880 --> 00:48:59,720
Cool wall.

1359
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,440
But the other wall didn't look cool.

1360
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,960
So they had to do something with it.

1361
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,920
So now they've dressed it up and there's kind of a,

1362
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,080
there's a saloon and some art.

1363
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,360
And they, I don't know, they,

1364
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:14,200
besides the characters on the carousel being different,

1365
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,680
I think they did a little bit more thematic work

1366
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:21,200
and it plays in the kind of 2D vibe

1367
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,720
of the original Woody's roundup show

1368
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,160
that you find out about in Toy Story 2.

1369
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,360
Right.

1370
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:31,640
Which this all made, I don't know,

1371
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,400
this was one of the rides they announced

1372
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,800
was going into Pixar period where I felt like,

1373
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,400
why does this need to happen?

1374
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,240
Yeah.

1375
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:41,800
But now that it's open, it's pretty nice and charming.

1376
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:42,640
And it ties things together.

1377
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,800
I think they had a carousel already.

1378
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:45,640
Yeah.

1379
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:48,240
But it wasn't a Pixar property.

1380
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,400
So I guess they, if it was truly Pixar Pier,

1381
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,320
the Little Mermaid wouldn't make sense.

1382
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,160
Yeah.

1383
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,920
So I guess I admire them for being consistent

1384
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:57,840
with the properties.

1385
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:59,320
So it would have to be this.

1386
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,140
Yeah.

1387
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:03,040
And I think they kind of committed to the,

1388
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,480
they used the 2D character, the 2D critters

1389
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,120
that you see in the Woody's roundup show.

1390
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,520
Which are the, I hadn't put it together

1391
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:15,640
that a lot of them are the prizes in Midway Mania.

1392
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:16,480
So that all ties together too.

1393
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,880
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1394
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:18,720
Yeah.

1395
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:19,720
That's great.

1396
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,680
And it all started to feel more essential to me

1397
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,680
when I realized and I saw this name checked

1398
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:27,080
in an official Disney video

1399
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:30,280
that it's all the artwork of Bud Lucky.

1400
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,920
Do you guys know about Bud Lucky?

1401
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,240
A little bit.

1402
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,840
There's a, I mainly know about him

1403
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,760
from this really good special feature

1404
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,800
on the Incredibles DVD

1405
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,320
that he was a guy, he's this long time animator,

1406
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:48,120
a Korean war veteran who went on to be an artist

1407
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:51,560
for commercials for Tony the Tiger and all this stuff

1408
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:53,960
and then did a lot of shorts for Sesame Street

1409
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:58,960
where he did the music and sang it and did all the artwork.

1410
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:00,480
Wow.

1411
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,240
What's the Alligator King was the thing on Sesame Street

1412
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:05,840
among others.

1413
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:09,640
But then was hired at Pixar really early on.

1414
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:13,920
Like in the ramp up to Toy Story.

1415
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:18,280
This guy is credited with Woody being a cowboy.

1416
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,120
Wow, I guess I didn't know any of this.

1417
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:21,240
But he's sort of a folksy dude.

1418
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:25,000
And if, just to give people the context for him,

1419
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,520
yeah, not only was he a behind the scenes person for Pixar,

1420
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:32,800
he's also the voice of Chuckles the Clown in Toy Story 3.

1421
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,400
He's got this gravelly, memorable kind of folksy voice.

1422
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,240
Right, yes, yes, yes.

1423
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:40,680
He became Eeyore in Winnie the Pooh from 2011.

1424
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,280
And he's Rick Dicker,

1425
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,640
the head of the superhero relocation program

1426
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:46,640
in The Incredibles.

1427
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,480
Oh yeah.

1428
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:50,160
Yeah, he had passed away by the time they did two.

1429
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,400
The movie's dedicated to him

1430
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,600
and he's replaced by Jonathan Banks,

1431
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:57,040
which is saying something for this guy's vocal performance

1432
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,440
that they had to hire this actor

1433
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,800
with this incredible voice to fill in.

1434
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,320
The gruffest character actor.

1435
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:07,080
So yeah, this guy's super cool.

1436
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:08,520
Oh, the thing about him making,

1437
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:13,520
so like early days of concept art for all these movies,

1438
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,080
you know, like in all the options on the table

1439
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,840
that they're trying a thousand things,

1440
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,080
they knew that it was gonna be

1441
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:20,840
about Buzz Lightyear, a spaceman.

1442
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,360
And he was the one who said,

1443
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:23,200
well, just, I don't know,

1444
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:27,120
makes sense that a cowboy would be a good foil for him

1445
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:29,200
because an original plan was for Woody

1446
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:32,680
to be a sarcastic ventriloquist dummy.

1447
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:33,720
Oh my God.

1448
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:34,560
Yeah.

1449
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:35,400
I don't like that at all.

1450
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,920
And if you've seen Toy Story 4,

1451
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,840
there are some very unsettling dummies around,

1452
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:43,880
which I did not realize until now is in a way a nod

1453
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:48,120
to the unpleasant original way that Woody could have been.

1454
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:48,960
Wow.

1455
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,880
Yeah, there's early animatics with Woody and Buzz

1456
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:54,160
and Woody is kind of a prick.

1457
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,200
Yes, well that's the whole story of it

1458
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:59,120
is that it was like unwatchably caustic

1459
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:01,080
for a long time until,

1460
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:05,400
I wonder at what point did Tom Hanks join?

1461
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,160
Did they try story reels with temp voices

1462
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,040
and then realize we have to soften this up

1463
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,880
and get the most likable person in the world

1464
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,720
to play this character or was he already?

1465
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:18,200
Yeah, I don't know how that,

1466
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,400
what Lindsey is now answering.

1467
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,240
Lindsey knows.

1468
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:25,440
There had been Tom Hanks being a dick, I see.

1469
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,360
So that was a revision midway through.

1470
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:31,320
Which is like Tom Hanks playing a dick can be great.

1471
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:32,160
Sure.

1472
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,200
Like he's really fun as a villain

1473
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,080
or even just like kind of a bunch,

1474
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,680
like in a league of their own,

1475
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:41,160
he's kind of curmudgeonly and salty.

1476
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,280
Yeah, yeah, but wouldn't have worked for this.

1477
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,560
They needed the charm.

1478
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:48,480
So the first ever iteration of Woody being cowboy

1479
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,000
was from Bud Lucky and then he really got to go to town

1480
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,320
on Toy Story 2 and design all of these critters.

1481
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,120
I reminded myself of,

1482
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,960
the Woody's roundup sequence at Toy Story 2

1483
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:58,360
was so much fun.

1484
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,240
The black and white puppet feel

1485
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,640
and especially the critters are great.

1486
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,840
These little simple two dimensional cutouts

1487
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:08,120
that just kind of flap around

1488
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,680
and make minimal critter sounds.

1489
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:14,000
So I started liking this ride more

1490
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,080
and it felt more essential to me,

1491
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:17,520
realizing, oh they're pulling you into the world

1492
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,440
of this really charming designer, Bud Lucky.

1493
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:23,800
Yeah, and even just like their design nods

1494
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:28,840
to like the 50s, 60s kind of toys and that sort of thing.

1495
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:31,840
They use the songs from the Woody's roundup show

1496
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:35,000
and then there's a new song, Jesse Saves the Day.

1497
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,360
There's six songs total.

1498
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,920
Like there's- Oh wow, is that many?

1499
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:41,840
Yeah, Woody's roundup theme, Jesse the Odolin Cowboy,

1500
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:45,480
Prospector Pete, The Ballad of Bullseye, Hey Howdy Hey,

1501
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,360
and then the new song, Jesse Saves the Day.

1502
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,200
I gotcha.

1503
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,720
I love that old Prospector song.

1504
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:51,560
That is great.

1505
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,040
Is that Kelsey Grammer?

1506
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,480
Is he the old Prospector in that?

1507
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:56,320
Yeah.

1508
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:59,200
The recently Me Too character.

1509
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,640
Yes. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1510
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:04,040
They cut the- This bizarre story.

1511
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,840
When they do the fake outtakes,

1512
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:07,520
there's a scene where the old Prospector

1513
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,840
is essentially offering like two Barbies.

1514
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,480
Yeah, there's a Kingston couch joke.

1515
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:13,040
To be in Toy Story 3, he knows-

1516
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:17,120
They're in his sort of narrow confines box.

1517
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,840
That's, I guess, will not be going forward

1518
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:23,520
on any of the Blu-ray or DVD releases.

1519
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,040
Do you think that they put that information out there

1520
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,680
to sort of like win progressive points,

1521
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,520
or was Disney trying to like slide that out

1522
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,080
without anybody saying anything,

1523
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:32,400
and then somebody noticed?

1524
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,400
That's a good question.

1525
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:36,680
Is it good for them at the end of the day or bad?

1526
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:39,040
I bet Disney put that out.

1527
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,880
I'm very, I'm always suspicious

1528
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,160
that they're always controlling,

1529
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,000
trying to control the narrative.

1530
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,480
So I feel like they put that up, but I don't know.

1531
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,400
How did someone just discover that?

1532
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,960
Because there wasn't like a new Blu-ray release

1533
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:51,800
of Toy Story 2.

1534
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:52,920
I think it's the stream,

1535
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:56,640
I think it's a lot easier to swap in and out masters

1536
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,320
on streaming sites and downloads.

1537
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,240
Oh, I see what you're saying.

1538
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:03,280
So maybe wherever that's streaming right now, it's gone.

1539
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,480
Someone noticed.

1540
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:05,760
I'd like to meet the person if that,

1541
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:06,920
if truly it wasn't Disney,

1542
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:08,200
and they just try to quietly do it,

1543
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,280
I'd like to meet the person that was watching it and went,

1544
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:14,400
hey, my favorite of the fake outtakes is gone.

1545
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,560
I mean, if I was a film archivist,

1546
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:18,760
I would be losing my mind after the last few months

1547
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:23,760
with like the Dumbo, Dumbo excising stuff for Disney Plus.

1548
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:25,720
Oh.

1549
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:26,960
Like, cause it's just like, oh wait,

1550
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:29,800
well then you have to go find a master cop

1551
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,960
just to preserve it, you know, just to have.

1552
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:34,040
If you were like a crazy archivist,

1553
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:34,880
you'd be like driven crazy by this?

1554
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,120
I mean like actual professional film archivists

1555
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:41,240
who are like trying to preserve history.

1556
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:42,960
Well, I mean, it exists somewhere.

1557
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,360
I don't think general consumers necessarily

1558
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:50,360
have the capacity to put stuff in the context of their times.

1559
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:51,880
Sure.

1560
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:54,240
That's why I understand why they're not like, you know,

1561
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,840
Disney Plus featuring Song of the South.

1562
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:58,680
Yeah, no, I think that's probably a bad idea.

1563
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,640
But I think for like academic archivists,

1564
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,920
I'm sure they're just like, oh God, we gotta make sure.

1565
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:05,520
Someone somewhere should have a copy.

1566
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,680
Doesn't mean it, no, this all needs to go.

1567
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:08,520
Yeah.

1568
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:11,120
They don't owe it being on their streaming thing.

1569
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:11,960
Right.

1570
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:14,800
I have Blu-ray of Toy Story 2 from seven years ago.

1571
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:19,800
So I will be the archivist for this casting couch couch joke.

1572
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,800
This must be belongs in a museum.

1573
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,160
Christopher Lloyd sang an Indiana Jones line.

1574
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:27,000
I don't know why.

1575
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:29,560
You know, let me hear.

1576
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:33,840
I'll tie it back to several things you were talking about

1577
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:36,880
by saying that the the Woody's Roundup theme

1578
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,760
and maybe some of these other tracks, I'm not sure,

1579
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:41,360
were done by a band called Riders in the Sky.

1580
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:45,200
They were sort of a little like a little forksy, forksy.

1581
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,280
Well, you just got forky on the line.

1582
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:49,720
Your new favorite character.

1583
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:50,720
I always got forky on the line.

1584
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:57,120
Riders in the Sky, a little folksy quartet

1585
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:01,520
that did sort of traditional Gene Autry-esque music.

1586
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,960
They did the Woody's Roundup song.

1587
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,480
Disney was so happy with that.

1588
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,080
They said, would you make an entire album like this?

1589
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:09,520
That album went on to win the best children's album

1590
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:12,400
at the Grammys that year.

1591
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:16,480
And this seems like a family-friendly group

1592
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:17,480
that tours the world.

1593
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:19,440
People seem very fond of them.

1594
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:23,960
And on June 25th, 2019, the New York Times Magazine

1595
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,120
listed Riders in the Sky among the hundreds of artists

1596
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:30,120
whose material was destroyed in the 2008 Universal Fire.

1597
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:30,960
No!

1598
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:31,800
Jeez.

1599
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:32,880
No!

1600
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,400
They're just a charming bunch of guys.

1601
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,720
They made the nice Woody song

1602
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,720
and they can never have their masters again.

1603
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:38,760
Oh man.

1604
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:39,880
What a turn.

1605
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:40,720
I know.

1606
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:41,560
Them?

1607
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,040
Riders in the Sky also?

1608
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:43,960
Riders in the Sky.

1609
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:46,720
Is there any acts that was not safe?

1610
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:48,920
I gotta check.

1611
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:52,040
Yeah, I was not a recording artist at the time,

1612
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:54,160
but I still feel like I lost something there.

1613
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,960
I feel like maybe there was something I recorded

1614
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:58,240
in high school that was stored there.

1615
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,240
I don't know what it would be.

1616
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:02,280
My family put, or my baby photo is in there?

1617
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:03,120
Why?

1618
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,680
Maybe it was my high school band, Second Level.

1619
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,360
Maybe my archives.

1620
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:08,440
Second Level?

1621
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:09,920
I joined it later.

1622
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,880
I didn't name the band, but maybe.

1623
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:14,200
You joined it after the,

1624
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,240
it became Second Level when you joined.

1625
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,680
It was first level before that.

1626
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,000
Well, that's what I like to think of it.

1627
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:19,840
Yeah.

1628
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:20,680
Yeah, yeah.

1629
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:22,600
Your version of the Simpsons theme song

1630
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,360
was a lot more polished.

1631
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:27,200
Yeah, well, we was a punk cover of the Simpsons, probably.

1632
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1633
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,880
I was trying to sing offspring songs.

1634
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,760
Is that what Second Level was?

1635
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:36,360
Second Level was a lot of things.

1636
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:38,280
We had a lot of different types of music.

1637
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:40,840
You have a long continuity and backstory,

1638
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:44,280
like Wu Tang and Kohit and Cambria and all that?

1639
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:47,240
Yeah, there were covers, there were originals.

1640
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:48,920
It was all-

1641
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:50,920
What are those, you gotta say a cover.

1642
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,160
Well, a cover or an original?

1643
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,000
What was it?

1644
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,480
Well, I wouldn't know what the originals are,

1645
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:55,960
but what's a cover?

1646
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:59,440
A cover would be like, I'm trying to think of,

1647
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:02,000
we would do Everlong, of course, by the Foo Fighters.

1648
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,160
Smooth?

1649
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:04,080
Smooth, no, no, no.

1650
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:06,240
We were much harder than that.

1651
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:07,680
We were a tougher band.

1652
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:09,320
Tougher bunch of high schoolers.

1653
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:15,400
Gone Away by Offspring, one of their intense songs,

1654
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:17,960
not like Pretty Fly for a White Guy.

1655
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:18,800
I'm trying to think what else, maybe-

1656
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:20,760
Crazy taxi theme?

1657
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:23,000
No, not, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1658
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Taxilef, right?

1659
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:24,840
Okay.

1660
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:26,240
In Beverly Hills Cup.

1661
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:31,240
We would do a punk cover of All That She Wants

1662
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,320
by Ace of Base.

1663
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:34,520
Nice, nice.

1664
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:35,560
That's pretty good.

1665
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:36,400
That was pretty good.

1666
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:38,560
I mean, that's a good idea, conceptually.

1667
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:39,680
Yeah. Yeah.

1668
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:40,720
That was fun.

1669
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,440
I'm trying to think of what else.

1670
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:47,440
All I'll say is that an original was called Rock the House,

1671
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:50,920
and it was very Red Hot Chili Peppers influenced.

1672
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,560
So that exists.

1673
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:55,560
I'm teasing the audience with that now.

1674
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:58,880
Do you have copies?

1675
01:00:58,880 --> 01:00:59,720
Of course.

1676
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:00,560
You have recordings?

1677
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:01,400
Okay.

1678
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:04,240
We did that song at the High School Talent Show.

1679
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:05,080
Wow.

1680
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:10,080
So that is a video of me singing slash rapping Rock the House.

1681
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,120
Whoa.

1682
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:13,960
Yeah.

1683
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:14,800
Wow.

1684
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:15,640
Rap rock.

1685
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:16,460
Yeah.

1686
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:18,240
But I am gonna go out on a limb and say there is 0% chance

1687
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,680
that you were doing it wearing only a sock.

1688
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:21,640
That is true.

1689
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:24,120
I am not naked as only an attribute

1690
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:25,800
to the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

1691
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:29,200
I am not nude with a sock on at the High School Talent Show.

1692
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,480
You remember any lyrics of Rock the House?

1693
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:32,760
I probably remember all of them.

1694
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:33,920
Let me think.

1695
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:35,080
Maybe not all of them.

1696
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:38,040
If Rock the House rhymes with Mickey Mouse.

1697
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:41,320
I think that it truly there were no,

1698
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:43,160
I think it didn't make any sense.

1699
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:44,920
I think the song made no sense,

1700
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:47,240
it was just a collection of words.

1701
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:48,280
Sure.

1702
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,280
Chili Peppers ask?

1703
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,480
Very Chili Peppers ask.

1704
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:54,080
That was a big influence on us obviously.

1705
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:56,160
I think it was, that's when we rocked the house,

1706
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:57,980
oh wait, we never got out.

1707
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,760
That's the sort of manic energy that the critters

1708
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:04,200
on Jesse's Critter Carousel have

1709
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,040
because they all got big crazy eyes

1710
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:08,280
because they've all got heat madness.

1711
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:10,880
A detail from one of the Imagineers who worked on it.

1712
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:11,720
What, really?

1713
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:13,440
Yeah, the wacky critters.

1714
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:14,560
Good transition.

1715
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:17,320
The wacky critters have a maniacal look

1716
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:20,040
in their bulging eyes as if they've been out

1717
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:23,240
in the desert heat too long from the Orange County Register.

1718
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,080
Interesting.

1719
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:26,640
Wait, they never got out.

1720
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:28,160
They never got out of the desert

1721
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,960
even though Jesse came to help.

1722
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:33,000
I think that if we do an episode

1723
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,560
where it's my performance of Rock the House

1724
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:39,040
and it's your performance as a Nazi

1725
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:41,720
and when you were 12 in a play,

1726
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:44,840
all on Patreon will be the most successful Patreon

1727
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,440
that month of all time.

1728
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:51,840
If there's a video of me reciting the midnight ride

1729
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:56,840
of Paul Revere at my fifth grade graduation ceremony.

1730
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,800
It seems like you know there is.

1731
01:02:58,840 --> 01:02:59,640
I don't.

1732
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:02,520
I swear I'm not withholding information.

1733
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:05,520
I know that I did it and I recently found

1734
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,920
a copy of the script that I had highlighted.

1735
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:08,760
Oh wow.

1736
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:12,680
I think I may have requested to have more of it added.

1737
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:16,800
I wanted to do the second stanza of Paul Revere's ride

1738
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,840
and really show off.

1739
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:20,960
Again, little Scott, a little wiener.

1740
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:25,040
Patreon coming soon of humiliating video.

1741
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,040
Eventually.

1742
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:27,880
Yeah.

1743
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:28,700
Eventually.

1744
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:32,020
So what else?

1745
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:35,580
Do you guys remember what you've written on there?

1746
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:37,220
What animals?

1747
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:38,860
Mike took a picture of me.

1748
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:40,180
There's a picture of it somewhere.

1749
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:41,020
I don't know where it is.

1750
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:41,980
It's on my phone somewhere.

1751
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:44,660
The backwards skunk is apparently a big hit.

1752
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:47,460
Yeah, Aaron just, we went on again the other day

1753
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:48,860
and Aaron did the backwards skunk.

1754
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:50,020
That's a delight.

1755
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:50,940
Yeah, that's fun.

1756
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:53,740
Yeah, where the tail is really big and high

1757
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:56,620
as a more normal carousel animal's head would be

1758
01:03:56,620 --> 01:03:58,460
but it's in reverse.

1759
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:02,140
I like this detail too.

1760
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:04,180
There was an, as they were building it,

1761
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:07,220
there was an Al's Toy Barn pre-order sticker.

1762
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:08,060
Oh yeah, that's fun.

1763
01:04:08,060 --> 01:04:10,220
I thought that was a nice attention to detail.

1764
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:11,180
I like that.

1765
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:13,960
I'm looking through my phone and oh, here it is.

1766
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:14,800
I found it.

1767
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:18,220
But the first picture is you wearing a Knott's Berry Farm

1768
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:21,660
poncho holding some pie.

1769
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:23,500
Nice.

1770
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:24,340
But here it is.

1771
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:28,260
I honestly, it doesn't, I've cropped out what I was writing.

1772
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:30,540
You're writing the snake.

1773
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:32,060
Jason's writing the blue snake.

1774
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:32,900
Oh yeah, and Scott's on the bench?

1775
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:34,460
I wrote the blue snake last time.

1776
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:35,900
Oh, and I was on a bench last time?

1777
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:36,740
Or you were on a.

1778
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:37,860
No, no, you were on a thing.

1779
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:39,220
I can't, but you're blocked out too.

1780
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:40,060
I can't see what you're writing on.

1781
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:40,880
I wasn't scared.

1782
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:43,300
I got up on one of the high, high animals.

1783
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:44,300
I'm very brave.

1784
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:47,660
But the benches are like owls

1785
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:49,240
who live in a downed tree trunk.

1786
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:50,420
Even the benches are fun.

1787
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:51,980
Yeah, yeah.

1788
01:04:51,980 --> 01:04:53,340
They've all got personality.

1789
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:54,900
It's definitely beyond that it's like

1790
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:56,300
cartoony looking animals.

1791
01:04:57,180 --> 01:04:59,660
I like that crazy, that crazed backstory.

1792
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:00,700
That's a lot of fun.

1793
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:02,820
The backdrop, the desert, you can see

1794
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:05,180
as you go around the circle, you see the story

1795
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:07,860
of Jesse going out to help out a miner

1796
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:09,840
who was trapped in a cave, which I believe

1797
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:11,780
is the old prospector who turns out

1798
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:13,780
to be a villain at the end.

1799
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:16,980
But not within, I mean that model of the prospector,

1800
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:20,140
not in the plot of Woody's round up the show.

1801
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:23,220
He's like a hapless, always his butt

1802
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:25,780
getting caught on fire and stuff.

1803
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:28,940
The character fictionally deserves to be rescued.

1804
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:31,340
He's not a Machiavellian schemer.

1805
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:32,180
No.

1806
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:37,180
Could you imagine if Lotso and the prospector teamed up?

1807
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:39,300
Toy Story 5?

1808
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:41,460
Toy Story 5, they all survived.

1809
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:42,980
None of them died I don't think.

1810
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:43,820
No.

1811
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:46,440
One of them ended up on the grill.

1812
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:49,300
Lotso is on a grill.

1813
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:52,300
What I like about this too, at first I was like

1814
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:54,020
well why isn't it just all, why aren't we

1815
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:56,180
sitting on Pixar characters?

1816
01:05:56,180 --> 01:05:59,300
Or why aren't we sitting on the Toy Story characters?

1817
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:00,860
And then I was like that doesn't make sense.

1818
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:01,700
It doesn't make sense.

1819
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:04,980
But then when we talk about, or when we were talking about

1820
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:06,620
it's just from the Woody's round up stuff,

1821
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:10,720
I like rides where they try to open up the world

1822
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:11,560
and dig in deeper.

1823
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:14,660
I've said this before, I like Hondo being the guy

1824
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:17,940
on Millennium Falcon and not a famous character.

1825
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:21,340
Give us at least a side character or a new character

1826
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:23,460
because that makes it feel a little more special.

1827
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:26,660
So it does make it fun that you're like digging deeper

1828
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:29,380
into an aspect of Toy Story as opposed to like

1829
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:31,740
sitting on Rex, which would also be awesome.

1830
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:32,580
Which would be fun.

1831
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:34,180
But it should be something where you sit on Rex.

1832
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:35,020
Yeah I agree.

1833
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:38,740
You should sit on Potato Head and Rex and Slinky Dog.

1834
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:40,500
I wanna sit on all of them.

1835
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,980
I wanna sit, one of my fantasies was not to play

1836
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:44,660
but to sit on all the toys.

1837
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:47,820
I wanna sit on Rick Dicker from Incredibles.

1838
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:48,660
Yeah let's sit.

1839
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:49,780
On or a bud.

1840
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:50,620
Yeah.

1841
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:54,580
I considered, they talked about having the bullseye

1842
01:06:54,580 --> 01:06:56,420
be one of the, but they were concerned like,

1843
01:06:56,420 --> 01:06:58,220
oh no, if there's only one bullseye,

1844
01:06:58,220 --> 01:07:01,180
people will fight over getting to ride bullseye.

1845
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:02,860
Oh interesting, that makes sense.

1846
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:04,420
Yeah.

1847
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:06,180
It could have been all bullseyes I guess.

1848
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:07,940
I guess it could have, that would have been a little.

1849
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:08,780
Little too much.

1850
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:09,600
Little too much.

1851
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:10,440
Scary.

1852
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:11,940
I guess it's good what they did.

1853
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:12,780
Yeah.

1854
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:14,460
And I think, hey and you know when you think about

1855
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:18,780
how many rides they've now mined Toy Story into.

1856
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:19,620
Four?

1857
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:21,020
Is it that many?

1858
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:22,940
Yeah, yeah I guess yeah Midway Mania and this

1859
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:25,100
and Buzz Lightyear, but Buzz Lightyear is like

1860
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:28,540
an entirely other aspect of just this one franchise.

1861
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:29,380
Yeah it's the same.

1862
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:30,220
Yeah.

1863
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:31,060
The same carousel as.

1864
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:32,260
Yeah same thing I'm talking about.

1865
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:36,620
Slinky Dog Dash and the Little Green Men ride.

1866
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:37,460
Oh yeah where's that?

1867
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:39,020
It's in Toy Story Land in Florida.

1868
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:41,700
Is that the one that's like the major.

1869
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:42,820
Yeah it's like the major one.

1870
01:07:42,820 --> 01:07:43,660
Gotcha.

1871
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:44,780
So that's up to five now.

1872
01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:45,620
Five I guess?

1873
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:46,440
Yeah.

1874
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:47,740
There's five Toy Story rides.

1875
01:07:47,740 --> 01:07:48,580
Wild.

1876
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:51,140
And then that one where you get the drop ride

1877
01:07:51,140 --> 01:07:52,340
where you're trapped in the.

1878
01:07:52,340 --> 01:07:53,180
In the.

1879
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:54,020
The incinerator.

1880
01:07:54,020 --> 01:07:56,180
With the, oh yeah yeah where you're heading down

1881
01:07:56,180 --> 01:07:57,020
into the garbage.

1882
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:01,140
No one ever goes on it, it's too terrifying.

1883
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:03,580
They should theme, they should re-theme Tower of Terror

1884
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:06,940
in Florida to the incinerator from Toy Story 3.

1885
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:08,740
Yeah that's a great idea.

1886
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:10,300
Dipped into the incinerator.

1887
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:12,980
Get rid of it just to make it a big industrial,

1888
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:15,100
the hotel turn it into like a big metal.

1889
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:16,380
Like a big metal chute?

1890
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:17,700
A garbage chute?

1891
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:20,060
And then you just go up in the front, up there

1892
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:22,700
and then you just have to, the only way to get out

1893
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:25,780
is you all clutch hands and accept your fate.

1894
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:27,580
But if you fight at all.

1895
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:31,140
If you fight at all it'll ride less longer.

1896
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:32,660
And then just put on like a lot of heat,

1897
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:37,220
like a lot of space heaters on the drop

1898
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:39,540
to make it really feel like you're about to burn up.

1899
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:40,380
Yeah.

1900
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:42,020
And then I guess you get, I guess open the top up

1901
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:46,660
and you get rescued by the aliens, by the claw aliens.

1902
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:47,500
Yeah.

1903
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:52,580
As we all will be, should we, any of us ever face peril.

1904
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:56,780
What we know that's nice is that somebody,

1905
01:08:56,780 --> 01:09:00,060
a peripheral friend of ours is gonna suck us up

1906
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:01,260
out of the situation.

1907
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:02,100
Yes.

1908
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:03,820
And that we won't die that time.

1909
01:09:03,820 --> 01:09:04,660
Right, exactly.

1910
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:05,660
You get at least one free pass

1911
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:07,380
where your friend rescues you.

1912
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:09,860
That's why we got a flood area 51.

1913
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:11,540
That's why we all gotta show up

1914
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:13,900
and break down the doors with area 51

1915
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:15,620
so the aliens save us.

1916
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:16,940
It is a smart plan.

1917
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:18,220
That is smart, yeah.

1918
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:19,060
Let's do it.

1919
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:22,100
Oh, and one more thing, the dynamite goat.

1920
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:23,980
This is a drawing of a dynamite goat.

1921
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:24,820
Oh, great.

1922
01:09:24,820 --> 01:09:25,660
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1923
01:09:25,660 --> 01:09:27,100
Yeah, yeah, that's a good little nod

1924
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:27,940
and it's high and together.

1925
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:28,780
I like that.

1926
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:30,820
Yeah, we love when rides reference other rides.

1927
01:09:30,820 --> 01:09:31,660
Yeah. That's fun.

1928
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:34,180
It's nice and subtle and it makes sense in the world.

1929
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:35,860
So wonderful, love it.

1930
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:38,780
Does that bring us to the third?

1931
01:09:38,780 --> 01:09:39,660
I think it does.

1932
01:09:39,660 --> 01:09:41,380
Keep going down Pixar Pier

1933
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:45,220
and head to the Inside Out Emotional Whirlwind.

1934
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:48,300
Itself, it's a new ride

1935
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:50,660
and a place where an old ride was removed,

1936
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:55,660
but it is also a former, a different Pixar ride,

1937
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:57,620
plopped into that other area.

1938
01:09:57,620 --> 01:10:01,500
It was Flix Flyers in a Bug's Land

1939
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:03,700
and now it is the Emotional Whirlwind.

1940
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:08,100
So if you were a fan of sitting in an Apple Jack's box,

1941
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:10,900
sorry, no longer.

1942
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:13,740
It's not an Apple, but it is exactly the same.

1943
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:14,580
Yes.

1944
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:16,940
It's not the exact same ride, it's just it looks different.

1945
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:20,300
And you're now, it all makes sense

1946
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:24,340
because they deal with those memory orbs,

1947
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:27,140
so it's like the big ball pieces are those.

1948
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:28,620
And before in the Flix one,

1949
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:32,940
they were like big nuts or something, or like acorns.

1950
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:33,780
Yeah.

1951
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:34,600
Were they big nuts?

1952
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:35,900
Something like that.

1953
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:36,740
Yeah.

1954
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:37,560
Okay.

1955
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:38,400
Something like that.

1956
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,240
They're gathering food,

1957
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:41,460
they're just constantly gathering food in Bug's life.

1958
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:44,620
I will first say that I was there a couple days ago

1959
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:48,460
and I was there with my family and I forgot to go on this.

1960
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:50,100
That was something I was doing,

1961
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:52,220
but I was so, I was trying to get in everything

1962
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:54,300
and I totally forgot to go on it.

1963
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:56,500
So I screwed up.

1964
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:57,780
I'm being honest here.

1965
01:10:57,780 --> 01:11:01,540
Well then you don't have the copious pages of notes

1966
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:02,700
that I have.

1967
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:04,460
So many notes, I assume.

1968
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:07,820
This episode's gonna be done 35 minutes sooner

1969
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:10,060
because you don't have your thoughts.

1970
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:11,300
I know, I'm sorry.

1971
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:14,260
You dropped the ball, the memory ball.

1972
01:11:14,260 --> 01:11:15,740
I have plenty of thoughts.

1973
01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:18,100
I just don't have first thoughts.

1974
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:18,940
What good are they?

1975
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:22,140
You don't know what it's like to have that specific wind

1976
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:23,540
rushing through your hair.

1977
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:24,380
I am upset.

1978
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:25,460
I was like, what the hell?

1979
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:27,300
I forgot to do, like,

1980
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:28,980
look, my parents were here for the whole week

1981
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:30,980
and it's, you know, that can be intense.

1982
01:11:30,980 --> 01:11:33,280
I think, Jason, it's time to begin the procedure

1983
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:36,180
to impeach Mike from the podcast.

1984
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:39,140
Well, at least someone's doing their job in this country.

1985
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:43,140
Let's be an example by...

1986
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:44,980
I have the video of the POV video.

1987
01:11:44,980 --> 01:11:46,980
Unfortunately, I did go on it.

1988
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:48,140
Oh, unfortunately.

1989
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:52,300
Well, no, I went on it, but almost got into some...

1990
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:53,140
Hijinks?

1991
01:11:53,140 --> 01:11:55,460
Hijinks, scaring some strangers.

1992
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:02,180
I was there by myself and I got in line

1993
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:04,940
and I got to the front and they put you on a number

1994
01:12:04,940 --> 01:12:06,700
and I did not...

1995
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:07,540
What do you mean they did?

1996
01:12:07,540 --> 01:12:08,860
Oh, they just like, like any other ride.

1997
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:10,580
They just stand on the number, right.

1998
01:12:10,580 --> 01:12:15,100
And it was right across from the pal around,

1999
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:20,100
the Ferris wheel, which we have all been on with me.

2000
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:23,180
I believe I've been on with each of you now separately.

2001
01:12:24,260 --> 01:12:28,780
And I thought, oh, well, surely we can all get our...

2002
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:31,580
Oh no, am I riding with this young couple?

2003
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:32,980
Oh, this is gonna be weird.

2004
01:12:32,980 --> 01:12:36,140
Cause on the Ferris wheel, they cram people in.

2005
01:12:36,140 --> 01:12:37,340
Sure.

2006
01:12:37,340 --> 01:12:41,620
So I followed the people in front of me

2007
01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:44,340
and sat down in the same car and they were kind of like,

2008
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:47,020
are we, I guess we share on this one?

2009
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:51,220
And then I realized, oh, everyone else had sat in their cars

2010
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:52,460
and there was an empty car.

2011
01:12:52,460 --> 01:12:54,060
And I'm like, I am so sorry.

2012
01:12:55,660 --> 01:12:57,660
And then went to the car next to us and I went,

2013
01:12:57,660 --> 01:12:58,500
I'm so sorry.

2014
01:12:58,500 --> 01:12:59,820
I got confused.

2015
01:12:59,820 --> 01:13:00,780
How old are the couple?

2016
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:03,780
I would say 20, 19 or 20.

2017
01:13:03,780 --> 01:13:04,620
Oh man.

2018
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:05,460
So...

2019
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:06,980
Trying to be a third.

2020
01:13:07,660 --> 01:13:08,500
Yeah.

2021
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:11,260
So, yeah.

2022
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:16,140
So that was a little second of weirdness.

2023
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:17,500
I should have just...

2024
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:18,820
That got your emotions up.

2025
01:13:18,820 --> 01:13:20,300
That got my emotions up.

2026
01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:22,460
Yeah.

2027
01:13:22,460 --> 01:13:24,100
You were especially mad when you slinked around

2028
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:26,980
to their side and put your arms around both of them.

2029
01:13:26,980 --> 01:13:27,820
I don't know.

2030
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:30,740
And I felt even like more stupid.

2031
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:33,380
When I read the, again, the Orange County Register article

2032
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:34,420
about this ride and they say,

2033
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:36,220
we think this will be a big hit with families

2034
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:38,420
and little kids and hey, we even think it's gonna be

2035
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:39,900
a nice date night ride.

2036
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:43,060
And I'm just like, oh God, a nice date night ride

2037
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:44,540
and Jason is here too.

2038
01:13:45,940 --> 01:13:48,460
I always read the OC Register article

2039
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:49,780
before you go on the ride.

2040
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:51,700
Is this a date night ride?

2041
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:52,620
You need to know.

2042
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:54,460
But I also felt extra dumb

2043
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:57,380
because it was like one through eight.

2044
01:13:57,380 --> 01:14:00,340
And then you can see there are eight cars

2045
01:14:00,340 --> 01:14:03,380
and I am like, oh, I am very stupid.

2046
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:04,220
I am very dumb.

2047
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:05,940
You misunderstood the number system.

2048
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:08,260
It was hot that day.

2049
01:14:08,260 --> 01:14:09,100
It was very warm.

2050
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:11,060
It was very hot when I went as well.

2051
01:14:11,060 --> 01:14:13,260
It's not the most shaded line.

2052
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:14,820
Not the most shaded line.

2053
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:16,660
Aesthetically very pleasing.

2054
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:21,100
Imagine your site, Mary Blair Influence.

2055
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:23,180
Probably my favorite part, there is a lot of

2056
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:27,340
Raleigh Crump Tower of the Four Winds Whirly gigs.

2057
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:28,420
Oh yeah.

2058
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:31,260
And they were like, that was purposely a reference point

2059
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:35,420
and the sign was a reference point to World's Fair stuff.

2060
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:38,260
Okay, that had not occurred to me.

2061
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:39,100
That makes sense.

2062
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:41,780
These like mobiles where pieces are spinning around.

2063
01:14:41,780 --> 01:14:42,900
Oh, that's super cool.

2064
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:44,780
And the one, there's this,

2065
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:47,180
specifically all the posters in the line are really nice,

2066
01:14:47,180 --> 01:14:50,020
but the poster for Imagination Land,

2067
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:54,860
this red swirly psychedelic art, it's fantastic.

2068
01:14:54,860 --> 01:14:57,100
I'm not sure what, I couldn't even put my finger

2069
01:14:57,100 --> 01:14:59,900
on what it's referencing, but that one especially.

2070
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:01,540
But a ton of them are great.

2071
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:03,940
That's I feel like half the reason to bring,

2072
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:08,660
these overlays feel like, they can feel a little perfunctory,

2073
01:15:08,660 --> 01:15:11,980
but if you can get the aesthetics of one of these

2074
01:15:13,740 --> 01:15:17,900
visually stunning Pixar movies into the parks,

2075
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:18,860
then that's a good thing.

2076
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:21,300
I mean, the orbs, like the sun was going down

2077
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:24,540
as I was going on it and the orbs were all lead up

2078
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:26,980
and everything, the memory orbs,

2079
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:29,540
and that just looked terrific.

2080
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:31,940
I really like Inside Out the movie

2081
01:15:31,940 --> 01:15:35,380
and I think it's very nicely designed.

2082
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:38,060
And I got to say the main theme song of the movie,

2083
01:15:38,060 --> 01:15:40,940
that piano theme, I think is so great.

2084
01:15:40,940 --> 01:15:45,940
And yeah, really adds a nice little vibe to this area.

2085
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:48,900
Yeah, kinetic energy, as they say.

2086
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:50,020
Kinetic energy.

2087
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:51,340
This and the Critter Carousel is interesting

2088
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:53,340
because they're both like the kid rides

2089
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:54,660
and they open later.

2090
01:15:54,660 --> 01:15:55,500
Yes.

2091
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:57,580
But they both add the movement

2092
01:15:57,580 --> 01:15:59,580
that does make a place feel alive.

2093
01:15:59,580 --> 01:16:00,420
For sure.

2094
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:01,240
That does make it feel more fun.

2095
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:02,600
I think this was a dead spot

2096
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,880
ever since the Malibuumer was taken out.

2097
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:05,920
For a really long time.

2098
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:07,840
Forever, what is it, seven years ago?

2099
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:09,600
And when it was there, it was maybe sort of

2100
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:13,000
an unpleasant spot because it's just big rocket sounds

2101
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:13,840
and screams.

2102
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:14,680
Yeah.

2103
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:19,800
And they need stuff for little, little kids to go on.

2104
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:24,800
Like under five and all to go on, whatever.

2105
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,280
There's a certain height you hit where it's like,

2106
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:31,160
okay, you are free to go on a lot more stuff,

2107
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,200
but the younger kids, I mean, once you pre-thrown.

2108
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:35,520
The pre-36 crowd.

2109
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:36,360
Yeah.

2110
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:38,600
What are they left with?

2111
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:41,880
I had a lot of anxiety as a small child

2112
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:44,720
that it's like, I can fit on this, thank God.

2113
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:46,040
Like I cleared.

2114
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:48,560
Was there a lag or was there a time when?

2115
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:52,560
I think I hit the minimum, I did hit the minimum at the age

2116
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:55,120
I started to really get into the parks,

2117
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:58,560
but it's like three foot, four foot,

2118
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:01,360
and I was very nervous at a certain age.

2119
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:03,680
I was like, I'm not gonna be able to be tall enough.

2120
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:04,680
Oh, sure.

2121
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:08,240
It's like if anybody's been to the Newport fun zone

2122
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:11,200
in Newport Beach, there's a ferry.

2123
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:14,120
You can take cars onto the ferry and it takes you back

2124
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:16,360
and forth to this little amusement area.

2125
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:18,440
And I spent a summer down there and I,

2126
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:21,040
that specifically they had an odd system of pricing it

2127
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:23,400
where it was a certain price if you were under 12

2128
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:25,640
and a certain price over 12.

2129
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:27,400
And every time I got on the thing,

2130
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:30,000
because I had just turned 12 and I was proud of it.

2131
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,240
I'm an adult now and I would get on this thing

2132
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:35,360
and when they charged me the kid price,

2133
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:38,640
I was more upset than I ever am about anything today.

2134
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:39,480
Wow.

2135
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:43,320
It's like, I've been just pangs of stress.

2136
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:45,880
Like, how dare you, how dare you think

2137
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:47,280
that I am a little child.

2138
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:50,680
I've been on this earth for 12 years, recognize it.

2139
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:53,400
Did your parents do like, hey, if anyone asked today,

2140
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:54,240
you're four.

2141
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:56,760
Oh, for sure, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2142
01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:00,000
Hey, that'll do, hey, if I can help save a buck.

2143
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,960
But, yeah, but this was a matter of like 10 cents.

2144
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:07,600
That's another weird thing, like 45 cents for an adult.

2145
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:10,760
35 for, it was a really obscure price

2146
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:13,320
and my face would go red when they would say,

2147
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:15,360
oh, one child, huh?

2148
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:17,240
And this is just to get to an amusement area.

2149
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:19,040
It's not a, like, cause we had the Cape.

2150
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:20,960
No, it gets you in general.

2151
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:23,360
You don't have to go to the amusement park to use this.

2152
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:25,480
Oh, okay, yeah, cause we, back East,

2153
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:26,680
there's the Cape Mayfair.

2154
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:30,040
You get on a Jersey and it cuts off like hours from,

2155
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:34,400
it goes from like Jersey to Delaware or Maryland.

2156
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:36,320
It admitted like, it's a shortcut

2157
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:37,880
instead of taking a highway.

2158
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:42,880
This is much more, it's a half hour at most.

2159
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:47,800
At some point we'll cover my beloved ride of mine

2160
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:48,840
from there that's no longer there

2161
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:50,800
called the Scary Dark Ride.

2162
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:51,840
If anyone's listening to this

2163
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,560
and knows the Scary Dark Ride,

2164
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:55,720
yeah, I hope you're as fond of it as me.

2165
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:59,040
It's this dual ripoff of Pirates and Haunted Mansion

2166
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:02,200
that said dead men tell no tales over and over again,

2167
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:05,360
even though it was about like skeletons and ghosts.

2168
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:09,080
And today that space is like a dentist's office.

2169
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:09,920
Wow, really?

2170
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:13,000
Cause somebody just works and types in what used to be a.

2171
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:13,920
That's wild.

2172
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:14,760
Yeah, yeah.

2173
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:15,960
Cause it wasn't very big, right?

2174
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:16,800
No, no, it was like.

2175
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,200
Yeah, really, it was like a cluster of like.

2176
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:19,840
A couple sheds, essentially.

2177
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:21,160
Yeah, yeah, pretty much, yeah.

2178
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:24,080
In just like kind of like an office parky area, so.

2179
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:25,520
Jeez.

2180
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:27,200
Yeah, wish that was my office.

2181
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:28,440
Is that documented on YouTube?

2182
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:29,360
I think so.

2183
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:30,200
Okay, good.

2184
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:32,120
Yeah, but it's not documented the time

2185
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:34,960
that my friend and I smoked weed in there.

2186
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:35,800
In it?

2187
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:36,640
Yeah, man.

2188
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:37,760
Wow.

2189
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:40,960
For the three month period where I was being bad.

2190
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:42,560
Wow.

2191
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:44,200
Wow, we gotta do an episode.

2192
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:47,280
Although wait, maybe I just sat while he did it.

2193
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:48,440
That seems more likely.

2194
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:49,280
Secondhand.

2195
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:50,100
So I could like.

2196
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:50,940
Secondhand deadly.

2197
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:54,040
Deny involvement if like somebody stopped us

2198
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:54,880
right on the other side.

2199
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:55,960
In the rare event.

2200
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:58,600
You still got like a thrill from knowing it was bad.

2201
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:00,320
Yeah, you know what I did one time?

2202
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:01,800
You know, it's the craziest thing I've ever done?

2203
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:03,600
I sat next to someone.

2204
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:04,440
Smoking weed on a.

2205
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:09,440
Who took one like scratchy puff of bad weed

2206
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:13,320
on an obscure OC dark red.

2207
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:16,160
God, you, that skeleton who sang

2208
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:18,800
Dead Men Tell No Tales was talking right to you

2209
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:21,080
because that weed could have killed you.

2210
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:21,920
Yeah, well.

2211
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:22,960
That dirt weed.

2212
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:23,800
And now.

2213
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:26,840
The realization dirt weed could have killed you.

2214
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:31,440
Well, and there's, you know, weed is now legal,

2215
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:32,880
but at the time it wasn't.

2216
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:35,120
So really it would be in the,

2217
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:37,600
it'd be okay for the Orange County police

2218
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:42,600
to come up here and arrest me for my misdeeds in 2002.

2219
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:44,600
So I might be.

2220
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:46,920
I might be telling a tale in jail.

2221
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:48,000
Oh no.

2222
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,080
Let's get that campaign going.

2223
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:50,400
Hashtag arrest Scott.

2224
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:51,240
Oh no.

2225
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:53,200
Please no.

2226
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:54,680
Lying about his age.

2227
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:56,040
Lying about his age.

2228
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:57,880
Sitting next to him.

2229
01:20:57,880 --> 01:20:58,800
On public transit.

2230
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,160
That was also, that was, yeah,

2231
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:01,520
that was in Orange County too.

2232
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:02,640
The many crime.

2233
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:05,480
I like, if there's any way I can make amends

2234
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:07,600
to the city of Newport Beach,

2235
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:10,840
I will now, now I'll happily say I was a minor.

2236
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:11,680
There's a guy.

2237
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:12,520
I'm not embarrassed anymore.

2238
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:13,720
I didn't know what I was doing.

2239
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:15,440
There's like an undercover cop in a car

2240
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:18,000
outside the apartment now that's listening in on this.

2241
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:18,840
And he goes, we got him.

2242
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:20,280
We got him, we got him, we got him.

2243
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:21,120
And then they.

2244
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:22,680
Takes his gun out of his holster,

2245
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:25,160
chambers around, safety off.

2246
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:28,360
They're about to burst through this glass here

2247
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:30,440
and shoot all of us just to get to Scott.

2248
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:32,320
Oh no.

2249
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:36,560
When it's a crime being committed by a now podcaster,

2250
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:39,640
it usually takes them about 110 episodes to fess up.

2251
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:41,280
Let's just bide our time.

2252
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:42,120
Where are they at now?

2253
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:42,960
I don't know.

2254
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:44,720
They've been talking about Liberty Square forever.

2255
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:47,080
I don't think today's our day.

2256
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:48,560
Talking about that poop.

2257
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:50,000
That poop-lush lane.

2258
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,240
Got more about the painted sewage lane.

2259
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:57,040
That guy goes home to his wife every day.

2260
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:57,880
How was work today?

2261
01:21:57,880 --> 01:21:59,680
This thing always have to be two hours.

2262
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:01,080
Jesus.

2263
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:02,040
I'm gonna be late again.

2264
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:03,720
Sorry, hun.

2265
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:05,480
They're running over.

2266
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:08,920
Well, I guess what else is there to say for this?

2267
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:10,880
My final episode is a free man.

2268
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:12,000
Yeah.

2269
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,160
Similar to the carousel, five different songs you can hear.

2270
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:18,800
This one time themed to each emotion.

2271
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:19,640
Yeah.

2272
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:21,320
I got anger.

2273
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:23,520
All the characters speak,

2274
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:26,520
but anger drove it more.

2275
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:27,720
Yeah.

2276
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:29,560
And that was nice.

2277
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:34,200
Yeah, the voices of Amy Poehler, Bill Hader, Mindy Kaling,

2278
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,760
and Lewis Black occasionally yell at you on this ride.

2279
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:38,200
If it's them.

2280
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:40,840
If it's them, the Poehler one doesn't quite sound right.

2281
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:42,360
I don't think it's her.

2282
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:45,240
I think it might be Lewis Black.

2283
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:48,280
Is it Amy Poehler's sister we don't know about?

2284
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:50,520
Doesn't Tom Hanks' brother do Woody

2285
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:53,400
when he doesn't wanna do it for the low paycheck?

2286
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:57,040
It's that brother who did the show about Sweden

2287
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:58,120
or whatever that was.

2288
01:22:58,120 --> 01:22:58,960
Right.

2289
01:22:58,960 --> 01:22:59,800
Oh yeah.

2290
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:00,640
So Amy.

2291
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:03,120
He can perfectly do Amy's voice.

2292
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:06,200
Tom Hanks' brother is doing Amy Poehler's voice.

2293
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:07,360
That's who's doing it.

2294
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:10,440
Yeah, interesting.

2295
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:13,040
I also like the trend and it's the Guardians thing

2296
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:15,920
where it's like six different songs,

2297
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:17,680
like just these little tricks to make you go,

2298
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:20,000
I only had to go on again to get the different song.

2299
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:20,840
Yeah.

2300
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:21,680
Very smart.

2301
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:23,680
You know, Mater's Junkyard Jamboree

2302
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:26,600
was a version of this too.

2303
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:28,280
I think it's a way to make all of these little,

2304
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:30,560
what are essentially still on the cheaper end

2305
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:31,520
a little carnival rides,

2306
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:34,600
like giving it a distinct aesthetic

2307
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:36,520
that is not just the ride vehicles,

2308
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:38,400
but also the murals and everything

2309
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,440
and the musical component.

2310
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:43,760
I think like at least bringing you into a world

2311
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:47,480
for the time, from entering the line to leaving the ride.

2312
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:50,720
I don't know, it keeps you coming back more

2313
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:54,760
than if it was just a little spinner or whatever.

2314
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:57,920
So I give these things credit for sure.

2315
01:23:57,920 --> 01:23:58,760
Yeah.

2316
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:00,560
The only thing that I would dock it,

2317
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:01,600
and it's not its fault,

2318
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:04,480
but because there's nothing else around it,

2319
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:08,120
it does feel like it doesn't quite belong aesthetically

2320
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:10,080
next to the coaster to me.

2321
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:10,920
Sure.

2322
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:13,040
I feel like everything else,

2323
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:16,000
like I feel like it was placed over by the Critter Carousel

2324
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:18,400
by the treat shop with the games.

2325
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:21,360
It fits better there than in the other room.

2326
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:25,840
Now, Critter Carousel is technically in a section

2327
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:27,520
called the Toy Story Boardwalk,

2328
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,880
and I believe this section is called

2329
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:30,560
the Inside Out Headquarters.

2330
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:31,400
Is that right?

2331
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:35,400
I've read this, this was totally news to me.

2332
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:38,480
It's called Headquarters in the movie.

2333
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:39,520
Okay, right, right, right.

2334
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:42,800
But I think the little sections of Picslar Pier

2335
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:46,480
have at least for imagineering references names.

2336
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:47,480
Interesting.

2337
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:51,320
So you could not have the Critter Carousel

2338
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:53,560
anywhere near Inside Out Headquarters.

2339
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:57,480
Or Paradise Gardens Pier Park,

2340
01:24:57,480 --> 01:25:01,600
the weird name, the extended name for the restaurant area.

2341
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:02,440
It's still awfully strange.

2342
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:04,640
What part is the Pal-Around in then?

2343
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:08,360
That's a good question.

2344
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:09,840
I don't know what that one is called.

2345
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:11,160
The Picslar Pal-Around.

2346
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:12,600
That's in Pal-Around Park.

2347
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:15,320
Stinkly different than Picslar Pier.

2348
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:16,160
And then.

2349
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:17,000
Lassiter Lagoon.

2350
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:20,680
Nothing's there.

2351
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:24,160
There was never there.

2352
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:26,240
It was there, yeah, I don't know.

2353
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:28,520
The hot, so the angry dogs

2354
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:30,400
are part of Inside Out Headquarters?

2355
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:31,880
Well, that's where it starts to break down

2356
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:33,160
because that's kind of far away

2357
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:35,320
from Inside Out Headquarters. That was my point.

2358
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:38,000
Because that's closer to the Toy Story Miniboy Mania.

2359
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:38,880
Yeah.

2360
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:40,960
So that's a different spot.

2361
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:41,800
Yeah.

2362
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:43,400
There are holes in this.

2363
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:46,720
Or the famously well thought out Picslar Pier,

2364
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:47,680
there are holes.

2365
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:52,680
So the Midway Games and the Bing Bong Treat Shop,

2366
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:56,200
that's Inside Out Headquarters?

2367
01:25:56,200 --> 01:26:00,120
I think the Bing Bong Treat Shop is closest to this ride,

2368
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:02,000
but I don't know about the Midway Games.

2369
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:02,840
Well, but that's in between, right?

2370
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:03,680
That would be the Midway.

2371
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:06,080
No, no, wait, is Bing Bong on the opposite?

2372
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:07,880
Am I losing my mind?

2373
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:11,000
Where is Bing Bong's Treat Shop,

2374
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,120
the Midway Games and this,

2375
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:15,840
is this to the right of it if I'm staring at it?

2376
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:17,800
How is it possible I don't know this?

2377
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:19,440
How is my brain not retained?

2378
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:20,280
You hit the Midway Games.

2379
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:21,120
Which way left to right?

2380
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:21,960
Why is this weird?

2381
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:23,160
Why am I not knowing this?

2382
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:25,400
This is crazy, I've walked by this a million times.

2383
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:26,720
It's pretty obscure, I don't know.

2384
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:27,960
Yeah.

2385
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:31,040
Bing Bong's across from the Ferris Wheel,

2386
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:36,040
and then you hit the Inside Out emotional whirlwind.

2387
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:37,960
I couldn't think of Ian McShane's name,

2388
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:39,520
I can't think of this.

2389
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:41,920
It's always a good podcast when the phrase hold on

2390
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:46,920
has been said a number of times, followed by silence.

2391
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:49,600
Let me look up just Pixar Pier map.

2392
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:53,200
It's really important, we know left to right.

2393
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:54,280
Well, this is another thing where people

2394
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:55,120
just yelling at us.

2395
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:59,920
West, east, obviously it's a very famous layout,

2396
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:02,920
and these guys, have they all gotten concussions?

2397
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:04,880
How could they not know this?

2398
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:08,640
Yeah, still sort of unclear to me

2399
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:09,480
from looking at this.

2400
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:12,000
Hold on, I got the Disneyland app.

2401
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,720
Oh, more hold on's, guys.

2402
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:16,240
I'm looking at the original concept art

2403
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:21,240
for Pixar Pier here, and it looks pretty good,

2404
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:23,000
and now it's fully realized.

2405
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,200
It's just the Mickey thing still bothers me

2406
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:26,160
that it's on the wheel.

2407
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:27,680
It doesn't make any sense, why would Mickey be

2408
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:29,440
on the Pixar Pier wheel?

2409
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:32,200
Take it off, put Luxo there.

2410
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:34,320
Because he's their boss, he owns them.

2411
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:37,360
All of the characters are in the ownership of.

2412
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:41,080
Okay, as you go down Pixar Pier,

2413
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:45,080
coming through the entrance by the restaurant

2414
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:47,520
and the Abominable Snowman ice cream,

2415
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:49,160
first you hit the Incredibles area,

2416
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:51,960
then you hit Jesse's Critter Carousel,

2417
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:55,960
then Midway Mania, then Midway Mercantile.

2418
01:27:55,960 --> 01:27:57,280
To speed up the pace here.

2419
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:58,800
Sorry, you hit Midway Mercantile first,

2420
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:02,200
then you hit Midway Mania, then around there

2421
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:04,080
you hit an actual Midway.

2422
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:06,560
Okay, so this is on the very end then.

2423
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:07,600
This is on the very end.

2424
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:10,200
Oh God, and now I hit a kid, I'm going to jail.

2425
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:13,760
The Midway itself, the games.

2426
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:14,600
Stir up this map.

2427
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:15,680
The games.

2428
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:19,840
So it goes bing bong, then emotional whirlwind.

2429
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:20,680
Yes.

2430
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:22,080
Got it, okay, so that is the closest thing.

2431
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:22,920
So that's part of it.

2432
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:23,760
The games on Pixar Pier.

2433
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:25,320
That's inside out headquarters,

2434
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:27,000
so we've determined that's right.

2435
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,720
I would say that's inside out headquarters.

2436
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:29,560
Okay, gosh.

2437
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:30,920
And then you hit the silly Symphony Swings,

2438
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:32,200
which is not Pixar based.

2439
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:33,040
No, that's a different thing.

2440
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:34,640
Because you're in Paradise Gardens Park.

2441
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:35,480
That's Paradise Gardens Park.

2442
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:37,760
The Incredicoaster runs through all of it.

2443
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:42,400
The Incredicoaster, now we know that at least 30%

2444
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:46,560
of the Incredicoaster traverses inside out headquarters,

2445
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:47,400
and how can that make sense?

2446
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:48,520
That doesn't make any sense,

2447
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:50,320
because that would be, what is the Incredi-

2448
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:52,160
They gotta demolish that part of the coaster.

2449
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:53,440
I do not have an answer for that.

2450
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:54,280
But there is an Incredi-

2451
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:55,560
They have a name for the Incredi-

2452
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:58,000
There's like a little section featuring the Incredicoaster-

2453
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,240
Incredi-land?

2454
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:00,840
And Jack Jack's Cookie Num Nums.

2455
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:01,680
Incredi-land.

2456
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:03,760
I don't know what the bathrooms fall under.

2457
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:06,160
Is that, yeah, the Incredible bathrooms,

2458
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:08,080
or are they Jesse bathrooms?

2459
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:10,040
But once you cross to the water side of the pier

2460
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:11,720
when you have senior Buzz Asturos

2461
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:13,920
and the Poultry Palace and the Pal-Around,

2462
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:16,160
is that just the Wild West?

2463
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:17,000
That's well-

2464
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,480
I mean, is that part of the Critter Country?

2465
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:22,080
Not Critter, Jesse's Critter Carousel Country.

2466
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:22,920
Oh my God.

2467
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:24,640
And then you got Coco Country,

2468
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:26,440
which consists only of a poster

2469
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:27,440
with the Coco characters on it.

2470
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:28,640
And the Marionette.

2471
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:30,280
There's a man with a Coco Marionette

2472
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:31,640
that walks around once in a while.

2473
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:32,480
Okay.

2474
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:33,320
Right, or is that just an Epcot?

2475
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:34,800
I think it's better to stay by that sign

2476
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,880
so that it all happens within Coco Country.

2477
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:37,720
Right.

2478
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:38,540
It doesn't make any sense.

2479
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:40,160
Well, it comes alive for like Day of the Dead

2480
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:43,120
and the Three Kings and that sort of thing.

2481
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:43,960
I want everybody to stay in there.

2482
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:44,800
And it goes away.

2483
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,280
Everybody stays in their area.

2484
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:48,280
Yeah, everyone needs to stay in their area.

2485
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:49,120
That's what I'm worried about.

2486
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:50,880
Yeah, Bominable Snow Truwaits, so that's, all right.

2487
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:53,600
Oh, that's the only Monsters Inc. thing there.

2488
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:56,760
Oh yeah, so is that Monsters Inc. Pier

2489
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:57,600
or Monsters Inc. section?

2490
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:59,320
Well, but then the restaurant.

2491
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:00,160
Lamplighter Lounge is over there.

2492
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:01,000
Yeah, Lamplighter Lounge.

2493
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,800
So that's Lampland.

2494
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:05,080
Oh, I was gonna call it Animator Alley.

2495
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:06,840
All right, that's fair.

2496
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:08,280
Don't go down Animator Alley.

2497
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:09,120
Yeah, I was gonna say,

2498
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:09,960
don't be careful in Animator Alley.

2499
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:11,560
Yeah, be careful in Animator Alley.

2500
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:13,560
Some say the culture there isn't so great.

2501
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:16,400
And then, yeah.

2502
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:17,720
Bomb Animator Alley.

2503
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:18,560
We'll figure out.

2504
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:19,400
We, you know what?

2505
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:22,200
Maybe we need to do a 19 part section.

2506
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:23,880
Of the Pixar Pier.

2507
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:26,280
Not this year, but at a certain point.

2508
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:28,520
It seems like there's a lot of places.

2509
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:30,760
It seems like the sectors are already created though

2510
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:32,160
for us, which is nice.

2511
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:34,640
Maybe I'd rather go to jail.

2512
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:36,360
I just need to go sit in a cell

2513
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:39,640
and have my meals laid out for me.

2514
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:41,960
Some say this podcast is like jail though.

2515
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:43,280
So you're already there.

2516
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:46,960
You're already there discussing this.

2517
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:49,520
It's a 400 episode sentence.

2518
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:52,080
I'm ticking them off every time.

2519
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:55,560
Well, for this time, we survived podcast The Ride.

2520
01:30:57,040 --> 01:31:00,800
Yeah, go check out these new updated rides.

2521
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:02,680
They all have lots of nice attention and detail

2522
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:03,520
and they're all fun.

2523
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:04,640
They're a lot of fun.

2524
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:07,640
Ended up with a lot to talk about with all of them.

2525
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:09,000
And, oh, you know what?

2526
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:09,840
Wait, one more thing.

2527
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:10,920
I like that in the line,

2528
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:15,000
they give the Spanish instructions to Bing Bong.

2529
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
And he says, soy, Bing Bong.

2530
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:18,440
Oh yeah, that's great.

2531
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:19,280
And that's nice.

2532
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:20,120
That's nice.

2533
01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:22,240
There's an Easter egg out front of the ride too.

2534
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:23,400
There's a broccoli plant,

2535
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:26,560
which in Inside Out Riley famously hates eating broccoli.

2536
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:27,760
Oh, really?

2537
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:28,960
Oh, didn't know that one.

2538
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:29,800
Cool.

2539
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:33,120
So you're a fan of Easter eggs.

2540
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:34,360
There's plenty of them.

2541
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:35,800
Go to those places.

2542
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:39,600
And if you're a fan of us,

2543
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:41,520
like failing to get information

2544
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:44,880
or succeeding in getting it many minutes later,

2545
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:46,640
then there's more of that available.

2546
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:48,680
You go to a podcast ride at Twitter,

2547
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:49,960
a podcast ride at Gmail.

2548
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:52,360
If you know any good berry farms that are fun,

2549
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:55,040
remember, send us your berry farms.

2550
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:56,720
We wanna hear about them.

2551
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:58,280
We have live shows coming up.

2552
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:03,320
August 24th in Anaheim, October 24th in Orlando, Florida.

2553
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:05,440
So yeah, get tickets to those.

2554
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:07,440
What else?

2555
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:09,240
Instagram, all that stuff.

2556
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:10,400
Whatever, what else you got?

2557
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:11,240
Nothing?

2558
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:12,080
Patreon?

2559
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:12,900
Oh yeah, we have a second gate.

2560
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:14,980
If you like hearing more of this stuff,

2561
01:32:14,980 --> 01:32:17,440
go over to Patreon podcast.

2562
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:18,280
I don't know what the URL is.

2563
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:20,400
Patreon.com slash podcast the ride.

2564
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:21,800
There you go.

2565
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:23,920
So yeah, we talk about all this fun stuff.

2566
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:28,200
I'm there for a small fee a month to support.

2567
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:31,480
And kick some money to my bail.

2568
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:32,320
In bail, Scott.

2569
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:33,480
Yeah.

2570
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:35,340
When I am arrested, I assume this,

2571
01:32:35,340 --> 01:32:37,440
when I leave this, it's gonna be like to catch a predator

2572
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:40,040
and there's people just waiting on the other side of the door.

2573
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:40,880
I would say.

2574
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:42,040
So I'll just lay down now.

2575
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:44,920
I would say actually, just for that fee,

2576
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:47,560
we should just get you an ISDN line straight into prison.

2577
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:49,800
And you can just do the show live from there.

2578
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:54,000
Boy, that's a way to make us stand out from other.

2579
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,600
Yeah, one guy's in prison.

2580
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:57,080
Did you hear that podcast about theme parks

2581
01:32:57,080 --> 01:32:58,080
where that one guy's in prison

2582
01:32:58,080 --> 01:32:59,480
and does the show live from prison?

2583
01:32:59,480 --> 01:33:00,400
Three childless men in their 30s,

2584
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:01,720
one of whom is in prison for a crime

2585
01:33:01,720 --> 01:33:03,320
that he committed while a child.

2586
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:06,520
A much better hook, honestly, than what we had.

2587
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:07,360
Yeah.

2588
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:08,200
Yeah.

2589
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:09,040
So yeah, that's good.

2590
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:10,440
You gotta say that hook quick,

2591
01:33:10,440 --> 01:33:12,600
but then we'll get a rhythm to it.

2592
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:13,440
Yeah, yeah.

2593
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:14,480
But the concept is great.

2594
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:18,640
And then my soulmate will chip in every once in a while.

2595
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:20,440
He'll for sure be a show character.

2596
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:21,560
No way.

2597
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:22,860
Backdraft sucked.

2598
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:25,880
He's the most popular of the three.

2599
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:28,280
Shut up, Roxo.

2600
01:33:28,280 --> 01:33:29,680
He's a prisoner from the 40s.

2601
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:30,960
I was gonna say, yeah, Roxo.

2602
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:32,280
He's been in there since.

2603
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:36,000
He made counterfeit money in the 30s.

2604
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,240
He's a Dick Tracy villain.

2605
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:38,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2606
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:39,920
Roxo's head looks like a rock.

2607
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:42,240
Pray for me, stuck with Roxo.

2608
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:43,080
All right.

2609
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:43,920
He's nice though.

2610
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:44,760
Heart of gold.

2611
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:45,760
So long.

2612
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:46,600
See ya.

2613
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:47,440
Bye.

2614
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:48,280
