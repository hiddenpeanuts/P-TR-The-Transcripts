1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,280
Previously on Podcast The Ride.

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,800
We've been invited to do an episode about the TGIF shows that filmed at Walt Disney World.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,640
Mind if I tag along?

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,640
Kyle.

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,640
We are not sharing a microphone.

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,560
Wow, I can't believe we're doing our show underwater.

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,160
This is a shark!

10
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,160
Me?

11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,160
Podcast Prince of the Day?

12
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,920
Oh no, the repopulating podcastulator blew a fuse.

13
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,520
You can find yourself a new guest.

14
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,520
I'm outta here.

15
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,520
Kyle, wave!

16
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:53,040
And now the conclusion of Podcast The Ride.

17
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:59,320
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a theme park podcast with hosts who are such dorks, no transformation

18
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,680
chamber would be powerful enough to make them cool.

19
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,640
I am one of said dorks, Scott Gardner, among the others, Mike Carlson.

20
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,640
Hi.

21
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,440
Hi, yes, if I got into that transformation chamber, it would either break or I would

22
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,800
somehow get less cool.

23
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,600
It would just not even know what to do with me.

24
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,640
Arrows on it would just spin around, steam shoots out, thing collapses.

25
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,720
It would meet its match in you.

26
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,440
Jason Sheridan, how would you fare in the transformation chamber?

27
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:35,400
I'm gonna go even one step farther from Mike and say I would simultaneously come out dehydrated

28
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,120
but also clammy.

29
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,760
It's unclear how I'm both at the same time, but I just am.

30
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,760
Okay, so yeah, it would just affect you physically.

31
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,040
It would almost be like you went to space but no transformation actually happened.

32
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,880
Yeah, it would probably just suck the moisture out of my body and just put it all on my forehead.

33
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:04,160
So somebody expecting, some babe expecting a suave version of you, Jason Sheridan.

34
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:10,880
Sorry, madam, I got worse.

35
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,160
Aged a bit, several decades, it's okay, we can go out.

36
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,240
You've heard of glow ups, this is the first glow down in history.

37
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,760
Folks, we today are, I'm thrilled.

38
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,080
I hope there are some audience members who've been anticipating this one for a while.

39
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:33,880
I certainly have been as a host to talk about some of the greatest narrative content ever made.

40
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:42,480
That being the episodes from ABC's early 90s TGIF lineup where the entire cast of the show

41
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,840
went and visited the Walt Disney World Resort.

42
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,520
These are spectacular, a half hour, two part, really hours of television.

43
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,720
And we're going to tackle a few of them today.

44
00:02:52,720 --> 00:03:00,720
And excited to be doing it with, I think, an aficionado of the genre joining us for the first time in a while.

45
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,520
He is a cast member of Saturday Night Live and the co-creator and star of the new show

46
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:10,000
Saturday Morning All-Star Hits, which premieres on Netflix today.

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,560
You can check it out right now.

48
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,440
Press pause on this, go watch it, come back, however you want to do it, up to you.

49
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,520
It's Kyle Mooney, ladies and gentlemen.

50
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,920
Hey.

51
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,280
So excited to be here. Thank you.

52
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,920
I get, I get nervous.

53
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,000
Like I was thinking about it yesterday.

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,280
I do really love TGIF and this genre, we'll call it a television.

55
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:43,360
But even you calling me an aficionado makes me very nervous because just why I feel like I need to be

56
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,360
continually watching it to know, to be able to pick from everything, if that makes any sense.

57
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,000
But at the same time, it's so ingrained in me that it feels a part of my essence.

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,880
I was nervous picking the word.

59
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:02,040
I didn't, I made a point of not saying expert, perhaps anticipating not wanting to put too much on you.

60
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,320
I appreciate that.

61
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,760
Yeah, it's definitely like influenced me spiritually in some way.

62
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:16,080
Like I couldn't, I don't know that I could like name off episode synopsis like in a moment's notice,

63
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,400
but I feel like it's kind of changed who I am structurally.

64
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:26,960
Yeah, you're not. It's not that you would win a TGIF trivia contest, but that's not what it's about.

65
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,680
I feel, yeah, it's tonal.

66
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,040
It's what these shows are, which I can see.

67
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,960
And it's affected your work.

68
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,520
I don't know if you feel like it's affected, I mean, seemingly that it's affected you as a person.

69
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:45,760
I mean, yes, undoubtedly it's affected my work and my sense of humor.

70
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,000
And therefore, like my sense of humor is part of who I am.

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,400
And so I think you could say it has affected me on a human level.

72
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,600
Yeah, I mean, it's definitely part of the all these shows are part of the fiber of my being as well.

73
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:04,560
And I know my younger sister would just parrot things Stephanie said and Michelle said.

74
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,600
These would just be around in the house for decades, for far too long.

75
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,320
She's still saying how rude and that kind of stuff.

76
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,160
I grew up in a Full House family a little bit, less people.

77
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:23,920
But you could underscore a lot of moments of the Gertner upbringing with the heartfelt music

78
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:28,640
as the heart to heart and the moral are conveyed to little Scott.

79
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:35,320
Full House was like on in the was on in the right time in like the morning when we'd be getting ready for school.

80
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:42,200
So it did feel like I was learning just as many things from the show as my parents, maybe more so.

81
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,560
My dad worked nights was not awake in the morning.

82
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:52,680
So I definitely like in the morning it was the three men of Full House giving me like fatherly advice.

83
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,880
I didn't realize that that you like ascribed some those are your your morning dads.

84
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,160
I just thought of it now, honest to God.

85
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,320
My dad worked nights, so he'd be sleeping in the morning.

86
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:07,840
So my father in the morning, my father's in the morning were Joey, Jesse and Danny.

87
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,800
But I am not I'm not a I don't know this stuff like I know certain comic books,

88
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,720
but it's in the same way with like just probably it's more influence on me than I realize.

89
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,680
That's something I was thinking about was real.

90
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:27,040
Because when you guys go off on Marvel tears, I wonder why is this lacking for me?

91
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,520
Why don't I have this pop culture avenue?

92
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,200
Why didn't I? Because we grew up with so much of the same stuff and not that you guys didn't grow up with these shows.

93
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:39,120
But I do feel like maybe this is my Marvel, like the TGIF shows.

94
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,640
They are again, I doubt my ability to like really spit out a bunch of information.

95
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:48,960
But I was thinking how I can definitely like an episode starts and like based on the

96
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,200
the picture quality or the age of the kids, I can go, OK, so now we're in the era where like

97
00:06:54,200 --> 00:07:02,240
Mrs. Carruthers would be in it or Joey's doing the Ranger Joe show where he has the the Woodchuck puppet.

98
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,560
Or like there's certain things I could sort of, you know, spit out on site about these shows.

99
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,760
You're probably I'm trying to think if there's a bigger Urkel fan I know than you, I feel like.

100
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,800
And I don't even. Is that accurate? Really? I don't know.

101
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,920
I think you made this observation before.

102
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:22,240
I thought about it, but I feel like maybe it's just because we're doing the show and we are referencing things from our childhood a lot.

103
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:29,520
But I feel like you love Urkel and I feel like you talk about Urkel more than any other adult I know.

104
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,000
Huh, huh. Well, I think because I don't feel like I'm talking about Urkel a ton.

105
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,200
I almost feel like this is this is that other people aren't talking about Urkel enough.

106
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:43,000
I think everybody else needs to bring up their their Urkel quota. Yeah.

107
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,560
Kyle, how do you fall in terms of how much does Urkel come up in your day to day?

108
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,840
Well, also, I do want to this is a slight clarification.

109
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,040
I want to make that maybe it's neither here nor there.

110
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,600
Full House started as TGIF, but it did move to Tuesdays.

111
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,760
And I bet that this episode likely aired on a Tuesday.

112
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,320
Is that right? Really? So it was not started.

113
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,960
If maybe when season five, I think I was reading that it was it had moved.

114
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:15,760
Yeah. One of the reoccurring things with these shows is that like when they hit season five or six,

115
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,200
like it's going to have the Disneyland two parter.

116
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,040
Oh, yeah. All of these shows, it did it in season five and six.

117
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,600
The other thing that was interesting to me is all of these shows are on HBO Max now.

118
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,680
That's how I watch them, because I guess Warner Brothers was the production company.

119
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,440
It was definitely the distributor.

120
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:39,000
But somehow the ownership has now ended up with Warner Brothers of these shows.

121
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,360
Yeah, all filmed on the Warner lot.

122
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:48,560
Warner Brothers logo at the end, now on HBO Max, even though these episodes aired on ABC

123
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:56,000
and are giant commercials for Disney World and in two cases have a lengthy Indiana Jones

124
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,960
sequence, which at the time was paramount.

125
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:04,120
So there's a real like car wreck of corporate ownership going on with these.

126
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,400
You can also really see in all of these like what

127
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:14,640
Disney World is pushing or what is new at the time because it gets like prime placement.

128
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,200
Yes, absolutely. Yeah.

129
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,360
You could like within the different episodes, for sure.

130
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,200
I mean, you know, Tower of Terror comes up a couple of times.

131
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,360
I always I feel a number of these episodes.

132
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,400
You can feel Disney saying, I know, I know you just want to do Castle stuff,

133
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,200
but we've got Epcot, so do Epcot, too.

134
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,040
Like eat your vegetables, make sure there's some Epcot in there.

135
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,880
Cover everything.

136
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,000
Yeah. And it definitely feels like they like they were going over.

137
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,760
There was some planning.

138
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,080
Obviously, Indiana Jones, they were pushing hard with a stunt show,

139
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,320
but it definitely feels like, all right, they all shouldn't be at the same hotel.

140
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,120
Like we need to make sure we spread it out a little bit.

141
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,400
People need to have a variety of the things they see, a variety of things they can do here.

142
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:01,760
The fact that they get like the big family shows to to go to Disney

143
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,080
allows them to cover a lot of bases of like four to five stories

144
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,840
going on at once, which can send everybody off to every park.

145
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,520
Everybody can cover a lot of ground.

146
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,000
I do like Urkel, by the way.

147
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,880
I didn't get I didn't get to

148
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,200
formally state that I was.

149
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:19,760
Thanks for that.

150
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,320
I don't know. I feel like just to speak briefly about my history,

151
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:28,000
if with this with the block, if anyone, I don't know, but yes, please. Yeah. Yeah.

152
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,840
This this was an event on Friday night.

153
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:36,040
I was not going out to hang out with cool people or anything like that.

154
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,440
So from like the age of, let's say, you know, eight years old till about

155
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,000
I would imagine 15 or something like that.

156
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,680
I consistently spent my Friday nights watching TGIF.

157
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,920
And and I think it also probably formulated like

158
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,800
kind of how I perceived what like high school was like or dating was like

159
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,280
in the same way, like Say By The Bell kind of had a similar

160
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,000
um, influence on me.

161
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,040
But Family Matters, I like I always had my favorite.

162
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,280
Family Matters was not my favorite at the time.

163
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:11,640
But then, like I would say in my mid 20s, I went back and watched it all.

164
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:16,960
And the way that it sort of evolved into almost like a sci fi fantasy show

165
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:21,240
and that they were like like fighting pirates and stuff like that at some point,

166
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,760
like I really was able to appreciate it on a new level.

167
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,760
And like, yes, the introduction of the chamber and Stefan

168
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,320
like just took the show to a to a new to a new place.

169
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,840
Yeah, yeah, it's I definitely I think all of us probably agree

170
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,520
that we would like prime time television to have more like chambers

171
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,680
that would transform the main characters into alternate versions.

172
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,480
Well, we discovered that Honey, I Shrunk the Kids show

173
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,680
and that that's full of chamber kind of bullshit and emotions all the time.

174
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,680
And it's like you can tell, you know, that critics at this time

175
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:01,800
must have been so judgmental of shows like this.

176
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,600
And like this is American trash and this is what, you know,

177
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,000
whatever L.A.

178
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,440
law is saving us from smart television.

179
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,320
I don't know what was being held up as the opposite.

180
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:20,480
But yeah, I think in retrospect, yeah, we would love if it was this kind of thing,

181
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,680
all that, especially the chamber.

182
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,920
The chamber is just the most fun.

183
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,000
If you started an episode and you realize that's where it was going,

184
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,840
because there's like how many like a dozen that end up involving the chamber

185
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,480
or Urkel's suave alter ego, Stefan or Kel.

186
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,600
Well, it's it's nice that I know I don't know what episode we're starting out with,

187
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,560
but it's nice that, yes, we got Stefan.

188
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,240
And like you're saying, I don't even know how many episodes Stefan is in.

189
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,800
But that's like a specific trope that we got used to.

190
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,800
That was always fun to see.

191
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,480
But I feel like in the full house special, we got to see

192
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,200
Jesse perform at the piano and with the Rippers.

193
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,480
And like that felt like a very fun.

194
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,080
I hadn't watched that episode in a while and thought for sure

195
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,120
when he was trying to convince Becky to

196
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:08,280
to forgive him for missing their date at the piano,

197
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,720
he was going to start playing forever. It just felt like.

198
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,560
Yeah, that's why I think I might have assumed that.

199
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,680
I know my wife, Aaron, thought that also at some point it like

200
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,280
you feel like that's what it's supposed to be for listeners who don't know.

201
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,320
The Beach Boys loom very large in full house.

202
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,720
They appear multiple times.

203
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,360
They lend a song to John Stamos, his character, Jesse,

204
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,800
and his band, Jesse and the Rippers, which is the one of the top tier

205
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,000
bands in the world in the universe of full house,

206
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,600
despite them not having any original songs.

207
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,320
They're like cover bands that is just outstandingly popular.

208
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,640
And having so much money, they don't move out of the.

209
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,840
Jesse still doesn't move out of the house.

210
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,280
And he is also a morning radio co-host at the time.

211
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,920
He's got like two different jobs.

212
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,360
Yeah, both of which come into play in the episode.

213
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,280
He's doing both.

214
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,960
I mean, that's a good era that he's it's rush hour Renegades

215
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,360
and Jesse and the Rippers.

216
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,400
He hasn't been kicked out yet and replaced with Barry Williams

217
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,440
from the Brady Bunch.

218
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,560
We turned it into Barry and the Rippers forever.

219
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:19,080
Just to say that is a you know, if I'm like doing the map of what is Beach Boys

220
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:23,560
that I kind of kitschy, ironically enjoy and then what's Beach Boys I truly love

221
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,920
forever, the original version from the 70s by Dennis Wilson is like deep

222
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,760
into what I truly love, just like wonderful, lush, beautiful little ballad.

223
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,840
And then for some reason, the Beach Boys elected to give

224
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,920
the only the biggest song by a deceased member

225
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,480
to the show Full House.

226
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,480
We are like he is this guy's been dead for 10 years

227
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,720
and we're going to like power ballad Brian Adams.

228
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:56,320
If I this song, I was just so as a kid, I was so confused by all of this.

229
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,360
I didn't say it out loud.

230
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,520
I wasn't asking questions out loud, but I was like this music video.

231
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,080
Is this supposed to be good?

232
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,560
Like, am I supposed to like this?

233
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:09,520
Because it's very like, you know, soft lens.

234
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,160
That's an insane music.

235
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,240
That's so silly.

236
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:18,840
Like like the many candles as he's in, like a no, no shirt underneath Vest.

237
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:22,480
Yeah. Despite the rest of the show being a sitcom,

238
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,640
you were supposed to watch that music video and think it is really cool.

239
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,040
And that Jesse is cool and Stamos is cool.

240
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,040
Yes. And that you want to buy the Beach Boys Summer in Paradise album.

241
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,680
The only place you could find on me as a child.

242
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,120
I didn't know that.

243
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,200
I didn't know. So I like Jesse at the time.

244
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,200
I thought he was cool, but I definitely was like, this video is funny, though.

245
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,720
He's like, looks funny.

246
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,400
And I'm laughing.

247
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:54,440
His twins are filmed in front of like on top of like in a cloudscape,

248
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:59,520
like and then he like tenderly kisses them and get his portrait.

249
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:03,600
Oh, yeah. It's really, really in get his. Yes. Yeah.

250
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:07,000
I don't think I was processing the music video element.

251
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,320
I think I probably just went, this is something for adults.

252
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,240
Like, this is something for my parents.

253
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,560
But I did know something from my parents.

254
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,760
Yeah, I don't know this.

255
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,160
I don't I guess this is a thing adults do.

256
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,160
I don't know what this is, but I knew only my parents,

257
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,320
the only people on earth who like this for my parents.

258
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,680
Yeah. And my aunts and uncles.

259
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,040
I knew Kokomo because that was always played at like weddings and stuff.

260
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,000
That was always played at like reception.

261
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,560
I feel like that was in the mix. Yeah. Yeah.

262
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,440
Kokomo with John Stamos in the video filmed at the Grand Floridian Hotel

263
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,120
in Disney World. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't realize that.

264
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,080
Mm hmm. Mm hmm.

265
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,720
History. Yeah. Not the Coronado Hotel in San Diego, you might think.

266
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,000
But let me clear. Let me get that on the record.

267
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,360
That's great.

268
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,720
I guess we're sort of full housing it a little bit here.

269
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,200
What year did this air? 90?

270
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,320
This is May of 1993.

271
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,680
93. The first one of these three days.

272
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,360
Yeah, I was going to propose chronological order.

273
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,360
By the way. And also just really quick, I think we're going to

274
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,600
we're going to try to just cover three of these.

275
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,440
The big family episodes, which are all two parters.

276
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,720
I was saying to Kyle, like they're all like roughly the same episode, kind of

277
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,760
like a lot of the same things happen structurally. They're the same.

278
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,960
You know, technically we should maybe be covering Boy Meets World

279
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,160
and Sabrina the Teenage Witch, but those are going to have to wait.

280
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,320
Not to say they're off the table forever, but apologies to

281
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,360
fans or stans of those shows anyway.

282
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,640
That's that's the plan.

283
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,880
Proceed later. TGIF later. Later on.

284
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,080
I was just going to bring up

285
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:46,080
Jesse and the Rippers doing the hippie hippie shake in 1993.

286
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,080
I know it's interesting now as an adult to watch it and go,

287
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,280
that song was 30 plus years old at the time.

288
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,320
It's like, but these are pretty sure that song is heavily utilized

289
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,240
in the Angels in the Outfield soundtrack as well.

290
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,640
So it got some some mileage, circa 93 to 97.

291
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,840
Just yeah, just throwing it out there.

292
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,600
It's interesting, though, because I think as a kid,

293
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,840
I actually didn't even realize it was that old.

294
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,720
Like it didn't register, but now it is just an interesting choice.

295
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,200
Well, and it's how they open the gate.

296
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,000
Like so the impetus of the show and of the Tanner family

297
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,320
going to Disney World is Jesse and the Rippers booking a gig at Disney World.

298
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,400
And you don't really know the specifics of the gig.

299
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,680
But then when it starts, it is in front of Cinderella Castle.

300
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,320
They've shut down Magic Kingdom.

301
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,400
It is all for Jesse and the Rippers.

302
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,520
I think the way it plays in the episode is ladies and gentlemen,

303
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:43,160
Jesse and the Rippers for goodness sake, I got the hippie hip.

304
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,400
They are straight into the middle of the song.

305
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,520
And one general question in all of these, I'm curious

306
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,880
if any of you have insight into this, like,

307
00:18:54,320 --> 00:19:00,200
are these actual park goers or are these background actors in these

308
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,560
in some of these like like in that spot?

309
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,760
It's a good question, because you see you do see when you go on Disney

310
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:10,840
on certain days at Disney, they'll have a sign up that says we're filming.

311
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,440
And basically by being in the park, you agree that we won't sue us

312
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,400
if you're on camera for any reason.

313
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,560
So I wonder if it's a mix.

314
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:22,600
I wonder if it's like people that extras like right around the main actors

315
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,480
when there's like closeups of them in crowds.

316
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,000
But then like there's possibilities that they just got stray people

317
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,480
far in the background and.

318
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,520
Yeah, I don't know.

319
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,320
When we were watching, Jane was like, look at that crowd.

320
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,680
They're like rubberneck.

321
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:39,280
They're like really staring at the action going on in the front of the shot.

322
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,120
Yeah, it's it's pretty crazy crowd acting specifically

323
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,160
in the in the family matters proposal scene.

324
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,680
If you if you really stare at people in that one,

325
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:57,720
when a a big grand proposal is happening between non famous people,

326
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,400
this isn't like Jesse and the Rippers.

327
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,800
Nobody knows who Stefan and Laura are.

328
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,480
And yet they're up on the stage with Cinderella and a crowd is gathered

329
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,000
that goes all the way back to the front of Main Street.

330
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,680
It feels right. All of me.

331
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,840
What is this event?

332
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,160
Is this a thing that occurs?

333
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,080
I mean, that's something you can ask about a lot of what happens in the right.

334
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,240
So that I think is another strong point of all of the is that they all

335
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:29,800
it contain things that do not, did not, never will happen in Disney World.

336
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,800
But I didn't know that as a kid, I thought all of these things were on the table.

337
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,480
Yeah, possibly.

338
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,200
I definitely thought the Michelle, what is she, the princess for a day?

339
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,240
I thought that might be possible.

340
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,600
Yeah. Now, in in my memory, and I don't know, this is another

341
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,600
show at Disneyland or Disney World.

342
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:53,080
I had thought that Michelle pulled the sword and the stone sword.

343
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,480
So I don't know if that plays in Blossom or something else.

344
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,960
Or I just totally imagined like imagined that.

345
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,760
But that's kind of always how I remember her becoming princess for a day.

346
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,120
So it's fun to see it change up.

347
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,760
That makes more sense.

348
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,760
That's what's that's what's there.

349
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,720
That is a thing where like only one kid does it.

350
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,600
I almost wonder if that was what was written.

351
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:21,400
And then Disney noted it and said, we're pushing Aladdin really hard right now.

352
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,280
Can we make this some sort of made up Aladdin thing?

353
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,320
Because if you haven't seen the episodes and again, HBO Max, look them up.

354
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,760
If you want to know what we're talking about.

355
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:35,920
As soon as the family enters the Magic Kingdom, there is the setup in Main Street.

356
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,880
Mind you, in the Victorian era, Main Street,

357
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,000
there is just this little Aladdin world set up

358
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,840
with a big, like loud vizier kind of guy.

359
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,480
And this announcing that there's you people can come up and rub the lamp

360
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,920
and there will be a princess for the day chosen.

361
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,880
Can I just add, I wrote down this quote and I don't know if this is directly

362
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,600
what it was. And I've not seen I've not seen Aladdin in a minute.

363
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,560
So you guys can correct me if like this is actually a major character, but

364
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:11,240
someone in the group is like, Whoa, look, all the guys from Aladdin,

365
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,880
the lamp seller, Jasmine.

366
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,720
I read that.

367
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,920
I knew it. All the guys.

368
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,800
Just like, yeah, it's everyone.

369
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,400
The lamp seller.

370
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,240
That's what teen girls are obsessed with.

371
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,880
It's the lamp seller.

372
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,880
So there's the ceremony that's going to happen.

373
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:36,080
Stephanie, the the middle child, Jodie Sweden.

374
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,120
It's supposed to be her turn, but then she offers it to Michelle.

375
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,120
I forget why it becomes Michelle.

376
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,320
But it's like rightfully her turn to rub the lamp.

377
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,440
But she gives it up or gets distracted or something.

378
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,280
And Michelle does it.

379
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:54,000
And she is chosen as princess for the day, which there's like

380
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,360
a bunch of magic, a big puff of smoke.

381
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,040
All of the all of the daughters together say, oh, baby.

382
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:08,760
And then suddenly a big inflatable genie is there,

383
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:13,800
which Storks knows from that Aladdin's Royal Caravan parade,

384
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,400
which was in Disney MGM Studios.

385
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,760
And what's it doing in in Magic Kingdom?

386
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,840
Makes no sense.

387
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:23,360
See it later on going down Hollywood Boulevard in MGM Studios.

388
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:28,440
The other inflatables, you know, that were used a lot in the parades at the time.

389
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:33,080
You know, Minnie with the fruit on her head and Jester Roger Rabbit.

390
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,320
Those, of course, come into play at the end of the episode.

391
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,520
But that's a different stream.

392
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,880
Yeah. Nice to see them.

393
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,560
Really good to see.

394
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,960
I'll add plot wise.

395
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,720
I mean, just because we maybe pass

396
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,360
and went past it a little bit, but like when Jesse gets these

397
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,280
when it gets asked to perform with his band at Disney World,

398
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:55,280
there's also this whole thing of him having celebrating his anniversary

399
00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:00,440
with with Becky and like and you'll see this when we get to step by step.

400
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,480
But there's this whole thing of like,

401
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,880
I guess, couples like trying to have sex while at the parks

402
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,920
or like trying to make love.

403
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,560
Yeah, it seems to be a driving narrative saying that's all of them.

404
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,160
Yeah. Every episode, every episode of every show is about a horny.

405
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,680
Almost every character is oddly enough.

406
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,920
These episodes are not pushing Disney's very robust babysitting services

407
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,200
and kids clubs, which they were really pushing in the 90s.

408
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,320
I was like, hey, parents, if you want to get the hell away from your goddamn kids,

409
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,960
leave them at the hotel.

410
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,320
We've got people.

411
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,480
You know, there should have been one that one at least that showcased that service.

412
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,360
Yeah, you think.

413
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,480
I don't know. Is this an uncomfortable area?

414
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,200
Maybe for why? I don't know what you were heading for, Mike, but I'm just

415
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,120
I'm curious now.

416
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,160
Is there anything accurate about this depiction of like Disney

417
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:55,760
World as an especially romantic place in that regard?

418
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,920
Well, here's what I'll say about this.

419
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,120
When you're a certain age and this is not

420
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,600
people think this is out of character for me, but when you're a certain age

421
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,440
and go anywhere, especially when you're with your parents

422
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,920
and maybe you're in your mid to late teens,

423
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:12,400
there is an idea that like maybe I will just lock eyes and fall in love with someone.

424
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,360
There's a lot of that on vacations all the time.

425
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,840
And, you know, stemming from like Kyle and like my worldview kind of coming

426
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,200
from shows like this.

427
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,200
And people are always like, you know, finding the love of their

428
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,520
especially on trips.

429
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,720
Any show goes to Hawaii or something.

430
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,360
They instantly somebody meets the love of their life and like

431
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,360
maybe gets engaged within three days.

432
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,360
I always thought that was in the cards for me.

433
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,200
In Disney World or anywhere. Yes. Right.

434
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,200
Yeah. I also it isn't until you're much older that you realize like all these

435
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,800
shows are written by weird by like weirdos who had like big old nerd

436
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,920
childhoods and they're writing what they wanted to have or like

437
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,120
didn't happen to them on vacations.

438
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,200
Yeah, I think the shows made me gave me the wrong idea.

439
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,120
Like that it would literally just be like a look at someone.

440
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,280
They would look at me and then they go, oh, OK, great.

441
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,520
Now we're in love.

442
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,560
And really, I would bypass the need to like

443
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,880
I would have to show my personality at all.

444
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,640
Like I would have to demonstrate I wasn't a crazy person.

445
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,400
Like all that stuff felt like, you know, basic stuff.

446
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,200
But maybe because I watched these shows and they made stuff like that,

447
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,480
seems simple.

448
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,840
It warped my brain and kept me

449
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,320
not having kissed a girl for extra a few years there.

450
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,440
A little more than the average.

451
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,840
Yeah, a little bit more. Yeah.

452
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,080
It might be true across the board.

453
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,800
To the requirements and structure of like we have to get this done

454
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,480
in a certain number of shooting days and also like it has to be two

455
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,320
or three acts or whatever.

456
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,960
Yeah. Influence the way you thought about love.

457
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,160
Yeah. Oh, we all did.

458
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,280
Yeah, yeah. Just you.

459
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:47,720
I don't mean to put it on you to stay on full house for a little bit.

460
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:51,400
Yeah. So that's kind of the kind of the biggest story, I guess,

461
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:55,640
is Michelle becoming princess for the day, because now she truly does have

462
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:00,360
royal reign over specifically the Magic Kingdom, mostly.

463
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,040
Although I guess they go to other places.

464
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,080
One thing that I like is the way

465
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:12,240
characters are around all the time, like Disney suited characters

466
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,440
and face characters like Snow White.

467
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,200
You know, they're pushing the Grand Floridian in this one.

468
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,560
That's where the tanners stay.

469
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:26,160
And just like as the show goes on, Snow White follows them back to the hotel.

470
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,880
Like she leaves the gates of the the Magic Kingdom.

471
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:34,360
That's how she in general is like kind of solving the family crises

472
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,840
and getting real mixed up in their interpersonal politics.

473
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:41,400
Besides that, people are just like having little sidebars

474
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:47,000
with the characters, Chip and Dale are roasting, roasting on Becky.

475
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,920
And yeah, being very rude in the wake of her being ghosted by by her.

476
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,960
Jesse. Yeah, that's not fair.

477
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,400
What would they be saying about her now? For God's sake.

478
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:04,400
Yeah, but she's turned to a life of white collar crime. Yeah.

479
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,040
What would pantomime insults would they have today?

480
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,680
Yeah. Anyway, this is another like way that these shows

481
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,760
incorrectly calibrated my expectations, where I thought that you

482
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,600
you go to Disney World and you become friends with the characters.

483
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,520
They hang out with you.

484
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,720
They follow you around.

485
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,240
If you're bringing some personal strife to the parks, they're helping you solve it.

486
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,600
Yeah, no, that is what struck me here.

487
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,400
And I do think that gave me unrealistic expectations.

488
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,600
We've talked many times on the show.

489
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,520
I think I think I think my initial expectation was that Goofy

490
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:41,080
would just be working there, that the characters were so much more active

491
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:44,200
at the park, I guess, in my way, doing like manual labor.

492
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,440
But this is a different version of it where they're just very engaged

493
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,640
and they have like free rein to go anywhere.

494
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,240
So it is a little bit.

495
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:58,160
It is a it is a little bit more fun to see kind of what I maybe expected.

496
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,000
By rewatching all this stuff.

497
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,640
Characters more involved in your personal like.

498
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,840
I want them involved in my personal life.

499
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,160
I want them all to know what's going on with me personally.

500
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:14,440
Well, it's you know, you recently engaged, Mike, and it's like it's a bummer.

501
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,680
I just, you know, I know the timeline and I know that you weren't

502
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,800
going to the parks a lot in the lead up to this because it was pandemic.

503
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,520
And I'd like to think that you like took a trip to Disney World,

504
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,280
wanted to ask Lindsey, couldn't find the right moment.

505
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,760
We're side barring with Captain Hook and

506
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,600
I take her about.

507
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

508
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,120
Of course. Yeah.

509
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:42,120
And all all ways of love, you want Peter Pan's thoughts on it.

510
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,480
But then ultimately culminating in an extremely ornate

511
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:52,080
fireworks display like the most complicated fireworks display in history.

512
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,320
Well, I reunited my band second level from high school

513
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:59,200
in front of Disneyland's Castle, and I played the song

514
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,080
I played in high school called Rock the House.

515
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,920
Yeah, you know about second level.

516
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,960
I've heard. Yeah.

517
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,720
Yes. And I've heard it mentioned.

518
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,040
I've heard the song mentioned specifically, and I feel like you've

519
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,840
sung the chorus maybe before.

520
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,040
Has it has it? Have we heard have you played it yet?

521
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,800
Has it been circulated or?

522
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:18,000
I haven't played the original recording of it, but I played a little bit of it

523
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,240
on guitar. It wasn't a very good re it wasn't great.

524
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,240
Didn't sound. Yeah, we made you play it.

525
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,800
Yeah. Yeah.

526
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,480
But there's also a live performance from a variety show, too, in high school.

527
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,080
Oh, wow. That's great.

528
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,600
And I want to say congratulations again on all the rock the house stuff.

529
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,960
Oh, yeah. Thank you. Yeah.

530
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,200
It was it was a big

531
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,040
the audience loved it at the time, I'll say that.

532
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,800
I'm sure it sounds awesome.

533
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,720
Yeah, yeah.

534
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,400
How much mileage like this is like a year of your life

535
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:51,240
where you get where you're getting mileage out of rock the house or how how

536
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,600
how long was this a hit for?

537
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,480
It's a good question.

538
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,200
I was probably there's probably a period in like two.

539
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,720
There's probably a couple of months there in 2001.

540
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,480
And then it was like sort of dormant.

541
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,680
And ever since I brought it back up on the podcast now,

542
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,640
I'm getting a little more again. Oh, sure, sure.

543
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,920
So it's been a 20 year gap.

544
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:12,120
It's beautiful. That's like a song like an album kind of bombing.

545
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,200
And then you're discovering that it has a big following in Japan or something,

546
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,680
which happened to Jesse and the Rippers, by the way.

547
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:21,760
Yeah. Rock the house gave you the confidence to do well on the SATs.

548
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,480
And then it came back around, gave you the confidence to get engaged.

549
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,320
Right.

550
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,320
So it was rock the house that did it.

551
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,840
Well, it's rock the house that did it.

552
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,000
But help.

553
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,360
I got help from Peter Pan and Hook and everybody.

554
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,160
Yeah. Anyway, I mean, that's the way I think they can sort of,

555
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,560
you know, make a richer, like more interactive,

556
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,720
augmented reality kind of experience is that the characters are around

557
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,000
giving you advice and stuff.

558
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,240
Yeah, that's a yeah.

559
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,160
Bob Chapek should really work, get focused on that with Disney Genie, at least.

560
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,400
Yeah. Yeah.

561
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,120
Just have your phone, like listen to all your phone calls and read

562
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,920
all your texts for a while. Right.

563
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,360
So that when you get there,

564
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,920
Pinocchio is really versed in what's up with you.

565
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,240
Yeah. Yeah. Setting you the very least.

566
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,600
Genie's Jack Nicholson impression has some advice about how to deal

567
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,880
with your family when you open your phone.

568
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,920
You know, trouble your mom again.

569
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:21,960
You know, the shows, since you mentioned dealing with your families,

570
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:27,640
these shows do present one way that I often am a big proponent

571
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:31,560
of on these kinds of vacations, which is like split up sometimes

572
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,000
and everyone do their own thing.

573
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,920
Although these shows really hit the because they need to do

574
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:40,320
ABC stories like multiple stories.

575
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,440
I mean, they really split up a lot.

576
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,600
Like you think Danny would want to do some of this stuff with his children.

577
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,760
We want to see this smiles on their faces.

578
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:55,120
Oh, yeah. And it even occurred to me that, you know, when he he gets a

579
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:01,240
so he's having a romantic meal at the Coral Reef restaurant,

580
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,240
which gets ruined.

581
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:07,520
He's trying to do a wedding proposal, gets ruined by Jesse and Joey

582
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,840
trying to go do their the first underwater radio broadcast ever

583
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,040
with the Rush Hour Renegades.

584
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,240
But then he then it gets interrupted again

585
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,640
because he gets an urgent phone call saying that his daughter is missing.

586
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:24,320
And I realize when that happened, he's he hasn't been around for any of it.

587
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,160
He's not even aware that Michelle is Princess for the day.

588
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,960
Like his daughter has taken part in an unprecedented

589
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,000
Disney World program never to be done again.

590
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,160
And he did. He missed it 100 percent.

591
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,760
Yeah, that is shockingly negligent.

592
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,400
And I understand he has something else on his mind,

593
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,800
but that also seems way out of character for him in general on the show.

594
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,480
He's very micromanaging. Yes.

595
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,440
So how does he let entire children's stories get away from them?

596
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,440
I mean, let's be honest, if this was I mean, I've seen there's some YouTube

597
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,440
videos reviewing like Full House Disney World episode now.

598
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,720
But if this were like YouTube era and in the time that this came out,

599
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,880
there would be so many like cinema, cinema sins or honest, whatever's

600
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:14,000
about like what the problems and the inconsistencies are on these shows.

601
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,560
Like there would be like, what do you think?

602
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,800
This is not how Danny would act.

603
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,480
Are you kidding me?

604
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,640
There would be like the the Red Letter Media

605
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,960
90 minute to our like Star Wars prequel reviews of these

606
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,600
just to show the inconsistencies in the characters.

607
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,680
Is that is that what those

608
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,840
outlets do, because I see those phrases every now and then.

609
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,960
And I was like, what is what are you talking about?

610
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,360
I don't know what these are.

611
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:43,560
It's always people are mad that things aren't honest, that trailers aren't honest.

612
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,200
And if like, yeah, if if this

613
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,400
news report or episode of a show were honest,

614
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:55,400
I thank these YouTubers for taking media to task about honesty.

615
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,720
Yeah. OK, OK, got it.

616
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,360
So there's yeah, if it's an honest portrayal of Danny Tanner's,

617
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:07,120
you know, character, he would actually have seen some of Michelle's reign.

618
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,360
Yeah, and he never would have done this.

619
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,880
They've completely betrayed the Danny Tanner character.

620
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,440
Oh, OK.

621
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,400
So you just throw aside suspending disbelief.

622
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,920
OK, got it. Thank you. Yeah.

623
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,160
One of the other side plots, I don't think we've mentioned yet is a DJ.

624
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,600
Candice Cameron's character is DJ.

625
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,680
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

626
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:32,640
She is constantly seeing her boyfriend, Steve, everywhere.

627
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,320
Yeah, she's hallucinating. Yeah.

628
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,280
Hallucinating. And then he does show up.

629
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,000
But one of the early hallucinations, she imagines him on the float

630
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,360
dressed as Aladdin, which is an inside baseball joke

631
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,040
because he is the voice of Aladdin, that actor.

632
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,320
Yep. Yeah.

633
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,240
Scott Wanger.

634
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:54,160
This is the type of little fact as a little boy that made me feel so smart.

635
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:58,000
I was so self-satisfied by knowing this

636
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:02,760
and like just a little chuckle, like the most obnoxious, like nine year old.

637
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,960
Like, I know what this is.

638
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,760
There's a lot of kids watching this,

639
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,800
but not all of them are privy to this information.

640
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,040
Like, yeah, I was exactly the same way.

641
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:13,960
Snooty kid.

642
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:17,720
I also I remember thinking that because at that time,

643
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:21,880
Scott Wanger, pretty big part, like pretty major scene

644
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,160
stealer on Full House in this era.

645
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,680
Also, the voice of Aladdin, the biggest kids movie at the time.

646
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:34,520
Didn't you think that Scott Wanger was going to be like a Chris Pratt level

647
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,080
star for the rest of your life?

648
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:40,680
Like based on that beginning, based on 93,

649
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:44,680
I thought we'd be like just knee deep and winger our whole lives.

650
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,280
I agree. Yeah. Charming, handsome.

651
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,160
I don't know. I don't want to put it.

652
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,560
I mean, he's worked. He works.

653
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:55,160
But yeah, yeah, as a kid, like this was like this was a big star to me.

654
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,840
I was going to say at a very basic level, just thinking about these episodes.

655
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,600
I don't know if we're going to touch upon it, but like

656
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,200
the way we're used to Full House presented, like as a multi cam,

657
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,560
we're now seeing like a totally different version of it.

658
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,320
And like, I guess, single cam, I imagine.

659
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,400
But there's something that's allowed in in these episodes

660
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,000
that I feel like you don't get in the typical episodes of Full House, which is like

661
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,680
there's all of a sudden like space for ad lib at like the beginning

662
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,960
and ending of scenes sometimes.

663
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,320
So like you'll get the sort of like, yeah, then we'll go on a haunted mansion.

664
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,000
And then, oh, and then like they'll do their real line.

665
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,880
I don't know if you caught any of these moments, but there are a handful of them

666
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,640
in all the three episodes we watched.

667
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:43,200
But there's just something so disorienting about seeing the show

668
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:47,520
look different than what you've you've come to expect.

669
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,880
Sort of like Scott, remember the the Saved by the Bell,

670
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,960
the wedding, the one where like Zach and Kelly get married.

671
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,200
It's like all of a sudden they've neglected the way we've like

672
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,360
seen the show presented and it feels alien.

673
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,760
The whole the whole thing feels alien to some degree to me.

674
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,120
I don't know if you all felt that.

675
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,280
It's weird. It's them out of their elements.

676
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,200
Yeah, you're totally right.

677
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,840
Like, yeah, rhythms are different.

678
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,360
They give characters stuff.

679
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,080
Now, I don't think I have it written down.

680
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:24,440
Whatever DJ and Kimi say when they're coming down the stairs in the Grand Floridian.

681
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:27,760
I posted an Instagram of this like truly like years ago.

682
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,360
But yeah, it's like then we'll go.

683
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:33,680
But it's some ad lib about like roller coasters.

684
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:37,360
And then, yeah, they spot Steve like checking in the hotel.

685
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,680
Like, oh, yeah, so scary.

686
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,160
Yeah, that's pretty much what it is.

687
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,160
And then it was going up so high and I didn't think we could make it.

688
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,720
I oh, look, yeah, staged interruption.

689
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,440
That was really fun.

690
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,800
I like Splash Mountain with the like the.

691
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,800
That was a lot of fun.

692
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,680
I thought it was really cool, too.

693
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,040
Oh, my gosh.

694
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,440
I must be really losing it.

695
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,680
Yeah, just out of just out of the tone is so weird.

696
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,480
I step by step is the one that felt the weirdest to me.

697
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,800
This feels like a weird handheld verite

698
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,360
step by step going on.

699
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,920
And that's like, I don't know what to like.

700
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,280
This doesn't. And I was never a big step by step watcher, but I was like,

701
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,320
this really felt kind of unnerving.

702
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,400
What's that one?

703
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,560
I mean, you know, I think we could jump around.

704
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,600
There's yeah, there's the one scene in.

705
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,400
They're in the hotel room.

706
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,520
It's when the the the country group has been formed.

707
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:32,440
They rehearse once briefly and then break up immediately.

708
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,680
That scene, the audio is so wretched.

709
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:39,200
It's really weird, which you never see on a sitcom of this nature.

710
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,680
For any criticism you might have of it, they're always

711
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,360
very solidly made.

712
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,080
They're always extremely clean.

713
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,480
So, yeah, it's weird to hear.

714
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:51,600
Yeah. What is also probably a very when Stefan is transformed

715
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,960
back to Oracle at the ending of the Family Matters saga,

716
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:01,240
there is so much coat rub on the lav mic consistently for like

717
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:05,200
a handful of lines that it's pretty awesome.

718
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,760
Like, I didn't know if like I was getting some HBO Max

719
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,360
special edition of the episode, like unaltered.

720
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,960
I was like, this couldn't have aired.

721
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,400
Maybe, though, they didn't know this was uncharted territory for all these shows.

722
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,640
They didn't travel. They didn't know how to do this.

723
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,160
It does feel like in the old days, you know, you watch movies,

724
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,680
not even that old movies sometimes.

725
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,800
And you go, oh, this whole scene seems like it's 80 yard,

726
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,800
which means that they had to redo like the sound.

727
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,440
I mean, they always redo sound effects, but they read the dialogue

728
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,120
and you can see it's like doesn't quite match the mouths.

729
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,480
That was an option to do here.

730
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,000
And they said, you know what? Fuck it. Yeah.

731
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,160
Who gives? No kids doesn't give them good shit.

732
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,880
Yeah, that is weird. It isn't super 80 yard.

733
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,120
Yeah, for sure. Yeah.

734
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,960
Was there just too much

735
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,480
in inventions like actual

736
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,240
attraction noise in the background for them to have like a backup boom

737
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,360
mic recording the dialogue?

738
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,840
It's just too many say, no, we tried.

739
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:06,520
We did have that audio track for everyone talking on a boom,

740
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:10,440
but there was too much Sega Genesis click clacking in the background.

741
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,360
Let us close the Sonic games now.

742
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,400
Yeah, we could not close the vector man displays.

743
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:20,320
Kidding. I guess we're going to if we're going to move from Full House,

744
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:24,400
the only thing I want to mention that I had fully forgotten and is special

745
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:30,200
is the is Joey at the animation studios and seeing the boy

746
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:34,200
animated Joey come to life, which is who's doing the voice

747
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,000
for the cartoon Joe because

748
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,400
Joey does voices, but it doesn't sound like him. Am I wrong?

749
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,040
Is it? I think it might be him.

750
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,000
OK, OK. It's just a it's odd.

751
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,360
Choice. He's definitely like suddenly he's

752
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,960
super Brooklyny out of nowhere.

753
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,800
He's a little like Brooklyn Pipsqueak kid who.

754
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,720
Yeah, just to set the scene, you know, they used to have the animation tour

755
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:05,520
at Disney, MGM Studios and kind of without explanation,

756
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,720
Joey is just like walking and talking on the floor

757
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,920
with an animator who he's like good friends with.

758
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,960
Seemingly, I think it's one of the major ones. His name is Mark.

759
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:18,400
I think that's Mark Finn who did Jasmine.

760
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,920
But don't quote me on that.

761
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,840
Mark Henney is what I read. Oh, that's that might be right.

762
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,080
Yeah, that sounds right.

763
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:28,280
Anyways, he offers him some coffee.

764
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,640
Joey asked if he could get some crazy cartoon stuff.

765
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:34,120
The guy says, I think coffee will do.

766
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,720
And then he's left alone to start doodling.

767
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,840
He draws a cartoon version of himself, which comes to life,

768
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:44,440
is drawn in like simple pencil drawn form.

769
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:48,360
And then you get the hijinks of Joey, like adding new parts to him

770
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,800
and embedding and squishing and squashing.

771
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,520
It's yeah. And this is a show

772
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,040
that doesn't full house doesn't have magic otherwise.

773
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,640
Doesn't get surreal. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

774
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,360
No, no, it's maybe the first time ever.

775
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:07,000
So to see some Disney magic sprinkled into full house is a lot of fun.

776
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:11,960
And that specific stuff that he's that a cartoon,

777
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:17,360
Joey is saying like, hey, down here, you're you're new at this, right?

778
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,240
Now that you mention it, could you draw me a couple of aspirin?

779
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,640
I didn't catch that.

780
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,200
I had not to reference the thing that people have not seen yet,

781
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,280
but I was certainly it's it's very little Bruce, is it not?

782
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,760
Sure, sure, sure. Yeah.

783
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,880
A tease for the show.

784
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,640
I kind of wish in hindsight, they could have just taken this little character

785
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,760
and just made him like Joey's great

786
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:45,920
Gazoo going forward, where he was like a character over Joey's shoulder.

787
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,040
The rest of the like the rest of the episodes are running.

788
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:51,360
You know, it's remembering and I don't know.

789
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:56,040
I feel like Scott, we might have brought this up when we were working on

790
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,120
the show Saturday, Saturday morning.

791
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:02,520
All started. Sorry to plug the full title, but these straight to video

792
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:06,000
cassettes McGee and me, do you do you all are you aware of those?

793
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,920
I don't know those there.

794
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,280
They're Christian, as I recall.

795
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:15,280
And it's it's a similar set up, I believe, where like it's a cartoon character

796
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,080
who's like maybe first drawn and then pops out of the page

797
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,240
and becomes like this kid's best friend.

798
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,800
But the characteristics match this Joey thing.

799
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,960
So could be something to do a side by side if anybody has any time.

800
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,920
I don't know. I'm just just coming to me right now.

801
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:29,840
Sure. Yeah.

802
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:33,680
Paracontrast of young Joey, your cartoon, Joey and McGee and me. Yeah.

803
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:38,440
I totally agree, though, that, yeah, there's like

804
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,560
because he doesn't have a kid of his own and I think he continues to not

805
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,040
on Fuller House.

806
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:51,040
So if he if his child essentially is the little Joey that he drew one day

807
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:56,000
and he cares for and he stays that age always, he never grows up

808
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,080
like other kids, like just like Joey himself never grows up.

809
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,480
Well, with this cartoon voices and all.

810
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,000
I think they can.

811
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,240
The little guy can feud with the puppet.

812
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,400
You know, Mr. Woodchuck.

813
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,760
Yeah. Oh, the Woodchuck puppet. Yeah, sure. Yeah.

814
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,240
What was his name? Who was the who was the Woodchuck?

815
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,200
Mr. Was it Mr. Woodchuck?

816
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,080
It was just Mr. Woodchuck. Oh, yeah, I think so.

817
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,840
Woodchuck. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. OK.

818
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:19,440
Yeah. Ranger Joe and Mr. Woodchuck.

819
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,720
And then, of course, there is the jackalope on America's Funniest People.

820
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,480
Well, that's a whole other.

821
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,560
No, no, no, no, no, that's this.

822
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,400
I was.

823
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,280
Recording out of order, I'll I'll.

824
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,600
Confusingly, the episode will come up before this.

825
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,960
I'm planning on bringing up the jackalope.

826
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,920
I hadn't thought about the jackal. Oh, wow.

827
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,720
You're the jackal. It was weird, right?

828
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:47,160
That's a this is this other Dave Coulier show that was kind of his

829
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,200
America's Funniest Home videos.

830
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:49,960
Erin called it out.

831
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,280
She's like, this is basically this is like they're trying to do

832
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,640
Caddyshack and the gopher. Oh, yeah.

833
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:59,160
I've not watched a jackalope segment in probably two decades.

834
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,720
So I'll have to.

835
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,160
I'll have to get on that.

836
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,920
Forest animal terrorizing.

837
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,720
This show was strange.

838
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,320
This is a show that aired for three seasons and yet no one recalls.

839
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,200
Do you remember the America's Funniest People?

840
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,480
Funniest people. Yeah.

841
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,240
It would be on Sunday nights with America's Funniest Home.

842
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,600
And it was Dave Coulier and Tawny Cattain.

843
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:21,720
Yeah, correct.

844
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:22,920
You know, we're taking care of it now.

845
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:26,240
We can just maybe we don't have to do it a week ago.

846
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,560
I'm so confused by the time we'll do it anyway.

847
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,200
All right. Apologies for more America's.

848
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:35,040
I was I was just, you know, the jackalope's back in my life

849
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,800
and I'm happy to be talking about him again.

850
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,000
Full house. Real quick, I'll just say this is going back to the

851
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,600
Jesse and the Rippers thing real quick.

852
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:47,040
Like and this is no put down of what I'll say that they should be doing,

853
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,600
but Jesse and the Rippers should be playing at like the stage outside of Earl of Sandwich.

854
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,280
That would have been a much more realistic place.

855
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,800
And again, I'm not putting I've just great bands that play there.

856
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,640
But that would have been more realistic for him going to Becky.

857
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:59,960
Like we have a great gig.

858
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,440
We're paying we're playing seven times a night

859
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:06,400
out by the Earl of Sandwich in downtown Disney.

860
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,520
That is where cover bands actually play.

861
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,520
Right. 20 minute sets.

862
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,760
And that's what they should have had.

863
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:16,320
The whole climax of the episode happened there, not in front of the castle.

864
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:20,360
But that concert is like unbelievable, right?

865
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:24,880
I mean, with the white piano, like it it has the vibe of like

866
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:28,320
like a it's a it's a live aid or like a, you know,

867
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:32,240
one of the last Freddie Mercury concerts or something like this is like

868
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:36,400
this is an unbelievable show that they're putting on that culminates in fireworks.

869
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,000
I really love that little like mumbled

870
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,040
this is this is a song for all the dreamers out there.

871
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:43,960
Or he does.

872
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,400
But it's not when you wish upon a star.

873
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,320
It's a dream is a wish your heart makes.

874
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,080
Yeah, right. Right.

875
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:51,360
A very breathy version of a dream.

876
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,480
You're a wish your heart is.

877
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,800
Jesse's hot.

878
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,160
He's so sexy.

879
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,720
He has to he can't.

880
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:00,800
There's no way to do a not sultry version of something.

881
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,240
No, he uses sultriness.

882
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,920
And again, that fireworks display,

883
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,640
that is like, how does it work?

884
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:13,280
Like so again, like Danny Tanner has been trying to propose

885
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,040
to his fiance at all time, struggling to find a way.

886
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:19,000
And it seemingly within the course of several hours

887
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:23,080
communicates with the Disney company and allows for the

888
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:25,800
creation of like the most complex

889
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:30,680
block of firework text ever made that isn't flashing on and off.

890
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:35,280
It like appears once, but it's not attached to wires or a framework or anything.

891
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,800
It's just the floating words.

892
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,560
Vicky, will you marry me?

893
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:42,440
That just stay in the sky unbroken for seven seconds or so.

894
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:45,080
Yeah, I do think this and I think I'm being serious.

895
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:48,720
I do think this made me think you could do this in real life.

896
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:52,400
And yet you didn't do it for your own marriage proposal.

897
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:55,680
Well, I inquired inquired.

898
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,600
And such an iconic just the setup of the guy

899
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:02,880
constantly trying to to ask the question and get interrupted.

900
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,520
I feel like we need a supercut of the like, would you

901
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,080
like to go clogging with it?

902
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:14,360
I don't know what I don't know what happens

903
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,320
in the German area, but

904
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:21,640
it's pretty it's actually pretty infuriating that he can't just say it.

905
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,280
Yeah, yeah.

906
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:27,000
By context clues, she should understand like it's an important question

907
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,400
that he's tried several times to ask.

908
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,880
I was impressed by her performance,

909
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:35,280
because I didn't recall how this concluded.

910
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:38,160
And she kind of plays it like can go either way for a second.

911
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:41,160
I think she played the drama of that scene very well.

912
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,040
So congrats.

913
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,120
Do we know that actor's name offhand who played?

914
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,440
I don't know. I don't know.

915
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,040
I don't know. Offhand.

916
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:52,280
And I always felt bad that it didn't work out like I was rooting for him.

917
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,840
I liked Vicky a lot.

918
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:57,800
And it kind of deflates this whole episode to know that it didn't.

919
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,240
Yes, it does.

920
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:03,160
And that he spent all that money, you know, getting close to six figures,

921
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,640
I would think, to make that display.

922
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,840
And he didn't get a bride out of it.

923
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,920
And all those itineraries he made, there was a line earlier

924
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,120
where he made everyone itinerary.

925
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,080
That wasn't cool.

926
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,840
Everybody threw away the itineraries immediately.

927
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,520
Yeah, they wanted to do their own thing.

928
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:21,680
Now, granted, most of the adults are wearing business casuals.

929
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,800
So like they're not going to go to nuts that day. Yeah.

930
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,520
Joey's wardrobe in that, by the way, very bizarre.

931
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:34,040
It's like, oh, yeah, collared shirt with wacky pattern,

932
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:37,600
but then blazer and shorts shorts shorts.

933
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:38,800
Yeah. Yeah.

934
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,640
Sport coat and shorts, which is really I mean, I didn't even pick up

935
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:47,120
on that outfit until his kind of emotional sit down with Stephanie,

936
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:50,800
where he's like hyper serious in that it's like

937
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,160
he's like a clown that's trying to dress up essentially.

938
00:50:56,040 --> 00:51:00,680
Yeah, like a real it's it's very sincere as and then just whenever it cuts

939
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:05,360
to the two shot, just like big old man leg up on that bench.

940
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,440
When we were talking about like how this

941
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:14,400
the sensibility of these TGIF shows influenced my work, our work, whatever.

942
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,600
Like, I don't even know what I how I can articulate what this is

943
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:22,760
or what this type of joke is or why it resonates with me.

944
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:25,600
But the in the midst of

945
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:30,760
a moment when DJ claims to see Steve and

946
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:33,800
he's not actually there.

947
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:37,520
I believe Stephanie says something to the effect of like up next,

948
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,480
women who hallucinate and theme parks on the next Oprah.

949
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:45,240
I don't know why.

950
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:48,360
I guess I just like that it's like this feels like it's like

951
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:51,000
a daring joke for them to some degree. You know what I mean?

952
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,560
They're like making a comment on TV culture.

953
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:58,160
It's like contemporary and hip to some degree, even though I don't know

954
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:02,320
that like Oprah is necessarily known for that, like kind of Maury Povich,

955
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:06,520
Jerry Springer style, like.

956
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:10,320
You know that she would bring that up, like that would be a subject of an episode,

957
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,840
but maybe it was in like 1993.

958
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:17,160
But I guess these are these kids are like cool and clever

959
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:20,880
and versed in television and they're able to to like

960
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:26,080
riff to and reference to like a Dennis Miller degree,

961
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:28,160
even though they're only 16.

962
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,720
That's how TV brained.

963
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:33,840
You're right. And I love and I can't in step in the step by step episode.

964
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:38,280
And I can't even think of the references that are that are are are thrown out

965
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,480
there, even though I might have my notes.

966
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,560
But this mix of one thing that I've always been obsessed with, like

967
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,720
I want to say Flash when we get to I mean, I'm very excited to talk about Flash.

968
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:50,360
Oh, yes. Yeah.

969
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:52,800
But I really episode Flash is making some

970
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:57,280
he's making some reference about like what is America because he wants to win,

971
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:02,400
set this regain the record for America anyway.

972
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:07,600
He's like Americans like our mom, Americans like the but master,

973
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,920
which is as I saw it is like clearly an analog

974
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:17,640
for the thigh master, which Suzanne Summers was a

975
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,680
spokesperson for. Yeah.

976
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,240
And this is what I like.

977
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:27,880
Why is it that Oprah exists, but the thigh master doesn't?

978
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:31,280
And this is something that I that I picked up on, say, by the bell as a child.

979
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:35,280
Like in on these shows that I I really am obsessed with.

980
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:39,240
Like when do we get to choose the real thing and when not?

981
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:40,720
You know what I mean?

982
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:44,680
The inconsistency of what exists and what doesn't exist in this world.

983
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,600
I mean, you're your your favorite one.

984
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:50,760
I have to pimp you out to say the the band on Saved by the Bell.

985
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,040
That's the greatest.

986
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:56,880
Yes. On on I think it's what is the Zack attack episode when

987
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:01,520
they have a band, the band is playing in the garage.

988
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:07,680
The manager of the Beach Buddies runs past them,

989
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,800
hears them playing and essentially like says he wants to, you know,

990
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,400
I don't know, sign, give them a record contract or everybody's like,

991
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:18,120
they're like, oh, you're you manage the Beach Buddies.

992
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,040
He's like, oh, yeah, but the Beach Buddies aren't buddies anymore.

993
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:25,160
But the point, but the thing is, like

994
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:27,960
the Beach Boys have been referenced in this universe,

995
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:33,000
and yet they're kind of presenting the Beach Buddies as the Beach Boys.

996
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:38,000
It's like in another show that thought about any of this would go,

997
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:41,360
well, do we have a Madonna or not?

998
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,680
Or do we have to make up a Madonna equivalent?

999
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:48,240
Like they make these choices, but these shows are done so slapdash that like,

1000
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,360
does it matter? We've already mentioned the Beach Boys.

1001
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,960
No, there can be the Beach Buddies.

1002
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:55,360
So and we can make a joke about how they aren't buddies.

1003
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:59,640
We can make a joke playing on their name that we made up.

1004
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:04,760
We're subverting a thing that doesn't exist.

1005
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:09,840
Yes, no one cared at a certain time, you know, but now

1006
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:14,000
there's a line in Step by Step where it's like, oh, if this was made now,

1007
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,880
there'd be so many minders on set because one of the characters go like,

1008
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,360
we should go check out the haunted house.

1009
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:22,360
And like, you know, if that was shot now,

1010
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:25,480
there would be a Disney rep going like, you need her to say that line again

1011
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:27,600
so she can say Haunted Mansion properly. Thank you so much.

1012
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:31,200
I yeah, there's another one that's about like the jungle boat ride.

1013
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,600
This is never happening today.

1014
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:37,520
I we're asking what are second gates that we should do.

1015
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:41,360
And loud and clear one that was said was Disney fairy tale weddings,

1016
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:43,760
the wedding show that's available on Disney+.

1017
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,760
So I was I was prepping for this one in advance.

1018
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,920
I was starting to watch some of the and there's a couple

1019
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,840
that is the first couple ever to get married in Pandora.

1020
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,840
And so this is a Pandoran wedding.

1021
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:57,920
But I go to CIVACO indeed.

1022
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:02,640
But they it's just funny hearing this couple, these very like regular

1023
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,880
people have to say, and we are so excited to be the first couple

1024
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,440
to get married in Pandora, the world of Avatar.

1025
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:13,280
When no one even the biggest, the biggest Pandora fan.

1026
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:18,120
By that, I mean, Mike is not regularly saying Pandora, the world of Avatar.

1027
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:20,640
No, but I will from now on if that's what they want me to.

1028
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:22,560
Sure, make sure you do.

1029
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,000
I'll call you on it if you don't say it.

1030
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,600
Can I maybe I miss under misheard, but I just just did a double check.

1031
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:30,840
Suzanne Summers had the Thighmaster and the Buttmaster.

1032
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,280
They were both. Oh, OK.

1033
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:36,000
So I was misinformed. OK, so the Buttmaster is a real thing.

1034
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:38,960
Yeah, I'm looking at it right now because I it's weird to bring it up

1035
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,920
because it's less OK. Yeah, there you have it.

1036
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:45,400
OK, yeah, I fully I feel bad about that.

1037
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,080
I'm sorry. I didn't sound it.

1038
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:49,160
This isn't gotcha journalism on my part.

1039
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:51,640
I just I was just trying to remember what it was.

1040
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,200
But it does sound like a fan.

1041
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,760
And your point still stands that this was happening all the time

1042
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,320
where it was like, why not just say that?

1043
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:01,480
No, you know, Mike, no, it doesn't stand.

1044
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,240
Yeah, did I feel bad?

1045
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,920
Oh, man, I shouldn't have told you about the.

1046
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,560
So sorry. No, I know.

1047
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:14,840
You're right. The Buttmaster does sound it does sound like a 90s joke, like.

1048
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:16,440
Right. For sure. That's right.

1049
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,520
And it's less famous than the Thighmaster.

1050
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:21,480
So they shouldn't have said something that wasn't going to read immediately.

1051
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:26,320
They can't count on everybody looking it up on on a website after the fact.

1052
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,600
Right. That was also love you sharing your screen, Mike,

1053
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:32,280
and then seeing your your previously on eBay,

1054
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:34,600
just that there were recently looked at turtles.

1055
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:38,200
Oh, yeah. And large turtles, too. Expensive. Oh, they're big.

1056
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:42,200
Yeah, they were one sixth or one quarter scale, actually, which is pretty big.

1057
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,760
She's yeah, that is unusually big.

1058
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:46,720
Bigger than my son.

1059
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:53,360
I just you can buy a third scale of the Joaquin Phoenix Joker, which is huge.

1060
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,680
You know, it looks exactly it looks so accurate.

1061
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,280
He's like a man.

1062
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:59,240
Like, why wouldn't you?

1063
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:01,360
I could see wanting that for, you know,

1064
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:06,360
Winnie the Pooh for something like cute or

1065
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:10,320
an animal. Why would you want a guy?

1066
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:14,200
You're asking a good question, but they obviously think there's a market for it.

1067
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:16,360
So it's you're considering that one.

1068
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,560
It's about a grand.

1069
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,400
You can buy it. Jesus.

1070
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:25,560
Well, it's a good thing to have if you want to like give anyone

1071
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:31,040
you're thinking about dating a major red flag as soon as they come in your apartment.

1072
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,280
That's a good point.

1073
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:37,520
There's one more of those little like sentence interrupters, Kyle, where you.

1074
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,160
OK, so one thing to mention,

1075
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:43,480
you watch the entire Indiana Jones stunt spectacular fold out like

1076
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:47,440
not the entire show, I guess, but the full boulder sequence happens

1077
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:48,880
over the course of five minutes.

1078
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,360
And that's another great thing about these episodes for these shows.

1079
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,200
We can kill a bunch of time.

1080
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,720
Let's just show all of Indiana Jones in the boulder.

1081
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:59,960
Let's show a big concert like we're going to burn through these two episodes

1082
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,280
in no time.

1083
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,920
In this case, DJ's hallucinations are continuing.

1084
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:10,600
She believes that she is seeing her boyfriend, Steve, as Indiana Jones.

1085
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:15,000
Then when the stunt happens and he gets run over by the boulder,

1086
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:18,320
and I'm sure I referenced this in our episode about this stunt show,

1087
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:23,080
the entire audience gasps because they buy the gag 100 percent.

1088
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:27,920
And DJ stands up and says, Steve, no silence.

1089
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:32,280
One believes you're actually here.

1090
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,960
Awesome. Love it.

1091
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:39,680
Love these. This this mechanism of.

1092
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:42,800
Try having to save the sentence.

1093
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:46,800
This is only in sitcoms and movies, but I think we should all.

1094
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:50,440
Yeah, I also caught how it was fascinating because, like, you're right,

1095
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:54,240
the stunt had concluded, essentially.

1096
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:58,800
He pops up and then you would expect the audience to applaud.

1097
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:02,640
She gets the Steve comment out,

1098
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:06,520
but there's still like an awkward silence until there's a sound cue

1099
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,120
that's like, do do do do.

1100
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:10,320
And then the audience applaud.

1101
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:15,080
I just don't believe that everybody is going to be fully silent for DJ

1102
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:18,680
to to question where Steve is to say that entire thing.

1103
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:22,240
I don't think that the show was timed out to have just like a six second.

1104
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,480
Like it is Indiana Jones dead

1105
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:28,520
where there is no music cue accompanying it.

1106
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,960
I'm sure you we all know.

1107
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:35,840
I mean, this almost exact sequence, it feels like,

1108
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:40,080
was repeated for step by step, like moment by moment.

1109
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:43,440
Yeah. Full thing again, entire.

1110
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,080
We got to go through the spikes.

1111
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:45,960
We got it.

1112
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:51,400
We I like that they play the tension of the trading out the idol

1113
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:54,040
for the bag of sand or whatever, like they do.

1114
01:00:54,320 --> 01:01:01,480
Indiana Jones is tension as if it's the character Flash or Steve's tension.

1115
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,960
But like it is like it's a fake stunt show.

1116
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:10,080
He doesn't need to make the trade out as much as Indiana Jones does.

1117
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:15,000
It was fun, though, seen like kind of from an an act early place,

1118
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,560
like kind of, you know, where kind of Steve and Flash's versions of Indy.

1119
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:22,520
I think they both both of theirs deserve merit.

1120
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,720
I might actually take Flash over, Steve, I hate to say it.

1121
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,520
Yeah, good. Flash is really good.

1122
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:30,640
Flash has a purpose.

1123
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:32,840
He has more of a reason for being there.

1124
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:34,000
He's got the energy.

1125
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,240
Flash is a little more energy as far as that performance, I guess, too.

1126
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:38,480
I love Flash so much.

1127
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,080
I think maybe we go out with Flash.

1128
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:42,320
I think maybe Flash concludes the episode.

1129
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:45,040
I think it's the peak of narrative content at Disney World.

1130
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:48,960
So let's let's shift over to Family Matters, the episode

1131
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:55,280
We're Going to Disney World, the two parter that began on April 28th, 1995.

1132
01:01:56,320 --> 01:02:00,240
Overall, this might be my favorite, and maybe this is just

1133
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:03,880
my love of Urkel that Mike has pointed out,

1134
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:06,160
poking through.

1135
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:08,920
I know. I think it's not only my love of Urkel.

1136
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:12,600
It's my love of Karl Winslow and Reginald Vel Johnson.

1137
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:17,800
I think Reginald Vel Johnson is the strongest performer on any of these shows.

1138
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:21,160
I think that's the reason why it's easier maybe to watch a Family Matters

1139
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:22,800
than some of these other shows.

1140
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:25,840
He's just so charming and fun.

1141
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,880
When he's happy or happy, when he's mad,

1142
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:30,800
you're scared.

1143
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:34,360
I love I'm just in for whatever Karl Winslow is going through.

1144
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:35,120
I completely agree.

1145
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:40,040
I wrote the note down that like Karl is also the most happy to be here

1146
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:44,040
of all the characters and all the episodes we watched as well, which is fun to see.

1147
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:45,720
Karl's the most excited.

1148
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:49,920
So it's like it is fun to like live through the Karl's enthusiasm.

1149
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:54,160
The actors playing his wife and mother are also very good.

1150
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:56,080
Like I rewatching it, I was like,

1151
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:58,040
Oh, the grandmother's really funny on this show.

1152
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,040
I forgot about that.

1153
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:03,880
Yes. Rosetta Lenoir, I believe, is so funny.

1154
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:08,000
And maybe another thing to say, but I think all of the way that I say

1155
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:13,000
that all of these episodes are the same, they all start with like a scene or two

1156
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,960
back in the regular set just to acquaint you.

1157
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:20,640
And there's you have to figure out how to get the characters to Disney World.

1158
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:23,880
Usually it starts with just two of them are going to do it.

1159
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:27,000
And then everybody gloms on or it's a good thing.

1160
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,080
Wherever that where I'm inviting everybody in this case,

1161
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:34,840
the impetus is that Urkel has been invited to participate

1162
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:38,120
in an inventor competition at Epcot Center.

1163
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:43,160
And he is inviting everybody in that not his family to go with him.

1164
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:46,720
Well, he's inviting all of his neighbors, but not his girlfriend.

1165
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:50,840
Right. Oh, yeah. Wait, my.

1166
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:52,440
Yeah, why isn't Myra?

1167
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:54,040
And that is strange.

1168
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:59,200
That was I mean, like how how many plus ones does one get in that one of these

1169
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,160
in in innoventions contest?

1170
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:04,240
Because that's how many people that was like seven, eight.

1171
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,160
I don't even know how many.

1172
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:09,120
It's it's not like the Oscars where you maybe only get a date.

1173
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:12,120
It's more like the Miss America pageant

1174
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:16,160
where you want to bring an entire fan section for yourself.

1175
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:17,680
Mm hmm.

1176
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:21,160
This is like Rock and Roll Hall of Fame where you get like a table,

1177
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:23,480
but you have to pay for the table, maybe.

1178
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:26,120
Oh, yeah. Those guys, they're mad every year.

1179
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:28,800
Steve Miller took him to task. That's right.

1180
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:32,200
This isn't the Rock Hall podcast.

1181
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:33,760
Yeah, sorry, sorry.

1182
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,720
No, I would just start doing the Rock Hall.

1183
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:41,240
Yeah, everybody's excited, except for Carl,

1184
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:47,560
who is too addicted to his police work to cut off and relax for a little bit.

1185
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:51,480
And then his mom tells a very sad story

1186
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:56,640
about how on his deathbed, Carl's dad,

1187
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:03,360
he his last words were, I never got to take little Carl to Disney World.

1188
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:06,400
And then he died.

1189
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:11,120
And that is moving enough that Carl realizes that he needs to do

1190
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:14,200
the family trip to put work to the side.

1191
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:18,760
And then she, the mom quietly admits that that was a made up story

1192
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:21,000
and that that never happened. That rascal.

1193
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,600
In addition to the Inventors contest,

1194
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:27,320
the justification for getting them to Disney World in this show

1195
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:30,520
involves lying about a dying man's last words.

1196
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:34,040
So, Brad, it's a pretty funny dark joke.

1197
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:37,800
Like they say, like he died years before Disney World opened.

1198
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:40,880
Oh, yeah. Oh, I love that flippant way that like he died

1199
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,480
way before that place was ever built.

1200
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:47,600
There is so much lying going on on all these shows, like week to week.

1201
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:52,480
The amount of lies characters tell each other and not little stuff, big stuff.

1202
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:56,200
Weekly is always impressive to me going back to watch.

1203
01:05:56,840 --> 01:06:00,480
That's true. That's kind of the that is sort of the like central mechanism

1204
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:03,440
of a lot of sitcoms is people like keeping up ruses.

1205
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:05,600
Huge thinking that they can't. Yeah.

1206
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:10,680
Yeah. They require them to like play parts and pull in people in their lives.

1207
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:12,080
Now, you have to be this part.

1208
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:15,360
You got to pretend to be my cousin or my wife or whatever.

1209
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:21,240
Even though like every scam unravels, they just keep doing it and doing it.

1210
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:24,880
Yeah, I was I mean, like, I don't know if this falls into that same category,

1211
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:30,680
but I was really disappointed in Laura for for messing with the chamber.

1212
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:32,240
Like that. Yeah.

1213
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:35,640
No, that felt like very wrong to me as it was happening.

1214
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:39,680
Like this felt like such a big deal for for Steve.

1215
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:42,600
And yeah, that's incredibly selfish.

1216
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:46,520
Incredibly. That's like a like relationship ender for like,

1217
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:51,840
oh, you did something that will prevent me from going back to who my normal self.

1218
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:54,000
Like that's a crazy thing.

1219
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,160
I'm trying to think of like a real world equivalent.

1220
01:06:56,680 --> 01:07:00,160
Yeah. I say you were on a trip and you like had a car and somebody like I

1221
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:04,280
cut all the tires on your car so you would stay here longer.

1222
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:07,720
You'd be like, what the fuck are you talking about?

1223
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:08,640
Why would you do that?

1224
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:10,920
Like I get like that's sweet that you want me here.

1225
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:13,160
But obviously, like something's wrong.

1226
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:16,000
Like that's a misery situation. Yeah.

1227
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,480
Yeah. That's like a fatal attraction. Yeah.

1228
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:24,320
There's also like some weird dynamics in this of like the psychosexual politics

1229
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:27,240
of like Stefan and Laura and the Myron Steve.

1230
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:31,160
And it's like, well, if he changes his DNA, if it is another person,

1231
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:36,160
but an only person exists occasionally, like it's like, oh, bizarre, bizarre.

1232
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:37,440
Do you wrap?

1233
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:41,040
Try to step back and wrap your head around this thing that no one was

1234
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:43,040
probably really thinking about that much in the writers.

1235
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:47,320
No. As Kyle was saying, with the logic of pop culture references,

1236
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:51,120
I just love that these shows in there, who cares?

1237
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:53,360
Let's get it done. We got to go to lunch.

1238
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:59,120
And like give us these riddles that we've been unpacking since we were 10 years old.

1239
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:02,280
Maybe I still do feel bad about the butt master stuff. OK.

1240
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:06,400
I'm sorry. I'll cut it out.

1241
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,800
I'll cut it out. No, no, you don't have to.

1242
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:12,600
But immediately I'm like, I'm living the fantasy of like somebody listening to me

1243
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:17,160
talk like go off on the butt master, like, whoa, no, this is not right.

1244
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:22,560
And the kind of thank God moment that like Mike, I am thankful that you looked that up.

1245
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:26,120
No, I'm sorry. I feel now I feel bad because I didn't want to butt.

1246
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:30,040
Like I don't want to make no every the world might not know about the butt master.

1247
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:33,960
And, you know, I need to tell them it was too good to be true.

1248
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:39,200
The idea that that flash would make up an apparatus called the butt

1249
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:42,600
master in terms of like all that makes America great.

1250
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:47,960
That's a stand in for the real invention that is hawked by the star of the show.

1251
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:50,600
Really go either way.

1252
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:54,680
But it is also worth mentioning that it's like oddly,

1253
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:59,120
an oddly patriotic sea story to stick into that.

1254
01:08:59,120 --> 01:08:59,960
That's that common.

1255
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:01,520
Right. Yeah.

1256
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:06,680
Look, Kyle, the degree of knowledge and accuracy

1257
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:11,000
and getting stuff right on this podcast is exceedingly high, almost never.

1258
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:12,240
I've never.

1259
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:16,880
So we will forgive you in this this instance, but we're trying to.

1260
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:17,960
I appreciate it.

1261
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:21,880
I'm glad I'm glad that you that that you checked me on that.

1262
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:25,640
And we didn't have to have like

1263
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:30,320
ongoing sitcom hijinks where we created a world where we're pretending that that

1264
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,120
was, oh, yeah, I know.

1265
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:34,040
For years, I don't want to be talking about like.

1266
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:36,760
And then there's the episode where he says, but master.

1267
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:39,560
So I follow you around.

1268
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:42,280
I was going to YouTube comment.

1269
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:46,440
I was Car the Dracula for the longest time, and then I was shamed for it.

1270
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:51,120
And, you know, well, it's best if we can be our own regulators

1271
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,160
and do the shaming for each other.

1272
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:55,000
We are our own ombudsman.

1273
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:55,960
Yeah. Mm hmm.

1274
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:58,440
I also thought maybe I'd say but master, it's real.

1275
01:09:58,440 --> 01:09:59,880
And then there would be a rift or two.

1276
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:03,520
You know, I was thinking maybe, you know, so I wasn't even maybe

1277
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:06,240
totally incorrect. I wasn't even thinking correctional wise.

1278
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:08,280
I was just thinking, oh, did that exist?

1279
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:09,560
You know, but.

1280
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:10,520
Well, was it familiar?

1281
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:12,200
Was it familiar to you?

1282
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:15,600
Did it make did you remember it all or was it like, I just want to look up.

1283
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:19,000
But I'm asked vaguely familiar, vaguely familiar.

1284
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,880
And I was like, I wonder that does sound because there were so many

1285
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:25,840
those 90s at home things you would like your mom would buy.

1286
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,200
I don't know my mom in a book.

1287
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:30,640
She has like my mom still has like this weird like saucer thing

1288
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,440
she exercises on that she bought from like late night TV.

1289
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:38,000
And I'm like, I think she'd be upset that you were even like bringing up

1290
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,320
the possibility that she had the but master.

1291
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:42,240
Mm hmm.

1292
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:44,880
I don't think so, but you never know.

1293
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:48,400
I'll say that. I don't think so.

1294
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:52,160
That's why all the whole but master thread will get pulled from the episode,

1295
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:54,080
not the accuracy issue.

1296
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:56,960
But yeah, it's like I run into an issue.

1297
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:00,080
Yeah, the but master does exist, folks.

1298
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:02,440
It was real and you can buy it on eBay.

1299
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:04,000
It was real. It does.

1300
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,000
I mean, in the way that it does sound like a cheap sitcom toss off joke, it does

1301
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:10,880
very clearly sound like the thymaster was a hit.

1302
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,440
And they're like, well, we need something else.

1303
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:14,000
We need someone else. What else you got?

1304
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,320
Yeah. You know, and they really quickly rushed it out.

1305
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:20,960
Right. Work. You can't like put one of those things between your butt cheeks, right?

1306
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:23,000
That's not what it is.

1307
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,160
It's not a little bit.

1308
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:26,880
Shreer, Scott, you can.

1309
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:29,360
And you will.

1310
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:31,760
And here's a demonstration.

1311
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:36,360
The thing goes in. Yeah, that little ball goes in your anus.

1312
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,080
And then the great.

1313
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:43,440
Yeah. My issue with my blood is that the cheeks aren't spread wide enough.

1314
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:45,640
I wish an implement could help me.

1315
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:50,400
Exactly. OK, let's let's explain the transformation chamber thing.

1316
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,720
Just the math of it to be to be very clear.

1317
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:56,120
And again, I just think that we were so lucky with all these episodes.

1318
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:58,600
All the shows are in their primes.

1319
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:00,240
Jesse has the band.

1320
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:02,640
Urkel has the transformation chamber.

1321
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:06,440
He has invented a machine that we know just to be clear.

1322
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:09,920
Step by step is not and we are post prime for step by step.

1323
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:11,920
Yeah. Step by step.

1324
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:14,160
It have a prime. Characters at this point.

1325
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:17,080
I don't I lost track of who was what, whose kid.

1326
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:19,800
But I kept going like, where is the older one?

1327
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:22,760
And it's just like, oh, he was kind of written out at the end of the season.

1328
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:25,160
The nephew like. Oh, well, that's a whole yeah.

1329
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:27,240
Well, that's why there is a flash.

1330
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:32,480
Urkel, a nerd has invented a machine that you can walk into

1331
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:36,400
that changes you from a nerd into not a nerd anymore.

1332
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:40,640
And in his case, it turns him into the very suave

1333
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:43,680
Stefan Urkel, who I I just want to say,

1334
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:47,960
I really like the specific mold of cool guy that Stefan Urkel is.

1335
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:52,560
It reminds it's like boys to men and baby face and like

1336
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:55,560
the vibe of the movie Boomerang.

1337
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:59,000
I haven't seen Boomerang, but I feel like that's kind of that's just like

1338
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:03,840
the type of like gentleman that that Stefan is.

1339
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:09,520
And it's, you know, look, Jaleel with his multi character abilities.

1340
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:11,160
I think he really nails it.

1341
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:14,840
You love Urkel and then like, could there be somebody you love more?

1342
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:16,080
And I think I don't know.

1343
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:18,160
I love Stefan. I love every time Stefan.

1344
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:19,080
And you got you.

1345
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:24,560
You have to give props to Laura is so infatuated with Stefan

1346
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:29,560
in a fun, in a fun, almost cartoonish way, like when whenever Stefan enter,

1347
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:34,280
like whenever he's mentioned, she's just so ready for it.

1348
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:37,440
Is that's the the deepest love there ever was.

1349
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:40,160
It's like, yeah, it's like the Chase Meridian Batman.

1350
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:44,880
Or she's just like, oh, my God, I can't even imagine.

1351
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:47,880
Like, I can't even hear the name or else I go nuts.

1352
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:51,880
One one Stefan thing that I noticed that maybe again is maybe

1353
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:56,080
maybe it's not that peculiar and like maybe there's more information necessary.

1354
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:59,080
But there was a scene and I don't know what's happening, but he's

1355
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:03,720
with Laura and he pulls out a wad of cash.

1356
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:05,520
Do you guys recall this?

1357
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,960
Oh, it's for it's when he's paying for the

1358
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:12,200
the artist who's who's doing their like their portraits, their

1359
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:16,400
oh, like in the in France and yes, exactly.

1360
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:20,880
And like he pulls out a lot of money, which got me think like,

1361
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,440
is Stefan rich? Is he like richer than Urkel?

1362
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:26,680
Did Urkel have that money on him?

1363
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:30,880
But he's just so suave.

1364
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:33,000
Yeah. Where does that money come from?

1365
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:36,840
Are like are random women just giving him money for no reason?

1366
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:39,800
Just to say thanks for giving me something to look at?

1367
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:43,080
Because his clothes are different.

1368
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:47,320
Yeah. And is that part of the transformation chamber?

1369
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:51,000
Yeah, it feels like it's some sort of like dimensional reality

1370
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,680
altering thing.

1371
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:57,280
It's not just making the human body different or the brain different.

1372
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:59,080
It feels like it's actually altering reality.

1373
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:01,160
So my I'm just this is off the top of my head.

1374
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:04,360
I think the money is created by the machine

1375
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:07,640
because a cool guy like that would have more money than a non-cool.

1376
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:12,000
And those are that's probably like, yes, those suits are not inexpensive.

1377
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:14,960
That's probably like Italian made like.

1378
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:18,280
Yeah. So I think that the yeah, the machine,

1379
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:22,160
they don't explain it on the show, but it alters reality in some way.

1380
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:27,720
So then it takes it away to like when he gets back in the chamber

1381
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:29,720
and becomes Urkel again, right.

1382
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:33,800
However much money Stefan had in his wallet is eliminated

1383
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:35,200
and decreases.

1384
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:38,000
Yeah, if it's if it's on him, but if it's left in the other world,

1385
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:43,200
I think like like Stefan could leave his sack of money outside of the machine,

1386
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:47,680
get into the machine and Urkel could change back and Urkel could take the money

1387
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:49,800
because Urkel still knows he's Stefan.

1388
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:52,120
He has memories of Stefan.

1389
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:56,560
And where does Urkel go when he's Stefan?

1390
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,520
Like, where is Urkel's soul?

1391
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:03,240
Well, like there's a there's a you know, this is a comic book reference,

1392
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:05,400
but there's a thing place called the negative zone.

1393
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:09,000
The fantastic it's kind of like

1394
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,880
it's almost like we're like a containment unit and Ghostbusters.

1395
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:15,720
You know, what is this like sort of not real play?

1396
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:19,520
It exists on some sort of other plane and it's like a limbo of sorts.

1397
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,440
Is Urkel stuck in limbo with unbaptized babies?

1398
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:24,840
You know,

1399
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:29,360
it's possible they're there all the time.

1400
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:34,800
Yeah. Well, with the Urkel Stefan dichotomy,

1401
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,880
Laura's lie isn't just

1402
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:44,760
breaking the machine so that he stays Stefan and doesn't turn back into nerd

1403
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:49,480
Urkel. You know, sure, it messes up the results of this inventor contest,

1404
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:54,520
but then the further ramification that like a soul will be gone.

1405
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:56,480
Like Urkel is no more.

1406
01:16:56,480 --> 01:17:01,080
Urkel just lives in oblivion now, which by all what, you know,

1407
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:05,120
you always make a lot out of how Family Matters started as a very grounded show

1408
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:08,240
and then became about inventions and time travel and stuff.

1409
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:09,680
But this is one of the headiest.

1410
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:14,240
This is just like a regular family police officer with a bunch of kids.

1411
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:18,520
And now his daughter is dealing with a scenario where a soul is in limbo

1412
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,400
because of a DNA machine.

1413
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:23,960
The father and that could affect their lives for 80 years.

1414
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:28,520
That's like that's a major part of being a Winslow now. Right. Yeah.

1415
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:30,880
Also, how old is Laura supposed to be?

1416
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,240
She like 20 at this point.

1417
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:34,480
It's like a few seasons in.

1418
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:35,320
Not sure.

1419
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:38,560
I think that was my guess, but I don't know. Yeah.

1420
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:45,160
They in step by step, the the two, the one kid and friend are like,

1421
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:46,640
we're saving for an apartment.

1422
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:48,480
And I'm like, you look like children.

1423
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:50,320
How old are these characters?

1424
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:54,240
Laura breaks the fibrillating

1425
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:59,080
rebobulator, which causes this live inventor

1426
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:03,960
contest that's happening on the floor of interventions to be delayed for three days.

1427
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:06,000
That's how long it'll take to.

1428
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,840
Well, I don't because nobody's working on the machine.

1429
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:11,800
Really arbitrary.

1430
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:14,320
I was sort of bothered by

1431
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:18,160
how quickly they allowed

1432
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:21,160
Urkel, Stefan

1433
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:27,680
this opportunity, like in what is seemingly a very organized sort of contest.

1434
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:31,120
And it's similar to in step by step when

1435
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:35,480
Karen's in this country,

1436
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:39,840
find a star contest where she just leaves the stage

1437
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:44,000
and then she's allowed to just come back and they're like, now I'm ready.

1438
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:47,360
And then she's back in the contest.

1439
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:52,000
Similarly, like, all right, we'll give you a few days to figure this out.

1440
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,000
That just doesn't.

1441
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:58,120
I don't know if I if I believe that that reality that whatever this

1442
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:02,920
not that I know anything about this inventing contest, but they're so quick

1443
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:07,800
to be on Urkel's side to prove whatever this DNA things that he has to prove.

1444
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:13,200
But famously, you choked in your SNL audition, ran away in tears.

1445
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:17,160
Now I'm ready back and said, can I get an extra two days?

1446
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,920
Then you went and had a bunch of New York adventures

1447
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:25,040
came back better than ever.

1448
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:30,440
Yeah, it's it is completely it feels like a Florida recount

1449
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:34,680
in the pocket for the Republicans, like which maybe, you know,

1450
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:38,880
what happens with those things are these people like hobnob at a party and now like,

1451
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:41,200
all right, well, I'll remember you when the time comes.

1452
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:45,880
And in this case, Urkel did in the hotel lobby meet

1453
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,920
Martin Fisher, publisher of Inventors Weekly,

1454
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:53,680
who all ahead of the competition, who then is the emcee of it.

1455
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:56,920
So I don't think that should have been allowed.

1456
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:59,240
Like you shouldn't get to meet the judge.

1457
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:02,080
You shouldn't be able to do Pratt fault nerd pratfalls.

1458
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:05,000
The second nerd pratfalls in like a five minute span

1459
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:09,520
with the supposed authority of this contest, because they're both nerds

1460
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:10,720
and they both bonding.

1461
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:13,760
I think even though they're not like actively bonding, they're both bonding

1462
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:16,960
while they trip over each other.

1463
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:21,160
Yeah. Speak an unwritten language, you know, a secret language.

1464
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:23,360
Right. Dropping things.

1465
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:27,560
There's really good, by the way, physical comedy, I think, in the lobby of,

1466
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:29,200
in this case, the wilderness lodge.

1467
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:31,120
That's the hotel that's being placed.

1468
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:34,440
Placement for the wilderness lodge and interventions

1469
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,920
and Tower of Terror, all of which would have been fairly new at the time of the show.

1470
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,040
Those are good things to push.

1471
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:44,080
I like I think a couple of these, they make the characters for no reason,

1472
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:48,200
kind of run past the sign of the new Tomorrowland at the time.

1473
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:49,840
I like seeing that sign.

1474
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:51,520
That's another great thing about these shows.

1475
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:55,240
They all like preserve the parks and the hotels in their mid

1476
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:59,520
90s, pristine new peak Eisner vibe.

1477
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:02,000
Yeah. Is that do we know what?

1478
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:04,360
I assume it's a pleasure island club.

1479
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:08,320
Now, this spoiler alert later on in the step by step,

1480
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:10,440
they are at the neon armadillo.

1481
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:13,200
Correct. Which is a big deal for us.

1482
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:14,760
You pleasure island heads out there.

1483
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:16,400
But do we know are they at Manicure?

1484
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:18,880
Do we know if they're at the club in this?

1485
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:22,960
Like on a pleasure island, do we know where like that contest is being?

1486
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:26,000
Oh, no, the contest is interventions.

1487
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,040
Oh, wait, I'm getting confused.

1488
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,640
Yeah, that's step by step is the OK.

1489
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:31,600
Yes. But they're they are at a place.

1490
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,200
Some are at a nightclub at one.

1491
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:36,160
That's what I'm thinking. Oh, yes.

1492
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:38,560
Oh, my God. You're right. That part is incredible.

1493
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,880
I didn't realize when when they're

1494
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:46,000
Stefan and Laura have nothing but time to go date and explore Disney World.

1495
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:49,520
Oh, my God. That's so epic when it zooms in on that

1496
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:55,960
dance floor with the light up screens that spell out is that Stefan Hart, Laura.

1497
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:59,880
I mean, that looks like the best nightclub I've ever seen.

1498
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:01,720
And I would know I know nightclubs.

1499
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:06,320
And according to that pleasure island Facebook group, I read Mannequins was the best.

1500
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:08,360
Maybe that was Mannequins.

1501
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:09,200
I don't know.

1502
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:11,480
People know offhand big light up screens

1503
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:16,480
that you could have made, say, Stefan Hart, Laura, just watching them date is great.

1504
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:20,760
I believe that montage is set to a cool version of Kiss the Girl.

1505
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:22,400
That's another throughout these.

1506
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:24,920
I didn't say in full house, so you get to hear like the full house

1507
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:29,200
kind of like jamming, I love playing When You Wish Upon a Star.

1508
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:30,120
Yeah, that's great.

1509
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:33,960
Now, well, yeah, I would mark that down because I love those

1510
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:37,920
uh, sitcom musical interludes.

1511
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:38,600
Yeah, exactly.

1512
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:41,520
Exactly. Yeah. And to hear the Disney five versions.

1513
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:44,720
But there was also earlier in this they do kiss the girl.

1514
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:47,400
But there's a song that plays earlier.

1515
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:51,720
I think maybe it's for a Carl montage.

1516
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:55,560
And I wrote down, yes, that song is Every Day Sunshine.

1517
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:57,440
Yes. Is that a Disney song?

1518
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:59,640
What is I guess I didn't know what that was.

1519
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:02,560
I should have looked it up before.

1520
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:05,720
Isn't it by a fishbone?

1521
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:07,040
I was going to say, oh, gotcha.

1522
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:10,080
Those nineties Lauren B type. Yeah. Yeah.

1523
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,400
That part, that sequence is the best.

1524
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:15,880
That's the kind of thing I love where like it's not drama and stakes

1525
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:17,720
and characters lying to each other.

1526
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:21,880
The point of this sequence is Carl has decided he's going to have fun

1527
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:24,640
in Disney World and put his troubles to the side.

1528
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:27,640
And then he just has a moment with every character.

1529
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:30,960
He and Donald rub their seats around.

1530
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:32,640
They have a lot of fun.

1531
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:38,520
Then all the characters gather in a big tableau and the whole audience cheers.

1532
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:41,040
There's just a huge hooray.

1533
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:43,600
It's Carl and the characters.

1534
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,200
There's no stakes or drama.

1535
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:48,880
It's just you just get to see Carl Winslow having a blast.

1536
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:51,040
Mm hmm. That's really fun.

1537
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:55,040
I can't find a good picture of this mannequin stage, but it's possible.

1538
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:56,560
I think it could be it, though.

1539
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:58,960
I think it's possible because they do have like a big light.

1540
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:01,040
Oh, oh, oh, whoa, whoa.

1541
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:02,280
Whoa, let me let me see.

1542
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:04,320
Let me take your guys's temperature on this.

1543
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:07,080
Do you think this is that's a big light screen?

1544
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:09,720
Yeah, it looks like it might be it. Right.

1545
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:12,840
Damn. I think there's a decent chance somebody correct us if please.

1546
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:16,720
I'll be corrected in the comments if this is wrong and it was not mannequins.

1547
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:20,480
But I have information about pinettas when we get to that.

1548
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:22,880
Oh, I want to know all Jason and pinettas.

1549
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:24,560
I'm so excited. Oh, yeah.

1550
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,640
Yeah, I'm all about.

1551
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:29,440
Also, here's that Joker statue I was talking about.

1552
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:33,120
Oh, wow. Oh, that's worth thirteen hundred dollars.

1553
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:35,560
That's two hundred dollar nonrefundable deposit, too.

1554
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:40,520
Is that like is this like a FBI snaring situation

1555
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:45,200
they think are they running a sting by the product that doesn't exist?

1556
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:48,560
I'll take him. Look, if I buy it and I'll take him to court for entrapment.

1557
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:52,240
So anyways, yeah, Stefan and Laura

1558
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:56,520
go on a bunch of dates to go to the sci fi dine in theater.

1559
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:57,360
I like seeing that.

1560
01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:00,200
And then there's this massive

1561
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:02,160
engagement ceremony.

1562
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:04,040
Love, Stefan. There you are.

1563
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:07,720
The sun, the rain is this.

1564
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:10,560
Oh, how much he puts into the rain.

1565
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:13,840
I'm in love with them. I'm in love with Stefan.

1566
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:15,680
I'd say yes.

1567
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:19,600
Stefan asks Carl for Laura's hand,

1568
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:24,040
and he's maybe more primed to say yes, because he's having such a fun time.

1569
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:25,880
He's he's having such a fun time.

1570
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:30,080
And this is might be relatable for, you know, certainly Mike and Jason,

1571
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:33,920
maybe me, maybe Kyle, I don't know, the feeling of being in Disney World,

1572
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:38,160
having so much fun that maybe you think, should I live in Orlando?

1573
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:41,240
Should I move here forever?

1574
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:42,800
That's what Carl's grappling with.

1575
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,560
Yeah, I can relate to that.

1576
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:48,840
It's a conversation we all have a couple of times a week

1577
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:51,160
in our heads.

1578
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:53,880
But yeah,

1579
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:56,080
I'm pulled the trigger.

1580
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:58,120
Not yet. We're all cowards.

1581
01:25:58,120 --> 01:26:01,600
Not yet. We're all cowardly up until Jason is one day,

1582
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,040
texts us and goes, I did it.

1583
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:06,400
And I'm here with like keys in his hand.

1584
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:10,880
He's in a trailer outside on the ground so he can vote.

1585
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:13,960
So we can vote in the local election.

1586
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:16,360
Here's another one of those repeat situations.

1587
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:20,000
Long sequence where the stakes of the episode,

1588
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,920
a little scene happens in front of the elevator doors of the Tower of Terror.

1589
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:25,440
Then they go in and sit.

1590
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:27,880
The elevator goes up. They get the view.

1591
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:31,560
There's a creepy elevator guy who says, enjoy your ride.

1592
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:33,600
And then the drop and it's scary.

1593
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:36,800
And the same promotional footage is used of the elevator.

1594
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:39,560
All the same stuff happens in step by step.

1595
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:44,080
They do every beat of this, the same direction, the same staging.

1596
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:46,240
And is it the same guy?

1597
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:48,520
Yeah, the same guy, too. Yes.

1598
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:53,400
I say this in dignity or something like it's a problem.

1599
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:55,800
I guess why is it?

1600
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:56,800
I like the scene.

1601
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:59,360
I was seeing my friends go on the ride.

1602
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:02,720
And the elevator operator, I'm wondering, like,

1603
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:05,760
and I'm sure we can figure this out very quickly.

1604
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:06,840
This is an actor, right?

1605
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:11,280
This is not where we're assuming not a Disney park employee

1606
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:13,080
who actually is an elevator operator.

1607
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:15,360
Or what are the odds of that? Do you think?

1608
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:17,640
There might have been a guy who was really good at it.

1609
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:21,600
A little. Yeah, some people play it up a little if they're working in the parks.

1610
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:24,480
But this guy seems pretty picture perfect, you know?

1611
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:29,280
So you think he was this actor was hired on two separate occasions

1612
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:31,200
to play the elevator operator?

1613
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:33,800
Or do you think this is a one and do you think they may have shot

1614
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:36,560
step by step around the same time?

1615
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:39,960
I think they were shot for far enough from each other

1616
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:42,960
that that wouldn't be the case, I think.

1617
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:44,920
But maybe they had the I don't know.

1618
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:47,400
Family Matters was April of 95.

1619
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:50,240
Step by step is February of 96.

1620
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:54,160
So it could just be the same local actor they hired for both.

1621
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:55,680
Or a guy who worked on the ride.

1622
01:27:55,680 --> 01:27:57,040
Or a guy who worked on the ride.

1623
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:59,080
And they're like, we we need you to come back.

1624
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:02,840
You do get people sometimes on rides where they do.

1625
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:05,680
You know how you like, you know, you would spot a star

1626
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:08,680
at Schwab's drugstore or something like you do have people.

1627
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:12,400
You go to a ride and you go, well, that person on Haunted Mansion

1628
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:14,720
is like 10 times better than everyone.

1629
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:16,000
Everyone is good.

1630
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,680
But it does happen where you go.

1631
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:19,880
I saw like there was a guy who was doing the old Tower of Terror

1632
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:24,360
a couple of years ago where he was like so good and scaring everybody

1633
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:26,640
and scaring like little kids in a fun way.

1634
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:30,120
It was something they talked up a lot doing the Universal Tour.

1635
01:28:30,160 --> 01:28:32,720
Like when I was doing the training of it, they said,

1636
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:36,440
and for the aspiring actors out there, think about where you're working.

1637
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:38,560
You're on Hollywood's doorstep.

1638
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:40,960
You're trying to get discovered.

1639
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:43,800
There's producers on that tram every day.

1640
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:45,720
Well, what?

1641
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:51,360
I believe the times this actually worked out for anyone was zero, I think.

1642
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:53,400
But I could be wrong.

1643
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,040
People are quiet about their tour guide pass.

1644
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:58,640
Was the whole and step by step was was the Tower of Terror

1645
01:28:58,640 --> 01:29:00,080
was in the second episode, right?

1646
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:01,520
That was in part two. Yeah.

1647
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:03,760
That's another same thing.

1648
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:07,080
If we're talking about the Venn diagram, the Family Matters episodes are called

1649
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:08,600
We're going to Disney World.

1650
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:11,840
The step by step episodes are called We're going to Disney World.

1651
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:16,160
Yes. Started getting a little lazy with the and all of it

1652
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:20,520
basically cribbing the format of what Full House laid out.

1653
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:24,880
So really, you got to give them the credit for cracking the formula.

1654
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:27,960
Full House called the House Meets the Mouse. Is that right?

1655
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:30,120
More inventive title.

1656
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:31,560
Yeah, more inventive title.

1657
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:33,680
I by the time they get to step by step.

1658
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:36,280
Yeah, they're repeating a lot of the attractions and stuff.

1659
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:40,520
From Family Matters.

1660
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:44,640
The the big difference is in step by step.

1661
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:50,440
They appear to be staying at the Old Key West Resort, the Vacation Club Resort,

1662
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:54,560
because they also you would know which one it's clearly a vacation club.

1663
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:58,640
Yeah, because they also they get dropped off in an old timey car,

1664
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:01,000
which are parked in front of some of the hotels.

1665
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:06,720
But Jane caught that the car door had the vacation club logo very small on it.

1666
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:09,520
And I was like, I think that's Key West,

1667
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:12,400
because it looks like there's a golf course outside the door.

1668
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:17,640
They had to push that the with by getting a vacation club condo.

1669
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:22,560
There's plenty of room for your giant family to all travel the Disney World together.

1670
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:24,680
But they never mention it in this one.

1671
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:29,200
I feel like the other ones, they either name or at least have a big shot.

1672
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:33,000
Yeah, yeah. They lay on the promotion a lot thicker.

1673
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:36,560
What else about about Family Matters before we move on?

1674
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:40,640
Other than that, like I just enjoy this one quite a bit.

1675
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:42,360
Well, I guess we're plot wise.

1676
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:47,280
We have, yeah, Carl deciding he's he wants to live in Orlando.

1677
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:49,600
He's going to give up the police force.

1678
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:52,880
And then we also have Waldo and Eddie

1679
01:30:54,360 --> 01:31:00,280
struggling to make their way to Orlando and hanging out with India.

1680
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:03,360
The con artist. Yeah. Yeah.

1681
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:07,160
There's a lot of that's that's that's not taking place in Disney.

1682
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:10,000
That's on the road to Disney World, and it lasts both episodes.

1683
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:12,640
Kind of green screeny. Yeah. Yeah.

1684
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:14,200
That's another great look.

1685
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:15,840
I love Jaleel. I love Reginald.

1686
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:19,360
And I don't know his name offhand, but the actor who plays Eddie's

1687
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:23,880
dumb friend, Waldo Geraldo Faldo, I think that's a really solid.

1688
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:27,080
He had he was entering such a tradition.

1689
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:32,360
Like I almost kind of follow Urkel as this as the silly scene stealer on that show.

1690
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:38,080
Totally. And like I and I'm sure this is my own

1691
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:40,200
immaturity in some way.

1692
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:41,480
And maybe you you all caught it.

1693
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:46,000
But like his joke, which is like a hundred miles away from a little town

1694
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:49,800
called Kenyatta, I wasn't ready for the punch line.

1695
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:51,040
I didn't do the math.

1696
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:55,320
And so it played for me when the reveal was that he was referring to Canada.

1697
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:59,200
So some of the writing is hitting in the right way.

1698
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:00,520
Yeah, I love that.

1699
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:04,760
Like the fake deathbed story and then Kenyatta and all of that.

1700
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:09,400
Like Urkel, it goes behind like he well, he crashes into luggage carts

1701
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:11,480
outside the hotel when he's driving.

1702
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:13,760
And that's definitely I feel like one of the big case explode.

1703
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:15,040
Big laughs. Yeah.

1704
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:16,960
Genuine laughs in all of this.

1705
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:20,000
There's a weird line where Myra calls the hotel

1706
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:22,680
and they can't get Urkel on the phone.

1707
01:32:22,680 --> 01:32:25,520
And she says, what kind of Mickey Mouse place are you running?

1708
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,600
And that is an old phrase.

1709
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:33,680
That's a very funny phrase to like have a shot like a young person in 1995.

1710
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:36,560
Say like what young person is using that

1711
01:32:37,680 --> 01:32:40,240
describing a hotel as a Mickey Mouse kind of place?

1712
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:42,960
Well, what young hip band is playing the hippie hippie shake?

1713
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:45,160
That's true. Yeah.

1714
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:46,320
All right, guys.

1715
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:50,680
You know, there was big 60s revival, nostalgic revival in the 90s.

1716
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:54,120
So, you know, we have to think about what the coolest band

1717
01:32:54,120 --> 01:32:57,320
in the world would be playing in this year, 1992.

1718
01:32:58,120 --> 01:33:00,240
I just make it hippie hippie shake and then we can go to lunch.

1719
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:02,800
Sounds good. Great. Great work again, gentlemen.

1720
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:07,040
That's something I was going to say about Stefan and the whole like,

1721
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:09,480
well, does Urkel become Stefan forever?

1722
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:11,680
I feel like we talked about this for a while.

1723
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:15,680
I think there was a point where Stefan split off,

1724
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:20,320
like I think with the atom so that Stefan could exist.

1725
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:24,080
I feel like that's the final season, the CBS season.

1726
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:27,000
I could be wrong. Maybe it's also the season prior.

1727
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,240
But yes, they both exist.

1728
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:33,880
And then I believe the finale is like Laura choosing between

1729
01:33:34,120 --> 01:33:38,360
the series finale between Stefan and Urkel and she chooses Urkel.

1730
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:42,240
Am I wrong that the very final episode of the show is about like Urkel

1731
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:46,320
going to space and then it's not clear if he's going to make it back or not?

1732
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:47,920
And that maybe they left it on.

1733
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:50,680
Oh, that's familiar. But I don't know.

1734
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:56,240
Are you? Well, I'm the guy who claims that the butt master is a made up

1735
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:57,840
thing.

1736
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:01,200
Keep beating yourself up.

1737
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:03,480
That's what we wanted. That's what we asked for.

1738
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:05,480
I would go back in time.

1739
01:34:05,480 --> 01:34:06,720
Urkel could build a time machine.

1740
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:09,240
I go back in time and prevent myself.

1741
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:11,520
There would be like a thing that would come through and I would like grab

1742
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:14,440
the microphone out of my hand.

1743
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:16,560
It's the D butt masterizer.

1744
01:34:20,120 --> 01:34:22,000
He might have made it back from space.

1745
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,280
Are you thinking of the elf?

1746
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:25,640
Are you thinking of the elf season series finale?

1747
01:34:25,640 --> 01:34:27,000
We'll find out.

1748
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:30,120
I think I think so in the like unresolved nature of where

1749
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:33,080
else gets like gets kidnapped by the FBI.

1750
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:35,920
And then that's this they thought there would be another season.

1751
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:39,640
And that was just the end of the show was elf in custody.

1752
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:41,680
Well, it's called Lost in Space.

1753
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:43,560
Part two is the final episode.

1754
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:45,720
So, hmm.

1755
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:47,800
Um, oh, no, it's not.

1756
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:50,880
But master part two.

1757
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:54,320
Ah, yeah, I'm really sorry.

1758
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:56,920
I hope you're not actually offended by that.

1759
01:34:56,920 --> 01:34:59,840
Is there a plot synopsis of the second episode?

1760
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:06,040
It does seem like I think he promises not to go to outer space again.

1761
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:08,720
And then I think they do.

1762
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:09,680
Urkel and Laura kiss.

1763
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:11,920
So I think Laura does end up with Urkel ultimately.

1764
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:14,120
So Myra is out of the picture completely.

1765
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:15,640
But in this case.

1766
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:17,520
And there's no Stefan.

1767
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:20,880
Interesting. It looks like he gets stuck in space.

1768
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:23,160
He left Stefan. That's what happened.

1769
01:35:23,160 --> 01:35:26,200
Yes, Stefan was just fired into space because they didn't want to deal

1770
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:28,880
with the moral quandary anymore.

1771
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:31,240
Some clarity on the Stefan stuff.

1772
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:33,880
The permanent Stefan made several more appearances throughout the series

1773
01:35:33,880 --> 01:35:36,640
and proposed to Laura again before the series finale.

1774
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:41,120
After Wayne, Wayne, her choices in the flashback episode pop goes the question.

1775
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:44,400
Laura chooses chose Steve over Stefan.

1776
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:48,640
So it's not I'm incorrect that it was the finale where that that choice made.

1777
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:52,800
So Stefan banished to limbo, banished to the Phantom Zone.

1778
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:57,880
To suffer, you know, he was never asked to be born, honestly.

1779
01:35:57,880 --> 01:35:59,520
You know, yeah, that's a raw deal.

1780
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:00,720
You know, it's crazy.

1781
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:05,440
It's a person who starts their life at 23 or whatever.

1782
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:07,240
Like he had no childhood.

1783
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:10,080
Right. Bizarre existence that Stefan Erkel lives.

1784
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:12,520
Yeah, he just woke up one day.

1785
01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:15,120
He just was. He just was.

1786
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:17,040
And he just was fine.

1787
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:20,120
Urkel played God.

1788
01:36:20,120 --> 01:36:22,320
Urkel was playing God, let's be honest.

1789
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:24,640
And we're better to do it than Epcot Center.

1790
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:27,360
Celebrating invention in the great minds.

1791
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:30,600
Ray Bradbury, this Stephen Urkel.

1792
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:36,400
He they so Laura admits what she did in an emotional scene

1793
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:40,200
with heavy music in a United Kingdom gazebo.

1794
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:45,400
Look, I sabotage the chamber, she has to say, and sell through.

1795
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:51,200
And Urkel agrees that the ultimately agrees that the machine is a more a moral,

1796
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:55,400
I believe, in sort of a back to the future three kind of

1797
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:57,480
destroying the DeLorean situation.

1798
01:36:58,760 --> 01:37:00,680
Or if it's the contest.

1799
01:37:00,680 --> 01:37:02,840
Oh, that's what that's why he says that. Right. Right.

1800
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:06,800
OK, yeah. And he he doesn't win and neither does David Lander,

1801
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:09,120
the uppity guy with a suitcase car.

1802
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:13,520
It goes to the woman with the food processor.

1803
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:15,880
Which it was an impressive invention.

1804
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:18,920
Yeah, she dumps a bunch of raw food into it, dropped a rock chicken

1805
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:24,240
and carrots in there and then came out as a arranged and nicely.

1806
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:26,040
Yeah, yeah.

1807
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:28,200
And I mean, that's kind of that episode.

1808
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:31,280
Any other Family Matters observations?

1809
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:32,600
It's just a fun one. I like it.

1810
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:36,080
It doesn't. Yeah, that one lacks maybe in some of like more the epic

1811
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:38,280
like set pieces, I would say.

1812
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:41,120
But I like the I like the intervention.

1813
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:45,080
I like interventions as being a big part of it because it's so locked in time.

1814
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:48,880
Oh, and everybody's in the crazy uniforms, like the imagination

1815
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:50,160
Institute.

1816
01:37:51,120 --> 01:37:55,760
Yeah, it's that kooky 90s Bill Nye, that new Epcot era.

1817
01:37:56,280 --> 01:37:58,000
It's fun to see it preserved.

1818
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:03,160
Yeah, interesting that it's the only one where like they think about like,

1819
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:06,160
oh, what if we just had a character whose whole thing was they're going to have

1820
01:38:06,160 --> 01:38:07,880
a lot of fun at Disney World?

1821
01:38:07,880 --> 01:38:10,400
That's their whole story arc.

1822
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:13,880
Like you'd think they would have a moment like that in all of them.

1823
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:18,720
Well, that's sort of in a way they they with the thin

1824
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:21,600
plot device that is given to Flash.

1825
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:23,720
That's almost what is happening.

1826
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:27,880
Like he it's a guy who has a like a moral imperative

1827
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:31,360
to have the most fun in Disney World that he can have.

1828
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:32,160
That's true.

1829
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:35,120
It was a little hard to track step by step because at this point

1830
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:38,360
and even before this step by step, there's too many goddamn characters.

1831
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:42,040
And a lot of them are very similar.

1832
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:43,560
Yes. Yeah, yeah.

1833
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:48,280
I still I this is the one that I watch the most now, by the way, like in the.

1834
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:51,720
Yeah, the one I've seen the most recently myself,

1835
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:53,640
even though probably it was like still eight years ago.

1836
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:54,400
But yes.

1837
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:57,560
Is there a way to to just quickly

1838
01:38:58,480 --> 01:39:03,200
capture what is the step by step magic that I think you and I have bonded over?

1839
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:04,920
It's some of this stuff.

1840
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:07,920
I think it's a relationship with pop culture.

1841
01:39:07,960 --> 01:39:08,920
Yeah, totally.

1842
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:11,320
And I've never attempted to articulate it.

1843
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:13,320
So I forgive me that that I might not.

1844
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:15,840
But it's like Cody, for instance, I think

1845
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:18,560
who's not in this episode, Cody, the Sasa.

1846
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:21,800
Sasha Mitchell has been let go from the show at this point.

1847
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:28,240
He was kind of the goofy scene stealer, the attempt at the Urkel on this show.

1848
01:39:28,240 --> 01:39:32,920
Yeah. Sort of a like fifth generation Bill and Ted Wayne and Go.

1849
01:39:32,920 --> 01:39:37,640
And that's why I think, yes, he represents his connection to like what

1850
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:42,840
I think the writers or ABC or whomever like kind of

1851
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:47,440
what they're trying to project as like 90s cool.

1852
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:48,800
He is he is that.

1853
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:53,600
And I think that's one of the main things I love about the show.

1854
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:58,800
And a la JT and Cody JT's world, like their version of Wayne's world.

1855
01:39:59,120 --> 01:40:03,680
It's like they're trying as a kid, as a let's say, 10 year old.

1856
01:40:03,680 --> 01:40:07,440
And my older brother was actually like watching Saturday Night Live

1857
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:09,320
and like love the Wayne's World movies.

1858
01:40:09,320 --> 01:40:12,640
This felt like, OK, I'm getting something cool, too.

1859
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:15,160
This is just as cool as that.

1860
01:40:15,160 --> 01:40:17,960
Oh, I was a way to like kid of five.

1861
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:23,280
What teens are into late night, a little bit cracking into TGIF.

1862
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:26,400
And like similarly, like I remember this quote that stuck with me

1863
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:28,920
with Boy Meets World, also a TGIF show where it's like

1864
01:40:30,160 --> 01:40:35,360
Corey is like, we're the MTV generation.

1865
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:39,200
We listen to alternative rock and watch Beavis and Butt-Head.

1866
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:43,880
And it like gets a massive applause or or or laugh from the audience.

1867
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:48,400
But just I feel like Step by Step has that thing where like

1868
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:53,520
it almost felt cool in a way that like Family Matters

1869
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:56,680
certainly with the introduction of Stefan, that felt very cool.

1870
01:40:56,680 --> 01:41:01,360
And there once we like started to see like Urkel play basketball super well.

1871
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:02,400
That was really cool.

1872
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:03,920
And Eddie was cool.

1873
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:08,280
But like Step by Step felt like the most relatable and

1874
01:41:08,280 --> 01:41:11,880
and a good a good thing going in terms of that.

1875
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:15,440
Well, and that like sort of that early 90s definition of cool

1876
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:20,040
that like Michelangelo was like everything kind of decided for us.

1877
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:26,720
A like doofy surfer guy is the ultimate what what cool is. Right.

1878
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:30,760
It's also but I think it's then it's like the most fun to watch now

1879
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:36,160
because it it like almost worked really great then and much less so now.

1880
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:38,760
Like Family Matters, just by being solid,

1881
01:41:39,080 --> 01:41:42,000
probably seems like the highest quality show today.

1882
01:41:42,200 --> 01:41:47,240
But Step by Step you watch and just has these like jaw dropping choices,

1883
01:41:47,240 --> 01:41:48,760
these bizarre things.

1884
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:52,560
Like you were saying, this thing that we love where they just had characters

1885
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:56,160
who were Beavis and Butt-Head, they just kind of stole Beavis and Butt-Head

1886
01:41:56,160 --> 01:42:01,520
and put them on the show just to kids show up and go, hey, hey, cool.

1887
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:06,080
But then they reference being aware that that Beavis and Butt-Head exists, too.

1888
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:08,960
It's just the weirdest thing ever that they like stole Wayne's World.

1889
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:10,240
It's so weird.

1890
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:14,320
I think what makes this episode so significant and interesting is this

1891
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:18,000
this this primary plot surrounding the kid Flash.

1892
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:22,480
We get to Disney World, everybody's anticipating what they're going to do.

1893
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:25,680
There's some somebody's looking at a trivia book

1894
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:30,840
and learns that the person who did the most rides and shops

1895
01:42:31,120 --> 01:42:34,400
and restaurants that covered all of it in Disney World

1896
01:42:34,640 --> 01:42:36,840
was a guy from Russia.

1897
01:42:37,320 --> 01:42:43,040
And this character Flash hears this, who's a friend of the family, right?

1898
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:45,200
He's not in the family.

1899
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:46,200
He's just joining them.

1900
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:47,800
And he hears this and he's indignant.

1901
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:50,880
I think he even says a Russian holds the record.

1902
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:52,640
That's a disgrace.

1903
01:42:52,640 --> 01:42:54,440
Yeah, he does.

1904
01:42:54,440 --> 01:42:56,840
And the wall fell years before this.

1905
01:42:56,840 --> 01:43:00,040
This is 1996.

1906
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:02,600
I mean, children still mad about Russia.

1907
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,440
We had to keep them mad.

1908
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:06,880
They're mad. We had to stay mad.

1909
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:08,160
We're mad at them still.

1910
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:10,080
They say you hacked the election.

1911
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:12,080
This is even like

1912
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:14,800
Flash has been introduced in the episode at this point

1913
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:20,160
after we kind of learn in Orlando that like it's not just going to be

1914
01:43:21,560 --> 01:43:22,720
the fan. It's there.

1915
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:25,080
There are a few extensions joining the family like

1916
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:27,880
Jason Marsden and Flash.

1917
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:32,360
And I don't recall like seeing Flash on TV when the show

1918
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:36,840
show aired. I can't until I rewatched the show years ago.

1919
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:40,720
But he was definitely a replacement for Cody and his

1920
01:43:41,400 --> 01:43:43,400
introduction is so awesome to me.

1921
01:43:43,400 --> 01:43:45,280
I don't know what he's like.

1922
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:47,800
Hey, you forgot your hammer.

1923
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:50,400
Like it's so cartoonish.

1924
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:54,400
And like you're just like catapulted into this into this universe

1925
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:58,720
where Flash exists and you're kind of like, what is happening?

1926
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:01,800
This all comes in with very Michael J.

1927
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:03,760
Fox ripoff energy.

1928
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:07,440
He traveled across the country to give the main character,

1929
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:09,960
Frank Patrick Duffy, his hammerback.

1930
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:14,080
And then suddenly the episode is just about him and about him

1931
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:17,720
trying to regain the the ride record for America.

1932
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:22,320
And like not having the show memorized years later, I'm like, OK,

1933
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:24,760
so I guess at some point they gave it over to this guy, Flash.

1934
01:44:25,480 --> 01:44:29,280
They got rid of Cody because the actors like did some awful stuff.

1935
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:31,880
So they had to just bail on him midseason. He's gone.

1936
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:35,840
So we need a goofy guy. It's Flash. We're going to bring Flash in.

1937
01:44:36,040 --> 01:44:38,920
And I think I assume like so they must have planted the seeds of Flash

1938
01:44:39,080 --> 01:44:41,800
slowly throughout the season to give him this big spot.

1939
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:45,240
His first episode was the episode before this.

1940
01:44:45,480 --> 01:44:50,680
Wow. This is the Disney World episode is the second episode ever of Flash.

1941
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:53,560
And this actor only has one credit before all this,

1942
01:44:53,560 --> 01:44:55,440
which is one episode of Full House.

1943
01:44:55,440 --> 01:45:00,240
So his third and fourth episodes of television ever

1944
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:05,160
are a massive plot using all of the rides and facilities of Disney World

1945
01:45:05,320 --> 01:45:06,680
devoted to him.

1946
01:45:06,680 --> 01:45:11,400
His fourth episode of television he's ever done is him in an American flag

1947
01:45:11,400 --> 01:45:16,120
jacket, waving an American flag in front, like with all of Main Street

1948
01:45:16,120 --> 01:45:19,280
cheering him on. This is never he's brand new.

1949
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:24,760
And I wanted to and I again, like I know we spoke briefly about who are these

1950
01:45:24,920 --> 01:45:26,320
are we seeing background actors?

1951
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:29,520
Are we seeing park park goers in these background scenes like this,

1952
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:31,000
like him running down Main Street?

1953
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:35,120
And I couldn't help but think like the idea of like, if you are a park goer

1954
01:45:36,040 --> 01:45:40,280
in 1996 or 1995 or whatever, and like you find out that they're

1955
01:45:40,280 --> 01:45:43,840
shooting step by step and you're like, oh, yeah, I want to be a part of that.

1956
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:45,400
That sounds awesome.

1957
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:48,520
And you're you're told to basically just like you're going to you're going to be here.

1958
01:45:48,520 --> 01:45:50,960
You're going to root one of the main characters from step by step,

1959
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:52,440
running along the end.

1960
01:45:52,440 --> 01:45:56,920
It turns out it's Flash and you just have no idea

1961
01:45:56,920 --> 01:45:58,920
what you're seeing or interacting with.

1962
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:02,560
Really responded to that.

1963
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:05,520
Right. Yeah. You're like, if you have a huge crush on Brandon

1964
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:10,240
Cole, like ultimate heartthrob Brandon Cole, and then all you only get to see him

1965
01:46:10,240 --> 01:46:14,480
super far away up by the castle and you're like, who's this guy?

1966
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:17,640
Judea, I've heard of Jeff Judea.

1967
01:46:18,520 --> 01:46:24,440
I I misremembered, by the way, I had always thought it was that the nephew

1968
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:28,360
that it was Cody who did the like, I'm trying to ride everything

1969
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:31,480
and that it was him who did the Indiana Jones.

1970
01:46:31,880 --> 01:46:34,000
I remember there was a character.

1971
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,960
So it was probably him who did the Indiana Jones show

1972
01:46:37,160 --> 01:46:41,960
because a kid wanted to see it, but he's got to get to the airport soon,

1973
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:46,760
which it's also like kid, don't save your favorite thing for last.

1974
01:46:46,760 --> 01:46:48,720
Are you crazy? Do it first.

1975
01:46:48,720 --> 01:46:51,960
What if it breaks? Like, what are you thinking, kid? Yeah.

1976
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:55,920
Yeah. So then in theory, he like Flash

1977
01:46:56,160 --> 01:47:00,240
speaks to whoever whoever is in charge and is able to like

1978
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:05,480
costume change into the indie role and then do that upcoming show.

1979
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:10,000
But later on, they say that he claims that they're slowed down

1980
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:14,160
in terms of this record breaking run because of what happened

1981
01:47:14,160 --> 01:47:15,960
at the indie stunt show.

1982
01:47:15,960 --> 01:47:19,680
But it seems like it actually moved on time, if this makes any sense,

1983
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:21,680
because he kind of probably took that.

1984
01:47:21,720 --> 01:47:25,920
I'm sorry to be if this is a convoluted point I'm making, but it's like,

1985
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:28,480
he did that upcoming show.

1986
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:31,040
He spent the same amount of time performing it that he would have

1987
01:47:31,400 --> 01:47:33,760
spent watching it. Is that accurate? Right.

1988
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:37,520
Yes. Yeah. If part of his duty was to watch every single show,

1989
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:40,920
then that's the exact same amount of time, regardless of whether it's an actor

1990
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:45,800
indie or him himself doing the dangerous stunts with no vetting or rehearsal.

1991
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:49,080
Yeah, it's really weird.

1992
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:52,400
This one, I think, takes some of the biggest swings in terms of stuff

1993
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:53,720
that could never happen.

1994
01:47:53,720 --> 01:47:58,800
I mean, this entire scenario that he sets out to get this record

1995
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:03,040
and it's just an indie enterprise initially that the character Mark,

1996
01:48:03,040 --> 01:48:05,520
the nerdy son is helping him with.

1997
01:48:05,680 --> 01:48:10,320
But then all of the resources of Disney World get behind Flash

1998
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:13,840
and his trying to bring the record back to America.

1999
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:15,280
And his pro-America agenda, yeah.

2000
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:20,120
Yeah. All of the people in lab coats in a place called Ride Central.

2001
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:24,160
Right. We're not going to let a child back there.

2002
01:48:24,160 --> 01:48:25,160
Yeah, we're going to have to.

2003
01:48:25,160 --> 01:48:26,800
I'll go talk to Disney Ride Central.

2004
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:28,240
And then suddenly he just is.

2005
01:48:28,240 --> 01:48:31,800
You don't see a scene of him talking his way in or seeing if that exists.

2006
01:48:32,040 --> 01:48:32,960
He's just there.

2007
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:36,040
And then there's like an Apollo 13 type crew

2008
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:38,840
all tensely watching every move.

2009
01:48:38,840 --> 01:48:40,800
And there's cameras everywhere.

2010
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:43,080
This is like Kristoff and the Truman show.

2011
01:48:43,440 --> 01:48:48,280
Like we've got all every possible eye on everywhere that Flash could be.

2012
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:51,720
And it's all, you know, it is a lot of fun because now you get to see a guy

2013
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:54,240
just having fun on all the rides, but with the sort of like

2014
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:58,520
the ticking clock of he's running out of the China pavilion.

2015
01:48:58,520 --> 01:49:00,920
He just had a blast at the Circle Vision movie.

2016
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:04,360
And then the kid who never has anything to do on the show

2017
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:07,600
has a churro right there waiting for him.

2018
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:09,520
You know, it's got like it's got a pace to it.

2019
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:11,440
There's a clock on it.

2020
01:49:11,440 --> 01:49:15,640
You know, I one line I wrote down just maybe which

2021
01:49:16,440 --> 01:49:19,920
falls in line with this whatever I was getting at in terms of this

2022
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:22,960
being representative of like a cooler, like our

2023
01:49:23,560 --> 01:49:26,360
kind of watered down Wayne's world or whatever is he does

2024
01:49:27,080 --> 01:49:30,600
coming off the teacups, Flash says something to the effect of like

2025
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:36,360
the G forces have my stomach set to hurl on her.

2026
01:49:37,960 --> 01:49:40,040
The G forces of the teacups.

2027
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:45,800
Like Hurl, I think it's just the perfect kind of encapsulation of like,

2028
01:49:45,880 --> 01:49:49,120
oh, as a 10 year old, like, OK, this show is actually cool.

2029
01:49:49,240 --> 01:49:51,800
They're saying the word hurl.

2030
01:49:51,800 --> 01:49:55,280
They're talking about gross stuff, stuff we all do.

2031
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:57,200
They're willing to address it on TV.

2032
01:49:57,200 --> 01:49:59,320
They talk like my friends and I talk.

2033
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,280
I this relates to me as an adult.

2034
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:07,280
He drops so hard because he basically does like a trust fall,

2035
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:09,880
like he's passing out and goofy catches him.

2036
01:50:10,280 --> 01:50:13,640
And he gets so low to the ground before goofy catches him.

2037
01:50:13,680 --> 01:50:15,440
I was so impressed with that.

2038
01:50:15,440 --> 01:50:19,240
Like he thought he like Chris Farley style, like physical,

2039
01:50:19,400 --> 01:50:23,720
like threw his body down and he really trusted that goofy to catch him.

2040
01:50:23,720 --> 01:50:26,680
And goofy did. But I would wonder if there was like another take where

2041
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:29,320
he like cracked his head on the cement.

2042
01:50:29,320 --> 01:50:32,080
Flash trying to make a good first impression, you know, he's given it

2043
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:34,600
his all, he's on his second or third gig, you know.

2044
01:50:35,080 --> 01:50:40,840
Yeah, it's pretty he does really carry it for having not really been on TV before.

2045
01:50:40,840 --> 01:50:44,480
He's the star of this episode and big locations.

2046
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:46,560
He's he's really got to sell all this stuff.

2047
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:50,680
And yeah, is he I mean, like you get the idea that he works for

2048
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:52,960
Patrick Duffy in that first scene, right?

2049
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:55,160
I mean, like, I guess like if you showed this

2050
01:50:55,160 --> 01:50:58,840
to somebody who's never seen the show, like, yeah, he passes it off like.

2051
01:50:59,560 --> 01:51:01,640
There's no question this could be the star of the show.

2052
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:04,160
He seems like he's always been there.

2053
01:51:04,160 --> 01:51:07,080
Yeah, even though he just showed up in like a construction

2054
01:51:07,080 --> 01:51:11,160
hijinks episode, the prior episode to all this.

2055
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:14,920
He can he sells some great topical jokes.

2056
01:51:14,920 --> 01:51:18,000
This could be the the if we don't get this back, it'll be the worst thing

2057
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:21,280
that happened to America since Roseanne sung the national anthem.

2058
01:51:21,640 --> 01:51:24,600
Yeah, that was very tiny tunes like they're trying to like

2059
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:27,080
everybody's pushing Roseanne is weird.

2060
01:51:27,160 --> 01:51:29,240
When did Roseanne sing the national anthem?

2061
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:31,240
What 90?

2062
01:51:31,240 --> 01:51:33,960
Is that a joke? Five years at five year old joke already?

2063
01:51:34,520 --> 01:51:38,720
I think so. But but again, that's as like up to date as you're getting on

2064
01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:40,960
what ABC program anger.

2065
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:42,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, because the rest of the show,

2066
01:51:42,680 --> 01:51:44,960
I feel like all these shows are just really littered with like

2067
01:51:45,120 --> 01:51:47,480
Chia Pett and the Clapper, right?

2068
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:51,040
It's all that sort of switches, I guess, is vaguely recent.

2069
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:55,360
But the master and but and let's say it, but master

2070
01:51:56,040 --> 01:52:00,320
and to shift things over to Suzanne Summers, to Carol,

2071
01:52:00,320 --> 01:52:04,040
we were talking about this, about their this is the they get the horniest

2072
01:52:04,040 --> 01:52:05,280
plot in this episode.

2073
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:09,760
Frank and Carol Duffy and Summers are trying to, you know,

2074
01:52:10,200 --> 01:52:13,760
basically they were trying to take a an anniversary trip

2075
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:17,880
and then it got ruined because his mom showed up and said, I'm dying soon.

2076
01:52:18,040 --> 01:52:20,040
I want to take everyone to Disney World.

2077
01:52:21,160 --> 01:52:23,400
Horrible thing to happen.

2078
01:52:23,440 --> 01:52:26,640
So they're just like so pent up and horny this entire.

2079
01:52:26,640 --> 01:52:28,120
But she's trying to.

2080
01:52:28,120 --> 01:52:32,240
Suzanne Summers is trying to find ways for them to break off and have a little fun.

2081
01:52:32,600 --> 01:52:36,320
Like when they, you know, they somebody brings up Peter Pan.

2082
01:52:36,320 --> 01:52:37,480
Oh, that's a kiddie ride.

2083
01:52:37,480 --> 01:52:41,440
Oh, I don't know. A slow moving fantasy ride in the dark.

2084
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:44,760
We all know this, the sexiest ride

2085
01:52:45,480 --> 01:52:48,040
could ever if there is a place where you were going to

2086
01:52:48,560 --> 01:52:52,160
go with the show, say, do the nasty that that might be too much.

2087
01:52:52,160 --> 01:52:55,680
I'm sorry. I feel like we feel like

2088
01:52:56,240 --> 01:52:58,520
Cody may have done like

2089
01:52:58,520 --> 01:53:01,880
I've never I've never done the sideways monkey dance.

2090
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:07,840
The horizontal mom, though I will say I did make note that like

2091
01:53:09,240 --> 01:53:14,760
I was kind of taken aback that in the beginning of the episode,

2092
01:53:15,680 --> 01:53:20,880
JT, in reference to his parents flirting, says something to the effect of like

2093
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:23,960
you guys are too old to have sex anyway.

2094
01:53:24,600 --> 01:53:28,160
And just hearing the word sex was off putting, I thought.

2095
01:53:28,200 --> 01:53:30,400
Yeah. Nine thirty, the gloves come off.

2096
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:32,680
Yeah, I guess so. Yeah.

2097
01:53:32,680 --> 01:53:35,360
I yeah, you would think there would have been a euphemism there.

2098
01:53:35,960 --> 01:53:37,240
Yeah, at least they would.

2099
01:53:37,240 --> 01:53:40,640
The daughter is the oldest daughter would say like, I have sex, mom.

2100
01:53:40,640 --> 01:53:42,200
OK, I have sex.

2101
01:53:42,200 --> 01:53:43,760
Do you have a problem with that?

2102
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:47,640
I don't know. I guess that was like the maybe that was the core idea of the show.

2103
01:53:47,640 --> 01:53:48,880
We are going to write.

2104
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:52,000
We're going to address stuff and be

2105
01:53:53,320 --> 01:53:55,240
a sort of uncomfortable throughout.

2106
01:53:56,520 --> 01:54:00,080
The boys trying to lose their virginity, that's alluded to that.

2107
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:01,840
This is the night they're going to.

2108
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:07,560
They are going to run this con where JT pretends that he's JT Disney.

2109
01:54:07,560 --> 01:54:11,760
And this will this will be the path to them both losing their virginity.

2110
01:54:11,960 --> 01:54:14,920
Yeah. Together your everybody's dream with their best friend.

2111
01:54:14,920 --> 01:54:16,640
Of course. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2112
01:54:16,640 --> 01:54:18,320
Yeah. Like that scene in Fargo.

2113
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:23,480
Yeah. They go to I alluded to this earlier, Panetta's.

2114
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:27,320
They pay the bill at this very expensive restaurant.

2115
01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:31,000
No restaurant ever existed at Disney World called Panetta's.

2116
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,200
That was a fake sign made.

2117
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:37,520
This is fake. The building is it was called the Portobello Yacht Club.

2118
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:41,040
Now it's called Terra Lina at what is now Disney Springs.

2119
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:45,520
But yeah, here's here's the back to the but master point.

2120
01:54:46,080 --> 01:54:48,160
Nine Dragons is referenced.

2121
01:54:48,640 --> 01:54:53,560
And that's a real up a real up caught restaurant in in in the World

2122
01:54:53,560 --> 01:54:55,640
Showcase and Panetta's is not.

2123
01:54:55,760 --> 01:55:00,720
So again, they're inconsistent logic in this episode where it's like, right.

2124
01:55:00,720 --> 01:55:02,800
Not just you. Thank you for that.

2125
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:04,520
Real real places.

2126
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:07,720
Why is that where a Disney person jumped in and go like, don't

2127
01:55:07,880 --> 01:55:11,960
don't go around talking about things being too expensive for people at Disney World.

2128
01:55:11,960 --> 01:55:15,280
That was probably their logic is because they have to say it is expensive.

2129
01:55:15,280 --> 01:55:16,600
But they could. That's why I looked it up.

2130
01:55:16,600 --> 01:55:18,400
The girl is really whiny about it.

2131
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:21,320
Like we want to go to Panetta's, but it's way too expensive.

2132
01:55:21,320 --> 01:55:24,440
And I was like, that can't be they would never allow that.

2133
01:55:24,440 --> 01:55:26,080
Yeah, I said about a real restaurant.

2134
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:29,560
I will say I fancy I am impressed by

2135
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:35,000
this hustle like claiming yourself to be JT Disney is funny.

2136
01:55:35,240 --> 01:55:37,760
That's like a cool whole idea. Yes.

2137
01:55:39,320 --> 01:55:40,080
Yeah, that's funny.

2138
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:44,840
Yeah, like, did he had to think on his feet about like, what is the relation?

2139
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:46,680
Is he the grandson?

2140
01:55:46,680 --> 01:55:51,480
Did he have to like spit out facts about him or like what he made in the will

2141
01:55:51,480 --> 01:55:53,880
or like what his shares are at this point?

2142
01:55:54,040 --> 01:55:58,600
Yeah. How would you prove that other than with like a limo, a local Orlando?

2143
01:55:59,880 --> 01:56:02,960
Yeah. In 1996 would be much harder to prove.

2144
01:56:02,960 --> 01:56:06,360
And like the Disney kids and cousins, like there's a lot of them.

2145
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:08,800
There's a lot of grandkids and cousins.

2146
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:12,000
Well, what he could have like, you know, he's like sign his name like Walt.

2147
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:14,200
Yeah. The.

2148
01:56:14,200 --> 01:56:15,440
See, that's how I sign.

2149
01:56:15,440 --> 01:56:16,880
That's the thing. We all do it.

2150
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:18,520
We all do it.

2151
01:56:18,520 --> 01:56:22,880
Also, like, I mean, I'm assuming you guys made this connection,

2152
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:25,880
maybe not as deep or as interesting as

2153
01:56:27,240 --> 01:56:29,440
Steve is to Aladdin, the cartoon.

2154
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:33,680
But Jason Marsden is a heavy Disney voice actor and was to.

2155
01:56:34,520 --> 01:56:37,160
I don't know if he had done Max Goof at this point, but

2156
01:56:38,040 --> 01:56:42,560
maybe maybe that might have come out or was like about to or the same year.

2157
01:56:42,600 --> 01:56:44,000
Yeah, I'm not sure when Goofy Movie came out.

2158
01:56:44,280 --> 01:56:45,480
He had a really funny moment.

2159
01:56:45,480 --> 01:56:48,360
I didn't even write it down that like felt like it could be improvised.

2160
01:56:48,360 --> 01:56:51,880
It could have been scripted, but I thought was like, oh, that's funny.

2161
01:56:52,120 --> 01:56:55,920
I think it's like he walks past Captain Hook maybe.

2162
01:56:55,920 --> 01:56:58,120
And he's like, love your movies, by the way.

2163
01:57:01,400 --> 01:57:05,280
Yeah. Which like he definitely performed it in an off the cuff way.

2164
01:57:05,280 --> 01:57:07,920
And I was like, OK, he's he's got some chops. He's funny.

2165
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:10,280
Yeah, he's just very pro.

2166
01:57:10,280 --> 01:57:11,760
He's just a very Broadway pro.

2167
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:13,440
Well, he can hit his mark.

2168
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:15,520
Every movement has purpose.

2169
01:57:15,520 --> 01:57:16,920
Just this is really good.

2170
01:57:16,920 --> 01:57:18,320
It's a really good Marsden, Scott.

2171
01:57:18,320 --> 01:57:20,680
Yeah, Marsden. I got a Marsden in the pocket.

2172
01:57:22,120 --> 01:57:25,360
Because I thought my use of that, I think nobody had nobody had anything to say.

2173
01:57:25,360 --> 01:57:27,840
Oh, my. Here's your hammer back.

2174
01:57:29,360 --> 01:57:31,160
I'm so I'm sorry we didn't say it before.

2175
01:57:31,160 --> 01:57:33,160
It's a great judge.

2176
01:57:33,160 --> 01:57:35,600
You got it. Yes.

2177
01:57:35,600 --> 01:57:37,040
I do Marsden, you do.

2178
01:57:37,040 --> 01:57:39,320
Jude, we covered the gamut.

2179
01:57:39,320 --> 01:57:41,960
If anybody wants to grab a Christopher Castile,

2180
01:57:43,200 --> 01:57:44,600
it's the balls in your court.

2181
01:57:44,600 --> 01:57:47,440
I'll workshop it up at the laugh factory.

2182
01:57:47,440 --> 01:57:50,040
I don't know. Yeah, what's open?

2183
01:57:50,040 --> 01:57:52,600
Panetta's go to Panetta's does a stand up night.

2184
01:57:52,600 --> 01:57:56,240
Go a big thing we've not gotten to speak too much about

2185
01:57:56,920 --> 01:58:01,560
that I thought was really fun was, well, Karen's whole plot

2186
01:58:01,560 --> 01:58:06,360
and in the song Girls with Guitars, I thought was, oh, boy, something of no.

2187
01:58:06,560 --> 01:58:08,240
Mom's worry.

2188
01:58:08,240 --> 01:58:09,880
Yeah, that was a good time.

2189
01:58:09,880 --> 01:58:13,720
Now, do you think this does this pre date like the Dixie Chicks, do you think?

2190
01:58:14,240 --> 01:58:15,720
Or is this at the same time?

2191
01:58:15,720 --> 01:58:18,960
Because like it felt like that's what not popularized, I think.

2192
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:23,560
But maybe they were like quiet on the rise, but they certainly hadn't hit yet.

2193
01:58:23,640 --> 01:58:27,200
Before Natalie, I know they were around before Natalie Mains joined the band,

2194
01:58:27,200 --> 01:58:30,200
which is sort of the part that made like skyrocketed them.

2195
01:58:30,200 --> 01:58:32,880
But apparently they were around since 89, the original.

2196
01:58:33,120 --> 01:58:35,200
The other two. Oh, I gotcha.

2197
01:58:35,400 --> 01:58:36,720
Yeah, this song is great.

2198
01:58:36,720 --> 01:58:41,040
So the all the girls are hanging out together at Pleasure Island,

2199
01:58:41,040 --> 01:58:43,480
which it's great to see Pleasure Island, that is prime.

2200
01:58:43,720 --> 01:58:46,520
The Jessica Rabbit way in the back on a sign.

2201
01:58:47,280 --> 01:58:50,000
So many clashy styles of buildings.

2202
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,600
It's just awesome to see

2203
01:58:52,600 --> 01:58:56,880
Karen, one of the daughters, who is has pursued country music before,

2204
01:58:57,080 --> 01:59:01,480
gets a flyer, which she reads in a very like Marsha Brady stilted

2205
01:59:01,720 --> 01:59:05,120
country music competition this Friday.

2206
01:59:05,240 --> 01:59:08,120
Top prize gets five hundred dollars.

2207
01:59:08,360 --> 01:59:10,120
Music scouts in audience.

2208
01:59:10,120 --> 01:59:11,480
Guys, we have to do this.

2209
01:59:11,480 --> 01:59:15,520
Maybe also like a like a live band accompaniment.

2210
01:59:16,640 --> 01:59:18,000
There is like some phrase in it.

2211
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:19,680
It's provided.

2212
01:59:19,680 --> 01:59:22,480
Exactly. Give chord changes if you can.

2213
01:59:23,520 --> 01:59:26,880
Only do one verse chorus and bridge.

2214
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:29,800
Guys, we have to do this.

2215
01:59:29,800 --> 01:59:34,320
Every every competitor allowed to walk off and disgrace once and then come back.

2216
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:35,120
That's to be fair.

2217
01:59:35,120 --> 01:59:38,080
That's how I read the rules of the coffin challenge to Anthony Geo

2218
01:59:38,080 --> 01:59:40,240
at Six Flags Fright Fest.

2219
01:59:40,240 --> 01:59:44,960
It's been three days in a coffin and you can't stand up except for peeing breaks.

2220
01:59:45,360 --> 01:59:46,720
We have to do this.

2221
01:59:46,720 --> 01:59:48,880
Top prize is six hundred dollars.

2222
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:51,760
Anthony, what are we waiting for?

2223
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:55,120
Yeah, she they work up a little country act.

2224
01:59:55,120 --> 01:59:58,880
They rehearse this song Girls with Guitars, which is a Winona Judd song.

2225
01:59:58,880 --> 01:59:59,600
Oh, OK.

2226
01:59:59,600 --> 02:00:01,680
Is it a song that exists?

2227
02:00:01,680 --> 02:00:02,720
It is. I looked it up.

2228
02:00:02,720 --> 02:00:04,280
Yeah, Girls with Guitars exists.

2229
02:00:05,280 --> 02:00:07,080
Girls with guitars.

2230
02:00:07,080 --> 02:00:10,040
It will be in my head forever having watched this.

2231
02:00:10,480 --> 02:00:13,680
They do a scene with horrible sound back in the hotel room.

2232
02:00:13,680 --> 02:00:16,120
The band breaks up immediately.

2233
02:00:16,120 --> 02:00:20,560
But then they join her ultimately for the big show with the neon armadillo.

2234
02:00:21,600 --> 02:00:25,600
She really eat shit on try one and then crushes it on try two.

2235
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:31,720
How do you as all of you perform to some degree, how do you deal with

2236
02:00:31,720 --> 02:00:36,120
with scenes in television film like this with the like

2237
02:00:37,080 --> 02:00:42,480
the person getting on stage and in this case, her vision,

2238
02:00:42,480 --> 02:00:47,800
we we get her perspective and her vision blurs and like she just can't get.

2239
02:00:47,800 --> 02:00:50,200
Oh, yeah. It's hard for step by step. Yeah. Yeah.

2240
02:00:50,760 --> 02:00:54,360
Do you get I'm just having yeah, what you're like psychological,

2241
02:00:54,360 --> 02:00:58,600
if it just doesn't bother you or it does bother you as a performer on that level.

2242
02:00:58,920 --> 02:01:02,760
I don't know. I feel like any time I've seen that usually it's before someone

2243
02:01:02,760 --> 02:01:08,840
takes the stage or like I feel like usually just adrenaline kicks in.

2244
02:01:08,840 --> 02:01:12,480
Like even if you're nervous, you know, I've never watched anyone

2245
02:01:12,480 --> 02:01:15,640
like run off stage and then come back and do it again.

2246
02:01:15,640 --> 02:01:17,160
You know? Yeah. Yeah.

2247
02:01:17,160 --> 02:01:23,360
Even in like you're like one on one improv, like class performance, nobody.

2248
02:01:24,040 --> 02:01:26,840
Like I've never seen anyone flip out like this.

2249
02:01:27,440 --> 02:01:29,920
Usually just somebody says something dumb like.

2250
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:35,440
Yeah. You're saying like that it is it is maybe kind of like the trope is

2251
02:01:35,800 --> 02:01:41,360
that they'll just be like a full minute of silence and people glaring.

2252
02:01:41,560 --> 02:01:43,760
And yeah, fuzziness.

2253
02:01:44,080 --> 02:01:47,080
Less I was commenting on like the reality

2254
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:51,160
versus what we're seeing, like, I guess I'm just as somebody who goes,

2255
02:01:51,200 --> 02:01:53,000
I get nervous when I see these.

2256
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,400
Well, I may be like I'm fearful.

2257
02:01:56,280 --> 02:01:58,880
I guess I'm just wondering if it stresses you guys out.

2258
02:01:58,880 --> 02:02:00,440
It was kind of what I was getting.

2259
02:02:00,440 --> 02:02:03,080
I see. I do have nightmares like this.

2260
02:02:03,600 --> 02:02:06,680
Like I don't I feel a little nervous before I go on stage,

2261
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:11,040
but not to this level, but I do have dreams where I'm on stage

2262
02:02:11,040 --> 02:02:13,760
and don't know my my lines or don't know what to do.

2263
02:02:13,960 --> 02:02:16,880
Yeah. Yeah. Not being prepared. Yeah, for sure.

2264
02:02:17,440 --> 02:02:21,440
I don't know that they're like seeing this now without something I'm nervous

2265
02:02:21,440 --> 02:02:24,920
about that's in the arena doesn't stress me out necessarily.

2266
02:02:24,920 --> 02:02:25,880
You weren't nervous.

2267
02:02:25,880 --> 02:02:30,200
OK, because I like I guess it made me put too much of my own

2268
02:02:31,360 --> 02:02:36,800
mental and like an investment into the performance of girls with guitars.

2269
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:38,880
And like I did really want it to go well.

2270
02:02:39,400 --> 02:02:44,120
Yeah, I guess I guess as a kid, for sure, stuff like this would stress me out.

2271
02:02:44,120 --> 02:02:46,120
I mean, I think I've said this before on the show.

2272
02:02:46,120 --> 02:02:49,320
One of my favorite movies seeing in the theaters as a kid was the Lassie movie,

2273
02:02:49,320 --> 02:02:53,840
like from 1993 or four was because there's literally no conflict at the end.

2274
02:02:53,840 --> 02:02:56,440
There's no like stressful thing.

2275
02:02:56,440 --> 02:02:59,600
So I can relate, even especially being a kid.

2276
02:02:59,640 --> 02:03:03,040
Anything like this would really stress me out

2277
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:05,960
to like feel like the character is having sort of a breakdown.

2278
02:03:05,960 --> 02:03:08,640
I also had an anxiety attack in real life a couple of weeks ago.

2279
02:03:08,920 --> 02:03:13,760
So I really I guess it's I guess if now that you're pointing it out

2280
02:03:13,760 --> 02:03:17,680
and if I were to rewatch it, I might actually feel a little more stressed out by it.

2281
02:03:17,920 --> 02:03:20,360
I didn't mean I don't want to do that to you.

2282
02:03:20,440 --> 02:03:23,680
No, no. But it's an interesting question, because

2283
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:27,360
it is something I don't think about in the context of performing

2284
02:03:28,040 --> 02:03:33,000
until I had like an audition or I'm doing a show.

2285
02:03:34,160 --> 02:03:36,160
Are we saying that Girls with Guitars

2286
02:03:36,160 --> 02:03:40,880
is a chillingly accurate representation of the performer spotlight?

2287
02:03:41,040 --> 02:03:45,680
Is it like the most gripping what it is like to be in that position?

2288
02:03:45,680 --> 02:03:49,560
Well, it's no it's really not any different from

2289
02:03:50,840 --> 02:03:53,080
B Rabbit choking an eight mile.

2290
02:03:53,080 --> 02:03:55,040
It's like almost the exact same thing.

2291
02:03:55,040 --> 02:03:58,040
So if that has a ton of merit or did when that came out,

2292
02:03:58,040 --> 02:04:00,520
I don't see why we shouldn't maybe get that.

2293
02:04:00,840 --> 02:04:02,440
He does get a second chance, right?

2294
02:04:02,440 --> 02:04:04,440
He comes back and kills it.

2295
02:04:04,560 --> 02:04:06,920
If I'm remembering just like Karen, just like Karen.

2296
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,440
Yeah, she comes back and she feels great.

2297
02:04:09,440 --> 02:04:12,400
I mean, like she's immediately you see her confidence on stage

2298
02:04:12,400 --> 02:04:14,280
when she comes back the second time.

2299
02:04:14,280 --> 02:04:16,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's not even a ramp up.

2300
02:04:16,040 --> 02:04:16,960
It goes great.

2301
02:04:16,960 --> 02:04:20,880
It cuts around to everyone in the family and a bunch of like

2302
02:04:21,360 --> 02:04:24,800
weirdos there for a country music new star night.

2303
02:04:24,800 --> 02:04:29,120
Yeah, the grandmother's French side piece like a stranger she met.

2304
02:04:29,920 --> 02:04:33,000
Oh, yeah. Speaking of Lassie, Lassie's June Lockhart.

2305
02:04:33,080 --> 02:04:35,120
Lassie's June Lockhart. God bless you.

2306
02:04:35,120 --> 02:04:39,080
I guess she was on Lost in Space as well, right?

2307
02:04:39,560 --> 02:04:41,960
Oh, that's right. Yeah.

2308
02:04:41,960 --> 02:04:46,640
Who ultimately solves the problem of that solves Frank

2309
02:04:47,640 --> 02:04:52,240
and Carol's main problem of that they can't find anywhere to have sex

2310
02:04:52,240 --> 02:04:57,720
because she offers up her condo, which is so it works out great.

2311
02:04:57,720 --> 02:05:02,160
They get to sneak away on the last night to his mother's

2312
02:05:02,160 --> 02:05:06,000
Kissimmee condo and have sex in her bed.

2313
02:05:06,720 --> 02:05:10,600
Well, she because she's hooking up with a French guy

2314
02:05:11,280 --> 02:05:12,680
at his place, presumably.

2315
02:05:12,680 --> 02:05:17,200
I think the sound I like the sound of Jason Sheridan's Kissimmee condo, don't you?

2316
02:05:18,760 --> 02:05:20,800
Sounds pretty good if you say it out loud.

2317
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:24,880
Yeah. Well, maybe one thing to mention also, just like the rush

2318
02:05:24,880 --> 02:05:27,320
to do everything at Disney World within four days.

2319
02:05:27,640 --> 02:05:29,520
Sounds like a job for Mike Carlson.

2320
02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:32,040
Do you think you could get the record? Absolutely, I do.

2321
02:05:32,080 --> 02:05:34,800
I absolutely was thinking about this because there's going to be

2322
02:05:35,040 --> 02:05:37,840
we're upcoming episode whenever Disney Genie launches

2323
02:05:37,840 --> 02:05:41,480
and I'm going to compete against the app to do the most stuff in a day.

2324
02:05:42,040 --> 02:05:44,800
It's like, what's the what's the chess program?

2325
02:05:45,120 --> 02:05:47,440
Oh, the deep blue Gary Casper.

2326
02:05:47,440 --> 02:05:49,560
I'm going to be deep blue, basically.

2327
02:05:49,760 --> 02:05:53,040
And planning. But yes, I was watching this going, I bet I could do this

2328
02:05:53,040 --> 02:05:57,360
and I bet I could do this quicker and I could like bring home

2329
02:05:57,360 --> 02:06:01,040
a bigger victory for America for a character who people have spent

2330
02:06:01,040 --> 02:06:02,960
a lot more hours with.

2331
02:06:02,960 --> 02:06:07,360
Flash was coming up on his finishing up his third half hour.

2332
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:09,440
We've done more than that in this episode alone.

2333
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:10,880
A lot more. Yes.

2334
02:06:10,880 --> 02:06:11,720
A good point.

2335
02:06:11,720 --> 02:06:15,640
The fictional character, Mike Carlson, is more beloved.

2336
02:06:15,640 --> 02:06:17,200
OK, faith, like Carlson.

2337
02:06:17,200 --> 02:06:21,280
Yeah. And Flash, the character put the hours in and that's who should it.

2338
02:06:21,480 --> 02:06:23,360
The Russia wasn't the disgrace.

2339
02:06:23,360 --> 02:06:26,640
It was given it to a guy with barely any screen time like Flash.

2340
02:06:26,840 --> 02:06:31,240
I will say, I do feel like Flash maybe had a big advantage

2341
02:06:31,240 --> 02:06:34,520
from what I could tell in that, like concession persons

2342
02:06:34,520 --> 02:06:37,840
and souvenir persons were truly just handing him things.

2343
02:06:37,840 --> 02:06:40,080
There was no money exchange I saw.

2344
02:06:40,080 --> 02:06:44,480
I felt like he just grabbed stuff and that was accomplishing his feet there.

2345
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:49,560
Yeah, at nine dragons, they just hand him the little thing of a Chinese.

2346
02:06:49,560 --> 02:06:51,840
Shrimp, lo mein. Yeah, yeah.

2347
02:06:51,840 --> 02:06:52,720
So you'd have to.

2348
02:06:52,720 --> 02:06:55,920
Yeah, I think it's maybe impossible to do this without the Disney apparatus

2349
02:06:55,920 --> 02:06:59,160
helping you. I think if you explained I'm trying to beat Flash's record,

2350
02:06:59,440 --> 02:07:01,680
the character from step by step, they might help you out.

2351
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:05,520
If we can figure out if somebody can actually like a real like figure out

2352
02:07:05,520 --> 02:07:10,360
exactly what Flash did, let's like write it down on a list and see

2353
02:07:10,360 --> 02:07:13,480
what day by day, how much time it would take us.

2354
02:07:14,120 --> 02:07:16,680
This is complicated because there was no animal kingdom yet.

2355
02:07:16,680 --> 02:07:18,440
So how does that factor in?

2356
02:07:18,440 --> 02:07:20,320
Comes out if it's just you're trying to beat Flash.

2357
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:24,160
I think it has to be what existed, what they had in 1996.

2358
02:07:24,160 --> 02:07:26,040
And then it'll be tricky, though, of course, because they don't have

2359
02:07:26,040 --> 02:07:27,680
quite the same, you know, a lot of stuff.

2360
02:07:27,680 --> 02:07:28,480
That's right.

2361
02:07:28,480 --> 02:07:31,880
Lots of stuff to full strength down there operation wise.

2362
02:07:32,080 --> 02:07:35,720
So you'll yeah, you'll have to figure out like what substitutes rides

2363
02:07:35,880 --> 02:07:37,920
if there's a different ride that exists.

2364
02:07:37,920 --> 02:07:39,280
This is really complicated.

2365
02:07:39,280 --> 02:07:42,200
Well, and it's complicated because you just are going to have to

2366
02:07:42,200 --> 02:07:44,920
skip all the lines and not stop and appreciate them.

2367
02:07:45,280 --> 02:07:49,280
Well, it will be it'll be tough, but I will keep remembering

2368
02:07:49,280 --> 02:07:52,240
what a victory I'm bringing home for the red, white and blue.

2369
02:07:53,040 --> 02:07:55,440
So there's a greater good.

2370
02:07:55,440 --> 02:08:00,040
It's for our country, which was which is hurting so much more so than back then.

2371
02:08:00,040 --> 02:08:02,360
Ninety six. Those are prime times.

2372
02:08:02,360 --> 02:08:05,080
America needs a victory now and you could be that victory.

2373
02:08:05,080 --> 02:08:06,200
Yeah. How about we do this?

2374
02:08:06,200 --> 02:08:07,320
Is there a way to just look up?

2375
02:08:07,320 --> 02:08:11,840
Is there a Russian record for most Disney World stuff done in four days?

2376
02:08:11,840 --> 02:08:16,160
And whatever in real world that exists, if there is a record like that

2377
02:08:16,520 --> 02:08:20,680
specifically done by somebody from Russia, then I will try to beat that.

2378
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:23,760
And that's a cleaner way to do it.

2379
02:08:23,760 --> 02:08:24,720
See, that's going to be hard.

2380
02:08:24,720 --> 02:08:27,040
We're going to have to find like a really neutral source, though,

2381
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:30,160
because our propaganda apparatus would underplay the

2382
02:08:30,920 --> 02:08:35,200
what they did in four days and their propaganda apparatus would would upgrade it.

2383
02:08:35,840 --> 02:08:36,840
Right. OK. Yeah.

2384
02:08:36,840 --> 02:08:38,720
Well, we'll get in the Mueller report.

2385
02:08:38,720 --> 02:08:42,520
Does he get into any of the Russia's Russians doing Disney

2386
02:08:42,520 --> 02:08:45,000
World challenges or I didn't read the whole thing.

2387
02:08:45,040 --> 02:08:47,640
You know, I'm not really sure. I'm so busy saluting him.

2388
02:08:47,880 --> 02:08:49,960
Might be deep in there. They address flash.

2389
02:08:49,960 --> 02:08:51,400
They address the Disney World issue.

2390
02:08:51,400 --> 02:08:52,920
Got it. OK. Yeah. Yeah.

2391
02:08:52,920 --> 02:08:54,960
Well, we'll get you going on this.

2392
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,560
Yeah. Bring bring the record back home to real people

2393
02:08:57,560 --> 02:09:00,560
and not fictional characters who barely appeared on the show. Exactly.

2394
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:04,360
Flash did not come back, by the way, in the next season.

2395
02:09:04,520 --> 02:09:06,760
He was replaced by. Yeah.

2396
02:09:06,760 --> 02:09:10,640
By a Frenchman by Jean-Luc played by Bronson Pinchot.

2397
02:09:10,640 --> 02:09:11,480
Drafted in there.

2398
02:09:11,480 --> 02:09:13,440
Cousin Oliver.

2399
02:09:13,440 --> 02:09:16,040
Right. Our first cousin, Oliver didn't work out this kid.

2400
02:09:16,040 --> 02:09:18,000
Flash, we got a second cousin Oliver coming.

2401
02:09:18,880 --> 02:09:20,200
We should start winding it down.

2402
02:09:20,200 --> 02:09:24,280
The anything else we want to say about these or Kyle having revisited these

2403
02:09:24,280 --> 02:09:28,400
is just any like specific memories or does it just like

2404
02:09:28,640 --> 02:09:32,000
is it flash you bet these like are these your favorite episodes

2405
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:33,560
of some of these shows?

2406
02:09:33,560 --> 02:09:36,040
I mean, I do.

2407
02:09:36,040 --> 02:09:39,120
I know you were saying you think Family Matters is your favorite

2408
02:09:39,120 --> 02:09:41,120
and the best of these three.

2409
02:09:41,120 --> 02:09:45,920
Yeah. I think I had I definitely had the most fun watching step by step.

2410
02:09:45,920 --> 02:09:49,080
And Flash is iconic.

2411
02:09:49,800 --> 02:09:52,480
Yeah. Well, I texted you before that before before we got into this.

2412
02:09:52,480 --> 02:09:54,240
I was like, we were like, what do we do?

2413
02:09:54,240 --> 02:09:56,920
And you said, well, we got to do Family Matters and Full House like,

2414
02:09:56,920 --> 02:09:58,480
oh, we should do step by step.

2415
02:09:58,480 --> 02:10:01,480
It's with the fast guy.

2416
02:10:02,920 --> 02:10:04,320
Yes. Yeah.

2417
02:10:04,320 --> 02:10:05,960
I mean, the fast guy.

2418
02:10:05,960 --> 02:10:10,480
What other episodes have something as short and iconic as that?

2419
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:11,520
What an idea.

2420
02:10:11,520 --> 02:10:13,280
Yeah, no, they're they're also fun.

2421
02:10:13,280 --> 02:10:17,200
And like I said, I love like we were talking about those moments

2422
02:10:18,240 --> 02:10:21,680
where these characters are forced to sort of be off the cuff.

2423
02:10:22,240 --> 02:10:24,360
And like kind of riffing on rides.

2424
02:10:25,120 --> 02:10:28,240
I think there's probably like more moments that if I went through all

2425
02:10:28,800 --> 02:10:31,920
all three of these, we could find little times where they're like kind of

2426
02:10:32,480 --> 02:10:37,000
ad libbing, like you were saying, not even correctly referencing rides.

2427
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,200
But I don't know any of these things.

2428
02:10:39,200 --> 02:10:42,200
It's fun when you see your favorite characters

2429
02:10:42,200 --> 02:10:44,520
like taken somewhere entirely new.

2430
02:10:44,520 --> 02:10:46,920
So I had a great time watching.

2431
02:10:46,920 --> 02:10:49,120
Interesting that they're all two partners.

2432
02:10:49,120 --> 02:10:51,400
Yeah, which I think makes them fit together nicely.

2433
02:10:51,400 --> 02:10:53,360
We left out Boy Meets World really quickly.

2434
02:10:53,360 --> 02:10:57,760
A big thing that happened then later is that Dana from Step by Step

2435
02:10:57,760 --> 02:11:00,320
shows up in the Boy Meets World episode.

2436
02:11:00,600 --> 02:11:01,920
Like they were there.

2437
02:11:01,920 --> 02:11:05,600
They kept Dana in Disney World in time.

2438
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:09,480
And she went and visited Corey and Boy Meets World on the same night of TGIF.

2439
02:11:09,880 --> 02:11:13,240
Wow. But it's sort of, you know, it's a different format.

2440
02:11:13,240 --> 02:11:14,360
It's not the two parter.

2441
02:11:14,360 --> 02:11:16,280
They don't spend as much time in Disney World.

2442
02:11:16,280 --> 02:11:18,040
I figured it makes sense to leave it out. Right.

2443
02:11:18,040 --> 02:11:19,200
Focus on these focus.

2444
02:11:19,200 --> 02:11:23,520
And I saw also there was outside of TGIF, there was a Blossom

2445
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:26,480
and a Roseanne around the same time that also do.

2446
02:11:26,760 --> 02:11:27,520
Yeah.

2447
02:11:27,520 --> 02:11:30,160
Boston to Disneyland, Roseanne to Disney World,

2448
02:11:30,600 --> 02:11:32,840
and then later Modern Family and Blackish.

2449
02:11:32,840 --> 02:11:36,320
But when I haven't seen those, I don't know what they did, but it's tough to top

2450
02:11:36,760 --> 02:11:41,520
Jesse and the Rippers on the white piano, the transformation chamber, the fast guy,

2451
02:11:42,760 --> 02:11:48,160
his American flag jacket triumphant on the the Cinderella Castle stage.

2452
02:11:48,160 --> 02:11:50,920
I mean, these are all these are all wonderful moments.

2453
02:11:50,920 --> 02:11:56,040
And it's it's awesome to go back into them and awesome to just remember

2454
02:11:56,880 --> 02:11:59,240
and meditate for a little bit on the but master.

2455
02:11:59,240 --> 02:12:01,680
So thank you for bringing that to our attention.

2456
02:12:02,160 --> 02:12:05,160
Yeah, I really feel bad about the master stuff.

2457
02:12:06,680 --> 02:12:09,000
I feel bad, too, now.

2458
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:10,480
It's just I feel bad for it.

2459
02:12:10,480 --> 02:12:14,680
I actually to me, I almost I actually almost this was a scenario

2460
02:12:14,680 --> 02:12:15,440
I almost forgot about.

2461
02:12:15,440 --> 02:12:17,320
I forgot about the but master for a while.

2462
02:12:17,320 --> 02:12:19,720
And now it's now it's back.

2463
02:12:19,720 --> 02:12:22,000
I've done a little.

2464
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:24,520
I brought back a dark memory.

2465
02:12:24,520 --> 02:12:29,560
It's now like but mass, but Master Gate is like the scandal

2466
02:12:30,520 --> 02:12:31,400
now on.

2467
02:12:32,600 --> 02:12:34,840
So but yeah, I feel bad.

2468
02:12:34,840 --> 02:12:36,720
I'm going to feel bad all the rest of the day.

2469
02:12:36,720 --> 02:12:38,200
We know you please don't, Mike.

2470
02:12:38,200 --> 02:12:40,640
I'm so thankful that you call me out on that.

2471
02:12:40,640 --> 02:12:44,680
And I'm also thankful that you were able to reaffirm the argument

2472
02:12:44,680 --> 02:12:50,440
I was trying to make wherein we don't know what what in our universe exists

2473
02:12:50,440 --> 02:12:54,280
and what it's it's a it's a consistent, cohesive logic

2474
02:12:54,280 --> 02:12:58,120
in pointing out things that are, yeah, invented based on the information

2475
02:12:58,120 --> 02:13:00,840
we had at the time, the but master was relevant.

2476
02:13:00,960 --> 02:13:03,720
It being a real thing is relevant.

2477
02:13:03,720 --> 02:13:05,960
I'm glad we know about it.

2478
02:13:05,960 --> 02:13:09,160
Thank you, Kyle, but master Mooney for her.

2479
02:13:09,560 --> 02:13:10,960
Bring it to the table.

2480
02:13:10,960 --> 02:13:13,240
You survived podcast the ride.

2481
02:13:14,080 --> 02:13:16,760
Your car, that's a that's a nickname to be comfortable with, right?

2482
02:13:16,800 --> 02:13:18,360
You feel you feel fine about that?

2483
02:13:18,360 --> 02:13:21,000
Yeah, about the but master stuff.

2484
02:13:22,520 --> 02:13:23,160
We'll leave it. All right.

2485
02:13:23,160 --> 02:13:26,000
We're leaving it behind. It stays in this episode.

2486
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,320
Let's exit through the gift shop.

2487
02:13:28,320 --> 02:13:31,840
I know that you have something to plug, but we've been talking about

2488
02:13:32,560 --> 02:13:36,080
this is a block of 90s television with an acronym

2489
02:13:36,080 --> 02:13:40,720
meant to air on a specific day of the week, which is applicable to your new show.

2490
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:43,240
Saturday morning, all star hits.

2491
02:13:43,240 --> 02:13:44,360
Let's talk about that.

2492
02:13:44,360 --> 02:13:47,160
Yes, our our new show, Scott.

2493
02:13:47,720 --> 02:13:51,760
Well, I mean, like, I feel like people have made it this far

2494
02:13:51,960 --> 02:13:55,600
past all the but master and flash stuff.

2495
02:13:55,600 --> 02:13:57,640
They skipped to the end for the promotion.

2496
02:13:57,640 --> 02:13:59,880
They only want to hear the promotion.

2497
02:13:59,880 --> 02:14:04,240
Yeah, no, this is super relevant in the sense that like TGIF was something

2498
02:14:04,240 --> 02:14:08,880
we were thinking about when Ben Jones and I, who co-created the show

2499
02:14:09,440 --> 02:14:10,960
with myself.

2500
02:14:11,320 --> 02:14:13,600
When we first started talking about

2501
02:14:13,600 --> 02:14:16,680
this seed of an idea, like I was definitely talking about TGIF

2502
02:14:16,680 --> 02:14:20,880
and the idea of doing that condensed experience in a half hour in our show.

2503
02:14:21,520 --> 02:14:25,160
We tried to do that essentially for the Saturday morning cartoon experience.

2504
02:14:25,160 --> 02:14:27,200
So it's called Saturday morning, all star hits.

2505
02:14:27,200 --> 02:14:29,080
The acronym is Smash.

2506
02:14:29,080 --> 02:14:33,240
And Scott was a big part of bringing it to life.

2507
02:14:33,840 --> 02:14:38,360
And yeah, we tried to essentially replicate

2508
02:14:39,440 --> 02:14:42,560
that Saturday morning TV viewing experience.

2509
02:14:42,560 --> 02:14:45,920
So like we have kind of our own versions of

2510
02:14:46,880 --> 02:14:52,120
late 80s, early 90s cartoons all condensed into a 30 minute block.

2511
02:14:52,120 --> 02:14:54,840
But then the show evolves and it was really fun.

2512
02:14:54,840 --> 02:14:59,840
And I think we did a pretty good job of sort of replicating

2513
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:02,280
the experience of of TV of the era.

2514
02:15:02,280 --> 02:15:03,760
I don't know. What do you think, Scott?

2515
02:15:03,760 --> 02:15:07,360
I think so. Thank you for the credit on it.

2516
02:15:07,360 --> 02:15:10,800
I'm like I'm thrilled and proud to be part of it.

2517
02:15:10,800 --> 02:15:14,680
It's surreal to even be actually talking about it as a tangible thing.

2518
02:15:14,680 --> 02:15:17,080
And within the podcast, the ride setting.

2519
02:15:17,080 --> 02:15:21,600
And it does feel like excited to be doing this relevant to to what I imagine

2520
02:15:22,040 --> 02:15:23,800
your listeners are into.

2521
02:15:23,800 --> 02:15:26,040
And like there's almost like some like

2522
02:15:27,040 --> 02:15:29,760
certainly Disney afternoon parallels, I would say.

2523
02:15:29,760 --> 02:15:31,640
So for sure, that's what I was like.

2524
02:15:31,640 --> 02:15:35,840
It's that kind of like the show is like it's a bunch of blocks of TV

2525
02:15:35,840 --> 02:15:39,120
taped off of TV like you're watching it on a VHS later.

2526
02:15:39,280 --> 02:15:43,160
And if listeners watch the Disney afternoon where shows would come in and out

2527
02:15:43,360 --> 02:15:46,400
like now, there's gummy bears, but gummy bears is retired

2528
02:15:46,400 --> 02:15:47,800
and Goof Troops coming in.

2529
02:15:47,800 --> 02:15:51,280
That's kind of what happens within the single season of Saturday morning.

2530
02:15:51,280 --> 02:15:54,680
All star hits like, you know, there's entire mini shows.

2531
02:15:54,680 --> 02:15:56,760
And then the show ends and a new one comes in.

2532
02:15:56,760 --> 02:16:00,920
But there's also this this through line with the hosts of the show,

2533
02:16:01,120 --> 02:16:04,760
the live action hosts, both played by Kyle, Skip and Treyboar,

2534
02:16:04,920 --> 02:16:09,040
who are kind of it's it really is the Urkel ization or the Cody effect.

2535
02:16:09,040 --> 02:16:16,760
I was almost I'm 99 percent sure, like in the pitching of this show,

2536
02:16:16,760 --> 02:16:19,960
we had like Skip and Treble or, you know, like think

2537
02:16:21,040 --> 02:16:25,760
Bill and Ted Dan Cortez, Cody from Step by Step.

2538
02:16:25,760 --> 02:16:29,400
Like I think Cody was may have been the reason why Netflix

2539
02:16:29,960 --> 02:16:31,840
decided to make this TV show. I don't know.

2540
02:16:31,840 --> 02:16:32,600
But I think so.

2541
02:16:32,600 --> 02:16:36,040
I mean, yeah, knowing that you could have a new Cody on your hands.

2542
02:16:36,040 --> 02:16:38,640
Yes. What that times to your cash flow.

2543
02:16:38,960 --> 02:16:42,600
Well, and on my end, Kyle, that you you set up a scenario

2544
02:16:42,600 --> 02:16:45,480
where beyond like the dream team of people to work with you,

2545
02:16:45,480 --> 02:16:49,480
Ben Jones, animation and art genius, Dave McCarrie,

2546
02:16:49,480 --> 02:16:51,880
your your awesome friend and director,

2547
02:16:51,880 --> 02:16:56,000
besides working with all you guys and and getting to write so much fun stuff,

2548
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:59,160
truly like kind of realizing that and like, oh, I'm like,

2549
02:16:59,160 --> 02:17:02,400
I'm like getting to write stuff for Cody, basically.

2550
02:17:02,680 --> 02:17:07,920
This is as close as I can come to writing for Step by Step in 1994.

2551
02:17:08,200 --> 02:17:10,680
So for that, I really got to thank you most.

2552
02:17:10,880 --> 02:17:13,080
Well, when we were taught, we were.

2553
02:17:13,080 --> 02:17:16,600
Yes, subs are a running theme in our show.

2554
02:17:17,680 --> 02:17:21,480
And I don't know when some sandwiches are like occupy the place of pizza

2555
02:17:21,480 --> 02:17:26,040
within this, like what pizza was to the turtles subs are in this world.

2556
02:17:26,280 --> 02:17:28,800
And certainly when I was like, when we were talking about Cody

2557
02:17:28,800 --> 02:17:32,600
and maybe what makes him cool or the idea of him being cool,

2558
02:17:32,600 --> 02:17:36,880
like that image came in my head of like somebody eating a sub sandwich

2559
02:17:36,880 --> 02:17:39,920
on one of these shows always felt like a very cool thing.

2560
02:17:41,640 --> 02:17:46,160
Well, Carl Winslow, like I, you know, that that's his dream day is like

2561
02:17:46,160 --> 02:17:52,040
he's settling down for a sub until Urkel making a massive super tall sub.

2562
02:17:53,800 --> 02:17:56,200
Is this a Jason dream to potentially build?

2563
02:17:56,520 --> 02:17:59,920
Like it should be, if you haven't, is just like building the ultimate

2564
02:18:00,040 --> 02:18:02,120
too big to eat in one day sandwich.

2565
02:18:02,120 --> 02:18:04,600
You know, I try to leave that to the professionals.

2566
02:18:06,800 --> 02:18:08,840
I like to sandwich artists, if you will.

2567
02:18:08,840 --> 02:18:10,760
Yeah. I'd like to see you try.

2568
02:18:10,760 --> 02:18:14,760
Look, if you like, if you like subs, if you like cartoons,

2569
02:18:14,760 --> 02:18:19,680
if you like TGIF or the Disney afternoon, if you like classic Vio people,

2570
02:18:19,680 --> 02:18:23,400
we have so many amazing Maurice LaMarche and Frank Welker

2571
02:18:23,400 --> 02:18:26,000
and Eric Bowser and Chris Summer and all those people.

2572
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,560
Like amazing voice talent as part of this thing.

2573
02:18:28,760 --> 02:18:32,720
And if you like Kyle Mooney, if you like your old pal Scott,

2574
02:18:32,720 --> 02:18:37,160
I think listeners, you will really enjoy Saturday morning All-Star hits.

2575
02:18:38,120 --> 02:18:43,520
I enjoyed working on it more than almost anything I've ever been a part of.

2576
02:18:43,520 --> 02:18:46,040
So thank you, Kyle. Sincerely.

2577
02:18:46,040 --> 02:18:49,560
And look, not not to be too sincere, not to make things awkward, but no,

2578
02:18:49,560 --> 02:18:50,520
I really appreciate it.

2579
02:18:50,520 --> 02:18:53,120
And like, you know, this is truly the beginning of my

2580
02:18:54,120 --> 02:18:57,240
of my press and support for for the show.

2581
02:18:57,600 --> 02:19:00,760
And I'm just really sorry about the but master stuff.

2582
02:19:02,160 --> 02:19:05,920
Do you think you'll bring any but master oriented material to any?

2583
02:19:05,920 --> 02:19:09,240
I think this is that you I think I'm going on Seth's show.

2584
02:19:09,240 --> 02:19:11,880
And it's like you have podcasts the other day.

2585
02:19:12,080 --> 02:19:15,160
You know, the but master is a real thing.

2586
02:19:15,160 --> 02:19:17,320
They brought it. I thought it was like a joke on a sitcom.

2587
02:19:18,440 --> 02:19:20,120
They actually made this thing.

2588
02:19:20,120 --> 02:19:22,160
We have a picture, if you want to come to that.

2589
02:19:22,160 --> 02:19:25,360
I don't think it'll get you.

2590
02:19:25,360 --> 02:19:27,800
I don't know what's going to do any gotcha journalism on you.

2591
02:19:27,800 --> 02:19:31,200
Hopefully I'm going to be the only one who will have done it during this press tour.

2592
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:33,880
It's right. And I think that's why we ran you through the ringer,

2593
02:19:33,880 --> 02:19:37,240
because we know that you have you got big shows to do.

2594
02:19:37,240 --> 02:19:38,600
We want you to kill it on there.

2595
02:19:38,600 --> 02:19:40,760
And now now I think you will.

2596
02:19:40,760 --> 02:19:43,480
Well, I always have a great time with you guys and it's good to see you.

2597
02:19:43,480 --> 02:19:45,320
And I'm sorry I couldn't be there in person.

2598
02:19:45,320 --> 02:19:46,400
Yeah. Yeah, no.

2599
02:19:46,400 --> 02:19:48,800
Thanks for making time in New York. A lot of time.

2600
02:19:48,800 --> 02:19:51,360
I'm again embarrassed by the runtime.

2601
02:19:51,640 --> 02:19:54,960
This happens. It happened with you before Star Tours was very long.

2602
02:19:54,960 --> 02:19:56,680
Look, this is how we do.

2603
02:19:56,680 --> 02:19:57,920
Check out Saturday morning.

2604
02:19:57,920 --> 02:19:59,520
I'll start it on Netflix.

2605
02:19:59,520 --> 02:20:02,120
Eight episodes all available today.

2606
02:20:02,240 --> 02:20:04,680
I guess. Yeah. And stick with the show.

2607
02:20:05,160 --> 02:20:07,400
It's fun all the way through. So stick with it.

2608
02:20:07,840 --> 02:20:11,680
Oh, yeah. Yeah. There's like I think there's an evolution and changes and surprises

2609
02:20:11,920 --> 02:20:16,160
and, you know, a lot in store as it as it evolves. Absolutely.

2610
02:20:16,160 --> 02:20:19,080
So Saturday morning, I'll start it on Netflix right now.

2611
02:20:19,240 --> 02:20:22,040

2615
02:20:34,440 --> 02:20:36,080
And we've already started recording it.

2616
02:20:36,080 --> 02:20:39,000
So we know these aren't short either.

2617
02:20:39,040 --> 02:20:41,600
So load up for the winter.

2618
02:20:41,880 --> 02:20:44,360
You've got a lot to hibernate with. What's that?

2619
02:20:44,360 --> 02:20:47,520
We've been doing so well with like the I runtime reasonable.

2620
02:20:47,640 --> 02:20:50,480
I feel like and then all of a sudden in the last week and a half,

2621
02:20:50,480 --> 02:20:54,240
it was like the Springsteen concert length are back

2622
02:20:55,280 --> 02:20:56,920
