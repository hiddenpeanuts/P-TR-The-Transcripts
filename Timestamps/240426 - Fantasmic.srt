1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Warning!

Teacher Angering Green Ink,

spectacular, Fantasmic.

for the rest of the day.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's Podcast The Ride!

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Music

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride,

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
a podcast that is once again

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
about theme parks after a month-long

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
diversion into a different topic,

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
food poisoning. I'm Scott Gardner,

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
joined by Jason Sheridan.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Hi, I just narrowly avoided

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
to the measles outbreak,

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Bucatipepo.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Oh, Bucatipepo did, yeah.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Bethy said me this,

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Bucatipepo, a place where

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
people may have been exposed

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
to measles at the end of March.

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Now I assume from that that we're still

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
living in the alternate universe

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
in which it is Bucatipepo.

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yes, that seems like

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
that's what we are doing.

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Okay, so canonically from this point on,

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Mike Carlson, hi. I'm here and I was also

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
sent a list of city walk places

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
that might have been the epicenter

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
of a measles outbreak.

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Okay, I don't know anything about this.

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
No, I've missed this entirely.

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
If you can imagine that I'm not exactly staying up on

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
city walk news now. We should keep doing

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
more city walk, but I think we have to do this

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
because there was a press release

45
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
April 13th, 2024,

46
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Public Health confirms measles case

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
in Los Angeles County health officials

48
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
identify locations for possible measles exposure.

49
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And if you go down the list,

50
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Bucatipepo,

51
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
if we're playing

52
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Bucatipepo in a different universe,

53
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Cletus' Chicken Shack is on the list.

54
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yeah, Universal Studios is also.

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Lardlad Donuts and

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
EC Food Truck is on the list.

57
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Sheraton Gateway

58
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Hotel is on the list.

59
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Oh no, the hotels too.

60
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So yes, I was sent this yesterday

61
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
as well.

62
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And so yeah, city walk, we just,

63
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I think narrowly avoided

64
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
a measles outbreak. Wow, we got out just in time.

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
My god. Yeah.

66
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Especially because the two of you

67
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
would have been like, oh it was probably from somewhere.

68
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Probably both of our cases of

69
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
measles. Surely it can't have been city walk.

70
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Yeah, well we wouldn't have blamed city walk if we

71
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
caught the measles in our

72
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
30s and 40s. If it had started up there,

73
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
then it must have flown down

74
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
from the famously windy food court

75
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
all the way down to the bottom of the hill

76
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
and we caught it there.

77
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The conditions can't have been such up there.

78
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Unless they were like ancient

79
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
measles unlocked from some old, from like

80
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
a Wampoppers or something, from the old

81
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
restaurant outside city walk. I mean it's possible.

82
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Oh yeah, they were doing construction on this

83
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
new roller coaster. They unearthed

84
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
some meat. Oh, and they unearthed a bunch of meat?

85
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
A 30 year old strain of measles that was

86
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
in the ground. A group of

87
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
early California settlers.

88
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Like a Donner family type group.

89
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Right. A group that succumbed to the

90
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
measles on the Cahuenga Hills.

91
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Right. And now it's been this living

92
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
in amber, some sort of amber casing

93
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
like Jurassic Park.

94
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And then yes, as they were, the bulldozers

95
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
were just knocking down parts of the hill.

96
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The amber was broken.

97
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And measles were unleashed on the Buca

98
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
de Beppo. Pepo.

99
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Was it on purpose

100
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
or not, Jason?

101
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
No, I just got too excited about

102
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I have news about a measles

103
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
outbreak. And I said Pepo

104
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
so many times during the series.

105
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
After that entire thing, you still haven't figured it out.

106
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You know what? I hope it never

107
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
changes. Ain't I a stinker?

108
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You just keep doing you, Jason.

109
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Well yeah, I didn't mean

110
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
to do a whole reprisal. This is important

111
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
news. And I'd like to thank my

112
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
friends for not texting me

113
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
about this. For knowing that I was

114
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
emotionally done. And we didn't text you about

115
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
it either. Everyone made the correct

116
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
calculation. Because while that was

117
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
a lot of fun, I'm

118
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
done. I'd say that I'm done.

119
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And I'm excited to be veering back this way.

120
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
That said, listeners, this is the

121
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
first main feed since the City Walk

122
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Orlando Saga. Thank you for all the kind

123
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
words about that. For the support of that.

124
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I did have a blast. And I would

125
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
like to just make sure at

126
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
the top here to dedicate this and every

127
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
episode from now on to our friend

128
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Stephen Kepner. Just the podcast

129
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
from this point on. I agree.

130
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Now Mr. Kepner,

131
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
in his infinite wisdom,

132
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
during the saga in one of the final

133
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
episodes, he asked us

134
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
is this still a theme park podcast?

135
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And I think

136
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
this episode we will attempt

137
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
to answer that question

138
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
to be yes. Yes.

139
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Measles Diversion or no.

140
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
That's part of it though. We're still

141
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
on topic. Yes. Well, yeah, of

142
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
course. If it came from the

143
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Bumblebee food truck itself,

144
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
then Cletus the Chicken Jack is in the theme park.

145
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Cletus the Chicken Jack is in the theme park.

146
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Emphatically, yes is what I'm saying

147
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
to the question. And that's why I

148
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
am covered in measles. Oh,

149
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
no. All right. Well, it's, you know,

150
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
if it's a thing at theme parks, then

151
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
it is our obligation to try it.

152
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So let's try, let's find out what having

153
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
theme park specific measles is like.

154
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Jason, I thank you for bringing it here today.

155
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Absolutely. It's time. We're doing the

156
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
old chicken pox party.

157
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Universal's

158
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
new tagline is get infected

159
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
by the movies.

160
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And that's what

161
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
we're doing. That ties together because

162
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
there are, there is an unfortunate

163
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
tagline involved in today's

164
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
topic. Yeah, there is.

165
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
All right. Well, why don't we check in with

166
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
the, oh, wait, that's not how it works

167
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
anymore. We have to say it

168
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
ourselves. Today's topic,

169
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
phantasmic. And we,

170
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
asking ourselves, where do

171
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
we go from here? A big

172
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
question post saga. We landed

173
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
at this. We landed at, you know, wanted

174
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
to do something primary theme

175
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
parky Disney, which got no love

176
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
for a month. And they've got to be hurting

177
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
and not getting the love from us, the

178
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
boys. So we're back to

179
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Disneyland. We're back to a big theme parky

180
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
thing, something that's

181
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
pretty epic, historic,

182
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
timeless that

183
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
we hope, I mean, it's on

184
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
hiatus now, but we hope that it

185
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
never leaves the park otherwise.

186
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And that

187
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I assume for all the things

188
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
that have been embattled in the recent past that

189
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
we've talked about, I'm going to take a guess here

190
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
and say that the three of us are all very passionate

191
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
about phantasmic.

192
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
If not passionate, then we like it.

193
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I was going to say I like it. I don't know where

194
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
my, when we discuss my passion,

195
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
when we discuss my passions,

196
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
which we do often on this show,

197
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I don't know that it's, yeah, passion, but I do,

198
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I like it. I really like it. Yeah, well, I backed up.

199
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I didn't mean to overdo it. No, it's okay.

200
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Passion is a big word. Passion you say for your love,

201
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
you give that to your love, but not necessarily

202
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
But you've, you've exposed now that you're

203
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
passionate for phantasmic, which I appreciate it.

204
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Okay. I don't know if that's a

205
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
correct calculation, but

206
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I do, I do really love it.

207
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Um, you know,

208
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I haven't, I haven't gone to see it

209
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
in a long time. So that's why I think I'd be

210
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
misbilling it, calling

211
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
myself passionate about it. Yeah.

212
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
But you know what I associate it with

213
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
is growing up here and going

214
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
to Disneyland as my home park more

215
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
than you guys. I obviously loved

216
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Disneyland every time that I went

217
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
and I must have been three or four times before

218
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
phantasmic, but there was something

219
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
about when this kicked in,

220
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
like, wow, we are cooking

221
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
now. In 1992, May

222
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
1992, this thing premieres

223
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
and we're still

224
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
in Disney decade era. It's

225
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
before they decided there is no Disney

226
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
decade. It was right after the debut

227
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
of Disneyland Paris,

228
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
if you're at Disneyland, which killed

229
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
the ambition of everything for a while. So

230
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
this was still very much

231
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
in ambition era.

232
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Um, you know, we're getting to an eight.

233
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I must have seen it for the first time when I was

234
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
seven years old. And

235
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
now I'm getting to stay

236
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
up late. Now it's not these quick

237
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
little kid pop-ins, which now

238
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
you've done, Mike, I think since the last

239
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
record. Uh, or

240
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I don't remember when you did it,

241
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
but we'll get into that at some point. Sure.

242
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Your child's first Disneyland happened.

243
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
But you know, you do these things a little bit

244
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
low ambition. You get out of there

245
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
early. You get them to bed at a fairly regular

246
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
time. Uh, and that's the kind of Disneyland

247
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I was doing. And now

248
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
there's a big nighttime spectacular.

249
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm old enough to stay up

250
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
for it. Every new thing

251
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
they add is killer.

252
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Like, what did this, what did this come

253
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
after? Was it post Toontown

254
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
or was it on the way to, I think

255
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
it's post. I think it's on the way. It's

256
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
post Star Tours, definitely. Yeah, yeah,

257
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
for sure. And on the way to Toontown,

258
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
on the way to Indiana Jones,

259
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
and you just feel like they're in a streak.

260
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
They're in an incredible streak that this

261
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
thing, uh, keeps up

262
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
and just adds something. They, I guess

263
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Splash Mountain is one that I'm missing.

264
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Not that I've done it by that point.

265
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Um, but what a killer time.

266
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Between Splash Mountain and Indiana Jones

267
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
and Toontown,

268
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
all killers in this era,

269
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
and they add something that's not just

270
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
some nighttime show. It's a show

271
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
that expands the scope

272
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
of what a nighttime show can be,

273
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
the ambition, technology

274
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
you've never seen before that is now

275
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
a part of any

276
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
nighttime show

277
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
worth its, uh, worth its salt.

278
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Do you, do you have

279
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
a memory of, like, just, I, just the idea

280
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
that they're using for Disneyland

281
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
the, like, the rivers

282
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
and, like, just that whole

283
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
area now is a stage for a crazy

284
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
show. To me, I feel like as a kid, if I was like

285
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
they didn't have a show there before and now

286
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
there's a show happening in what used to

287
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
just be, like, a river way, or

288
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
a river and just, like, Tom Sawyer Island.

289
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Absolutely. Like, that must have been pretty

290
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
crazy to be like, holy shit, you can do

291
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
a show anywhere? Anywhere could be a show.

292
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Anywhere, yeah, you don't know,

293
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
well, and that's, and that's before, you know,

294
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
the, the, the jammeters. Sure.

295
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
That's before now, even with, oh,

296
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
that's just the custodians going by, wait a

297
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
minute, hang on, they're banging on, now

298
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
really a show can be anywhere. Now we're used

299
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
to the idea. Yeah, absolutely. It

300
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
adds to, it, it adds to the magic

301
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
that, like, they didn't add new

302
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
space, they didn't buy new property

303
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
and yet they opened up a

304
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
space where a lot of magic can happen

305
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
and I think it adds to the magic

306
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
day to day at the park, where, yeah, you're looking

307
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
at, like, during the day, that's some

308
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
rusty old shack, but at night

309
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
it explodes with Mickey's

310
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
imagination. Yeah. And the boats,

311
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
the Mark Twain. Yeah, I was going to say,

312
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
adding on to that, it uses both

313
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
boats. Right, and the day, Mark Twain

314
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
is a shitty, boring old boat.

315
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Yeah, just a real

316
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
creeker, just a seasickness

317
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
machine. Yeah, but then at night

318
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
that's when it really shines, that's

319
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
when I like it. During the day, get the hell

320
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
out of here, I wish it would sink. You gave me a ride

321
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
here and now you have to get me a ride home and I'm

322
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
going to be bawling.

323
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
In the car?

324
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Just sobbing

325
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
in Mike's car.

326
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Why did you say that? I kept it together during

327
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
the record. I kept it together, I'm a

328
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
professional.

329
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Now that it's you and me,

330
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I want you to see my hurt.

331
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I've never asked you to edit comments

332
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
out of a show before.

333
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
That's a lie. You've insulted

334
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
me hundreds of times

335
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
and I've never asked, but this one time

336
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
you've gone too far, sir. Any

337
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
MAGA thing you want to say, that's fine,

338
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
feel free, but you

339
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
insult my boat. Don't insult my boat,

340
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
sir. That's right, Mike, we cut a lot of

341
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Mike's MAGA rants.

342
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
That's right.

343
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
They all go three hours and we cut an hour

344
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
ten every time. Yeah, I take a little

345
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
nap touring them.

346
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Look, this is one of my criticisms

347
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
of Fantastic,

348
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
is, I love a peaceful

349
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
nighttime Mark Twain ride.

350
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Ooh,

351
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
interesting. And it's taking that away

352
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
from you. Me and the three little pigs,

353
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
they get to ride nighttime Mark Twain,

354
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
but not Jason.

355
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Yeah, Buzz Lightyear

356
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
gets to go on it. He's from space.

357
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
He shouldn't even be in an old timey

358
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
steamboat. That doesn't make sense.

359
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
He's hanging out

360
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
at infinity and beyond

361
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
and I can't even ride the

362
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
little boat in the little rivers

363
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
of America. He has everything he could ever dream

364
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
of. He has everything. This is like, what are you

365
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
being jealous of, Buzz? I don't want to be controversial

366
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
here, but right away, let me ask a question,

367
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Jason. If,

368
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
okay, how many, Fantasmic doesn't run every night,

369
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
but would you prefer Fantasmic

370
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
to go away so you always have the option

371
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
to ride the Mark Twain?

372
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
No, I don't think I would

373
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
go that far. Okay, but how far

374
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
would you go?

375
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I don't mind being close for a year

376
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
plus.

377
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Has the year, wait here,

378
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
continue your line of questioning. I was just going to say, once a

379
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
week, how many times do you think would be acceptable

380
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
for Fantasmic to run? Oh, I think

381
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
half and a half would be fair.

382
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Well, what gets the four days, though?

383
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
What gets the three? What gets the four?

384
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Mark Twain gets four days.

385
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Okay, would you prefer weekends

386
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
for the Mark Twain or weekends

387
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
for the Mark Twain? This is a custody battle now.

388
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I think a lot of, during

389
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
slower times, I think Fantasmic

390
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
mostly runs

391
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Friday through Sunday. I would think

392
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
because it's a high capacity show and

393
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
that's when more people are there. It might want it that

394
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
way. They probably want to do less

395
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
shows. They like it. They actually like it.

396
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
They like the breaks to recharge

397
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
and maybe some of them, maybe the people who work so hard

398
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
on Fantasmic can take a break,

399
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
take a little moonlight boat ride

400
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
as long as they don't get in Jason's way.

401
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Do you have a spot on there

402
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
if you're doing it late? Do you want to be on top?

403
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Are you a top or a bottom?

404
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Mark Twain wise?

405
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Definitely tops. I think second or

406
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
third. At least second

407
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
if not third level

408
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
than Mark Twain.

409
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Now,

410
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Fantasmic going down

411
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
for a year and we are still, and actually, you know

412
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
we picked this topic, didn't even realize

413
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
that we are, this week

414
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
is a year since

415
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
the fire which took down

416
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
the dragon that factors

417
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
that's the main part of the climax

418
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
of the show. I mean, well, Jason would call the climax

419
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
the boat going by. Unless

420
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
it makes you mad. Unless it ends

421
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
the boat goes by and

422
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
you're just in a jealous rage.

423
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
They usually have to pry me off the fence.

424
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Yeah, because I'm like, okay, if I really

425
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
leap

426
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I can get on there.

427
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And you come equipped with, you bring

428
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
your own little Cogsworth costume

429
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
so that you can maybe blend in as one of the characters.

430
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Just bring streamers

431
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
dress up like a little clock and then maybe

432
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
they'll let you just be on it. Yeah, I'm multitasking.

433
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm climbing the fence.

434
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm putting my Cogsworth outfit on.

435
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's like that scene in The Fugitive where Harrison

436
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Ford's in the St. Patrick's Day parade

437
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
and he kind of slips into a costume and he goes right

438
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
on. So Jason puts the Cogsworth hat on

439
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
and slips right on the Mark Twain

440
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
finale. Or like the Joker being

441
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
in the group of all the policemen

442
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
at the funeral.

443
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
But you're not after any Joker activity.

444
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You just want a nice little boat ride. Anyway,

445
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I was saying

446
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
this week is a year since

447
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
The Dragon fell, thus creating

448
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
a year of No

449
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Fantasmic. Do we know, has

450
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
that opened up more nighttime

451
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Mark Twain abilities? Or do they

452
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
stop running that at a certain point?

453
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I don't know specifically

454
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
the schedule of the Mark Twain. I am sure

455
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
that on certain nights, if not all

456
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
nights, they run Mark Twain later.

457
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
But I could be wrong. I don't know

458
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
actually. This is something I should have looked into.

459
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
But I didn't even think about what

460
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
would happen to Jason's beloved Mark Twain.

461
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And I believe Fantasmic coming

462
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
back at the end of May.

463
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Yes, for sure. So we are

464
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
about to break the

465
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
hiatus and see

466
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
what they have cooked up

467
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
in the meantime. And we'll talk about

468
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
some of what the show was before

469
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
before we get into the changes.

470
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
But here's something that I didn't realize.

471
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I thought, show coming

472
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
back, so that means we get Dragon

473
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Mach 3. We get to the

474
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
third Fantasmic Dragon.

475
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
But now I'm looking into it.

476
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
It's coming back. No Dragon. Didn't

477
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
realize that. Yeah.

478
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I don't know. I don't know.

479
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
This is like a primary facet

480
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
of it, of the billboards, of any

481
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
imagery of it that there's ever been over

482
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
these many decades. This is one of

483
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
those things where I start to get

484
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
conspiratorial. I start to get

485
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
like conspiracy brain.

486
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Where I go, well what is the...

487
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Did they set the dragon on fire?

488
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
For insurance money?

489
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
We are back to one of the

490
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
things, this ranking that we kind of

491
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
stopped doing, the burning things down for insurance

492
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
money. This is, yeah, it could be a

493
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
possible version of that.

494
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Why wouldn't it be back? Why wouldn't they just build a new one?

495
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It's pretty convenient that that's something

496
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
they don't want to bring back.

497
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Maybe they don't want to bring it back because it almost

498
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
shot a bunch of flames into people.

499
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Well, I'm just saying though, it was

500
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
spectacular, and you just make the flame safer

501
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
somehow. I don't know.

502
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
But the conspiracy brain,

503
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
here's where, I think the conspiracy

504
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
brain gets into dangerous territory

505
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
when you start

506
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
accusing the company of

507
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
like, well you realize if we

508
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
light it on fire on purpose, it could shoot

509
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
jets of flame from its mouth,

510
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
and if it's not angled just right,

511
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
it might go into the crowd. And you're saying

512
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
like, I don't know if it was Eiger or

513
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Chapek at that point, but somebody's like,

514
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
maybe. And then just turns and leaves

515
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
the room. Well, it'll save us a hundred thousand

516
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
dollars.

517
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It would only have torched

518
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
a couple of human souls. It would have only put the cost on top

519
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
of that. I guess it would have torched Mickey, not

520
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
the audience, because it's pretty far away from the audience.

521
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I suppose it could have shot across

522
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
the rivers. It is

523
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
probably the most convenient place

524
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
where something's going to burst

525
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
into flames at

526
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Disneyland. Because it's far

527
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
away from the audience. Yeah, it's far away from everyone.

528
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Most performers

529
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
and stagehands even

530
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
are pretty far away from it.

531
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Except for that Mickey. Thank God.

532
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
This is another story

533
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
entirely, if anything happens

534
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
to Mickey that night. Maybe

535
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
we don't cover it as a topic. I think

536
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
probably we don't cover it as a topic.

537
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
But just the

538
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
tenor of Disneyland changes forever

539
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
if a dragon torches Mickey

540
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
one night. I think that's correct. And maybe

541
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I don't say it's a conspiracy theory if that happened

542
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
either. But

543
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
it is funny when this happens

544
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
because it's like the King Kong thing. Where it's

545
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
like, oh yeah, King Kong burned up.

546
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And we have a new King Kong thing ready.

547
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And you're like, well, what's the chances?

548
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Sometimes the stuff lines up. Now, I think

549
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
oftentimes when something breaks,

550
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
everybody reassesses it. And

551
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
whatever their feeling about it was before,

552
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
now it's just a good excuse

553
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
to change it up.

554
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
So I watched a couple

555
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
of videos

556
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
of this show.

557
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
One from 2023,

558
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
4K,

559
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
crystal clear. And one from

560
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
1992, like

561
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
converted high

562
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
millimeter film.

563
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Which was still pretty good

564
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
quality for that

565
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
format. And

566
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
it is funny that

567
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
the dragon caught on

568
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
fire in 2023.

569
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Because 1992,

570
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
lots of

571
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
the interesting thing was seeing

572
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
how many beats of the show are already

573
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
in place. A lot of big moments of the

574
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
show are in place. The majority of it.

575
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
To some extent. But the

576
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
thing that was surprising to me

577
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
is how much the original version of

578
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
the show relied on

579
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
sparks. Sparks and fireworks

580
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
shooting out of things.

581
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
And sparklers. And that

582
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
did not cause the slightly

583
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
goofier looking dragon

584
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
to catch on fire. Instead of

585
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
the art, you know,

586
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
redone multiple times dragon

587
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
is the thing that exploded.

588
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I mean, it did.

589
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I think it was, you'd have to put it

590
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
in the sparks and fireworks category.

591
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
What ultimately did it. Because it wasn't

592
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
the flame breathing. It was the

593
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
the beat that did it, I think, was when

594
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
fireworks go off

595
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
in his brain.

596
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
And

597
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
which does always happen.

598
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
That does happen every night.

599
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Which is crazy. They do

600
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
light it on fire from

601
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
the top, essentially.

602
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
And it seems like that's the one that

603
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
did it in. Yeah.

604
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I mean, I remember

605
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
the night it happened,

606
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
within minutes, there

607
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
were multiple angles of it online.

608
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
People live streaming

609
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
or people who happened to be there

610
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
and got their phones out.

611
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
You could see it.

612
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And it was badass.

613
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Admittedly, one of the most badass

614
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
things Dizzy had done, and they didn't

615
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
need to. It looked awesome.

616
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Admittedly, and again

617
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
we could say it, because nobody got hurt.

618
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
And you know, it's not like

619
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
if the trees had caught on

620
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
fire, if the island was torched.

621
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
But the fact that it was just a

622
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
watching a dragon burn up, it was admittedly

623
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
it's very compelling.

624
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's very cool. Yeah.

625
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
What happens if, say,

626
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
no one was on the Mark Twain, but the Mark Twain just

627
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
went up in flames, and there's a flaming

628
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Mark Twain going around the

629
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Rivers of America, as if it's on

630
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
a river to hell.

631
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Well, I think

632
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I think if Buzz Lightyear

633
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
is burning up, that'd be less funny.

634
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
No, I said empty. Yeah, empty boat.

635
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
If it's empty,

636
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I mean, that

637
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
would also be a sight to behold.

638
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
It would, yeah. But I think you would have to rebuild

639
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
it. Would they rebuild

640
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
it, though? I bet they wouldn't.

641
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
For history's sake. I don't know.

642
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
You'd have to rebuild it by hand, I think.

643
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Oh, jeez.

644
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Or you would, if the boat was

645
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
on fire, you'd be like, take me, take me to hell,

646
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Mark, and try to swim

647
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
across onto it. Grand Circle Tour to

648
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
hell. This is the way I want to go,

649
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
you said. Look, it's been

650
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
in my will. I wrote this

651
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
14 years ago.

652
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Light the Mark Twain on

653
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
fire with me in it. And take me to hell.

654
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
It's in

655
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
your will that it be hell.

656
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
If this part of it, if anybody ever sees

657
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
the will who can make that decision,

658
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
just let you know. Because Jason

659
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
blazes up blunts, and where are you

660
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
going to get to do that? Hell.

661
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Plenty of fire, plenty of sinful

662
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
weed smokers down there.

663
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Oh, okay. Yeah, weed is the devil's

664
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
drug. Most people in hell are

665
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
there from even just one marijuana

666
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
used. From singular possession

667
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
and usage?

668
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
If you've been near it, actually,

669
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
if you've been near it and you didn't report it to the

670
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
authorities immediately, that's hell for you.

671
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Listeners, you can do your own

672
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
reflection on it by my rules if you're

673
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
going to hell or not. Like most

674
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
are. Although I don't know

675
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
with this audience. I'm not sure.

676
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I don't know either. Have you seen, do you know

677
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
what weed looks like? If so, hell.

678
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
No, this is making people uncomfortable listening

679
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
to anything. I'm sorry. We apologize.

680
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
We're going to leave it in, though.

681
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Well, it looks slightly like Sour Patch

682
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Kids or Reese's Peanut Butter Cups.

683
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
It's what everyone's concerned about.

684
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Sour Patch Kids? What? The weed

685
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
looks like Sour Patch Kids? I mean, no, I mean

686
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
like edible packaging. That's very

687
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
clearly like a ripoff.

688
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Oh, you're saying that? Well, this is something that Scott

689
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
and I don't even know that there's just constant

690
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
ripoff packaging or

691
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
there's constant ripoff packaging.

692
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
These are the things. You've got to give us the context

693
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
here. We aren't always extorting out.

694
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
This is taking you right down to Satan's

695
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Chamber, Jason, knowing all

696
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
this. That's such an evil

697
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Sour Patch Kids have been tainted? That's a

698
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
pure thing from my childhood. They're kids.

699
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Right. Get kids off of drugs.

700
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Oh, my God. You're going to sit at his right hand.

701
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Low-nose accent is at his left hand.

702
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
If the

703
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
word shows are any indication. The three of you

704
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
will be unstoppable. Yeah. You'll

705
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
take over Earth.

706
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Little J-Sex.

707
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Okay, so let's get into some

708
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
basics about this thing. May

709
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
13th, 1992.

710
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
A year ago,

711
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
went away, but on and off.

712
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
It's been going for a long

713
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
time.

714
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
History of it. They

715
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
were using the rivers

716
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
and the space across the river

717
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
for shows.

718
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
There is somebody named Barnett Richie

719
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
who was named a Disney legend last

720
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
year, and she put on

721
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
a lot of the nighttime entertainment

722
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
that existed before this thing.

723
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
There's a show called Kids of the

724
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Kingdom. She was one of

725
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
the Kids of the Kingdom. I'm not

726
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
prepared with a lot of information about Kids

727
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
of the Kingdom. Either

728
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
that will be an episode or we start looking into

729
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
it, and that's the blandest thing you've ever

730
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
heard of and we don't do it. I don't

731
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
know. Research

732
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
remains to be done. It sounds good, though.

733
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
It sounds like a good episode. It sounds up Mike

734
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Sally, for sure.

735
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
We're back to wholesome territory. Yeah, yeah.

736
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
It just sounds nice. That's all

737
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
it is. I'm sure it was.

738
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
There was also something called the

739
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Rolling River Review, where

740
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
jazz bands went by. I think for a long time

741
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
jazz bands played on the

742
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Tom Sawyer Island rafts.

743
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
So they were utilizing this area

744
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
for nighttime entertainment a decent amount.

745
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I think at grad nights, I think they had bands

746
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
play over there. I remember reading forever ago

747
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
that Cheap Trick played across

748
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
the rivers of America. That sounds

749
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
fucking cool. But

750
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
at some point, it's like...

751
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Are Cheap Trick replacing the dragon permanently?

752
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I hope so.

753
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I don't know how wise of an investment that is

754
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
for the future. I'm not sure their age

755
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
is in health, but

756
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
just one summer at Cheap Trick

757
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
and I'm happy.

758
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
On fire-based fireworks,

759
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
rock and roll fireworks, that's what I say.

760
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
And most importantly,

761
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
over 60-year-old guys

762
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
playing rock and roll.

763
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
It would have to be. Those are the only

764
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
people who play rock and roll.

765
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
They're trying to flip a coin. Are they going to

766
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
play Tom Sawyer Island or are they going to

767
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
play The Sphere in Las Vegas?

768
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
That's

769
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
probably where The Sphere is heading,

770
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I would imagine, given the recent bookings.

771
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
So anyways,

772
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
but we can't just keep

773
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
booking bands

774
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
who demand salaries

775
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
and run out the door.

776
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
There's got to be something permanent

777
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
that we can place here and something that uses

778
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
a little more imagineering magic.

779
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
So they start planning, oh wait,

780
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
and on top of that, Barnett

781
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Ricci takes a trip to France

782
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
and she discovers that there is a French company

783
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
that does something quite incredible,

784
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
which is mist screens,

785
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
water screens that allow

786
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
you to project visual images

787
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
onto them. They have that

788
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
copyright.

789
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Disney, as in

790
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
great Walt tradition, Disney sees something

791
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
and says, us too.

792
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Now

793
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
this is, in terms of

794
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
fundamentals of Fantasmic,

795
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
this blew my mind

796
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
when I was seven years old. This is so cool

797
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
and now we almost take it for granted. There's a lot

798
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
of things of this nature

799
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
and this is a part of a lot of

800
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Disney nighttime water shows,

801
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
but this was the first.

802
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
So cool. I strongly remember

803
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
being up close

804
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
and not even that up close and you still get the

805
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
mist on you, even if you don't stake out

806
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
those front row positions.

807
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Love this.

808
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Haven't done it in a long time, but as I talk about it

809
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
now I'm kind of craving that screen mist.

810
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Screen mist is so interesting

811
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
because the term now

812
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
makes me go, uh oh,

813
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
in 2024, because there was

814
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
a lot of talk of the Tiana ride coming out.

815
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Now they've just released videos of all

816
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
these robots and the robots look spectacular.

817
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
So perhaps any of my fears

818
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
are stupid or whatever. They look

819
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
amazing. But they were mentioning

820
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
a lot of projections on mist

821
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
a few months ago or a year or two ago

822
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
and I was like, uh oh,

823
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I don't like the sound of that. But I

824
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
remember when

825
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
projecting on mist was new, because

826
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
we had it at our local indoor

827
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
swimming pool

828
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
slash mild water park

829
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
where I grew up. And I've said this before,

830
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
there was a hologram

831
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
projected on some mist as we

832
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
went down a water slide.

833
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
This wasn't your choice for

834
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
the parks that made us, this was something different?

835
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Uh, it was not my choice.

836
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
This was just a low,

837
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
for some reason, like the

838
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
park district had some money, so they upgraded a

839
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
pool when I was in like fifth grade into an

840
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
indoor pool that was, like,

841
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
you could go year round. And for whatever

842
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
reason, they had a water slide that had a mist

843
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
and, like, had a projection of some

844
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
kind on it. I don't even remember what the projection

845
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
was, but it was all the talk

846
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
of, like, oh my god, you

847
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
could, like, place something on, like,

848
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
water and mist. Mike, what you're describing

849
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
is the greatest use of taxpayer

850
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
money I've ever heard of. Oh, it's

851
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
a ridiculous, I don't know why.

852
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
What was the point of it? It probably

853
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
cost a million dollars at the time.

854
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
To cheer up all the kids in

855
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
town. We never think about morale

856
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
when we make our budget decisions.

857
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
You don't get to go to the public pool generally

858
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
in the Midwest in the middle of winter,

859
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
but going to now branded

860
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Waterworks, it's of course called

861
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Waterworks, and I believe it still is,

862
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
they spent money on

863
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
some sort of mist projection. What was on

864
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
the mist? I'm telling you, I don't remember.

865
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
But we were excited about

866
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
it nonetheless. It didn't look very

867
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
good as my memory, but you'd

868
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
kind of, like, try to make it out of what it was

869
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
as you were going through it. And it

870
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
was not, again, it was nothing spectacular, but

871
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
for whatever reason, they sold the Schomburg

872
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Park District on this, and

873
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
we got to experience, that's the first time I

874
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
ever saw it, and it was cool,

875
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
even though I can't remember what the projection

876
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
was. So you're,

877
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
when you finally then find out about

878
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Fantasmic, you're like, oh, so they're doing

879
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
like a Waterworks thing. Right, it's basically, they ripped us off

880
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
of Waterworks. The Schomburg Park District

881
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
did this first, as far as I know. This

882
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
is just Disneyland copying Schomburg

883
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
as usual.

884
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
It might have. You grew up

885
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
in a wild experimental town.

886
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Yes, of course. Rainforest

887
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Cafe, Mars 2112,

888
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Waterworks, the Little

889
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Caesars, but the play area,

890
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
a big play area.

891
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I am, look, I'm mildly

892
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
jealous whenever this list

893
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
comes up. I know, and I didn't realize

894
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
how good I had it. Why'd you move?

895
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I moved back.

896
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Alright, I will.

897
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
All that stuff is gone, except for Waterworks,

898
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
but I'll move back. You're right.

899
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Maybe there'll be a new restaurant coming to Woodfield soon.

900
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Hopefully.

901
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
For the legacy fans.

902
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Anyway, they,

903
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I never heard any of this history.

904
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
This was all news to me that there were premises for what this

905
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
would be before Fantasmic.

906
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
The first pitch was something called

907
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
River Haunt, and they did a whole

908
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
bunch of imagery of this that

909
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
you can look up. River Haunt

910
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
was supposed to combine

911
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
the mythologies of haunted

912
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean

913
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
nearby this spot, the

914
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Rivers of America, so it makes sense.

915
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
It's just artwork,

916
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
so you can't exactly make heads

917
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
or tails of the plot, but it's a bunch

918
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
of ghosts and a bunch of pirates, and

919
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
maybe ghost pirates, and maybe

920
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
a big leota. Sounds

921
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
kind of good. Do you think we missed out?

922
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Should it have been River Haunt?

923
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I think the name is bad.

924
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Sure, but the concept

925
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
is cool. They might have, maybe

926
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
they would have gotten it there. They might have

927
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
buffed that name. So I don't know. If they said

928
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Fantasmic's going away and we have a new version

929
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
of River Haunt, maybe

930
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I'm in. I don't know.

931
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
There's that scary,

932
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
remember they repurposed, was it in,

933
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
it was in Disneyland Paris, they repurposed

934
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
the Mark Twain as a big scary boat.

935
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Do you guys know what I'm talking about?

936
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Let me see if I can find it.

937
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
But it looked crazy, and I'm like,

938
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
oh, that looks really cool.

939
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Hold on, let me find it.

940
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I mean, maybe the issue with that show is they're kind of

941
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
limiting themselves by making it

942
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
a fully scary show.

943
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Now it does not attract the broad

944
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Disneyland audience.

945
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
For example, me, I would have heard

946
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
those words and been out and never

947
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
seen River Haunt until I turned 21.

948
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Yeah, oh, this is,

949
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
okay, it's the thing that was

950
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
tugging the Mark Twain. It's this

951
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
big scary ghost.

952
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Oh, I've seen that before.

953
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Okay, weird hooded creature with no

954
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
face. Like a giant tugging

955
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
the Mark Twain, like a tugboat,

956
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
not tugging it, like, you know what I'm saying?

957
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Like Ghosts of Christmas

958
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Yet to Come, Time Grim Reaper.

959
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
It is the

960
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
ball and chain that's been put on this

961
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
creature. His destiny in life

962
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
is to tug this boat away. Now if Jason

963
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
that was his destiny, there'd be a big

964
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
smile on this guy's face. Oh yeah,

965
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
the hoodies keep the sun out of my eyes.

966
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
And the smile,

967
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
the big smile would be reflecting

968
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
and hitting people in the eye because

969
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
the big smile constantly.

970
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
But yeah, something like this.

971
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I don't know. Obviously, Fantasmic

972
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
definitely a crowd pleaser.

973
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
So probably the better choice.

974
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
But yeah, they got to something

975
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
that is, it's only scary at times.

976
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
There's some scary parts of Fantasmic. Maybe like

977
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
a scary Fantasmic around Halloween time.

978
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
That would be awesome. Sure.

979
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Something like this. It would be awesome. The only

980
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
problem with like entertainment

981
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
that could potentially scare

982
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
you, there are active walkways

983
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
that people are walking on.

984
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
So there's suddenly a jump scare.

985
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Maybe not.

986
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
People would be jumping into each other's arms constantly

987
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
like in an old cartoon or movie.

988
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Someone's arms are going to break at some point.

989
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
That crowd would look like a popcorn machine.

990
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Constantly.

991
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Yeah, we don't want

992
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
that. So they end

993
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
up with probably at some point in this

994
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
development, they realize that involving

995
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
classic characters in Mickey Mouse would

996
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
be a good idea. And they put together

997
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
somewhat what we know

998
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
today. But they initially call

999
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
it Imagination. And I think it's

1000
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
far down the road as Imagination.

1001
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
That's the song. I bet

1002
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
the song was written. Because Fantasmic

1003
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
is never said in the

1004
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
song.

1005
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
So there's posters

1006
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
of that. Maybe even advertisements

1007
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
outside of Disneyland saying come see our

1008
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
new show Imagination. And Imagination

1009
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
is in the song. They say that word. Yes.

1010
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Imagination.

1011
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
It's not in a night that's Fantasmic.

1012
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Because the name.

1013
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Here's something that we have missed.

1014
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
First things first. Exclamation point.

1015
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I should have said it out loud when we said

1016
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
the topic.

1017
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
The name. How has this name

1018
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
always struck us our whole

1019
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
lives? Did it ever hit the ears

1020
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
weird? No, I always liked

1021
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
it. It's

1022
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
funny because I was

1023
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
just saying this the other day. All the things that Disney

1024
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
decides to name things these days. There's a

1025
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
blandness often times.

1026
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
It's not that Fantasmic is so amazing.

1027
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
But it's just enough of a twist

1028
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
to make you go okay

1029
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
that's memorable and somewhat unique. Yeah.

1030
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
It's strange.

1031
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
They made up a word. Yeah.

1032
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
And it's in my I guess I always

1033
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
thought it was so wait so it's

1034
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
fantastic but Fantasmic

1035
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
is what I what I always

1036
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
thought was the entomology and how

1037
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
they landed there. But then you're changing more than

1038
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
right. It's fantastic.

1039
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Oh yeah. No. It's TIC

1040
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
becomes MIC.

1041
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
But that's not how they got there.

1042
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
What it is

1043
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
is a shortening of Fantasmagoria.

1044
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Because it involves

1045
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
ghost stories. Yes.

1046
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Yeah. But I never figured that out

1047
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
because it doesn't have most

1048
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
of that word in it. And it's not

1049
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
a pH. It's an F.

1050
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
And who someone

1051
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
says it in the show. Maleficent

1052
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
says it. Really? Is it the words in old?

1053
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Oh. When she's the old

1054
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
crone she goes I will

1055
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
turn this into a Fantasmic.

1056
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I love how you said the old crone. I forget

1057
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
her official. Is that her official

1058
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
name? I think I've heard that character

1059
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
referred to as the old crone.

1060
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
But I do wish it would be. That's why I'm saying it.

1061
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I'd like it to be said more.

1062
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I mean we're coming up on a

1063
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
presidential campaign that is old

1064
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
crone versus old crone. That's

1065
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
true. I think it's time to get that phrase

1066
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
back on the book. And I think if we push

1067
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
them at these conventions they could get

1068
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
VPs who are even older.

1069
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I hope so. I hope so.

1070
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Yes.

1071
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
My complaint about both of these guys

1072
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
is they can technically still speak.

1073
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Let's get a real, let's get

1074
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
a guy who's like a cut to in a

1075
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Laurel and Hardy movie.

1076
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Just a guy who looks like the craziest looking

1077
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
old man. Just don't ask him to say anything.

1078
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
The last surviving Civil

1079
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
War soldier, I think they could be

1080
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
VPs come January

1081
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
2025.

1082
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
That's the era they want everybody

1083
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
to go back to so why not have somebody serve

1084
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
who was in that era.

1085
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Now I'm looking up,

1086
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I don't know if she does say Phantasmagora

1087
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
because I do have the

1088
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
score she was like in

1089
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
a rant. Like before she

1090
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
turned into a dragon. And the old crones rant.

1091
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
She rants and raves

1092
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
cronishly. We talked about the price of groceries.

1093
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
But then if you try to engage her

1094
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
of like, well don't you think all these

1095
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
conglomerates merging grocery store

1096
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
change is a bad thing? She just

1097
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
like writes you off entirely.

1098
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
It came pretty naturally Jason.

1099
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Who's the old crone now?

1100
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I don't think it's any argument that

1101
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I'm not an old crone.

1102
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
He's 38.

1103
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
He sounds like he's 68.

1104
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
What I found

1105
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
that was funny is how they landed

1106
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
on Phantasmagoria. So the show

1107
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
is in rehearsals. It's going great.

1108
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Where he's like wow this is going to

1109
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
this is really going to land huge.

1110
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
We like everything about that name.

1111
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Imagination, it's not proprietary. You can't really

1112
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
put it on merchandise because it's just

1113
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
a word. So according to

1114
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Disneyland president Jack Lindquist,

1115
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
we got a dictionary down from Michael

1116
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Eisner's bookshelf and started going

1117
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
through it page by page.

1118
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
We both kept throwing out names and rejecting them.

1119
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Finally we reached the P's and Michael

1120
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
threw out Phantasmagoria.

1121
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
It immediately intrigued us both.

1122
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
It had the right feel. They took it to

1123
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
our team who

1124
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I rightfully said

1125
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
it's a lot. It's long though. And they

1126
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
put Mickey in there and that's it.

1127
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
So kind of comes from Eisner.

1128
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Comes from Eisner.

1129
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
It's all good things do. Yeah.

1130
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
We land there

1131
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
over and over again.

1132
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
If he had anything

1133
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
to do with City Walk we never would have gotten

1134
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
sick there. Oh that's a very good point.

1135
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
No measles. No we didn't touch that

1136
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
with his hands. Golden touch.

1137
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
All he did was go there and change the name

1138
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
of one place. If he had named

1139
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
the wind up store

1140
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
that would have left a legacy that would have ensured

1141
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
no measles forever.

1142
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Old Hag

1143
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I ever credited as

1144
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
in the script I'm looking at.

1145
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
And she at one point says

1146
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
and she at one point says now I'll turn

1147
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
that little mouse's dream into

1148
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
a nightmare phantasmic.

1149
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Okay yes.

1150
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Okay.

1151
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I mean she's an old hag. She could be

1152
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
sundowning and just making up words.

1153
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Who knows.

1154
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Is crone gender specific?

1155
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
And can it not be?

1156
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I always think of it as

1157
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
enable everybody to be a crone.

1158
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Supposedly an ugly old woman. That's what

1159
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
a crone's definition is on

1160
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
this when I look it up.

1161
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Hag sounds so much worse

1162
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
though. Crone just sounds like an old crank.

1163
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Yeah. Yeah. Oddly

1164
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
maybe a little softer

1165
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
in a way. And I

1166
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
just like it. I want men to have the

1167
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
ability to be old crones.

1168
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
This is my dream.

1169
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Yeah.

1170
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Well you know. Well there's folklore

1171
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
too. We can really get into the history

1172
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
of crones I suppose. In

1173
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
folklore a crone is an old woman who maybe

1174
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
characterizes disagreeable, malicious, or sinister

1175
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
in manner. Often with magical

1176
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
or supernatural associations

1177
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
that can make her either helpful or

1178
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
obstructive. So

1179
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
the crone is also an archetypal figure

1180
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
or a wise woman. As a character

1181
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
type the crone shares characteristics with

1182
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
the hag.

1183
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
So there's a little bit of a history lesson here.

1184
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
That implies that they are different.

1185
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
That does imply that. Not the same thing.

1186
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Yes. The word becomes

1187
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
further specialized as the third aspect

1188
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
of the triple goddess. Popularized

1189
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
by Robert Graves.

1190
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Subsequently in some forms of

1191
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
neo-paganism. Particularly

1192
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Wicca in which she symbolizes the

1193
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
dark goddess. The dark of the moon.

1194
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
The end of the cycle. Together with

1195
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
the mother crone. The light

1196
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
goddess. And the crone

1197
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
maiden. Wow we really stumbled on some

1198
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
fun stuff here. This sounds great. This sounds

1199
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
like not negative crones at all.

1200
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
This is fun crones. Mike you start

1201
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
reading it from a dusty old book

1202
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
that appeared in your hands.

1203
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
That sounds like the work of

1204
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
some old crone to me.

1205
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
All I'm saying is we

1206
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
get working on the script for

1207
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
crone versus hag.

1208
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
And then eventually down the line you do

1209
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
crone x hag. A new empire.

1210
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Because eventually

1211
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
you just want to see them be friends. You want to

1212
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
see them hang out. Oh sure.

1213
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Best way you terminate her too. You flip it

1214
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
at some point. The work becomes good.

1215
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I was curious if anybody

1216
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
has called Trump an old crone.

1217
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
And I did find the headline from this year.

1218
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Crone backs former president

1219
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Donald Trump. What?

1220
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
An old crone? No.

1221
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Camden County Republican Chairman

1222
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Tom Crone. No.

1223
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Oh no. Doesn't count.

1224
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
That's not quite yeah. That's not

1225
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
something related to

1226
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
neo paganism. That's not

1227
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
mother crone or the light goddess.

1228
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Yeah that's not fun. Yeah it's not

1229
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
as fun. Anyway

1230
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
well yeah more crone and photocom.

1231
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
But so anyway they land on

1232
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Phantasmagoria. They do so much

1233
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
stuff to this area to

1234
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
prepare it to do a big nighttime

1235
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
spectacular. They drain the rivers

1236
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
of America. They finally

1237
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
replace the clay

1238
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
that was at the bottom of the

1239
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
rivers of America since 55.

1240
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
When they filled it

1241
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
first and then it drained. So

1242
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
they put a bunch of clay in there which drained

1243
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
much more slowly. We just

1244
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
found this out about submarine voyage too that

1245
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
the leaking of submarine voyage is unbelievable.

1246
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Rivers of America I don't think as bad

1247
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
but still pretty bad.

1248
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
And it was during that time that they replaced

1249
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
the clay with gunite.

1250
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
So next time you're there

1251
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
no that's what's down there. Gunite.

1252
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Gunite.

1253
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
More facts to bore your group with.

1254
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
You know that's gunite.

1255
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Then you get pushed

1256
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
into the river.

1257
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
So they fixed the river. Less

1258
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
draining. They build that

1259
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
entire that facility was not

1260
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
there. The shack or whatever you call

1261
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
it. Because what I didn't

1262
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
realize is that that's this giant

1263
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
high tech facility

1264
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
that goes five stories down.

1265
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Oh my god. That's like a crazy

1266
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
vault there even though we think

1267
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
it looks like a musty old shack.

1268
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Every inch of it is

1269
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
different you know is computer

1270
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
equipment and lighting grids.

1271
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
And also space to put the massive

1272
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
massive show pieces.

1273
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
And elevators

1274
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
that bring them up.

1275
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
You talk about this dragon thing and you know

1276
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
there were dragon problems

1277
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
from the beginning and problems with other things.

1278
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
The show used to have these big Pinocchio

1279
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
marionettes that they stopped

1280
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
using because sometimes wires would snap

1281
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
and they'd just plummet down

1282
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
into their grave at the bottom

1283
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
of the like. This show

1284
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I mean

1285
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
amazing that there weren't more

1286
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
problems in a way but the problems that did

1287
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
occur are so massive in

1288
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
scale. You got to give them credit for

1289
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
plowing through and getting it done

1290
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
night after night even though it's

1291
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
this is a destructive show. These

1292
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
are props that could like crush dozens

1293
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
of people under them. I was going to mention

1294
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
the Pinocchio marionettes because

1295
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
marionettes. I've never seen those

1296
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I feel like in the versions

1297
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
of Phantasmag that I see

1298
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
and I think they were gone by the like

1299
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
mid 2000s when I started

1300
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
going to Disneyland.

1301
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
But in the newer version

1302
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
there is a little

1303
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
the genie makes a little

1304
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
like Mickey.

1305
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
He turns Mickey into one

1306
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
and it's the same style and very Pinocchio

1307
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
marionette and it's a nice little nod

1308
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
without having to build

1309
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
these potentially rigorous

1310
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
props. They were kind of scary.

1311
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I remember they scared me because they have that

1312
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
day glow vibe as

1313
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
a lot of things did in this show.

1314
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Everything like that

1315
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
I can go back into history but like

1316
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
if we just talk about like

1317
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
things that resonate with us about the show

1318
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
the big

1319
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
claw, the snake that walks

1320
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
around. The snake is pretty intense

1321
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
always. Yes. Yeah.

1322
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
That shoots like

1323
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
it's got laser eyes.

1324
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Maybe not lasers but like big light eyes

1325
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
that kind of scope the crowd.

1326
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Kind of hypnotic in the movie.

1327
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Hypnotizes people.

1328
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I don't think it's laser. It's not blinding

1329
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
everyone in the audience.

1330
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
They don't fry audiences with lasers each night.

1331
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
A lucky family. Every night

1332
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
there's a lucky family that will be

1333
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
horribly scarred by our new

1334
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
nighttime production, Fantasmic.

1335
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Unless it gives them super powers.

1336
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
They could get

1337
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Fantastic Ford.

1338
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
That would be fun.

1339
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
That stuff's cool.

1340
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
The King Louie

1341
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
and the apes that go by

1342
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
at some point.

1343
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
All this day glow stuff because that also felt like

1344
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
look it wasn't new

1345
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
in the 90s. Obviously

1346
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
day glow was technology

1347
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
that we had. But with

1348
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Batman Forever

1349
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
and the Buster

1350
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Rhymes Put Your Hands Over My Eyes Can See

1351
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
music video. It felt like we

1352
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
were living in a great time day glow wise.

1353
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
And not to discount

1354
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Cosmic Bowling. To leave that out of it too.

1355
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Blacklight. Right?

1356
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Blacklight and blacklight paint.

1357
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
See I loved that as a kid. I loved

1358
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
all blacklight stuff.

1359
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Day glow might not even be the correct

1360
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
term. Is day glow right?

1361
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
That's a good question. I know what you meant.

1362
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
But maybe it isn't.

1363
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I don't know. I'm seeing day glow paint

1364
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
that glows in the dark.

1365
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I guess blacklight's probably an important

1366
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
word to say. An element of it.

1367
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I feel like it's just gotten more

1368
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
elaborate as the

1369
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
show is like seeing

1370
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
different iterations.

1371
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Day glow paint looks like that's what you're talking about.

1372
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Yeah. Totally.

1373
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I was obsessed with this type of thing.

1374
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Glowing in the dark and neon colors.

1375
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Forget about it. That's one of my top

1376
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
five things I liked as a kid.

1377
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Neon in general. Whenever you

1378
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
got a box of crayons. I'm sure I've said this before on the show.

1379
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Whenever they added like five

1380
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
neon colors to your box of crayola

1381
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
crayons. I lost my mind.

1382
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I loved it.

1383
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
I feel like that was 90s when all of a sudden

1384
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
you know what kids? You got neon colors now.

1385
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
We found new colors between

1386
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
the colors. They're brighter colors.

1387
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
They have names with attitude.

1388
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
This is a gift to your generation.

1389
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Our scientists, our crayola scientists

1390
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
have uncovered new colors.

1391
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
They've been researching. They've been in the mountains.

1392
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
The crayola mountains.

1393
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
And they found them. And now we're

1394
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
making them into your crayons.

1395
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
I definitely would use those colors

1396
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
first when I was

1397
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
coloring or drawing.

1398
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Let me ask you this.

1399
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Did you like it as you aged

1400
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
and people started getting different colored

1401
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
pens?

1402
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Like not just black or blue

1403
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
ink but like green or purple

1404
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
ink? Of course I did.

1405
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I recently mentioned this when Griffin

1406
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
was here for a Club 3 episode that I had one of those

1407
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
pens with the four different colors on it.

1408
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
But then when I was a kid I would have a pen

1409
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
that had the ten colors and it was a big

1410
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
thick pen. Do you ever see these

1411
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Scott? Do you remember these? I guess so.

1412
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
And it would be like ten colors and you just put like

1413
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
click down which color you wanted.

1414
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
But the pen would obviously have to be big because it had all those

1415
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
different things of ink in there.

1416
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Incredibly easy to destroy.

1417
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Like they would break if you looked at them too hard.

1418
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
I had a big purple

1419
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
like metal one of these and it was like

1420
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
my prized possession in like third or fourth

1421
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
grade. I don't know what happened to

1422
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
it. I know I had a space

1423
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
pen at some point in like middle school

1424
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
that I lost and I was heart broken.

1425
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Space pen because you could write

1426
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
sleeping down. Well yeah you could write

1427
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
upside down. Yeah I

1428
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
was dead asleep. I

1429
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
would lucid dream right.

1430
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Lying down is what I meant to say.

1431
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
I think I said sleeping down. Sleeping down.

1432
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Yeah in that case

1433
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
if it gives you the ability to write while

1434
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
sleeping. While sleeping down.

1435
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
When you're sleeping down. Which is because I don't think

1436
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
they're sleepwalking but who in their

1437
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
sleep writes? And that ability

1438
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
comes from the pen. Yeah.

1439
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Was that fun colors though?

1440
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
No it was just black and pink.

1441
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
So you weren't a fan of the fun colors?

1442
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
No I like the fun colors. Therefore process

1443
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
of elimination. You don't like fun colors

1444
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Jason. He's a Nazi. Let's see what he says.

1445
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Did you have I specifically

1446
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
remember teachers though like

1447
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
losing their shit on kids.

1448
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
You can't use like

1449
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
green ink. Yeah there would be

1450
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
sometimes like always like specifically

1451
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
you shouldn't use anything fun.

1452
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
As a kid I was like what's going on

1453
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
what's going on with them? What's their

1454
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
problem? If you can read it what's

1455
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
the problem? From a practical standpoint I

1456
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
suppose pink ink is hard

1457
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
to read. Yellow ink also hard to read.

1458
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
So I could see if you're grading

1459
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
like 30 papers and there's a bunch of pink

1460
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
ink on it. Sure. Or kids

1461
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
are writing in red ink and teachers

1462
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
like no I use the red ink.

1463
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Yes that's another legit concern if

1464
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
they're writing with red ink because you're not going to know

1465
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
because yeah you could be a kid.

1466
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
What if you just tried to fool the teacher and did the whole

1467
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
test and then just did the red and just gave yourself

1468
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
a hundred percent and an A plus.

1469
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
I definitely fooled some teachers.

1470
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
That would for sure work.

1471
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Yeah. Well you know.

1472
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
That's the way to get them. Just put that grade on yourself.

1473
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
They'll get them every time. Yeah.

1474
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
So yeah try that. If you're in

1475
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
school right now if you're in elementary school

1476
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
try that. Grade your own test with a red

1477
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
pen and see what happens.

1478
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Or in college. I don't know

1479
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
try it in college. A parent turning off

1480
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
the podcast. I thought these were good boys.

1481
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
They're giving cheating

1482
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
ideas. Yeah.

1483
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
I

1484
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
back to the history of the show a little bit.

1485
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
The show cost 30

1486
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
million at the time.

1487
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
To compare Star Tours I think cost

1488
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
like 32 to 35

1489
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
million. Wow. So we're spending attraction

1490
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
money on a show.

1491
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
There's also all this infrastructure

1492
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
stuff to do because they have to tier

1493
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
and kind of like the terrace

1494
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
where you watch it. I've never looked

1495
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
at numbers of how many people watch

1496
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
or can watch Fantasmic.

1497
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
The area is meant for

1498
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
6,000 people but I think can sometimes

1499
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
attract eight.

1500
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
And I was trying to. It feels like

1501
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
it some nights I'll say that. Yeah.

1502
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Yes and that's the biggest deterrent to

1503
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
not going to this or

1504
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
trying to you know what I like is like

1505
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
can I find some little corner kind of see

1506
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
some of it from the edge but then

1507
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
get out of there. Yeah. Beat the crowd

1508
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
out of there because yeah that is and you

1509
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
got to get their way early to scope

1510
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
out. Though I love the show

1511
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
it's not something I'm

1512
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
willing to put the time into doing

1513
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
that often. Yeah.

1514
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I'll say that it's

1515
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
much more pleasant if you were staying

1516
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
in Anaheim.

1517
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Because then you can kind of like

1518
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
easily kind of slowly

1519
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
let the crowds pass a little

1520
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
then gradually make your way back. Make your way

1521
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
to a hotel or whatever.

1522
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
But dealing with crowds

1523
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
dealing with Southern

1524
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
California has some pretty cold nights

1525
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
a lot of the year. Some pretty

1526
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
like chilly nights.

1527
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
And so dealing with that

1528
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
and then to get back to the parking

1529
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
garage and then drive back to

1530
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Burbank. It is such a Jason concern

1531
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
though. It is. It's tiring.

1532
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I think though Southern California

1533
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
we're really like

1534
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
we have it so good weather wise

1535
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
now we're going to it's chilly some

1536
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
nights. It is chilly it's too dry out

1537
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
here the chilliness.

1538
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
And it's not exactly a phantasmic problem.

1539
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
It's chilly at night in Orlando too sometimes.

1540
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Yeah but it's humid and it's warmer.

1541
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Is it warmer

1542
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
you think? Well they say

1543
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
there was an LA Times infographic

1544
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
about this where it's like oh

1545
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
50 degrees out here feels a lot

1546
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
colder because it's drier.

1547
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
There's not as much of a

1548
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
moisture in the air.

1549
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I'm willing to entertain that.

1550
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Say Jason you want to see phantasmic tonight?

1551
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
I don't know the dry cold.

1552
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
If I were

1553
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
a wet cold maybe

1554
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
but maybe some of that mist will

1555
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
get on me. But that mist is going to be cold if it

1556
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
gets on you. That's not really.

1557
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Are you saying that because you have to stop and

1558
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
stand or just in general

1559
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
at Disneyland are you concerned with the

1560
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
chilly nights? Is it just because you're

1561
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
stationary? Chilly nights this summer

1562
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
at Disneyland. You get colder if you're

1563
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
standing. That's a good point.

1564
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
But if you're roaming through Disneyland

1565
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
at night generally it's not so bad.

1566
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
I think if you're roaming through and you're going on

1567
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
indoor attractions

1568
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
you probably don't notice it as much.

1569
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
If you're just standing outside

1570
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
in the middle of all these people

1571
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
you know.

1572
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
It can get chilly.

1573
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Do you think it's chillier though seeing

1574
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
a world of color?

1575
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I bet it is because there's more

1576
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
open air. There's a lot of mist off

1577
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
world of color. A lot of mist, a lot of

1578
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
projections. But then I feel like there's more

1579
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
things in the way of the full

1580
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
windy gusts that you might

1581
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
get. I feel like yeah DCA

1582
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
is gustier. I think DCA

1583
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
is gustier. That's my premise

1584
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
that I share with Jason.

1585
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
What is with you guys in wind

1586
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
these days? The food court

1587
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
at City Walk is so windy.

1588
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
It is crazy windy. Can I ask you this?

1589
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Sorry we're going back to City Walk.

1590
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
I've never experienced this wind in my life.

1591
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
I let it slide in the episode.

1592
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Are you sure you wasn't just windy that day?

1593
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Did you see his mouth open like mine?

1594
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
It's always windy up there.

1595
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
It's always windy. No matter

1596
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
what time of year. City food is always

1597
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
windy. Or 90% of the

1598
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
time. It's alright.

1599
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I shouldn't be opening it up now but as it was

1600
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
happening in the moment I'm like here's a very

1601
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Mike and Jason old crone

1602
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
kind of thing. I'm shocked by this.

1603
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
If this is old crone behavior

1604
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
consider me the oldest crone.

1605
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
It's always windy up at City

1606
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Food. I don't know why. I used to go out there for

1607
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
dollar fish taco Tuesday nights

1608
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
and it was so cold

1609
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
up there eating those dollar fish tacos.

1610
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
That's a five

1611
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
timer and sometimes you go up and there's

1612
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
people working up there. That's another

1613
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
five timer. Working up there.

1614
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
You talk about how there's people

1615
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
who go up on business lunches.

1616
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
That's something that's come up a zillion times.

1617
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Well there's plenty of business travelers

1618
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
staying at those fine hotels.

1619
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
When he's right he's right.

1620
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Chilliness at Disneyland.

1621
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
I've also gone up there

1622
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
and done creative work in the past.

1623
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I'm not as concerned with chilliness at

1624
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Disneyland as Jason is but we

1625
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
are in lockstep on the windiness of

1626
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
City Food. It seems like you're a little bit

1627
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
concerned with DCA gustiness.

1628
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Well I'm just saying it is gustier

1629
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
and I think you could probably get chillier

1630
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
and get hit with the gusts more aggressively

1631
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
at Disney's California Adventure during

1632
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
World of Color than

1633
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Fantasmic. But that's just

1634
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
honestly that's a guess. That's something we're going to need to test out

1635
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
in the next year. It's a gust guest.

1636
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
It's a gust guest. I'm gust

1637
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
guesting on gusts here.

1638
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I think I said it right.

1639
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Our guest today is gust guest

1640
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
who's going to take

1641
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
some guesses about gusts.

1642
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Look we need to do more

1643
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
work in year what is it? Seven

1644
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
of this podcast on the gustiest

1645
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
parts of the parks.

1646
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
We don't have good gust

1647
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
maps when it comes to our home

1648
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
parks like Disneyland, Disney's California Adventure.

1649
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
People leave. They go to these parks unequipped.

1650
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
They don't come with the proper gust breakers.

1651
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Exactly. They're thrown out to the

1652
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
elements. They need that. The chilly

1653
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
California nights.

1654
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
That is a big change

1655
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
from Orlando light.

1656
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Just throw a light sweater in your bag.

1657
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Day and night not that different

1658
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
much in the year.

1659
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
It's one of these coastal

1660
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
things because I go to

1661
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Disney World and I'm like this weather is

1662
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
bonkers. But you guys grew

1663
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
up on that side of the country.

1664
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
It's perfect. Florida weather

1665
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
notoriously perfect.

1666
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Nothing more comforting than some old

1667
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
fashioned hurricane weather.

1668
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
I've been there where it's been on and off

1669
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
rain and ten minute stints

1670
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
for the entire day. Just bring a

1671
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
sweater. Duck in a shop.

1672
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
That's the fun of it.

1673
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Check out the wares.

1674
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Now that's fun but gustiness

1675
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
this you must come equipped. You must plan

1676
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
what clothes will

1677
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
protect me from the gusts.

1678
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Now you must

1679
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
deal with the power of California

1680
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
gusts. Oh my god what if the new

1681
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
there's a new I guess not a dragon but the new

1682
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
bad guy or character is gusting

1683
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
at the audience not shooting flames.

1684
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
The gusts are

1685
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
hitting the audience now. I mean that'd be evil

1686
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
and it would probably also hit the

1687
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
standby line when that Tiana ride

1688
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
opens. Oh you know what it's also

1689
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
like an ingenious thing too because you

1690
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
would sell light sweaters in all

1691
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
the gift shops around the rivers of America.

1692
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
So everybody would race into the gift

1693
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
shops to get a little light sweater and purchase

1694
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
a Disneyland light sweater. So now

1695
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
they're making hand over fist money

1696
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
with the different people that

1697
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
are just a little chilly. They're exploiting

1698
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
people running into the brand new Critter

1699
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
co-op store. Critter co-op.

1700
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
They're running into the Tiana's general store.

1701
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
The new Haunted Mansion gift shop that will

1702
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
open this year. All these new places are just designed

1703
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
to sell new Disneyland light sweaters.

1704
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
These motherfuckers.

1705
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Did you guys age 28 years

1706
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
since the City Walk Saga ended?

1707
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Now we're concerned

1708
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
with shawls.

1709
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Well Disney is concerned by

1710
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
selling us shawls. But it

1711
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
is always, look it's just practical to have a light

1712
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
sweater when you go anywhere. Or a sweatshirt. It could be

1713
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
a sweatshirt as well. It could be a sweatshirt if

1714
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
you're going to be a young person. If you're going to be

1715
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
younger it's a sweatshirt.

1716
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
If you're, are you

1717
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
saying that sweatshirt is a young

1718
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
person's term? Well it's

1719
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
cooler than a cardigan.

1720
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Sweatshirt

1721
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
and sneaker and

1722
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
blue jeans.

1723
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
What's his name? What's that basketball player?

1724
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I couldn't tell you. I can't keep up with

1725
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
the kids. If you're sort of in college

1726
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
you wear blue jeans and you wear

1727
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
your sneakers and stuff. But after a

1728
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
certain point you become an adult and

1729
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
switch to slacks.

1730
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Blue jeans?

1731
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Do you wear your loafers? Blue jeans is a college

1732
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
term? Like dungarees.

1733
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Hang on. As an adult

1734
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
I'm supposed to start saying the

1735
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
brand names. Blue jeans is a

1736
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
phrase I retire as a young man.

1737
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
I don't know what's being said

1738
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
anymore. Look, if you don't

1739
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
understand it I'm not going to explain it

1740
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
at this point. Because that's just a difference

1741
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
of, I don't know, how we were raised

1742
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
or how we are

1743
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
with morals. In a lot of ways it's just

1744
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
differences in how we're maturing as adults

1745
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
I think. The way in which we speak. Abandoning

1746
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
childish things like the phrase blue

1747
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
jeans and sweatshirt.

1748
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
That's right. Sweatshirts and blue jeans

1749
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
are for young people. That's

1750
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
all I know. That's what I know.

1751
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
As an adult.

1752
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
An adult man.

1753
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Podcast The Riot hosted by one

1754
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
man in his late thirties and

1755
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
two who are mentally in their mid

1756
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
eighties.

1757
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
But mostly the two

1758
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
mostly wear joggers. For some

1759
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
reason they switch from slacks

1760
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
to that.

1761
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
They haven't worn blue jeans in

1762
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
years.

1763
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Alright.

1764
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
I'm going to play, how about we play a clip?

1765
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
You guys want to see a clip?

1766
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
When the

1767
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
show is on its way to

1768
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
opening they tease it on what I would

1769
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
have to imagine is an Easter special.

1770
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
And there is a tour

1771
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
being given to a group

1772
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
by one of the Disneyland

1773
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
plaid wearing tour guides.

1774
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
And one of the kids

1775
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
in the tour group is

1776
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Home Improvement's Taryn Noah Smith.

1777
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
This is one that

1778
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
I strongly remember seeing.

1779
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Didn't see it for decades but remembered it

1780
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
in a scared

1781
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
way and I think you'll understand why when I

1782
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
play the clip. So know that

1783
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
the scene as it begins

1784
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
is between

1785
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
youngest Home Improvement child

1786
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Taryn Noah Smith.

1787
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Who today is a submersible expert

1788
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
apparently. Now you know that.

1789
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
He gives his life to submarines

1790
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
now. And this

1791
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
tour guide. But will she remain a tour guide

1792
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
for long?

1793
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
I can't. I wish I could see it now.

1794
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Oh careful.

1795
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Wishes do come true at Disneyland.

1796
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
I didn't come here to be

1797
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
careful.

1798
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Oh my god she turned into Maleficent.

1799
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Very well.

1800
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
You have been warned.

1801
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
She turned into Disney's sing-along

1802
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Maleficent with like the shinier

1803
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
face. Not as shiny as the Disney sing-along

1804
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Maleficent but close. It is

1805
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
a little bit shiny. It's definitely

1806
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
in that family. Yeah yeah. Was I

1807
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
particularly afraid of Maleficent

1808
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
in the cartoon? No. But you live

1809
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
actioned this Maleficent.

1810
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
You give her shiny green.

1811
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
And then digital red

1812
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
eyes. Yes. This sequence is

1813
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
terrifying. I definitely

1814
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
remember watching this.

1815
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
He does a

1816
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
big McAuley

1817
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
I said it wrong. How is it? McAuley.

1818
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Everybody yelled at me about this one. You said like McAuley.

1819
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
McAuley or something you said.

1820
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
McAuley or something.

1821
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
You got McAuley there.

1822
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
That's sort of how you say it. Like Mater would say it.

1823
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Hey McAuley cock.

1824
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
I turned into.

1825
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Scott's such a hick.

1826
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Listen to him say McAuley.

1827
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Hey McAuley there. He's got the same

1828
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
vocal tics as Mater the Toe Trunk.

1829
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Toe Mater.

1830
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Finally got an angle on Scott. Scott is such a

1831
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
dumb fuck hick.

1832
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
He thinks you say McAuley.

1833
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Hey McAuley cock. He don't eat.

1834
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Well yeehaw.

1835
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Scratches his butt. Scratches his

1836
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
rear and says McAuley all day.

1837
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Get her done.

1838
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Get her done Scott.

1839
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
McAuley I believe. McAuley.

1840
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
So

1841
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
anyway then

1842
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
he go. It becomes night.

1843
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
And he's like all

1844
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
of phantasmic is happening to him.

1845
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
And then Maleficent chases him around

1846
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
the park. It's

1847
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
a terrifying little scene. If you

1848
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
take these park specials at their word

1849
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
and you think this is what's actually going to happen

1850
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
this is

1851
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
a nightmare. And I did. I took every

1852
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
single

1853
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Splash Mountain is going to take a full

1854
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
two minutes to do

1855
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
the drop like Ernest. And

1856
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
I'm going to be hunted down

1857
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
for sport by Maleficent.

1858
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Yeah. No I didn't see this when I was a

1859
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
kid. Thank goodness. Because

1860
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
it would have really colored my feelings

1861
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
about the show. But anytime

1862
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
and what's weird also

1863
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
about it is these specials feel

1864
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
they don't feel like a movie.

1865
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
They're shot kind of like

1866
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
they're not like a home video. But they're not

1867
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
shot on like some film. They look

1868
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
like it's shot on video. So that almost

1869
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
lends itself to feeling like it's real

1870
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
more so even than a movie

1871
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
which you can even you can

1872
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
articulate it as a kid that you know what a movie

1873
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
looks like and feels like. But almost

1874
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
there's some distance between you and

1875
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
a movie versus this which is shot on

1876
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
video which to me as a

1877
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
kid would make stuff like that feel more real.

1878
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Like the news.

1879
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Like the news. Yeah. Right.

1880
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
They just pointed a camera at this.

1881
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
They didn't do anything.

1882
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
We were thankful. We're like

1883
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
I'm glad on the East Coast and the Midwest

1884
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
far away from this hell park

1885
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
where child actors

1886
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
keep getting comeuppance after comeuppance.

1887
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Yeah. Yeah.

1888
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Individual kids might be victimized

1889
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
by specific Disney villains.

1890
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
It could happen to you. So yeah.

1891
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
I'm just glad.

1892
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
I think they have targets on their back because they're

1893
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
celebrity kids. I was always hoping that the

1894
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
anonymity would make it so

1895
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Maleficent wouldn't even see me. Yeah

1896
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
maybe. Maybe. And she didn't

1897
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
attack you when you went to Disneyland. No

1898
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
I can't unless I ever pressed this

1899
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
greatly. I don't remember Maleficent

1900
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
attacking me. Okay that's good. You were

1901
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
comforted in early

1902
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
one thing about early

1903
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Fantasmic the old hag

1904
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
had like a pretty comical

1905
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
like character head on.

1906
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. She

1907
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
transforms from having a regular face

1908
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
to having like a big muppet face

1909
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
for sure.

1910
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Hopefully fire. Like it's

1911
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
mostly fireproof. Yeah.

1912
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
I hope that's a concern with all

1913
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
the wardrobe in this show. They used to

1914
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
soak all the costumes in gasoline but they had to stop

1915
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
doing it. So

1916
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
It's fun if it catches on fire. Yeah.

1917
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
There is a point

1918
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
where the Mickey

1919
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
I believe it's when he confronts the

1920
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
dragon and the very old

1921
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
version holds up a sword

1922
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
and you can see the

1923
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
hose of sparks.

1924
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
You can see the hose that is probably

1925
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
filled with sparks.

1926
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Sparks fluid.

1927
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
He's always you know there's been

1928
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
God knows how many Mickey's

1929
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
are actually on that island but

1930
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
A thousand.

1931
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Oh God. There's so many.

1932
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
They keep coming. They keep reproducing. The one has

1933
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
the gloves. The spark gloves.

1934
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
That has been a main stay I feel like

1935
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
on this show. You know what you bring up

1936
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Mikey mentioned the sing along songs

1937
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
video. The Disneyland fun sing along

1938
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
songs. Which is our first club three

1939
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
episode. And I think that ends

1940
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
with a pre-Fantasmic

1941
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Mickey shoot of

1942
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
the sparks from his fingers.

1943
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Right. I think this was something they had.

1944
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
This is something they could do

1945
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
maybe for commercials or

1946
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
very special events. But

1947
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
they made it part of nightly entertainment.

1948
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
And as we're talking I mean we can start getting into

1949
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
the show and just call out moments that we love.

1950
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
I mean this is great.

1951
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
And the music builds

1952
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
to it perfectly where it's like the music

1953
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
is so many like great like it's dynamics

1954
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
and hits. And I like that that's like

1955
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
dun dun dun.

1956
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
And it lets you go one arm two arm.

1957
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
They go up one more time.

1958
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Sparks. And Mickey

1959
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
shoots sparks. And we discover that

1960
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Mickey is a god. Yeah that's right.

1961
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
It always delights me.

1962
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
The spark gloves.

1963
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
No matter how much

1964
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
they like change the lighting

1965
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
or the projection to be like

1966
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
crisper and brighter. Like spark

1967
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
gloves still

1968
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
is as great as when the show started

1969
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
I feel like. The two things that I

1970
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
like. Well I like seeing Mickey do a lot of things.

1971
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
But the two things that always pop out

1972
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
in my mind of what I like to see the costumed

1973
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Disneyland Mickey do is shoot

1974
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
sparks and drum for

1975
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
real. And he does

1976
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
that. He hasn't done that in a parade lately

1977
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
but when there's a performer that's

1978
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
the drummer and they're wearing the Mickey outfit

1979
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
and they just go crazy on the drums on a big

1980
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
float. I am delighted

1981
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
and it's pretty equal with the sparks.

1982
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Well let me throw something at you.

1983
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Both. That's

1984
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
how they up the game.

1985
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Oh wow. They're shooting. He's drumming

1986
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
and shooting sparks

1987
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
while he does it. Now is that

1988
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
safe? No.

1989
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Let's give it a try.

1990
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Only one way to find out.

1991
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
And it should be one of those like Neil Peart

1992
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
like a hundred

1993
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
different drum crazy drum sets.

1994
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
I think Tommy Lee

1995
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
had a mechanism where he'd like float above

1996
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
the audience.

1997
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
It's like he's trapped in a drum cage.

1998
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Travis Barker did it on a blink tour

1999
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
once maybe. Well so all the great

2000
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
drummers have done it so why not include

2001
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
the greatest drummer Mickey. Wow that would

2002
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
rule. Let me ask you this

2003
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Mike. Do you like

2004
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
the walk around Mickey? Do you like

2005
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
the one that can blink?

2006
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Do I like? Yes. You like blinking

2007
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Mickey? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't know that there's a

2008
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Mickey I don't like that walks around.

2009
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Sure. Even blinking. Remember

2010
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
I went to the talking Mickey.

2011
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
The one with his arm around Minnie.

2012
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Well I don't like it as

2013
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
much. I like him as much but

2014
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
yeah, yeah. I like the blinking one fine.

2015
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
I wish the talking one was back. They retired

2016
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
the talking Mickey. For some reason.

2017
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Yeah they retired him.

2018
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
They put him on that island with all the Mickeys.

2019
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
We don't know how many are out there.

2020
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
They put him out there to pasture.

2021
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Welcome to Mickey Island.

2022
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
How do you eat you ask?

2023
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Well rats,

2024
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
squirrels and perhaps

2025
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
other Mickeys. Good luck.

2026
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
The original like nightmare mice

2027
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
that were from like the ice skating show

2028
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
that Wal just bought a mouse costume from

2029
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
with the holes in the face. Those are out

2030
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
on Tom Sawyer Island. They're still out there.

2031
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
They're on the island. We've been trying to find a way

2032
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
to kill ourselves.

2033
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
They skitter if you go out there in the daytime

2034
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
and you see something just in the corner

2035
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
of your eye but you look and there's nothing

2036
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
there. Right. That's the mutant ones.

2037
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Right. Mickey's birthday land. Mickey's

2038
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
out there. Yeah. They're all out there.

2039
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
But yeah it's

2040
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
basic. Yeah so they retired the one that

2041
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
I talked that I met in Disney World

2042
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
where I met him in his dressing room.

2043
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Wow. Yeah.

2044
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
So I'm glad you caught him in that window then.

2045
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Well right because I was

2046
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
upset when I went to the city hall to complain

2047
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
that initially you didn't get

2048
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
the talking Mickey yes.

2049
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
So yeah I like blinking. I like talking.

2050
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
I like stationary face as well.

2051
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Dear city hall, Mickey doesn't

2052
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
drum while shooting sparks.

2053
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Well how am I supposed

2054
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
to keep coming to the park until this is

2055
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
a reality? Yeah. Yeah. I would

2056
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
complain about any sort of thing.

2057
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Can I ask this? I meant to bring this up earlier.

2058
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Were you guys's family

2059
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
because I was texting with my dad

2060
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
about like

2061
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
were we did we camp

2062
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
out a lot for shows or

2063
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
parades. You know what

2064
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
I mean like setting up well before

2065
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
because he's like oh your mother

2066
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
was always

2067
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
on like getting a good spot for

2068
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
the parade getting a good and I

2069
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
was like but we wouldn't be there like an hour

2070
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
or 90 minutes before. He's like

2071
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
no like half hour. That was the

2072
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
most we ever. I think I'm similar.

2073
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
I feel like my mom would be willing

2074
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
to do it and if it was something new like

2075
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
this I bet we camped out for a little bit for this.

2076
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
And only

2077
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
my mom, dad and sister out.

2078
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
I think there was the

2079
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
other time you remembered was

2080
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
and we'll talk about the Fantasmic

2081
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
in Florida down the line.

2082
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
But that loading in

2083
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
the early days I think took a

2084
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
lot of time

2085
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
to really load in and

2086
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
out people as they were getting up to

2087
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
speed on that one. I'll tell you what

2088
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
it is a thing that I do not ever do

2089
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
today. This is

2090
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
will I get back there if there's shows

2091
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
that I feel like my son would

2092
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
really enjoy then possibly I

2093
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
could see getting back to that point. But

2094
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
for now a camp out it's

2095
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
been decades. Oh yeah.

2096
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
I don't know. Well I mean like

2097
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
they have the thing where you upcharge

2098
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
like we did the Main Street

2099
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Electrical. Yeah.

2100
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
So you eat at Blue Byte. You know you pay a

2101
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
bunch of money and then you have like a little spot

2102
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
they give you. Oh sure. So that's sometimes

2103
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
a little treat you can do. They do that

2104
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
with World of Color and stuff.

2105
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
I don't think we that's not

2106
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
especially when you go so often it's not something

2107
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
I make a point to

2108
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
do. Okay. But

2109
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
once in a while and if it's like

2110
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
a Mickey and the Magical Map or whatever that show

2111
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
was called that was in the theater with seats

2112
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
that's more of a like well we go

2113
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
and we can go early and sit down for

2114
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
45 minutes. Now that's a different story. Yeah easier with

2115
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
seats but those seated

2116
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
venues they may not open.

2117
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Well it depends. For much longer.

2118
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
It depends if they're doing like three or four

2119
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
shows in the day. I feel like you can get in there

2120
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
a little early but if they're like

2121
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
I forget what's the Little Mermaid show at Hollywood

2122
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Studios. I feel like that's running

2123
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
so many shows per day. Well that's been down for

2124
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
a while too. Sure but I'm just saying I think they run

2125
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
that show more often. Oh yeah they run that

2126
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
a lot. Than some other shows so it depends

2127
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
but yeah no especially in a home park

2128
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
you always have that feeling

2129
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
well I can always do it next time and maybe

2130
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
that's wrong. Maybe that's a wrong instinct

2131
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
but I do feel like I have it with a lot of things.

2132
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
You never know when something will catch on

2133
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
fire. Right and then they'll change it forever.

2134
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Go down for a year. Yeah. Somehow

2135
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Waterworld hasn't caught on fire that much.

2136
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Sure that's true.

2137
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Just one character on

2138
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
purpose every show.

2139
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Let's talk about some stuff

2140
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
that we like in

2141
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
the show.

2142
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Speaking of fire. Fire on

2143
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
water. Now they didn't invent

2144
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
this. This is possible. This has happened

2145
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
in the movies but had it ever

2146
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
happened in front of me I don't

2147
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
know. And at that scale

2148
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
it's pretty unbelievable. I mean

2149
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
it's second only to the projections

2150
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
on the water in terms of like that's

2151
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
possible

2152
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
blew my kid mind. Really loved it. And you

2153
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
could feel that mystery. You could feel that heat. Very cool.

2154
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Feeling the heat yeah. I mean I'm trying to

2155
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
remember when I even maybe it was like Six Flags

2156
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
stunt show or something when you feel the

2157
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
heat. Like as the Batman stunt

2158
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
show I saw in the early 90s where it's like

2159
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
they blew up a barrel of gasoline

2160
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
or something and it was like oh my

2161
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
god. Like that really will

2162
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
scare the shit out of you as a kid. Yeah

2163
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
we want our shows to stink.

2164
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Yes. Our shows should smell the

2165
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
high heaven or it's barely a show.

2166
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
But yeah that's the

2167
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
flames on the water is pretty crazy.

2168
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
That feels like

2169
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
that feels like end times to me. That feels

2170
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
like hell is on earth now.

2171
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Like it shouldn't be possible. I

2172
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
understand how it works. I think I do at

2173
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
least but it doesn't feel right.

2174
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
It feels magical. I'm not saved from fire

2175
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
when in water. My god.

2176
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Yes. I know that the oil

2177
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
tankers spill oil and it catches

2178
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
on fire. I know how that works but I'm just

2179
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
saying. It's like seeing a live oil

2180
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
tanker. It shouldn't be right. It must have been tough

2181
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
in the wake of Exxon Valdez.

2182
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Right yes.

2183
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
They had to get so much dawn soap

2184
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
up there to clean off those animals.

2185
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Yeah I just

2186
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
I will even I guess

2187
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
I should have said this earlier back. I also

2188
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
like when I went to Disneyland for the first time because

2189
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
in Disney World this is its own thing.

2190
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Yes. So when I was a kid that's

2191
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
what we saw it in its own like little theater

2192
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
thing. In an amphitheater that they specially

2193
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
built. Yeah so they did create a new

2194
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
area for this and the plan I believe

2195
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
is to talk about this down the road

2196
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
second gate question mark.

2197
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Yes I'm just I'm just saying it for

2198
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
context so like part of it was

2199
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
just almost when I was going

2200
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
here for the first time like noticing

2201
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
all of the fun like oh

2202
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
this shit all these lights are here

2203
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
and they're hidden here and I didn't notice that that

2204
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
was a big rig for the whole show.

2205
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Oh yeah. So like later like almost

2206
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
like putting it together after the fact

2207
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
not realizing maybe when I

2208
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
first went that Fantasmic is just it's right here

2209
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
and all this stuff is kind of hidden

2210
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
in the background. So you're there like

2211
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
much older and not even realizing that's

2212
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
how they did thinking like it's you know you know

2213
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
it is this like sectioned off amphitheater.

2214
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Right. And then you're in it you're everybody's walking

2215
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
through that amphitheater all day and walking

2216
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
on the show pieces you're on the ships.

2217
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
It's all happening and then they in a matter

2218
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
of hours they convert it. So I should have said earlier but yeah

2219
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
even just before any of the actual scenes

2220
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
itself it's just like I was I thought

2221
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
that was cool that it's all like

2222
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
hiding in plain sight. I have a question

2223
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
on a similar note to that. Yeah.

2224
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
The when

2225
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
the okay there's like King Louis

2226
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
and then there is a portion of the show

2227
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
that I call Rafts

2228
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
of Love and that is when the

2229
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
romantic sequences go

2230
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
it's Beauty and the Beast and

2231
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
I think at various times been Little

2232
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Mermaid or Tangled.

2233
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Tangled. And you hear

2234
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
very adult contemporary versions of

2235
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
the love songs from the movies. Yes.

2236
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Are those

2237
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
converted Tom Sawyer

2238
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Island rafts or are those their own

2239
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
vehicles because they certainly resemble

2240
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
them. So do they switch those

2241
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
out during the day

2242
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
or not. That is a good

2243
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
question. I hadn't even thought of that but maybe

2244
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
I mean they repurpose so much stuff.

2245
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Yeah. But is that a big

2246
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
headache to flip those

2247
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
and like put glowy

2248
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
roses on them or whatever.

2249
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
They have a lot of fiber optics on them

2250
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
now I feel like. I feel like I always

2251
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
saw those as separate barges.

2252
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
They might be and maybe the I can't picture

2253
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
the Tom Sawyer Island ones maybe those look

2254
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
woodsier, folksier.

2255
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
So I might be wrong on that.

2256
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
That's just one of those like is it

2257
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
in plain sight questions I had

2258
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
that I don't know. Another one that I was

2259
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
like wow this was

2260
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
in here pretty early.

2261
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
In the old old

2262
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
video Ariel

2263
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
is sitting on a rock with

2264
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
flippers. I don't know in

2265
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
the new one she is still doing that.

2266
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Uh huh.

2267
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
I don't know. I saw

2268
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
there's yeah is that in the

2269
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
that's a good question. Or is it just Ariel

2270
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
with legs. She has

2271
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
flippers I think. I'm pretty sure she has flippers.

2272
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
But I'd have to go double check that.

2273
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
I like the

2274
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
it's in the newer one

2275
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Aladdin and Jasmine with the carpet.

2276
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Yes. And the mist and stuff like

2277
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
a mist on the lake. That is

2278
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
really cool. That looks great.

2279
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
I think especially when they flip

2280
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
it to

2281
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
less projection.

2282
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Like almost like the mist goes

2283
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
away and there's more

2284
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
like stuff on the island.

2285
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Oh I see what you're saying. Yeah

2286
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
it's like a good reveal almost. It's not really

2287
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
revealing anything but it's like

2288
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
it's putting more focus on

2289
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
the carpet and the performers I suppose.

2290
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
But yeah that looks really cool.

2291
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
I really

2292
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
like the pink elephants

2293
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
sequence.

2294
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
I like that we have kind of a

2295
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
scary psychedelic

2296
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
moment in the show.

2297
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
It's maybe the coolest use of the

2298
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
mist screens because they think you know

2299
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
if you're it's like you're not meant to like

2300
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
stare at anything on the mist screens for a long

2301
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
time so it's better if it's more abstract

2302
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
and cutty or

2303
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
crazy designs and patterns and that's

2304
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
what that sequence is completely. But what

2305
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
I really like about it

2306
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
I've always really loved

2307
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
the music in that

2308
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
section because I

2309
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
find it to be such like

2310
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
funny meat head

2311
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
90s prog.

2312
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
It's so like the version of

2313
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
pink elephants they play which is very

2314
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
guitar heavy.

2315
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
I mean you'll see it's just like so bright

2316
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
it feels very like Pro Tools

2317
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
core.

2318
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Let me give you a taste to see what I mean.

2319
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Look out!

2320
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Look out!

2321
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
They're like guitar like guitar

2322
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
harmonies the guitars are playing.

2323
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
I'm going to go through a little solo and get

2324
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
to this one little part.

2325
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Pack of derbs!

2326
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Pack of derbs!

2327
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
That's really funny yeah.

2328
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Silly the dumbest like guy thinks he's

2329
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
cool right. That's a real dad playing guitar

2330
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
moment. I'm busting out

2331
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
this rockin version of

2332
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
pink elephants.

2333
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Same aesthetic as all the Marvel

2334
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
superhero island music.

2335
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Yeah yeah yeah.

2336
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Double guitar.

2337
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Yeah you're in the zone of like power rangers

2338
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
rock. I think it's kind of it kind of

2339
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
sounds in a way like like kind of like

2340
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Steve Vai

2341
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
type like

2342
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
you know get to say Triani like

2343
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
guitar 90s guitar

2344
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
virtuoso music.

2345
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
It's like really technically

2346
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
impressive but it's also like generic.

2347
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Yes.

2348
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Everybody playing

2349
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
is fantastic but it is produced like

2350
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
so blandly.

2351
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
But it also sounds like stuff that I listen to

2352
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
to like with the express purpose of

2353
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
like take me back to 1992.

2354
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
So I kind of

2355
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
love here and I love that it's never gotten fully

2356
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
fully

2357
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
90s.

2358
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
And on that note the music.

2359
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Let's talk music

2360
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
a little bit.

2361
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
I love I love this theme.

2362
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
I love hearing it.

2363
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
You know in the Esplanade

2364
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
I've I listen

2365
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
to it like specifically

2366
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
if you get it as the exit music

2367
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
on Spotify

2368
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
because you can listen to the you could

2369
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
go to Spotify and get the entire 25

2370
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
minutes score of the entire show.

2371
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
There's a lot to get through.

2372
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
But I like playing just the exit

2373
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
music which I guess is as people walk out

2374
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
that's what the word exit means.

2375
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
And I just

2376
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
it's just such a

2377
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
it's got some inherent 90s

2378
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
but also very classic.

2379
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
So bombastic and

2380
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
if you're talking instrumental music

2381
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
in the parks it's one of the pieces that

2382
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
moves me and transports me there the most.

2383
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Yeah it's one of those songs

2384
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
that maybe I'm

2385
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
misremembering or I've implanted

2386
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
a memory in my brain that doesn't actually

2387
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
that shouldn't be there. But I remember

2388
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
hearing this seeing the show for the first

2389
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
time and then us humming the song

2390
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
the whole trip. I don't remember which

2391
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
year it was which trip it was where we

2392
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
saw this for the first time. But

2393
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
it was one of those where we were like

2394
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
humming the phantasmag theme.

2395
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
And it's just I don't know

2396
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
top five

2397
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
top ten of any of these

2398
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
instrumental maybe pieces of music

2399
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
in general I would say.

2400
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Made for theme parks.

2401
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
I mean maybe then Soren after this and then

2402
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
after that music that like you

2403
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
hear but Soren I don't even think the first

2404
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
time we did it we were like humming it in the park

2405
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
even though it's really memorable.

2406
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
The only other time now in recent memory

2407
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
is Sinbad in Tokyo

2408
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Disney Sea where

2409
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
we were like humming the song

2410
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
the rest of the trip.

2411
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
It was immediately memorable

2412
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
and we were just like singing it

2413
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
for the rest. Yeah all those so

2414
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
many days or whatever we were there. How many

2415
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
was it? Was it three and a half? Was it four?

2416
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
I don't remember. How many days we spent.

2417
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Well however many it was.

2418
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
We were singing the song. Let's not go back to that.

2419
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
We don't want to go back to that. But yeah

2420
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
so but I'm pretty sure

2421
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
phantasmag and that are the two things

2422
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
I remember the most when music

2423
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
that we're hearing for the first time in the park

2424
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
like just sticks with you immediately.

2425
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
And it's like

2426
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
it just like makes you feel like I'm on

2427
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
an adventure. Yeah. This is the little

2428
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
theme of my adventure. Right.

2429
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
It's just the star of the show.

2430
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Yeah. It's the it's the best

2431
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
thing in the whole show.

2432
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Full of good stuff. Yes. I don't think

2433
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
this anymore. Not going to anything else but if it wasn't

2434
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
tied together by that magical

2435
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
fanfare. Yeah I don't think

2436
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
I don't think phantasmag is phantasmag

2437
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
and maybe doesn't last

2438
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
as long without the music. Yeah. I think

2439
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
you're right because they've done other like they've

2440
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
done other great shows where there's not

2441
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
necessarily where the music's fine but it's not as

2442
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
as memorable as that. But like

2443
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
nothing I mean maybe years before we were doing

2444
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
this podcast and I hadn't seen fully phantasmag

2445
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
the only the thing I build is a dragon

2446
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
or Mickey. Yeah. Yeah. But the

2447
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
song that's the big

2448
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
that's the fireworks of the show is the sound

2449
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
of the song what the song makes

2450
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
you feel a certain way. Yeah. With incredible

2451
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
speaker I mean the sound setup

2452
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
of this thing is unbelievable especially

2453
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
that it stays hidden all day. Right. And comes

2454
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
out at night. Let's just get a little hit

2455
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
of it. Bruce Healy is the composer. Yeah.

2456
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
It's funny because out of context

2457
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
too especially that the kind of like

2458
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
chiller version of it which is that

2459
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
the exit music it does feel like

2460
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
it could be in some sort of like industrial

2461
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
tape to teach fast food workers

2462
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
how to clean the equipment.

2463
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
One thousand percent and that's what I love about it.

2464
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
I chase that kind of music. I know I understand.

2465
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
That's what I want to hear all

2466
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
the time. It relaxes me so much.

2467
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
When cleaning the fry cooker at McDonald's

2468
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
make sure

2469
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
You will often find

2470
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
find some old video just some

2471
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
arbitrary thing. It's just

2472
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
yeah it's for Kmart internal use only

2473
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
and you're like damn that song what is

2474
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
up with it. It goes hard. Yeah. Yes.

2475
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
It's such a common occurrence.

2476
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
When you're working at Kmart make sure not

2477
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
to wear your blue jeans. Make sure to wear

2478
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
loafers and khaki pants.

2479
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Leave your young person clothes at home.

2480
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
You want to be treated as an adult. Bring a light

2481
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
sweater as well because sometimes at Kmart gets

2482
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
chilly but we like to keep our guests on their toes

2483
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
by keeping the temperature. Leave the blue jeans at home

2484
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
the blue light is what's

2485
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
the focus here at Kmart.

2486
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
The exciting world of Kmart.

2487
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
So let me say this without

2488
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
saying the name there is

2489
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
I had a conversation once that

2490
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
changed my that kind of warped

2491
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
me on Fantasmic forever.

2492
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
When I was talking

2493
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
to somebody who is

2494
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
a music industry person and also

2495
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
a big Disney parks fan

2496
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
and when talking to

2497
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
a music industry person I want to ask

2498
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
stories about David Foster

2499
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
who's come up on the show.

2500
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
80's mega producer

2501
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
why did he come up because of his Alan Thicke

2502
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
collaborations a couple months ago.

2503
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Some people have reached out like really wanting

2504
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
to nerd out about David

2505
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Foster with me and I appreciate you

2506
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
do it anytime. I am available for David

2507
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Foster talk.

2508
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Any and all times. But I

2509
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
asked about David Foster

2510
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
and this person said boy well if I were

2511
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
David Foster I would be pissed about Fantasmic.

2512
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
And I said

2513
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
what does that mean and he said

2514
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
Winter Games and I said

2515
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
of course know what you mean Winter Games

2516
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
the 1988 Winter

2517
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Olympics theme performed by

2518
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
David Foster for his beloved

2519
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Canada as they were in Calgary

2520
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
that year. What I'm going to play

2521
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
this is not a rip off

2522
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
but I think you could see

2523
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
tell me if you disagree with me but

2524
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
ever since I heard that I am like I think

2525
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
we're at least in the same tone.

2526
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
These are at least in the

2527
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
same genre of music

2528
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
I would say. Interesting. So here

2529
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
is a little bit of David Foster's Winter

2530
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Games.

2531
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
That's funny.

2532
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
It's really

2533
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
those hits.

2534
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
The hits really a big dynamic

2535
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
and then kind of like glistening

2536
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
like the river of piano

2537
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
going through it. And if I played the whole thing

2538
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
I think like the movements of it.

2539
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
I'm not making any rip off

2540
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
accusations. I'm happy that there's

2541
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
room in this world for both of these pieces

2542
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
of music. I just wonder if they were inspired

2543
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
by. It feels like a demo of Fantasmic

2544
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
or something. Yeah.

2545
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Well that's a knock on the

2546
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
lush orchestration of Winter Games.

2547
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
I apologize to the

2548
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
song Winter Games. What I would

2549
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
recommend either way whether or not

2550
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
you see musical similarities there

2551
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
here's what I'm going to recommend to any

2552
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
and all listeners and to you guys. You go on

2553
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
a road trip. You're on a little getaway that

2554
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
you're really amped for. You start that

2555
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
road trip with this playlist.

2556
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
Fantasmic exit music. Bruce

2557
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Healy. David Foster Winter Games.

2558
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
And then I

2559
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
believe. See if you go with me

2560
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
that I think that this is of the same

2561
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
maybe. I don't know what to call this. I was

2562
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
thinking on the way maybe is it like triumph

2563
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
rock. Is that maybe the genre

2564
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
of this music. It's kind of

2565
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
athletics. Yeah. I mean Mickey isn't

2566
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
in the Olympics but it's Olympic level feats.

2567
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
And I think part of

2568
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
all that I think number three of that playlist

2569
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
could be a very famous sports song.

2570
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Well.

2571
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
John Tesh.

2572
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
I mean you're

2573
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
it's got the hits. It's more hits.

2574
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
It reminds you of the

2575
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
the glory of victory

2576
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
of the defeat

2577
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
of enemies like old

2578
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
crones and I don't know the

2579
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
trailblazers if you're rooting against

2580
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
them.

2581
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Great SNL sketch about

2582
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
this song. Yes.

2583
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Tim Robinson sketch.

2584
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So

2585
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
anyway. Put that playlist

2586
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
together. That's good.

2587
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Yeah. And also you know if you

2588
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
get the John Tesh live version

2589
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
on Spotify then you get a little bit of the

2590
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
basketball sample at the beginning.

2591
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Because you know he tells the story of how he

2592
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Oh I've seen it. Yeah. Yes. Of course.

2593
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
He left himself an answering machine

2594
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
message. He plays it stirring

2595
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
to hear round ball rock live.

2596
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
I think that's all part.

2597
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Whatever the genre is called Triumph Rock

2598
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
I love it.

2599
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
So there's my little musical terror.

2600
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
What have we missed?

2601
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
The big changes

2602
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
I want to highlight like

2603
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
one moment from

2604
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
the old old version of the show

2605
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
that I don't know that I've ever seen

2606
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
live. There was a

2607
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
giant Ursula

2608
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
float puppet

2609
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
thing. Like a bitch. She was a big

2610
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
barge. She was a big barge.

2611
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
She was an Ursula barge. She was lit up for maybe

2612
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
40 seconds.

2613
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
And it looked expensive.

2614
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
You know what is she inflatable

2615
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
because the arms wave but it might be

2616
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
like where it's kind of being

2617
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
the arms are being selectively blown

2618
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
so it looks like she's like singing or casting

2619
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
a spell. I thought it was cool.

2620
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
I mean she was a big

2621
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
that was a big villain at

2622
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
the time. A recent villain.

2623
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
And you know what some of the magic

2624
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
of Phantasmic and for me at that

2625
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
age is we're getting

2626
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
my movie the recent

2627
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
movies that have hit me as a kid

2628
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
so I grew up in this Disney

2629
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Renaissance era but they weren't able

2630
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
to put in permanent attractions yet so we're

2631
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
getting Beauty and the Beast Little Mermaid.

2632
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Beauty and the Beast gets in there fast.

2633
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
And it didn't in

2634
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
like significant permanent ways

2635
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
for a long time so

2636
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
so yes that's

2637
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
great. I think that was gone by

2638
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
97. That's in the Phantasmic

2639
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
problems category.

2640
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Continuously broke down.

2641
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Ultimately was

2642
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
replaced by not replaced

2643
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
because it took a long time but

2644
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
as kind of a spiritual

2645
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
replacement they did

2646
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
big flotsam and jetsams

2647
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
her

2648
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
eels. Is that what they are?

2649
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
And which

2650
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
I never knew how they worked but I

2651
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
saw like a kind of

2652
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
a diagram of it

2653
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
that those were run on

2654
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
jet skis.

2655
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
It was like a big mask

2656
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
that they put over a jet ski.

2657
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
I guess similar to that

2658
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
scary thing pulling the Disneyland Paris

2659
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
boat. And

2660
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
I mean imagine that's your job. You're

2661
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
driving gigantic eels

2662
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
around via jet ski.

2663
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Cool. Yeah. Well the jet ski I mean I

2664
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
recently we saw the purge

2665
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
show at Universal at Horror Nights

2666
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
with like neon jet skis.

2667
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
And I would imagine I mean that's cool

2668
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
too because that you get to be more showcased

2669
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
now. You're the guy or whoever the

2670
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
person driving a neon

2671
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
jet ski. But be hauling

2672
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
an eel behind you or next

2673
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
to you. That'd be awesome.

2674
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Anyway

2675
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
I mean in the cross section I'll try to post

2676
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
that somewhere is so crazy.

2677
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
These however

2678
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
capsized all the time, bumped into

2679
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
each other all the time. These do not last

2680
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
very long. Yeah. It's saying

2681
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
something though that like

2682
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
they've always tried very

2683
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
ambitious stuff

2684
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
in like limited space

2685
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
for Fantastic. And there's

2686
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
been technically a lot of

2687
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
troublesome stuff. Be it like

2688
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
the pyro or

2689
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
the dragon or Ursula

2690
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
or the

2691
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
eels. But it is

2692
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
it's good that they keep trying

2693
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
new things and iterating new

2694
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
things. I think

2695
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
one of the

2696
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
interesting

2697
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
things might be a short

2698
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
as the show is going on

2699
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
I feel like more and more is

2700
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
taken over by missed

2701
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
projection. Yeah true.

2702
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
And all of and the like

2703
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
you know the

2704
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
whatever. What is the

2705
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
projecting perfectly onto the wall?

2706
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
What is the

2707
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
projection mapping?

2708
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Yeah thank you.

2709
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
There's a lot of that and I don't

2710
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
I mean I'm just like

2711
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
tired of it.

2712
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
It's been used a lot. Yeah.

2713
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
I think it's a little bit of clutter

2714
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
in the Fantasmic context.

2715
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
You'll be happy to know that

2716
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
the Pirates of the Caribbean was on the

2717
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
sailing ship Columbia for a while.

2718
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
I believe Peter Pan

2719
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
coming back in the

2720
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
in the new version.

2721
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
The Return of Peter.

2722
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
Pinocchio is still the McKets

2723
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
are still going. The Marionettes are still

2724
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
going. We haven't seen the new show.

2725
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
Maybe there's Pans back.

2726
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
The McKets are back. My little puppet

2727
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
boys are back.

2728
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Little boys that

2729
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
don't want to grow up are back and puppet boys

2730
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
are back. That should be the tag

2731
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
because of the billboards going down the anus.

2732
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Puppet boys and boys that

2733
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
don't want to grow up are back.

2734
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Thank God. What can we do?

2735
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Certainly we can't move on from this.

2736
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
I get, look

2737
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
other people don't feel this way. Other people are not

2738
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
creeped out by Peter Pan as I am.

2739
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
They just added a new area in Disney

2740
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Sea.

2741
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
I just, I don't know.

2742
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
But I guess I'm being very

2743
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
age picky. Here I am upset with you

2744
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
guys for being obsessed with

2745
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
pussies and shawls. I guess I don't want you

2746
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
to be, I just want you to be your age.

2747
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Just enjoy the age that you're at.

2748
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Yeah, but you're the boy who never

2749
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
grew up.

2750
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
How are we?

2751
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
I am not that.

2752
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
We're like Peter Pan's

2753
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
parents. That's really what Jason

2754
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
and I are like. We're Peter, what's Robin

2755
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Williams' name in Hook?

2756
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Peter Panning.

2757
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
Banning with a B.

2758
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
But he's Peter.

2759
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
He's not the parents, right?

2760
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
He's Peter. Yes, he is Peter.

2761
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
He is Peter. Does he have parents?

2762
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Did we see his parents in that movie? I don't remember.

2763
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
I don't know. I don't think so. No, I don't think you do.

2764
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Here's my question. This is, it's called

2765
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Fantasmic, and this is

2766
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
the closest you have to a Fantasia

2767
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
show or ride. Oh, I forgot

2768
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
to say, and that was an idea

2769
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
kind of, there was Riverhaunt,

2770
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
then it was, is there some like we do

2771
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Fantasia live,

2772
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
show clips, play live music, and it kind

2773
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
of grew out of that. So that's at the base of it.

2774
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
But yeah, they show,

2775
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
you know, there's clips from Fantasia,

2776
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
there's the Chernobog stuff, but it's kind of mixed in

2777
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
with like Monstro,

2778
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
there's a clip of Monstro, whatever, it's all in the projection.

2779
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
But you get Mickey in his

2780
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Fantasia Sorcerer's Apprentice

2781
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
outfit. And that's the closest,

2782
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
yeah, that's like, there's never been a,

2783
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
I mean, there's really never been a Mickey ride,

2784
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
but you do, it's, I guess that's

2785
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
probably, it's like the closest thing

2786
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
is a mashup of Sleeping

2787
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Beauty and Fantasia in some ways.

2788
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
That's like the kind of climax of it

2789
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
in a lot of ways. And it's kind of interesting,

2790
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
like I kind of think it's interesting to mash two movies

2791
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
up. Steve and Willy

2792
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
too, in their pioneering Mark

2793
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Twain. Yeah, and obviously there's a ton of movies, but also

2794
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
like this, in my mind,

2795
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
my mind, I think of those two, the things

2796
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
you think of are Mickey in his outfit

2797
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
and Maleficent Dragon,

2798
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
which are from two separate

2799
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Disney movies. So I think more mashup

2800
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
shows like that are good ideas

2801
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
potentially. Sure. I don't know, we could

2802
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
brainstorm real quick. I don't know,

2803
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
two things, Peter Pan

2804
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
and Pinocchio perhaps.

2805
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Aye, there used to be a lot more.

2806
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
Send that back to the cardboard.

2807
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
I don't know, take this song, there's

2808
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Peter Pan and he's fighting,

2809
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
like, Monstro is fighting Peter Pan.

2810
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
That's interesting.

2811
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
I just want, can we, let's just mash

2812
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
up. Yeah. Peter gets

2813
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
turned into a puppet boy.

2814
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
How about that? Peter Pan

2815
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
we found a way to

2816
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
worsen the...

2817
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
And he's got strings,

2818
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
but he still wants to fly. All you gotta do is

2819
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
draw those ventriloquist lines

2820
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
under his mouth and now I'm

2821
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
even more out than usual. That's pretty good.

2822
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
There used to be a lot more Pinocchio

2823
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
in this show, admittedly.

2824
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
How about this for a mashup?

2825
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Go ahead. Going really

2826
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
small characters,

2827
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
the rescuers

2828
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
meet

2829
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
the great mouse detective.

2830
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
So, kind of around

2831
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
the same time periods,

2832
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
I feel like, at least at first.

2833
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
More realistic mice meeting

2834
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
up. Well, let me ask you this question.

2835
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Will the mice be to scale?

2836
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Will they be tiny

2837
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
mice? Cause it'll be hard

2838
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
cause the rescuers and the great mouse detective are

2839
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
actually the sizes of

2840
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
mice in the movies.

2841
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Mickey's more of an anthropomorphic. For a live theme park

2842
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
show, it might be hard if they were to

2843
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
scale. That's a good thought.

2844
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Alright, you're thinking, yeah, and if you're

2845
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
at a distance, like across the river, great.

2846
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
But for a motion picture where you can zoom in

2847
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
and do some close ups.

2848
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
So you're talking about a movie, maybe, too.

2849
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
Oh, this is a whole franchise.

2850
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
The great mouse detective

2851
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
meets the rescuers.

2852
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Okay, alright.

2853
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Do they save somebody, or I guess

2854
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
there's some sort of a mystery to be solved

2855
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
and a rescue that need to be enacted

2856
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
at the same time. Well, somehow, Rattigan

2857
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
has returned.

2858
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
And that's the opening crawl.

2859
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Yeah, that's the opening. That's the opening crawl.

2860
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
Did they kill Rattigan at the end of the great mouse detective?

2861
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
I feel like he gets tossed off, much like

2862
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Moriarty in

2863
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
the. It's like a Gaston, it's like a generic

2864
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
piece. But again, as with

2865
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Palpatine, that was a fault

2866
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
of the death that turned out to not be true.

2867
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
So, yes, we could be in

2868
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
somehow territory. They do kill a lot of the

2869
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
villains off at the end of these

2870
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
movies. Yeah, but in a way that you don't

2871
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
see. Right. You don't see the

2872
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
splat. The kids don't see the splat.

2873
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
Yeah, which isn't too satisfying. If you really,

2874
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
if you hate Gaston, if you hate

2875
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
Rattigan, I want to know.

2876
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
I want to see a corpse.

2877
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Scar gets eaten at the end of Lion King

2878
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
by the hyenas, right?

2879
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
That's sort of what's implied. But you meet

2880
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
his son later on.

2881
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
You meet Scar's son later? Isn't that

2882
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
like a TV show or

2883
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
directed DVD? Oh, maybe. I don't know.

2884
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Scar's son? I don't believe it.

2885
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Scar's bastard child?

2886
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Oh, that's the title. Great. Yes, that rings a bell

2887
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
now. Yeah, Scar's bastard child.

2888
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Does he talk about how he plays?

2889
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
I don't know. I got to look into all of this.

2890
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
I was going to keep talking, but I had to

2891
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
sneeze, and then it didn't come in. I think it's coming again.

2892
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
I may have to sneeze anyway.

2893
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
I'm trying to fight it. Okay, I'll just sneeze.

2894
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
There it is.

2895
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
It's fine. Everything's

2896
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
fine. It's amazing that doesn't happen

2897
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
more often. I was just thinking that

2898
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
this is crazy that the

2899
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
adrenaline is pumping so much during the

2900
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
show that rarely do I ever have to sneeze.

2901
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Yeah, yeah. Because I'm in fight

2902
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
mode or whatever. It's so high octane, yes.

2903
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Sneezes

2904
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
are weakness, I say. Yeah, you would think

2905
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
we were ending that. And we feel so strong.

2906
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Sure, yeah.

2907
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
It's like we've all got, I mean,

2908
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
we do, you know, Mickey doesn't

2909
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
drum with spark gloves, but

2910
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
we are podcasting and shooting

2911
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
sparks out of our fingers

2912
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
a lot.

2913
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
We don't film it, actually.

2914
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
It's pretty exciting.

2915
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
What have we missed about this thing?

2916
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
You know, we've, okay, so

2917
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
yes, good.

2918
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
We've already alluded to it,

2919
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
but if you're not seeing the show,

2920
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
it absolutely ruins

2921
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Disneyland at night.

2922
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
If you're trying to get from point A to point

2923
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
B that's around adventure land.

2924
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
But then it

2925
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
sucks a lot of people out of it. That is true, too.

2926
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
But it is something,

2927
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
if you are going to see it,

2928
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
go early, see it, and stake out of place

2929
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
or do some sort of dining package.

2930
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
But if you are not seeing Fantasmic,

2931
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
avoid at all costs.

2932
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
Avoid New Orleans Square

2933
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
area. It is hard to get around

2934
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
this area. Make sure that you have done,

2935
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
you know, Pirates Saundered Mansion,

2936
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
anything in that direction, the entire

2937
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
west of the park. Make sure that you

2938
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
have cleared it out. Yes. And hopefully

2939
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Tomorrowland becomes a ghost town.

2940
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Stick to Batuu or Tomorrowland.

2941
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Stick to Batuu.

2942
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
But don't exit that one way.

2943
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Batuu is empty at night.

2944
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
No one's there. Despite the fact it looks

2945
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
terrific. No performers, no people.

2946
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
That's not the issue.

2947
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
Supposedly Sabine

2948
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Wren or whatever is hanging out.

2949
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
There's new characters around in Batuu.

2950
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
I don't know if you're messing with us.

2951
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
No, I'm not. I think I just said a name of

2952
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
one of the characters. Sabine is the name?

2953
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Just put some arbitrary sounds together.

2954
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Sabine Wren, I think I actually got the name correct.

2955
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Yep. And she's going to be

2956
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
in Galaxy's Edge or is already there.

2957
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
What is she? What does she do? She's from a show.

2958
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
She's not an old crone, I hope.

2959
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
She's a Mandalorian warrior

2960
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
and a graffiti artist.

2961
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
And she's got a creative and rebellious

2962
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
spirit. So is she gonna do

2963
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
like airbrushed art of the kids?

2964
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
She's gonna do, yes. You can get

2965
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
a caricature of yourself painted

2966
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
by Sabine Wren

2967
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
in Batuu. Sabine Wren will draw you

2968
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
with a baseball bat in your hand

2969
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
eating Cracker Jacks. That's correct.

2970
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
Will she like spray paint like Calvin

2971
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
pissing on Snoke?

2972
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
On his body?

2973
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Yeah, on his dead body. On Snoke's dead body?

2974
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Remember he died. I certainly do

2975
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
remember. He didn't just go into a tunnel.

2976
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
He didn't go into a tunnel of ambiguity.

2977
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
Snoke hasn't returned yet.

2978
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Yes. But somehow

2979
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
in episode 12, Snoke could return.

2980
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
If they give me the keys to the Star Trek

2981
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
Wars. No, do it.

2982
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
If they give you the keys to Star Trek, get Snoke

2983
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
in there. That'll surprise everybody.

2984
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
You'd never see it coming. Snoke shows up.

2985
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Yeah. No, here she is.

2986
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Sabine Wren is now appearing

2987
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
for a limited time in Galaxy's Edge.

2988
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
How about that?

2989
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Okay. Well, took the helmet off.

2990
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
It's on a phone far away from me.

2991
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
No, right? Fair enough.

2992
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
But, you know, maybe that'll

2993
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
draw some people from Vandesmic. I don't

2994
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
know. A question.

2995
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Will the dragon come back?

2996
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
What is this going to be? So a really, really quick

2997
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
history. Original dragon

2998
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
was a big head on a cherry picker.

2999
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
I kind of liked it. I kind of like

3000
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
spindly, old school

3001
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
dragon. I like it too.

3002
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
Yeah, I don't know. I liked it.

3003
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
He just kind of became abstract

3004
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
and he was a wiry guy.

3005
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
I almost found the second one like goofier

3006
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
with his big pot belly.

3007
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
What damage is

3008
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
this guy going to do? If he has to take

3009
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
one step, he's screwed. It's all about

3010
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
fire breath. If Mickey runs 10 feet

3011
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
away, that guy ain't running.

3012
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
I think this is a perfect, I don't think

3013
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
they can do it, but

3014
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
I would love it if there was some drone

3015
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
element at the end.

3016
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
Some sort of drone thing.

3017
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
And I don't know, because we've talked

3018
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
about this before, there were patents filed by

3019
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Disney for drones to like

3020
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
puppet giant marionettes down

3021
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Main Street, which I think are not

3022
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
against, it's against the law to put drones

3023
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
over the guest's head.

3024
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
This is over the river.

3025
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
That's what I'm saying. So this almost feels like

3026
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
this is the perfect place in Disneyland to do it

3027
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
because you don't have to have them

3028
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
over the guest's head.

3029
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
But what is that going to be?

3030
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
How is it not just a bunch of drones?

3031
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
Well, I don't, that's a

3032
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
good question. I haven't really thought this through,

3033
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
but it could be some

3034
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
drones making the shape

3035
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
of a head or a character, because they can do

3036
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
that now. They have the technology

3037
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
to do that. But if it's the

3038
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
puppeting where like, you know, you have four

3039
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
drones basically

3040
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
acting as if they're a puppeteer hands,

3041
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
just put a big Pinocchio at the

3042
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
finale. Yeah, I was going to say, I have a really

3043
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
famous puppet. Pinocchio gets puppeted at the end

3044
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
and Mickey just kind of hangs out with them.

3045
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
So the dragon is replaced by

3046
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Pinocchio? It's just a

3047
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
fun dance? There's not a fight?

3048
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
Well, it could be evil.

3049
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
It could be evil, but I think it would be better if

3050
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
they just have a nice dance. Pinocchio

3051
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
and Mickey just have a nice dance.

3052
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
You don't have the tension to get out of Fantasmic.

3053
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Yeah, it's too stressful is one of my

3054
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
problems with Fantasmic. I just would like Mickey

3055
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
and big Pinocchio. Big

3056
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Pinocchio. Like a two-story Pinocchio.

3057
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
You make Pan a puppet and I hate him

3058
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
more. You make Pinocchio big.

3059
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
Big. Oh, God. Yeah.

3060
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
And then the drones just sort of pilot him

3061
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
kind of going up and down. I'm going to go light this

3062
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
show on fire. I will

3063
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
swim through the

3064
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
balloon or whatever it's called.

3065
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
I'll kill the drones. I'll kill this mega Pinocchio

3066
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
before it kills us. Okay. Well, how about this?

3067
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
How about a big, evil Stromboli?

3068
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
And he tries to puppet Mickey.

3069
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
So Mickey's got to shoot fire

3070
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
at him and then Stromboli just goes

3071
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
up like

3072
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
kindling like a deep-fried turkey on

3073
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Thanksgiving, you know?

3074
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
Flash, like what do they call it? Flash

3075
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
frying? Flash fry, thank you.

3076
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Well, you know what? I love

3077
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
that. I think Stromboli is a more

3078
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
relevant villain

3079
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
than most because

3080
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
he is an evil

3081
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
show business

3082
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
character with a certain look

3083
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
and does he not, you know, he's like the

3084
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
warning to not get

3085
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
to be very careful

3086
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
if you're going into the show business direction.

3087
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Is he not the original Harvey

3088
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Weinstein? Absolutely.

3089
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
So to see him go up in

3090
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
flames, would that not

3091
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
be, that might scare a lot

3092
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
of kids out of child acting.

3093
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Future Tara Noah-Smiths,

3094
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
who left the industry correctly

3095
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
to follow his submersible passion.

3096
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
You know, if anybody's

3097
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
tugging on their mom's shoulders, I want to act.

3098
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
You put a big Stromboli in front of

3099
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
him, that'll send him running the other way.

3100
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Very good point. Sure. So yeah,

3101
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
more Stromboli maybe just in general at

3102
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Disneyland then. He's everywhere.

3103
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
Stromboli on Main Street.

3104
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Hey, you will come with me!

3105
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Around any turn, there

3106
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
could be a giant Stromboli. Giant

3107
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
honest John?

3108
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
Yeah. Well, honest, yeah.

3109
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
But put Stromboli in Galaxy's Edge

3110
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
too. Yeah.

3111
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Now, all right, again,

3112
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
I'm about IP Surprise.

3113
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
Snoke and Star Trek. Stromboli

3114
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
and Star Wars. Right. Now

3115
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
I'm interested. Now we're innovating.

3116
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
Unkar Plot was kind of Stromboli-esque.

3117
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Unkar, oh, Unkar Plot was not

3118
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
a Stromboli, you think? I mean.

3119
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
You don't, I don't think so. I think he had

3120
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
roped Rey into like

3121
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
kind of a shady business deal

3122
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
for that inflatable bread.

3123
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
Well. For that big, for that quarter

3124
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
portion. Yeah, he wasn't on

3125
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
the level, but I don't know that he was so

3126
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
nefarious. I didn't get

3127
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
that from Unkar Plot in his

3128
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
brief time. You think so?

3129
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
He's no Stromboli. I don't think Unkar

3130
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
Plot is a Stromboli. They're odd areas

3131
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
because neither of them are like

3132
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
Satan, but. Right. But Stromboli

3133
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
is a bad guy. Yeah. He's a bad

3134
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
dude. Unkar Plot might have

3135
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
a heart of gold. We just don't know. Does he have

3136
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
anybody in, does he have a droid in a cage back

3137
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
there? And does he tell the droid you'll never be

3138
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
a real boy? I hope

3139
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
not. I had a good feeling about Unkar

3140
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Plot, honestly, until Jason said that.

3141
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
So he's really. I don't know why you'd have a good

3142
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
feeling of it. Maybe like no feeling,

3143
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
maybe neutral, but I don't think he's a good

3144
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
guy. Well, I had a good feeling about,

3145
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
I enjoyed him. You're behind the

3146
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
scenes knowledge that Simon Pegg was

3147
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
in that outfit.

3148
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Was he? Oh yeah. I think he might be

3149
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
right. Yeah. I think he did play.

3150
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
But that might have been coloring your reflection.

3151
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Maybe that's what it is. You know what's also coloring

3152
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
my reflection is that one of the best parts

3153
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
of the sequel trilogy, and I mean this sincerely,

3154
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
is that bread. Oh yeah.

3155
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
That bread is so fun

3156
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
and good. Yeah. And is one of the

3157
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
top five things in those sequel trilogies

3158
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
maybe. Maybe top ten. So

3159
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
being that you associate him with the

3160
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
bread. I do. As far as you know, he might have invented the

3161
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
bread. Yes. So. It's possible

3162
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
he invented the bread. Who could be bad

3163
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
if you invent magic bread? Yeah.

3164
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
Hmm. So. All right. I'll give you that. He needs

3165
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
to be in, put him in Batuu.

3166
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
It's insane. Smack in your leg.

3167
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
You're insistent on this. Well there's, it's fun.

3168
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
Give me fun stuff. He's from

3169
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
the sequel trilogy that's in the same timeline.

3170
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
He didn't get killed in the movies. You know what, juice up

3171
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
mobile pickup.

3172
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
You know, mobile food ordering.

3173
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
Juice up the pickup spot.

3174
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
Have an Unkarplud animatronic

3175
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
screaming at people. Oh, okay.

3176
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
I see what you're saying. Faster. Yeah.

3177
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Well and then not selling the bread is a mistake too.

3178
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
We've talked about this before on the show. Well I think they were

3179
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
for a little while. Were they?

3180
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
But as like, it was just a custard. What do you mean the bread's

3181
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
made up though? You can't do

3182
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
the bread really. I want the bread. You put some

3183
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
green sponge cake on top of a custard.

3184
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
I want the bread more than I want the milk. Yeah.

3185
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
I want the bread from seven more than I want the blue

3186
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
milk. I don't care about the milk anymore.

3187
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
I'm never gonna try that milk again. I did it

3188
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
opening weekend. No interest in having the

3189
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
milk over again. Did you try the green milk?

3190
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
I don't remember.

3191
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
It's a little more herbal. I don't care.

3192
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
I want the bread. Wow. We tried one

3193
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
of it. You can get a little

3194
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
you know, little. Oh you get a little.

3195
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
Now we're talking. Now we're talking.

3196
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
Little nip in there, you know.

3197
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
I get my flask out. I put a little on the green milk.

3198
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
I was about to say that you guys were recovering some of

3199
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
the old person energy until

3200
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
you called it a nip. Nip

3201
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
took it for ten more years.

3202
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Of a little sip of alcohol. I want

3203
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
to say also just on the way out

3204
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
the door. I was

3205
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
inspired by Mickey. I was starting to use my

3206
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
imagination. And I thought

3207
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
of a little show.

3208
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
I don't know where it goes and

3209
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
how we could do it. But I did start

3210
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
conjuring a little show called Phantasmike.

3211
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
It's a journey

3212
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
into your imagination

3213
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
Mike. Where you use

3214
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
the power of your imagination

3215
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
to get Prince and Bono to come to your

3216
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
birthday.

3217
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
In this world they have

3218
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
very busy schedules. But when they

3219
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
hear that a cool

3220
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
youthful seeming guy with a really

3221
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
chill vibe is having a birthday

3222
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
they drop everything so they could come

3223
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
be a part of it. You gotta

3224
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
have villains as part of this.

3225
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
Of course. So the villain

3226
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
is me. It's a green version

3227
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
of me. I show up and say

3228
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
people don't really know the

3229
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
song Black Balloon by the Goo Goo

3230
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
Dolls. Oh yeah it's making me mad

3231
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
hearing the dialogue. I know. As angry as you've

3232
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
gotten every time this has come up.

3233
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
But you Prince and Bono show

3234
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
me you lead an all star

3235
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
jam for 20

3236
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
minutes of Black Balloon.

3237
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Olivia Rodrigo shows up for the first half

3238
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
and she cuts out of there.

3239
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
And I melt

3240
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
and scream. And

3241
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
Dr. Chase Meridian and Minnie come and

3242
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
give you kisses on the cheek.

3243
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
One each though makes like

3244
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
I don't want it to be excessive. Hey

3245
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
use your imagination. Wait your imagination

3246
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
is to keep it limited?

3247
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
Yes just one on each cheek.

3248
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
Minnie on the right. Shit Dr.

3249
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
Chase on the left. And then they leave.

3250
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
Yeah yeah good. You

3251
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
advise them, girls you look

3252
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
a little chilly. Might want to throw on a light sweater.

3253
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Not a sweatshirt. Ladies do you have a light

3254
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
sweater? Yes that's a good

3255
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
plus up for the end of it. Watch out for drifts.

3256
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
Okay yeah no I like all

3257
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
of that. I think that's nice and wholesome.

3258
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Are you big? Are you a big

3259
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
robot or some kind or? Yeah

3260
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
I think I could be. Yeah yeah. Why not

3261
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
a stromboli style. Okay.

3262
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
Alright I'm all the villains.

3263
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
We're mashing up villains like you were saying.

3264
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
So I'm all the villains. I am massive.

3265
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
I am green. And I

3266
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
have a big stromboli beard. And you have

3267
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
the puppet lines by your mouth as

3268
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
well. You know what I'll give it. It's your show.

3269
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
It's your imagination.

3270
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
And since I'm the one

3271
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
who's ruining this beloved song

3272
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
for you. You can paint me any way that you

3273
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
want. Can he have Chernabog wings?

3274
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
Chernabog what? Wings. Oh I like

3275
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
that. I don't mind this.

3276
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
This is cool. You know

3277
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
I was actually pretty old when I

3278
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
learned the name Chernabog.

3279
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
That seems like something I would be an

3280
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
annoying 12 year old about. I think

3281
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
I was pretty old by the time I heard

3282
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
the name Chernabog and knew what it was.

3283
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
I think I was an older man when I

3284
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
knew what I learned. I was something

3285
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
years old. I'm sure I definitely

3286
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
told people who were not asking

3287
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
that the wizard named Yen Sid

3288
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
was Disney backwards.

3289
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
That old crone.

3290
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
Yen Sid. The famous old crone.

3291
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Mickey's mentor. The original

3292
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
wizard.

3293
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
That stops him from dreaming.

3294
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
That's a real, that's a relevant

3295
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
villain as well. If Stromboli's like Harvey Weinstein

3296
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Yen Sid

3297
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
is the boss who doesn't want upward

3298
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
mobility. Who probably doesn't pay

3299
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
very well. Who doesn't like

3300
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
you turn the other way while

3301
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
the employee uses the

3302
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
facilities to pursue their dreams.

3303
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
You don't need a union.

3304
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
We're all family here.

3305
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Normal healthy units.

3306
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
Families.

3307
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
Those brooms tried to unionize on me

3308
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
and I took away their ability to talk.

3309
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
Did you know like only four

3310
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
months ago all the brooms could talk. One zap

3311
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
that was the end of that.

3312
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
Can't talk back when you can't talk.

3313
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
So you knew that years before

3314
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
you knew Chernobyl. I feel like that was like

3315
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
did you know kind of fact

3316
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
at the Disney hotel room channel

3317
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
or around MGM studios

3318
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
or something. And now you're

3319
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
a professional did you know factologist.

3320
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
That's really

3321
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
isn't that what this is. The most beloved

3322
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
kind of person on planet earth.

3323
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
People love it. That's all

3324
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
I know. The most likable type.

3325
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
That's what we are.

3326
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
Well did you know

3327
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
that there is a whole

3328
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
other world of Fantasmic

3329
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
at Disney World in Florida.

3330
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
Disney's Hollywood studios. And did you

3331
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
know that if we talked about that

3332
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
this episode would get much longer.

3333
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
So here is my proposition

3334
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
that after Fantasmic

3335
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
finally returns after the by then

3336
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
more than a year hiatus

3337
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
when we determine what that

3338
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
ending is

3339
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
in the lack of a dragon. If it is a giant

3340
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
flaming stromboli. If it is just

3341
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
a nice Pinocchio made of drones.

3342
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
We'll see. I propose

3343
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
that the episode is we talk about that.

3344
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
We say do we like that or not.

3345
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
We talk about Disney World version.

3346
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
We talk about Tokyo version.

3347
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
Which I saw.

3348
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
So you know just a big

3349
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
old potpourri

3350
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
of the rest of Fantasmic.

3351
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
We like the sound of that. I think we love it.

3352
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Ok great. Well that will be coming

3353
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
down the road. Which means we can

3354
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
close out this one.

3355
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Unless there's any further thoughts about

3356
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
temperatures, conditions

3357
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
in which light shawls or sweaters

3358
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
should be packed. I will say this.

3359
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
I don't have any other thoughts about

3360
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
windiness. But

3361
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
ever since we talked about city food I've been

3362
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
hungering for a firehouse sucks.

3363
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
You can always go to the

3364
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
North Hollywood location.

3365
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
That's like $2 cheaper.

3366
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
I know where that is. I think we should go there.

3367
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
I will say this.

3368
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
I don't. Ok.

3369
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
The brand. If you want to try

3370
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
the brand again.

3371
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
That makes sense to me. But the idea that you would

3372
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
specifically want to go back

3373
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
to the city firehouse subs

3374
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
post piece of plastic

3375
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
in the sandwich. Which Jason described

3376
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
online as just a little nub.

3377
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
Just a little nub. One of the most disturbing

3378
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
things you've ever said.

3379
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Saying a lot. That's

3380
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
where I draw the line. There has

3381
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
been a thing

3382
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
nubbing at me since the city.

3383
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
I let this pass. This was in the last

3384
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
main feed episode which was the finale with

3385
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
Weiger. There was a point. I don't know

3386
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
maybe I was just like preparing for the next thing. Maybe

3387
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
I wasn't listening to you carefully enough Mike.

3388
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
But what the thing was

3389
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
when I was editing I found it.

3390
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
And you said well I have the strongest stomach

3391
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
of all of us. You talking about yourself.

3392
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
Because Jason gets tummy aches.

3393
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
And Scott you know he gets sick.

3394
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
And he throws up.

3395
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
When I was watching it back in editing I was like

3396
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
why didn't I say something. I don't.

3397
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
I do not.

3398
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
This only happens at two places.

3399
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
City Walk Hollywood.

3400
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
And City Walk Orlando. I do not

3401
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
regularly have stomach

3402
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
problems. And I let it happen.

3403
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
I let you toss it all out.

3404
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
Scott and his weak trembly stomach.

3405
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
It's basically made of liquid.

3406
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
It can't even retain anything.

3407
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
Scott basically eats paste.

3408
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
And even that he throws up a little bit.

3409
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
Gosh. Look I wanted to be.

3410
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
I shouldn't have said the fire off subs thing obviously in hindsight.

3411
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
But I mean look.

3412
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
There's no better place to test your metal.

3413
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
As far as eating is concerned.

3414
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
And your stomach is concerned than City Walk.

3415
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
This clearly is the premise.

3416
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
What I am saying. I don't want

3417
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
my metal tested. This is the only

3418
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
place where my metal is in question.

3419
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
These are not regularly

3420
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
problems. Now Jason. I feel like

3421
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
sparkling water makes Jason sick.

3422
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
Jason's all.

3423
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
He's got his banana in the morning.

3424
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
His stomach is an issue. I really

3425
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
don't. It's a weird. So.

3426
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
As you say I have the

3427
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
strongest stomach. You know

3428
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
Scott has. But this is not a problem. I don't want

3429
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
to be cured of this. I don't

3430
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
want it to be loosened up. I feel like

3431
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
I'm Hercules. Hang on. Hang on. I'll let

3432
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
you say that. But you can. I'll only if you call

3433
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
yourself City Walk Hercules. I'm City

3434
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Walk Hercules. All right.

3435
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
I'm City Walk

3436
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
Hercules. I like

3437
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
that. I like the weird dubbed movie

3438
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
version of Hercules that you're doing. I can eat

3439
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
a pound of candy from its sugar

3440
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
and then a shake from

3441
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
Dr. Toothsome and then three

3442
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
pieces of plastic from Firehouse

3443
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
Subs. An entire

3444
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
nub Sunday.

3445
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
I would laugh in its

3446
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
face. I wish Harryhausen was still

3447
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
with us to make City Walk Hercules.

3448
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
One nub baked into each meatball

3449
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
please.

3450
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
Can I have it with nubs?

3451
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
Whatever plastic you put around

3452
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
your food leave it on.

3453
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
Oh, you were already going to?

3454
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
Wonderful. His only

3455
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
weakness is flounder almondine.

3456
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
That's the only weakness he has. And even

3457
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
that didn't make him puke or throw up

3458
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
or anything. It just made him bite his mouth.

3459
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
Just made you bleed.

3460
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Yeah. But it's

3461
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
stomach. No more City Walk for months.

3462
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
We won't even say the word. I swear.

3463
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
I don't swear. You know what?

3464
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
But I swear. I don't swear.

3465
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
All right. Well, with

3466
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
that, tribute to City

3467
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
Walk Hercules. We'll give you a victory

3468
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
parade. As we say, you survived

3469
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
Podcast the Ride.

3470
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
Glad to be back in

3471
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
Theme Park World. Although, you know, we might step

3472
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
back a little nub at a time.

3473
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000

3480
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
I kind of want to

3481
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
end it with Jason saying

3482
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
wait here, I'll whisper it to you.

3483
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
Mickey's last line.

3484
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
Some imagination, huh?

3485
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
Jason saying it as Mickey.

3486
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
Some imagination, huh?

3487
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
Forever

3488
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
