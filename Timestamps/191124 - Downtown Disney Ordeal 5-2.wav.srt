1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
...Dark!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Darkness falls out on the street, Evil rears its head.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Get your crazy shake to go, And your fried donut bread.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The villains threaten this sacred place, This downtown shopping mall.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We must defend the Lego store, And the Splitsville bowling balls.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The Downtown Disney or to you, We must protect our AP discount meals.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The Downtown Disney or to you, With secrets does the Earl of Sandwich conceal.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Boys, boys, my cousin has been taken by evil forces that have inhabited Downtown Disney.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
In order to find them, he will need to thoroughly discuss every aspect of the mall.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Stores, restaurants, both of the Starbucks.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We have 18 daily, very necessary episodes and much to do so.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I will be there to guide you and keep your conversations from getting too off topic or boring.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The Downtown Disney ordeal, Why do we do this to ourselves?

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the Downtown Disney ordeal, level five, stage two.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
My name as always is Mike Carlson.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It is, it's remained consistent.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's consistent the whole time, I'm a little tired.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Except for the podcast then it changes, but besides that...

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yeah, that's true. Same name. Scott Gardner is mine.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
That's Scott Gardner talking, that's Jason Sheridan.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
His name as always. Jason Skeleton.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Jason, oh, you're back to the... You kept on case.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It comes in and out. Yeah.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You pulled like what I pull where I'm like, all right, I got this intro down and then...

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Oh, I... Did you see confidence?

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I immediately trip off the diving board.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Did you see confidence when I said I would do it?

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Because I wasn't like, watch me smoke these guys with this introduction.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
We're all broken men.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yes, that is what's happening.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We're amblin to the end.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We have... The boss has not appeared yet.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
No. Still, there hasn't been some early exit.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We're still trying to find him.

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
In fact, of course, we had more episodes than planned.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yeah. But one less than City Walk Saga.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Still, but if you think about it...

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So far, but also remember, yeah, we have no idea if bonuses will get added,

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
but also we sort of didn't really do the food court.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So that is the same amount if you think about it.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That's true.

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But I think that the distinction of having the episodes with a start and finish still,

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
there'll be people that will argue that with us.

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Have you heard how I think our Facebook group, somebody pointed out how the four-minute episode

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
about the food court where we don't talk about it is just ravaged by ads

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
because they still plug all the ads in.

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Because the algorithm is still putting stuff on top of it.

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yeah. So I think you listen to it and it's like three minutes of ad content

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
and then two and a half minutes of us not doing what we...

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
But which of course was that we had...

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Remember how all the research we had for the City Walk food court?

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
We had so much we wanted to say.

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But honestly, the Sector Keeper wouldn't let us.

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So I hope to God he allows us to talk about this stuff today because this is a good...

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
If I remember correctly what's in this sector...

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
No, stage, stage!

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Stage is not a sector.

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's a pretty strong one.

60
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So let's bring him in and get his official permission.

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Oh, great one, the Sector Keeper.

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Boys, boys, you give me strength and I hope this ordeal gives you strength.

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You said that in a way that I feel like you know it's not giving us strength.

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I feel like you were f-ing with us.

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Looking at you, I see three buoyant boys.

66
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You seem up.

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Like you see, did you find some of those like the higher nicotine jewel pods

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
that like are harder to get now?

69
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yeah, there it is.

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Higher nicotine content?

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
There's like double nicotine pods?

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
There are different levels of nicotine content in them.

73
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Is that Rolo?

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It smells like Rolo.

75
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
That's cigarette flavor.

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It just is cigarette?

77
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Okay.

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Oh, God.

79
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
That seems unpleasant, honestly.

80
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm eating Rolos, you want one?

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I do. You know I do.

82
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Popping Rolos and oh my gosh, you're like, you're amped.

83
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
This is a high level Sector Keeper we're getting.

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
This is an exciting level.

85
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
An exciting stage, I should say.

86
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yeah.

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Whatever the f-ck this is.

88
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

89
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Hey.

90
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Hey, don't take your agitation out on us.

91
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
We're already, we've been losing it, okay?

92
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And who God knows where you've been, we've been like,

93
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
we've been facing bosses and dealing with shit and you know,

94
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
what did we do yesterday?

95
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I don't remember.

96
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I don't even know.

97
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
We talked about the Cosmete goes tequila for an hour.

98
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Oh, God damn it.

99
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yeah, we had to loop back around the Cindy Crawford guy.

100
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yeah, now that you've reminded me.

101
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Randy Gerber will have to be coming up on this episode in some capacity.

102
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Sure.

103
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
All right, we'll see.

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I won't force it.

105
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Gerber's an old friend.

106
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What?

107
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Oh, really?

108
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yes.

109
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
No.

110
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Did you ride, have you ever ridden on the back of his motorcycle with him?

111
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yes.

112
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Wow, really?

113
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Or does he have a sidecar?

114
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
He has a sidecar, but I ride on the back and Clooney rides in the sidecar.

115
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Oh, wow.

116
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And you like just like grip him, like just rub, put your arms around him and go for a

117
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
for a joyride.

118
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Just go for a ride.

119
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Boys, boys, focus though, because we must get you moving.

120
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Today's level five stage two, the downtown Disney stage, food trucks, the unbuilt luxury

121
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:59,000
hotel, security checkpoints and as always, rinse bath and body company.

122
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
As always.

123
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
As always.

124
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Something going around today.

125
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Has it like been there since the beginning?

126
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Maybe it predated downtown Disney or something?

127
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It predates downtown Disney.

128
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
That's not like physically correct.

129
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
But maybe like under the ground as minerals and there were like bath bombs like found.

130
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
If you dug under it, like under the surface, you'd find just like big deposits of glittery

131
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
bath bombs.

132
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yeah, that you could clean yourself with.

133
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So and pucker sticks, ancient pucker sticks.

134
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So, I feel like it's all coming apart here.

135
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Well, this is the area that's just left.

136
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
We got nothing happening now because the hotel didn't get built.

137
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Sure.

138
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
To to recap, we can do that real quick.

139
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
We have a whole episode about this unbuilt luxury hotel.

140
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
There was originally supposed to be a hotel on the downtown Disney surface parking lot.

141
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Just a bragging about a four diamond hotel, Disney's first four diamond hotel.

142
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And you could see fireworks from a rooftop bar.

143
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Right. So the hotel, the hotels they already have that you pay nine hundred dollars a night

144
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
for are not four diamonds.

145
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Those aren't considered nice enough.

146
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Right. So what because what it is, is that if you're a business and you want to send

147
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
your businessmen to have a conference in Anaheim, they need the hotel to be a certain level.

148
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Like they only like to send those important businessmen and women to a very high end hotel.

149
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
To a very high end hotel.

150
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
They don't want to slum it at the Grand Californian.

151
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
No.

152
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
A bunch of garbage.

153
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Those expense accounts aren't going to get stretched enough at the Grand Californian.

154
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So that first hotel eventually morphed into a second hotel that was going to have seven

155
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
hundred rooms and be built on this part of downtown Disney and incorporate the monorail

156
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
station for perspective.

157
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Seven hundred rooms in this unbuilt hotel.

158
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The Disneyland Hotel is nine hundred ninety rooms.

159
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
The Grand California is one thousand nineteen rooms and Paradise Pier has four hundred and

160
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
eighty one rooms.

161
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And this whole thing was very seemingly rushed.

162
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Very rushed.

163
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Sector keepers just started laughing for some reason at the all you remember.

164
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Please don't forget the device of the coughing.

165
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
If you're ever feeling bored, just if you need to cough to keep us moving, feel free to cough.

166
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
People love our infrastructure.

167
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Sorry, I just zoomed.

168
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So now the problem that happened with this is that Disney got a two hundred and sixty

169
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
seven million dollar tax subsidy to build that.

170
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yes.

171
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Original hotel.

172
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:53,000
When they shifted it a block away, it caused multiple businesses to close and jobs lost.

173
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Oh, that's right.

174
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
When it was going to be not in this downtown.

175
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
This is a cursed stage.

176
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yeah.

177
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It killed the entire.

178
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It killed the whole problem.

179
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
The whole parking garage.

180
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It all came apart.

181
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And this seemingly was a very this hotel we're going to build over downtown is very fast.

182
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It felt like all of a sudden they were like, oh, yeah, well, we're not going to do it here.

183
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
We're new here and we're going to just design something quick and like just throw it out

184
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
and cramped like the concept art is very cramped.

185
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
The other thing is if they had taken all those tax subsidy dollars, they would have been on

186
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
the hook to raise the minimum wage to eighteen dollars an hour by 2022.

187
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yes.

188
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So that was another factor in play.

189
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
That one wasn't happening.

190
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
They don't know.

191
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Yeah.

192
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So thus we're left with this weird graveyard of like they don't know what to do because

193
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
they had gotten so far as to gut the rainforest cafe.

194
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Sure.

195
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yeah.

196
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Got ESPN zone.

197
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
They obviously theaters, movie theaters gutted like they were moving so quick with this whole

198
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
thing.

199
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Yeah.

200
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
There was not even time to go back once.

201
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It did.

202
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It cursed other stages.

203
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Yes.

204
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yeah.

205
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
We could be talking about we could be doing an hour and a half on just the AMC theater

206
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
alone in the Disney ordeal.

207
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But of course, this for a hotel construction site.

208
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
What a mess.

209
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Could you imagine though?

210
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Could you imagine?

211
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
That would be a killer app.

212
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
If we yeah, if we just like kind of we're like peering over the construction wall for

213
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
30 minutes to an hour.

214
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I saw some lunch boxes.

215
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Construction worker lunchbox.

216
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Jason could do an hour on lunchboxes.

217
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I could do an hour on lunchboxes.

218
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
What did you have as a child lunchbox wise?

219
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Oh, great question.

220
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
How to Ghostbusters for sure.

221
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
How to plastic Ghostbusters and then a Ninja Turtle, I think.

222
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And then my mom got real into.

223
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Yeah.

224
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Good stuff.

225
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Then my mom got real into like the freezer bag, like the kind of fabric bags that were

226
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
insulated.

227
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I had mostly unfortunately.

228
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I wanted always wanted the fun plastic, but I usually had just like an insulated bag with

229
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
a turkey sandwich that was so wet because there was an ice pack in the thing to keep

230
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
it like crushing it.

231
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Yeah, to get cold.

232
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
But like my mom was so worried the food would spoil within three hours.

233
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Well, but then by the time I got to high school, it was just a brown paper bag.

234
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Like I because I was like, I don't want to carry around the freezer bag all day.

235
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Right.

236
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I do cafeteria.

237
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Yeah.

238
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
In high school.

239
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I eventually.

240
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So anybody else want to chime in on this conversation?

241
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I don't remember.

242
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I don't remember what lunchboxes I had.

243
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And well, it's just like it will keep us moving.

244
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Luckily, if you're looking for some eats in this stage, there's a bunch of fucking food

245
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
trucks parked here sometimes.

246
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
They are trying to just dress it up and make people not notice that they destroyed three

247
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
of their businesses.

248
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
That a giant temple ruin is legitimately a ruin now.

249
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Yes, that is true.

250
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You could like.

251
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Yeah.

252
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
So they're trying to.

253
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
They put banners up and some lights to dress up.

254
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
The area party.

255
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Yeah, it's fun.

256
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Early sandwich in Starbucks were able to reopen, which good.

257
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I like them.

258
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
They're convenient.

259
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Yeah, sure.

260
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I mean, that's yeah, they didn't go in there and bomb those places.

261
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
No.

262
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
So there was a big ones because how do you fill those like the like everything ending

263
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
up being a Halloween superstore, these big spaces, there's nothing to do.

264
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And they already have that's the giant retail spaces.

265
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
All you can do is Halloween superstore or avoid and they already have a void.

266
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So there's nothing they can do with this.

267
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
These giant boxes just left to rot.

268
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Yes.

269
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Yeah.

270
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Could they if it's truly like empty, I wonder what it looks like in there.

271
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Is it truly empty in there or is it just like rubble?

272
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Like, is it?

273
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I wonder.

274
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
There's no no leaked photos.

275
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I feel like there's more leaked photos from Disney World of stuff like that.

276
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And did they leave all the rainforest props or did they did they take it to put in other

277
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
rainforest cafes?

278
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
But there's not that many of those.

279
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Right.

280
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
But still, I mean, they need parts.

281
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm sure they need parts.

282
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So I'm yeah.

283
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Oh, yeah.

284
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Are any robots left?

285
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You could maybe they like yanked out a gorilla jaw to use in case like Niagara Falls gorilla

286
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
jaw drops out.

287
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Or Schomburg.

288
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Schomburg gorilla.

289
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Yeah.

290
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Sure.

291
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
God.

292
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Well, if the car zoom around that mall, the car that busted in had been successful and

293
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
driven into the gorilla for straight into the gorilla and decapitated it, then it would

294
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
be a but thank God nothing happened.

295
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
But they need one.

296
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:30,000
If he had hit any themed characters, we would be we talk about him every single episode.

297
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
We would be raising money for the rainforest cafe if that had happened.

298
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Yes.

299
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Our favorite charity.

300
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Go fund me.

301
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Not for us, but for.

302
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And not for the conservation groups that rainforest cafe donates money to.

303
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Oh, yeah.

304
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Like real animals and plants.

305
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
No, no.

306
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
No.

307
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
The restaurant group.

308
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Get out of here.

309
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Save the robots.

310
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
They should reopen it for a special event.

311
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Or my favorite movie coming out soon.

312
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Oh, yeah, we heard your about Robert Downey Jr.'s do little.

313
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Take me to do little.

314
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
If we get out of this whole thing unscathed, yeah, we should all go to do little.

315
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Now, does that supplant taking you to good boys or do we now owe you two movies to please

316
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
double feature?

317
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
What a fun double feature.

318
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Good boys and do little 2020.

319
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And wait.

320
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And by that point, it's November now.

321
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Good boys hasn't been we're going to have to go find a discount theater and then and

322
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
regroup in what January, February when do little comes out.

323
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I'm saying I shouldn't be saying this like it's a problem.

324
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I would love to hang out with you.

325
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm excited to hang out with you.

326
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Also, Scott, I think you're overthinking it.

327
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
We can rent a theater and host a screening of good boys.

328
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Rent the vacant.

329
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Maybe and then fill the and then walk over to do an after party at the empty rainforest

330
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
cafe.

331
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Yeah.

332
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Yeah, using whatever robot remnants are there.

333
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Oh, boys, boys, you give me strength and parental guidance.

334
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Wow.

335
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I wasn't even thinking that far.

336
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
That's a great idea.

337
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
We can rent the abandoned AMC to do a double feature of good boys.

338
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
We have to bring our own screen, though.

339
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I bring a projector.

340
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
That's fine.

341
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
We did that for our Anaheim show.

342
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
So all right.

343
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
So I'll get on the ground and plug in my my home projector to fill an empty movie theater

344
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
that has no seats.

345
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
We have to bring our own seats to bring lawn chairs.

346
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Well, we got you covered.

347
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Sector.

348
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
This is going to be great.

349
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
We now have to host.

350
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
We're also going to have to sneak in and do all of this.

351
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Yeah.

352
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Disney is not going to let us know.

353
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I have to find a bootleg DCP of do little like a bootleg copy with Chinese subtitles.

354
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Little.

355
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
That's fine, though.

356
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
So all right.

357
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So opening day of do little.

358
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Yeah, we will.

359
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
All right.

360
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
So assuming that we have a hookup in China to film it off of a screen.

361
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Yeah.

362
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And send it to us and adjust the subtitles, then join us.

363
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
We'll just say the day of do.

364
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
The day after let's go buy ourselves a day.

365
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Go just walk into the AMC theater, break it open if you have to.

366
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
And you'll find us in the sector keeper hosting a screening.

367
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And yeah, you'll be filled with wonder seeing downy as do little.

368
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Yeah.

369
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Bring one of your podcasts, the right T-shirts, wrap it around your wrist.

370
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Punch the glass, glass and then Jimmy the door.

371
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And if any if you get any shards stuck to your hand, we'll remove the shard and autograph

372
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
it.

373
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Yeah.

374
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
That's also just a good thing.

375
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
If you're on the fence about getting one of our shirts from T-Public, that's just a great

376
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
use for it.

377
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
If you need to punch some glass to bandage your hand.

378
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
If you don't want to wear it, I have to answer questions about what is your shirt about.

379
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
You can use it to break into spaces you shouldn't be into.

380
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Yep.

381
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
At Disneyland.

382
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Yeah, sure.

383
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Oh boy.

384
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
All right.

385
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,000
So we have we got a good plan now, but until then, this area is just in decay.

386
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
And you know, this might be a good opportunity to talk about, you know, we're talking about

387
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
the never built luxury hotel.

388
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Something we haven't talked about in this ordeal that we've talked we in both the saga

389
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
and the ordeal, we've talked about Fallen Brothers.

390
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
What we haven't talked about is Neverborn Brothers.

391
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Yes.

392
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You'll probably feel a little twinge of their spirit every time I bring them up, though

393
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
the ones who weren't lucky enough to live and walk and talk with us.

394
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Yes.

395
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Like two little animals.

396
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I was wondering about this because, you know, like plans that never came into fruition

397
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,000
and there was no real source of it until that weird Al Lutz controversy that happened a

398
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
little while ago.

399
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
That's the highlight of my fucking year.

400
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,680
For anyone who doesn't know, there was a longtime Disney blogger in the 90s who apparently has

401
00:17:54,680 --> 00:18:01,680
been usurped by an interloper within the Disney company who is using a fake using this real

402
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:06,420
bloggers name in a fake way to try to get Bob Chapek fired.

403
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,440
That's the long head of the park.

404
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,920
That's the most confusing way to put it.

405
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:16,000
Sort of like how dear Abby died years ago and they kept the column going.

406
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Right.

407
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Yeah.

408
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Or the Boxcar Children.

409
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,920
The author of the Boxcar Children died years ago and they kept writing Boxcar Children

410
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,920
with their name on it.

411
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,920
Oh really?

412
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,920
Yeah.

413
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,920
Oh wow.

414
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,920
You've read every page.

415
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,920
Well yeah, that's his favorite book series.

416
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,920
Reminds him of his childhood.

417
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,920
Reminds him of his childhood.

418
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,920
I knew the Boxcar Children.

419
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,920
Whoa, really?

420
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,920
The originals.

421
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,920
You're like Benny.

422
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,920
What was Benny like?

423
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,920
I don't remember.

424
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,920
I read the first one.

425
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,920
Benny slept a lot.

426
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:49,920
I remember the Boxcar Children.

427
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,520
The thing I liked about them is that they had a boxcar they lived in, but they would

428
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,160
keep their food cool by putting it next to like a waterfall that was by the boxcar.

429
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,160
Yeah, you pack it up.

430
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,520
You like, this dream is colder.

431
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,520
Lunch cooling situations.

432
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,520
Yeah.

433
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,520
And I thought that was awesome.

434
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,520
Yeah.

435
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,960
I'd like to live in that boxcar and keep my food cool by a nearby waterfall.

436
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,960
As opposed to a refrigerator.

437
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,960
Yeah, no.

438
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,640
Jason, do you use a refrigerator or a waterfall?

439
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,200
A refrigerator, but I have an overflow waterfall.

440
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,520
Like your uncle who's got like a meat fridge in the garage.

441
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,800
If the fridge is full.

442
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,800
If the fridge is full.

443
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,800
Move it over to the waterfall.

444
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,360
And I hate to keep sidetracking this, but the Boxcar Children at the end of the first

445
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:39,360
book got adopted by a very rich man, and he brought the boxcar into their backyard.

446
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,360
Into the backyard.

447
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,280
It sort of became their clubhouse.

448
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,920
And then they just didn't live, but the fun of it to me was that they lived out on their

449
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,920
own in the middle of the woods in a boxcar.

450
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,720
Now they were just adopted by a rich guy and they solved mysteries.

451
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,720
Was that the idea?

452
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,720
Yes.

453
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,720
100% right.

454
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,720
That's a bummer though, isn't it?

455
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,320
They should have been in the boxcar in the middle of the woods forever.

456
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:02,040
You, their suffering was your enjoyment.

457
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,960
I guess, yeah, I guess if I think about it, that is true.

458
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,640
That is the tagline for this series.

459
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,640
Our suffering is your enjoyment.

460
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,640
All right.

461
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,600
Scott, anyway, back to the Lutziverse.

462
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:21,640
All that was just to say in the middle of all that, somebody, we texted about this,

463
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:26,120
somebody tweeted out, here is the entirety of the Al Lutz archives.

464
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:31,120
All this like, this like website that would like detailed all of the rumors and everything

465
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,680
that like from 1997 to 2004 or something.

466
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:42,200
And I went into the Al Lutz archives, searched for downtown Disney to get material for this

467
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,200
series.

468
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,200
And there still wasn't that much.

469
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,200
It was just a lot of finance.

470
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,200
The sacred text.

471
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,200
The sacred text.

472
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:53,680
It was really, this was the Al Lutz archives were the Pentagon papers of the downtown Disney

473
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,680
or deal.

474
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,680
They cracked the whole thing open.

475
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,680
Page turners, they were not.

476
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:10,040
So just to name check, that was the explanation was longer than what I have to say.

477
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:15,920
His things that were not built, the Neverborn Brothers of downtown Disney, the Virgin Megastore

478
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,320
was not built.

479
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,280
Planet Hollywood was never built.

480
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,600
Oh God.

481
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,240
There was apparently supposed to somewhere be a gigantic Barbie collection.

482
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,320
I think Disney did own for a while a big Barbie collection and was trying to figure out is

483
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:38,040
there a way we can shoehorn it into California Adventure or put it in here somewhere.

484
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,320
There was a whole thing and I don't know if this is tied into it, but there was a whole

485
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,840
thing with trying to get Barbie in the original Toy Story.

486
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,360
And that was Bo Peep, I believe.

487
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,800
I could be totally wrong about this, but there was some version of this.

488
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,960
I know this for sure, but I don't know if I think it was Bo Peep.

489
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,160
And then they eventually did get Barbie because I think that Mattel owns Barbie at this point.

490
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,160
I believe so.

491
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,520
They finally were like, well, obviously Toy Story is a giant hit and it would be good

492
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,920
for us to have Barbie involved.

493
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,360
So then that finally happened.

494
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,360
So I wonder if that's all.

495
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,960
Well, this is in the same era.

496
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,280
So maybe Disney formed this Barbie partnership and also around the same time, one of our

497
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,560
most overdue episodes, Barbie at Epcot.

498
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,560
Right, yes.

499
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,560
Yeah, we got to do that.

500
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:21,160
There was this live show and a video that came with it.

501
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,520
Yeah, we really owe that one.

502
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:31,960
Right, also, but I think a lot of these, like these bigger retailers stopped, like didn't

503
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:37,040
want to end up in there because they were cutting costs everywhere and California Adventure

504
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,560
was going badly.

505
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,360
And in fact, like Wolfgang Puck.

506
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,520
Oh, wait a minute.

507
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,680
No, I had it wrong.

508
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:47,360
Wolfgang Puck was offered a spot in downtown Disney, but he didn't want to be in downtown

509
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,360
Disney because he missed the lunch crowd.

510
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,040
He was like, people aren't going to leave the parks, go have lunch and then go out.

511
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,240
So he wanted to be in California Adventure instead.

512
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,840
So thus he was in Avalon Cove, which is now, what's it called?

513
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,840
Lamplighter?

514
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,840
Yeah.

515
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,840
Yeah.

516
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,880
But then that was very bad for him and he pulled out of that as fast as possible.

517
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,560
And he was, this is in the outlets, he was apparently so disappointed that Disney may

518
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:16,880
give him another location in downtown Disney, either at a discount or free as a make good,

519
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,160
possibly due to the terrible attendance they're getting at California Adventure.

520
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,160
Wow.

521
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,480
Wolfgang Puck is calling him throwing a fit.

522
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,040
I want a free restaurant given to me.

523
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:30,400
But yet that is a never built Wolfgang Puck did not get his free downtown Disney restaurant.

524
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,960
He was probably in the right.

525
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,320
Like he, I feel like he has goodwill.

526
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,480
I feel like it's a trustworthy brand and they fucked him around.

527
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,480
Classy name.

528
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,480
Absolutely.

529
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,480
Same with Robert Mondavi.

530
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,200
He pulled out of there.

531
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,300
He took his shitty wine out of California Adventure as fast as he could.

532
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,440
And also Disney Quest, Disney Quest.

533
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,440
Disney Quest.

534
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,440
Yeah.

535
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,160
Intended to be here at some point and maybe that Copperfield Magic Underground restaurant.

536
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,000
I would imagine if it had gotten off the ground.

537
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
These were all.

538
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
That would have been a big plan.

539
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Potentially.

540
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,700
If now imagine downtown Disney where all of that was built.

541
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:10,200
There was one spot I read that they had talked about a West Coast Adventurers Club too.

542
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,520
And I never was able to confirm.

543
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,960
I think Tony Baxter did not.

544
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,280
I think I asked him about it.

545
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,280
You did and he did not know.

546
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,800
And he did not remember.

547
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,200
And I have not found like three sources.

548
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,200
I think I found like once.

549
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,200
I mean it makes sense.

550
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,920
You should tweet it, Rhodey.

551
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,920
Yeah.

552
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,920
I could try that.

553
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,920
I mean it would be expensive to build the building, the themed environment and then

554
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,960
all those equity actors and puppets and stuff.

555
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,960
And it doesn't.

556
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,960
It adds up.

557
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,960
Would it make sense?

558
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,760
You'd have to put plaques all over downtown Disney to make it fit into a narrative like

559
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,600
it did in Pleasure Island.

560
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,360
So you mean they didn't want to have a bunch of puppets and robots and equity actors and

561
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:50,960
instead they built a store where you got three socks instead of two.

562
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,880
That was somehow more cost effective.

563
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,480
You do not bring up the three sock pair.

564
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:02,280
If you didn't hear about the three socks, go back into the underworld at patreon.com

565
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,280
slash podcast.

566
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:06,360
If that doesn't entice you, I don't know.

567
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,360
Well, it will.

568
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,360
So there you have it.

569
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,360
The Never Builds.

570
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,960
Truly with all of those things, this would have been the greatest place.

571
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,960
It really does.

572
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,880
It's so tragic, honestly.

573
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:20,200
Like having, especially if they were all like, they'd probably be replaced maybe by today,

574
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,200
but like three years ago.

575
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,880
They all would have failed in three years.

576
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:28,480
But well, I think that a couple of them would have hung on up until like 2016 and been decaying

577
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:34,440
so badly that we would still have gotten to enjoy like a rotting Disney quest.

578
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,440
Yeah.

579
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,440
A Copperfield restaurant that has like nine rooms and only one is open.

580
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,440
Right.

581
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,440
Yes.

582
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,160
There's three people working at the.

583
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,760
They do lay, they taught them how to, you know, like put the, put a handkerchief for

584
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,160
like fake, pull a handkerchief out of your ear real fast.

585
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,560
And that's all the magic that happens.

586
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,560
Otherwise.

587
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,560
Okay.

588
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,560
So specials are we got a cod.

589
00:25:54,560 --> 00:26:01,400
It's like shares a kitchen with the rainforest cut down on costs.

590
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,960
Somebody has to walk a hamburger across the.

591
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:10,560
So if you order a monkey burger from the rainforest cafe, that's also the magic burger.

592
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,640
It's a magic burger.

593
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,640
Yeah.

594
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,880
Five things on the menu.

595
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,360
So yeah, it's a weird one.

596
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,640
It's a weird sector that you've got.

597
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,680
Now the stage has been there for a long time.

598
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,080
I don't know much about the stage.

599
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,000
I've got a little about this stage because the stage kind of plays in into a classic

600
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,600
Disneyland event.

601
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:37,920
So the stage is where the Saturday night swing dancing moved when they closed Carnation Gardens.

602
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,720
Do you remember, do you know about this?

603
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,720
No.

604
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,280
For years and years and years, decades.

605
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:50,800
Carnation Gardens, right by the castle, hosted Saturday night swing dancing.

606
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:55,160
And eventually that was closed for the fantasy fair.

607
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,900
And people were very upset because there is a contingent of people that would go and do

608
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,040
swing dancing every Saturday.

609
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:06,280
So while they were rebuilt at like doing all this construction, they moved the swing dancing

610
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:11,120
and the big band to the downtown Disney stage.

611
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:16,760
Eventually fantasy fair, they put the swing dancing back in there on Saturday.

612
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:21,200
So you can still go Saturday nights to go to swing dancing some Saturdays.

613
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,600
But then also there are swing dancing other nights at the downtown Disney stage and swing

614
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,220
dancing at the Splitsville stage.

615
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,600
So there's more swing dancing than ever.

616
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:39,420
And there is a Facebook group that uses very confusing abbreviations to say like Saturday

617
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,800
10 17.

618
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:48,800
Dan, Dan Whoopi, like it says like DW at DTDS.

619
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,680
So like Dan Whoopi at the downtown Disney stage.

620
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,680
It's like all the abbreviations.

621
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,680
Is that a real name?

622
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,680
No, I just made that up.

623
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:59,280
I couldn't believe though that Dan Whoopi was a real swing dancer that loves downtown

624
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,280
Disney.

625
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,280
Dan Whoopi.

626
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,280
So you can still see.

627
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,680
The alter ego of yours.

628
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,680
Go see Jason do swing music.

629
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,840
I call when I play my tunes, I call it making whoopee.

630
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,840
Oh my God.

631
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,480
Disneyland has asked me to not do that anymore.

632
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,480
To body for it is your body.

633
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,880
So you've had to learn the code of the Disneyland swing.

634
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,920
You're now a code talker of Disneyland swingers.

635
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:28,280
I am a kind of swinger swingsters.

636
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:33,080
Swinger is if you're hooking up with the multiple swingsters.

637
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,720
If you're a dancer.

638
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:42,680
I know about Dan Whoopi, the Wop Opaloo Bops, all of the guys.

639
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,080
If there's daddies who are cherry popping.

640
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:53,680
The pencil skirt sisters, all of the local swing dance bands.

641
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,800
When I said on Twitter, is there anything you like from downtown Disney?

642
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,480
Somebody said I should shout out the Suburban Legends, which I did notice, which is a ska

643
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:05,920
band that seems very popular locally and with a giant discography.

644
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:11,320
They seem to have amassed a huge following primarily from their appearances at downtown

645
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,320
Disney.

646
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,320
So there are legitimate bands around there.

647
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:24,760
As we learned with the House of Blues, downtown Disney is a legitimate part of the OC, ska,

648
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:28,000
and punk, and now we know swing scene.

649
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,640
I like the stage.

650
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,280
The only thing I don't like about when I go up, because I like watching a little bit of

651
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,280
every performance.

652
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,920
There was an Elvis guy, Elvis-y guy, I forget his name.

653
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,920
I like that.

654
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:41,840
I just don't like it when there's only like 10 people because I don't want too much eye

655
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,480
contact from the performer.

656
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,080
Because if I want to leave, I want to leave.

657
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:49,280
So I like try to hang back and enjoy because I just don't want to.

658
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,280
I feel pressure to stay.

659
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:56,120
Yes, because I feel like if there's 10 people and you're playing and one of them leaves,

660
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,120
that is devastating.

661
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,360
Like as a performer.

662
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:04,040
You act as if you know that from your years of improv performances.

663
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:09,120
10 audience members is a blessing.

664
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,880
10 is generous.

665
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:18,360
And especially if there are not people performing in 10 minutes, that's even better.

666
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,360
Yes, that's true.

667
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,680
That's very common as well.

668
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:24,960
The audience of the downtown Disney stage probably aren't taking classes from the downtown

669
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,760
Disney stage and have to go.

670
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,760
Yes, that's a good point.

671
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,920
They're not taking classes to be the next Elvis impersonator.

672
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:38,280
Although an Elvis, a UCB style Elvis training academy.

673
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,320
Or just UCB teaching an Elvis class in general.

674
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:47,000
Well, if you want to be performing in a paid manner, Elvis is one of your best bets.

675
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
It's true.

676
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,060
You go to Vegas, like almost like every hotel has like four Elvis's at any given time.

677
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,880
And you would think that that wouldn't regenerate at this point.

678
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,400
He's been dead for an awfully long time.

679
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,400
Sure.

680
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,400
But I guess.

681
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:06,120
But Elvis maintains and we need new young Elvis's to replace the Elvis's who are dying

682
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,120
off.

683
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,120
Or is he?

684
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,120
Oh, interesting.

685
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,120
I don't know.

686
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,120
You know something from the after world.

687
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,120
We don't.

688
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,400
Let's just say we never crossed paths.

689
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,400
Okay.

690
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:23,320
So, oh, and you've met a lot of other dead people.

691
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,560
Pat, let me ask you this.

692
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,160
Have you crossed paths with Jimi Hendrix?

693
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,160
Yes.

694
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,160
Okay.

695
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:32,160
How about DB Cooper?

696
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,160
Yes.

697
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,160
Uh, uh.

698
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,160
A chance to confirm once and for all.

699
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,160
Beethoven?

700
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,120
The dog, not the dog, the composer.

701
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,120
The composer.

702
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,120
Yes, the dog.

703
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,120
No.

704
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,480
Oh, wait a minute.

705
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,280
The original Beethoven, the dog is still alive.

706
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:51,760
That's a conspiracy theory that he's passed away.

707
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,680
I'll send you a link.

708
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,680
Oh, boy.

709
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,960
YouTube video explaining all this.

710
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,240
Some very interesting thoughts out there.

711
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:05,120
So we even like the conspiracy theory that the original Beethoven is still alive.

712
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,040
The original dog who played Beethoven is still alive.

713
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,040
It's very impressive.

714
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,960
But his big dogs die more easily.

715
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:16,480
I read that he's making a cameo in Do Little.

716
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,600
That would put him at least at, what did Beethoven come out, 92?

717
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,200
Dogs 27 years old?

718
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,200
At least?

719
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,200
28, 29?

720
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,640
He's old enough to have gone way past Beethoven's second.

721
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,920
We're talking Beethoven's 29th.

722
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,920
Yeah.

723
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,920
Whoa.

724
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,920
This is big, honestly.

725
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,920
This is a big revelation.

726
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,920
It's this late in the ordeal.

727
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,920
Yeah, holy shit.

728
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,920
Yeah.

729
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:39,120
Who cares about like his Tupac still out there?

730
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,120
His original Beethoven.

731
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,600
His original Beethoven still alive.

732
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,400
Any St. Bernard you see, or any other big dog, maybe he's in disguise.

733
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,960
He painted his fur a different color.

734
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,960
I don't know.

735
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,120
If anyone has any more information about this, tweet at us.

736
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,120
Yeah.

737
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:55,760
He has blood transfusions of younger dogs.

738
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,760
Oh no.

739
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,760
What?

740
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,760
Oh my God.

741
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,480
He gets like stem cell treatments?

742
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,480
Yes.

743
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,480
Wow.

744
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,480
That's crazy.

745
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,920
It's transplants.

746
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:09,000
What's that thing the celebrities get, the hormone in the face?

747
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
HGH?

748
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
What are you talking about?

749
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Botox?

750
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Yeah, or the, I don't know, the thing you talked about.

751
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,600
HGH is human growth hormone.

752
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,880
You don't necessarily get it in your face.

753
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,960
I think I've talked about what I believe is HGH head, which is what makes your head big

754
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,960
and puffy.

755
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,960
Sure.

756
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,800
He would be, if Beethoven got it.

757
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,800
Right.

758
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,800
DGH.

759
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,160
Nobody would be the wiser.

760
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:33,200
I think Edwin just walked down here and I think maybe it's time for him to get a little

761
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,200
DGH.

762
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:39,080
If you want Edwin to stay around forever, make his face huge.

763
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,080
I just want him to be more strong.

764
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,080
I want him to be more powerful.

765
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,080
Just jacked.

766
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,520
Which you'll need if you ever run into original Beethoven.

767
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,520
He'll knock you through the hall when he humps.

768
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,520
Yeah, original.

769
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:54,440
He's a stress humps, simply knocking you, giving you a concussion.

770
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:59,480
Original Beethoven looks a lot like Sylvester Stallone looks now.

771
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,760
Where like he looks pretty good for in his seventies, but something's weird.

772
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,760
Get up close.

773
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,760
It's a little strange.

774
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,760
Okay.

775
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,920
So we're almost out of here, but are we?

776
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,920
Security checkpoints.

777
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,920
Oh yeah.

778
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,600
Security checkpoints on this side.

779
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,720
We didn't talk about it because they're gone on the other side.

780
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:23,960
Well, this area gets a little weird because you have the security checkpoints and sort

781
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,840
of on a straight line laterally is rinse.

782
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,880
Rinse is technically outside.

783
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,760
We have to talk about the points first.

784
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,760
I know.

785
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,760
I'm just saying it gets weird.

786
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,760
Do we?

787
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,760
Sector keeper, do we?

788
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,760
Yes.

789
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,760
Fuck.

790
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,760
Hey, all right.

791
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,760
Well, there's like a bunch of metals.

792
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,880
They give you those little white jars.

793
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,000
They give you little dog bowls to put your stuff in.

794
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
They give you little dog bowls.

795
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
They'll check your bags.

796
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Boys, boys.

797
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:53,080
I just received a text message from my cousin, the level key level keeper.

798
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,160
Oh, oh.

799
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,640
He says, make sure you spend ample time on this.

800
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,640
Level keeper.

801
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,800
Thinking about that wherever he's lost.

802
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,800
We can't find him.

803
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,800
He or she.

804
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,800
We don't know.

805
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,800
We don't know.

806
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:14,280
I would text back, but he's texting or she is texting from his, his or her prepaid cricket

807
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,280
wireless phone.

808
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,280
Right.

809
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,280
All right.

810
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,960
What does count as ample?

811
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,960
I don't know.

812
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,640
I got stuck the last time we went and we were there with you, sector keeper.

813
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,160
They got rid of the line.

814
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,880
That's just no bag.

815
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,880
No bags.

816
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,880
Interesting.

817
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,880
Which I think is interesting.

818
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,880
Yeah.

819
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,880
Because like, because you both said interesting.

820
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,320
Well, I find that interesting.

821
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,560
Well, they it's changed.

822
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,880
The security system has changed for many years.

823
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,640
You just had to get your bag checked.

824
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,880
You did not have to go through a metal detector.

825
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,080
And then they had them further down and it was a fucking mess.

826
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,080
Yeah.

827
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,640
And now they have them at the tram.

828
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:56,680
When you get on the tram or here, if you walk over or you're coming from the hotel.

829
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,680
Yes.

830
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,400
Talking about this is as interesting as being stuck in a security line.

831
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,720
People love our infrastructure.

832
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:08,400
I will say sometimes I don't think I like a thorough bag.

833
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,800
I'm a paranoid person.

834
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,800
Sure.

835
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,600
The world we live in is scary sometimes.

836
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:17,760
I don't like it when I see a guy or a girl just put their hand in and like do a little

837
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,520
glance and don't do the thorough check.

838
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,760
They maybe opened my glasses cases before.

839
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,760
Good.

840
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,760
Yeah, sure.

841
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,760
I like that.

842
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,760
That makes me feel good.

843
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,800
Sitting next to Wawa West, you can just walk in and out.

844
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,800
Yeah.

845
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,640
So I appreciate the time they're taking.

846
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:40,120
But if I'm just a single passenger, essentially, I'm just a man in his 30s alone going into

847
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:44,280
downtown Disney as you are once a week, at least once a week this summer.

848
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,720
I just want an express lane or a TSA pre-check for downtown.

849
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,720
We talked about this already.

850
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,360
Yeah, we talked about it already.

851
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,280
But I want that and it would be nice.

852
00:36:54,280 --> 00:37:00,600
I'd also like, I think also with any of these types of lines, generally you try to go to

853
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,920
the farthest one away.

854
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,920
That's the quickest.

855
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,920
Right.

856
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,960
I guess so, yeah.

857
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:09,440
That's usually the case because people generally just psychologically I think go to the first

858
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,440
line.

859
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:14,320
How we do, if you had to guess your cousin's thoughts.

860
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,640
Do you think that we need more here?

861
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,120
Maybe a little more.

862
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,120
Okay, well.

863
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:25,920
I got stuck and I had to, they went down to my belt and they made me turn my belt buckle

864
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,680
around and show that there was nothing hidden on the other side of the belt buckle.

865
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,760
I did find that a little interesting.

866
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,840
I find it interesting that I have a belt that I generally wear and 90% of the time does

867
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,480
not set a metal detector off, but once in a while it does.

868
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,480
Once in a while.

869
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,480
Which is weird.

870
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,040
At airports they're really strict about belts now, I find.

871
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:49,200
It does and at airports it never sets it off, but at downtown Disney once in a while this

872
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,200
belt that I wear sets it off.

873
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:57,600
I don't know if they can, can they turn up the intensity on a metal detector?

874
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,280
Why is this not always working?

875
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,240
Yeah, that's a good question.

876
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,240
Yeah, I thought you knew.

877
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,240
Oh no, I don't.

878
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,320
Well, let's all just wear ropes instead of belts.

879
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,960
So we don't have this problem anymore.

880
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,560
Hang it on your cord, man.

881
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,560
Did that do it?

882
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,560
Did that kick it over the edge?

883
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,560
Wow, boys, boys.

884
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:20,560
You gave the level keeper and I great strength.

885
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,560
Keep moving.

886
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,480
You aren't even looking at your phone.

887
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,480
You're making up these.

888
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,480
I'm not sure he ever texted.

889
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,480
Well, but now.

890
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,480
Or she.

891
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,480
He or she.

892
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,480
Or she.

893
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,480
But now we're at the pièce de resistance.

894
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,480
Rinse.

895
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,480
Rinse.

896
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,480
But now wait a minute.

897
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,480
Yeah, though, Jason, wait.

898
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,480
Why do we have to?

899
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,480
We're at this.

900
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:44,360
You said the security checkpoint was the end, but there's this store.

901
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,840
I didn't know this.

902
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,840
Look at this map.

903
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,840
See?

904
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,120
See this map I'm showing you?

905
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,480
Yes, it's distance wise.

906
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,080
It's technically behind.

907
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:57,440
You have to go outside the security checkpoint, but it's realistically the side of the movie

908
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,440
theater sandwich.

909
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,440
So therefore.

910
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,440
But it's the only store.

911
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:04,080
It's technically downtown Disney that's outside the security checkpoints.

912
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,080
Right.

913
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,080
Yes.

914
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:10,080
And the only store you could bring a weapon in, I guess.

915
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,080
I mean, that's true.

916
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:18,400
I'm not saying use it, but if you felt like you might encounter a problem in the soap

917
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,400
store.

918
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,400
If you had a saber, you could bring it.

919
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:27,400
If you had a nunchuck, a single nunchuck.

920
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:32,680
You could bring it into rinse.

921
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,680
That's true.

922
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,680
Yes.

923
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:39,040
It runs parallel with a security checkpoint and it shares a space with Earl a sandwich.

924
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,760
So boys, you must explore.

925
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,320
Tell us.

926
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,560
I didn't know this existed.

927
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,560
I didn't either.

928
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,560
Before the ordeal started.

929
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,720
I know it's very newish.

930
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:52,320
I thought it was part of the store with all the wooden sides.

931
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,200
I thought that was technically like half rinse.

932
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,200
I knew.

933
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,200
I brought this to the table.

934
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,600
I figured it might be on the table.

935
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,160
So I was like, let me we should be prepped.

936
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,160
Yes.

937
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,640
We don't get stuck and like have to go back down just to do that.

938
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,640
Right.

939
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:14,800
But once you said like once a bad supply was in contention, like I started rubbing my little

940
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,800
hands together.

941
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:29,160
I bought because last time so in the in the city walk saga, we went to nectar bath treats

942
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,800
where everything looks like donuts and cakes.

943
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,800
Yes.

944
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,480
And you guys are did only one of you do a bath.

945
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,480
We both.

946
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,280
Well, we both did different approaches.

947
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,160
Yeah, I did a bath.

948
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,160
Okay.

949
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,160
Bath bomb.

950
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:47,440
I got a bar of soap that smell looked like a donut shaped like a donut.

951
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,520
I just would like to remember, mind everyone and anyone who didn't know for a period of

952
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:57,600
a couple of weeks, a few weeks, I cleaned his body with a donut, coconut, pineapple,

953
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,960
donut soap.

954
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,360
I would just like it to say just you clean yourself with a donut.

955
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,240
That's better than even saying it's a so fair.

956
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,240
Yeah.

957
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:10,800
So Mike and I were bath buddies again for this deal.

958
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,320
We went in and I we were looking around.

959
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,720
And you bought two things or did I?

960
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:21,720
Yes, I bought I bought a bar of oat and honey soap.

961
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,720
Okay.

962
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,720
Yes.

963
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,320
I bought the bamboo loofah soap.

964
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,320
Yes.

965
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:33,000
It was a bar of soap with a with a loofah inside to exfoliate, which is a problem.

966
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,360
I feel like I don't exfoliate enough.

967
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,360
Yeah.

968
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,760
Which is good to scrub those dead skin cells off.

969
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:43,960
It smells like tea tree oil, which really smells like it smells like like the gift shop

970
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:49,560
at Knott's Berry Farm or like like it smells like vacation, which is what I like.

971
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:54,240
And I feel like maybe I will do more tea tree oil based soap in the future.

972
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,240
Yeah.

973
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,920
After using it, you found your flavor profile or whatever.

974
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,040
Yeah, it's a nostalgic smell.

975
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,720
The loofah is a little hardcore.

976
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,360
When it started, it's a little rough.

977
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,360
But you know what?

978
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,360
That's good.

979
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,360
That's good to get that dead skin off.

980
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,360
Okay.

981
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:20,160
Mine, as I've been using it, has revealed to me more and more oats.

982
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,160
It's filled with oats.

983
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,800
It's an oat and honey soap that has oats in it.

984
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,600
That kind of de facto exfoliate.

985
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,600
Be honest.

986
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,840
Did you eat them?

987
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:34,320
I mean, it's real tempting.

988
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:37,320
Did you be honest when you were cleaning yourself with that donut?

989
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,320
Did you take a bite?

990
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:47,320
I had posted wet post-it notes everywhere saying don't eat the soap.

991
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:50,480
In case you wake up at 4 a.m. and forget.

992
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,480
Yeah.

993
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,480
I just have a donut sitting in the tub.

994
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,480
Really?

995
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,480
Which happens to them a lot.

996
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,480
It's a scrubbing donut, not an eating donut.

997
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:03,360
You have different donuts in different corners of the tub.

998
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,920
These are not eating sprinkles.

999
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,400
They're exfoliating sprinkles.

1000
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,040
I was just chanting myself.

1001
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,520
Bazen became rinse.

1002
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,520
Bazen became rinse.

1003
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,640
Okay.

1004
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,440
So did you like your baths?

1005
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,840
Well, so okay.

1006
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,840
Yes.

1007
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,840
That's not the only thing.

1008
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,840
We did.

1009
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:27,360
I saw the name of a certain thing and I said, oh my gosh, Jason and I both have to do this.

1010
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:31,680
They sell something called tub truffles.

1011
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,480
And I was like, oh my God.

1012
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:38,960
And before we get into our tub truffle experiences, I have to give it up for everything all natural

1013
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:39,960
handmade.

1014
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:43,440
I think she said in Georgia and I thought priced very fairly.

1015
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,960
Those soap bars were like seven dollars.

1016
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:46,960
Very fairly.

1017
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:47,960
Tub truffles four bucks.

1018
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,880
Four dollars for a tub truffle.

1019
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:54,120
If this were City Walk, it would be like eight or nine dollars.

1020
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:57,880
If not more for some sort of a bath bomb situation.

1021
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,080
I found also this soap less dry.

1022
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:03,560
Like the nectar stuff kind of dried my skin out.

1023
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,920
This I felt much more moisturizing.

1024
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:05,920
I will be honest with you.

1025
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,820
I also felt very moisturized.

1026
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:12,120
So tub truffle is a little I guess you would call it like a bath bomb.

1027
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,220
It's a little bath bomb.

1028
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:14,720
It's got a different.

1029
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,840
What flavor did you get?

1030
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:19,120
I got not scent flavor.

1031
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,960
Coconut mango.

1032
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:26,480
I got a fun coconut mango one.

1033
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,600
I got lavender tub truffle.

1034
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:35,000
I'll just read for the listeners who might be a little confused what it is.

1035
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,440
This cocoa butter based bath bomb fizzes in your tub as the cocoa butter slowly melts

1036
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,480
away conditioning your bath and skin.

1037
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,120
There is just enough cocoa butter to lightly moisturize the skin.

1038
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:49,560
Scent lavender.

1039
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:55,680
The only problem I have is that the bathtub I have is too small for a man of six three.

1040
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,160
Which came up the last time.

1041
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,160
Yes.

1042
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,320
And still same apartment.

1043
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:03,760
The last time I took a bath was the City Walk saga.

1044
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,280
I don't do that regularly.

1045
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:09,720
But I was like this would be nice to do more often.

1046
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,120
But it's also wasteful too.

1047
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,720
So obviously we're being journalists right now.

1048
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,920
We have to take the bath.

1049
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:16,920
But I don't want to be wasteful.

1050
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:17,920
We're required by work.

1051
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,920
Yeah, this is a work thing.

1052
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:24,360
Honestly to waste all that water on my body.

1053
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,920
I like the fizzing.

1054
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,200
I found it very relaxing and no like dyes and stuff.

1055
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,680
So it didn't like dye the tub or anything.

1056
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:35,440
Like mine was just like clear.

1057
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,680
Did you let me ask you about the experience.

1058
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:43,920
Last year I had I sipped a diet grape soda while I was in the bath.

1059
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,200
This year I drank a white claw.

1060
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,800
Oh that is very funny.

1061
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:48,800
I had a screwdriver.

1062
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:57,800
You both drank while you did the tub truffles.

1063
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:02,880
If I take like two baths a year and I'm having a beer or a glass of wine.

1064
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,640
I'm having some sort of drink and I was just getting over a cold.

1065
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:09,360
So I had orange juice in the house for once and I had some vodka.

1066
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,000
I've been trying to get rid of for ages.

1067
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
So now.

1068
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Bring me over.

1069
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I'll get rid of it for you.

1070
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:24,640
I got to say I got too relaxed because I think I almost drown.

1071
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:25,960
No not that bad.

1072
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:33,400
I was like light headed by because like that water like hot.

1073
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,480
I don't like so on us that much.

1074
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:41,080
I get light headed from them like very so between the screwdriver the very relaxing

1075
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:45,040
tub truffle and he the vapors.

1076
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:50,440
I really had to steal myself getting out of the tub and like I have to go lie down.

1077
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,440
Oh my God.

1078
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,360
You almost had to go to the hospital.

1079
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,860
I know it's great.

1080
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:55,860
It was great.

1081
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:59,120
It was like it was like it sounds like you couldn't walk.

1082
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:02,120
I mean I got out of there.

1083
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:04,960
A wheelchair to will you from the bathroom to your bed.

1084
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,240
Jason didn't make it out of the downtown Disney or deal.

1085
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,240
Oh my God.

1086
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:16,960
You know, I'm so relaxed that they find him and he's just smiling eyes closed in the bath.

1087
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,960
If only we stayed behind the security checkpoints.

1088
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,960
Oh, these rules.

1089
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:22,960
Jason died.

1090
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,880
He's like he died of happiness.

1091
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:34,560
I took a quick 20 minute lie down and then I made the notes required for this episode.

1092
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,560
Wow.

1093
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:39,720
Well, I I had the last year I took a photo.

1094
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:40,720
Yeah.

1095
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,440
With and I was like, well, what do I have in the house to drink?

1096
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,600
And I have a thing of white cloths because I love hard water.

1097
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,680
It's all the rage now.

1098
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:52,800
But I didn't I didn't get hammered in there.

1099
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,280
I was I was not I I have I have I think I've said it on the last episode.

1100
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,840
I can't go right to bed, though.

1101
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:04,680
My body's too hot to go to bed and it's readjusting to the temperature of the apartment.

1102
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:05,680
Hot boy ordeal.

1103
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:06,680
Yeah.

1104
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:11,520
So I take like an hour to get back to my normal body temperature before I can go back to bed.

1105
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,520
Cough please cough.

1106
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:13,520
He loves all this time.

1107
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,520
That's why he isn't coughing.

1108
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:22,760
I got to say hi Marks to rent the worker in there was so she was very funny.

1109
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,520
She kept asking if we were a boy band.

1110
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:25,520
Oh, yeah.

1111
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,520
I'll send the sector.

1112
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:27,520
I'll send the sector keeper.

1113
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,760
We were having a lot of fun.

1114
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,920
She was thrilled to see some customers.

1115
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:33,920
Very nice.

1116
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:34,920
Very nice.

1117
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,720
Annual pass discount works at Rinse.

1118
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,520
Yes, it is alive.

1119
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:39,520
Yeah.

1120
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:43,120
He said her name on her name tag wasn't her real name.

1121
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,920
Oh, yeah, that is right.

1122
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:45,920
Oh, yeah.

1123
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:46,920
Right.

1124
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:47,920
But she was that a lie.

1125
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:52,720
Why did she say I used to work retail and if you forgot your name tag at home, you

1126
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,560
just grabbed an extra from the breaker.

1127
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:55,560
It's just whatever was around.

1128
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:56,560
Oh, yeah.

1129
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:57,560
Right.

1130
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,560
Doesn't have to be your name.

1131
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:02,080
I had my last name on my name tag for the last couple of years of working at Container

1132
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,080
Store.

1133
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,080
Wow.

1134
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,360
I never earned my name tag at Cricket Wireless.

1135
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,360
Oh, no.

1136
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:10,400
Would it just say sector keeper?

1137
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,760
Did you used to have a name?

1138
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,560
Is there any continuity for your name?

1139
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:15,560
I can't remember.

1140
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:18,680
I don't think so.

1141
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:21,840
Maybe we need to do another series looking for my name.

1142
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:25,240
That's the goal of the next one.

1143
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:28,040
Who were you before all this?

1144
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,040
Yeah.

1145
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:35,600
Before you got amnesia from having to listen to all these episodes.

1146
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:38,440
You forgot your own name because now you have to know.

1147
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,440
Nick Valenti.

1148
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:48,120
You have to know who Nick Valenti is and how the Owl Lutz archives told us where Disney

1149
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,800
Quest was going to be.

1150
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,360
Well, it seems like a pretty good experience for everybody.

1151
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,880
Yeah, I liked it.

1152
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:59,440
Again, I don't want to be wasteful, so I shouldn't take a lot of baths.

1153
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,280
But aren't you wasting the rest of the truffle?

1154
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:04,080
No, the truffle all went away.

1155
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,080
Yeah, yeah.

1156
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,080
The truffle is a one shot.

1157
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,840
I mean, I guess you could cut it in half.

1158
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:08,840
Well, that's fair.

1159
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,360
I wanted a full cocoa.

1160
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,360
Let me read it again.

1161
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:16,800
Full cocoa butter based bath bomb that fizzes in your tub and slowly melts away.

1162
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,120
I wanted the full experience of that.

1163
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,480
That's nice.

1164
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:23,760
Yeah, I think this was so it was such a nice.

1165
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:28,160
It seems like this place is so successful that I think in honor of it that Chumbawumba

1166
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:33,040
should return and write a new anthem to this place called Tub Truffling.

1167
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:38,440
You speak my language rather than have lyrics for it.

1168
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:47,640
I splash right down and drop the truffle in and it conditions my skin again.

1169
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:54,280
I prefer coconut and it's in its fizzing in the tub again.

1170
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,120
There you go.

1171
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,120
I love it.

1172
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,120
That's good.

1173
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,120
Thanks.

1174
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,280
But it's up to them to write it.

1175
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:06,800
We need all 17 members of Chumbawumba who were like we like there was something up with

1176
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:07,800
them.

1177
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,280
They were like, yeah, what was the deal with them?

1178
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,280
They were like terrorists.

1179
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,280
I don't forget.

1180
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,920
They would say they said like shoplift or music.

1181
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,480
They were encouraging people to shoplift.

1182
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,840
That's right.

1183
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:23,360
Man, right when the new radicals were encouraging everybody to storm the mall and put the security

1184
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:28,920
guards in cages and get Beck and Marilyn Manson to run back to their mansions.

1185
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:33,120
This is a violent time for dull radio rock.

1186
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:36,360
Yeah, the late mid to late 90s.

1187
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:40,600
We get mad about Limp Bizkit and Korn, but the new radicals in Chumbawumba were the real

1188
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:41,600
threats.

1189
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:42,720
Yeah, they were rebel rousers.

1190
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:43,720
Yeah.

1191
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,720
You missed all those bands.

1192
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:51,240
Yeah, I'm trying to keep up.

1193
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,240
What's up now?

1194
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,240
Billie Eilish, Kamiya.

1195
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,240
Kamiya, yeah.

1196
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,240
Cabello.

1197
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,240
Yeah.

1198
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:01,960
Cabrera, which like Ryan Cabrera.

1199
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:02,960
That's not right.

1200
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,280
No, Ryan Cabrera is from years ago already.

1201
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,280
That's a long time ago.

1202
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,280
That's a long time ago already.

1203
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,280
Extremely irrelevant.

1204
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,280
Yeah, especially then.

1205
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:16,160
Billie Eilish is kind of bad and you're kind of breaking bad as we speak.

1206
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:19,520
Might be a good little role model for you.

1207
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,800
Sometimes it feels good to be mad.

1208
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:27,200
That has become one of your sayings.

1209
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,800
So wait a minute.

1210
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:30,800
This is it.

1211
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,080
So we've got to wait.

1212
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,300
OK, so we like face a boss now, right?

1213
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:39,200
Is the boss like a huge tub truffle or are you going to get inhabited by a big tub truffle?

1214
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,800
Because we're done.

1215
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,800
Well, that's it, guys.

1216
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,080
Well, let's hold on.

1217
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,560
This is a stage two.

1218
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,560
Bosses come at stage.

1219
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:46,560
Something doesn't add up.

1220
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,560
My math is off.

1221
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:50,560
Boys, boys, you did it.

1222
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,560
Almost.

1223
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:52,560
Almost?

1224
00:52:52,560 --> 00:53:00,720
There's still another bit to explore.

1225
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:03,420
But you said the security.

1226
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:09,040
We made the exception for rinse, but the security checkpoint is the that's the final.

1227
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,040
That's the end of it.

1228
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,320
I brackets it.

1229
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:16,840
But think of all the emptiness in this level.

1230
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:20,640
The AMC, you know, all the empty.

1231
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:25,040
You know, I'm getting it right.

1232
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:30,680
So you must fill it with something very ample.

1233
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:36,480
A parking structure.

1234
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,480
That's right.

1235
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:42,480
Well, I guess it does connect to downtown Disney.

1236
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,960
It is the conduit that takes you to downtown Disney.

1237
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:54,200
And in fact, when they recently built this new parking garage and a pedestrian bridge

1238
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:58,080
even more recently, they opened the pedestrian bridge that gets you to downtown Disney.

1239
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,080
Yes, yes.

1240
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:02,040
The pedestrian bridge to pedestrian bridge to.

1241
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,040
Yes.

1242
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,040
In one episode.

1243
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,040
How are we going to manage?

1244
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,200
That's a lot to tackle.

1245
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,200
You can do it, boys.

1246
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,200
You can do it.

1247
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,480
And you have the help of a dear friend.

1248
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:13,480
Oh, really?

1249
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:16,920
Well, I wonder who it'll be.

1250
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:17,920
Yeah.

1251
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,560
Let's let the rumors start flying.

1252
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,040
It's only there only be 24 hours.

1253
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,800
There's 24 hours of exciting rumors.

1254
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:25,800
Yeah.

1255
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:26,800
Yeah.

1256
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,920
So let your imagination come alive.

1257
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:35,920
What friend are we going to meet in the parking garage and what boss and what are and will

1258
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,720
we finally meet the level keeper?

1259
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,720
Yeah.

1260
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:41,360
Will she or he be there?

1261
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:42,360
God willing.

1262
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:43,360
Yes.

1263
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,360
Can we have you don't know?

1264
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:46,360
He doesn't know.

1265
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:47,360
He's just sending us.

1266
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,360
You're right.

1267
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,360
You're just we're on this journey with you.

1268
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,360
We're on this quest with you.

1269
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,360
Schedules permitting.

1270
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,360
Yes.

1271
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,360
OK.

1272
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,360
Yeah.

1273
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:55,360
Sector keeper.

1274
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:59,520
Can we have an item to carry into this brave new frontier?

1275
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:00,520
We're going to need something in there.

1276
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:02,240
We need something to add to our inventory.

1277
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,040
Something from level five stage two.

1278
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,040
Yes.

1279
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:09,920
The item that you'll put in your inventory to take into the parking structure from level

1280
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:18,880
five stage two is a hard hat from the unbuilt luxury hotel.

1281
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:19,880
Oh, wow.

1282
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:20,880
OK.

1283
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:21,880
More armor, I guess.

1284
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:22,880
One hard hat.

1285
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:23,880
One, though.

1286
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:24,880
So we got to decide.

1287
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:25,880
Just one.

1288
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:26,880
Yes.

1289
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,880
Share it between you three.

1290
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:30,880
OK.

1291
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:35,160
Jason might still be a little weak from the screwdriver and the vapor.

1292
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:36,160
Yeah.

1293
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:40,400
Maybe we want to put it on his noggin so he doesn't crack it open in case.

1294
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:45,360
What if like a steam vent burst in the parking garage and you got a little tipsy again?

1295
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:46,360
Yeah.

1296
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:48,960
He may have some post-traumatic stress from the bath.

1297
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:49,960
So he could just fall into a.

1298
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:52,160
Is there like a good version of post-traumatic stress?

1299
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,880
Yeah, I'm sure there is.

1300
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:54,880
Post-bliss stress?

1301
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:55,880
Post-traumatic bliss?

1302
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:56,880
Post-traumatic bliss.

1303
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:57,880
That's it.

1304
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:06,000
I guess traumatic is probably not going to go on there either.

1305
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,240
They toured with the new radicals for a while.

1306
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,560
They had a couple members of Faroukhi Salt.

1307
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:13,560
Yeah.

1308
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:14,560
One hit wonder.

1309
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:15,560
Mall Rock.

1310
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:16,560
Wow.

1311
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:17,560
OK.

1312
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:27,120
Well, with that in mind and with item in hand or on head, we have all survived level five

1313
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:33,800
stage two of the downtown Disney ordeal and tomorrow it all ends.

1314
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:34,800
I hope.

1315
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:35,800
Hopefully.

1316
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:36,800
We all hope.

1317
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:37,800
So tune in.

1318
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:38,800
Oh man.

1319
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:39,800
We can end it.

1320
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:40,800
All right.

1321
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:41,800
Smells like cigarettes.

1322
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:42,800
Cigarette flavored vape.

1323
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:43,800
OK.

1324
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:55,280
Well, tune in tomorrow for the grand finale and be sure to follow us on Twitter, Instagram

1325
00:56:55,280 --> 00:57:02,080
and Facebook, Facebook, Facebook, hashtag DDDO, hashtag save the level keeper, which

1326
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:07,040
hopefully we'll do tomorrow and hashtag sector keeper cricket wireless severance tweeted at

1327
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,120
cricket wireless and not at us.

1328
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:10,120
Yeah.

1329
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:16,680
As you know from the underworld, if you want more podcasts, the ride, then go to the Patreon.com

1330
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:19,880
slash podcast, the ride, the podcast, the second gate for three bonus episodes every

1331
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:20,880
month.

1332
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:21,880
So here we go.

1333
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:30,000
It would have been good if we got a bath bomb and we could use a bomb in the fight.

1334
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:35,080
I just received a text message from the level keeper.

1335
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:41,160
He or she says you receive one bath bomb.

1336
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,640
Oh, OK, cool.

1337
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:50,760
However, what flavor you must cut it up and share it between the three of you.

1338
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:51,760
OK.

1339
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,440
I'm doing what flavor is the bath?

1340
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,440
Sugar cookie.

1341
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:56,440
Hell yeah.

1342
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:00,440
What a tease for tomorrow.

1343
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:06,200
So as long as it doesn't get eaten in the interim, be sure to share it with your friend who will

1344
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,200
be helping you.

1345
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,680
OK, we're going to split it in four.

1346
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:10,680
Yeah.

1347
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:11,680
All right.

1348
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:16,360
So like so then do we just like have four parts and then reform it?

1349
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,360
I don't know.

1350
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,140
I think we'll just kind of have to be on the fly.

1351
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:20,140
See how we're going to use it.

1352
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:21,140
Yeah.

1353
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:23,560
We'll run it by him and see what he wants to do or her.

1354
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:24,560
Who will the guest be?

1355
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:25,560
We don't know that.

1356
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:28,440
Wake up tomorrow AM and find out.

1357
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:29,440
Oh, boy.

1358
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,440
Here we go.

1359
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,440
Sugar cookie.

1360
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,440
Forever.

1361
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:33,440
