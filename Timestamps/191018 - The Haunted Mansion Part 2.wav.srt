1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:27,580
Doog!

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hauntcast, The Fright.

4
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,300
Welcome once again to Hauntcast, The Fright, the Scream Park podcast hosted by three headless men in their 30s.

5
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,300
I'm Rott Skardiner, joined by Mike Coffinson and Jason Skeleton.

6
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,300
We got some feedback from last week about the names.

7
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:12,300
Somebody correctly pointed out that Lindsay Cat's Eye could have easily been Lindsay Slaytie.

8
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,300
That is good, yeah.

9
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,300
And I have to say that I agree with that.

10
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,300
In the heat of the moment, you know, you toss stuff out.

11
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,300
I thought Cat's Eye was a real good solve, I thought, but Slaytie, pretty good.

12
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:28,300
As part of this, somebody also pointed out that Jason could be Slayson.

13
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:32,300
So I just wanted to put that on the table if you want it.

14
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:36,300
Because you should have agency in your own scary name.

15
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,300
But that's up to you.

16
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,300
I'll sleep on it.

17
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,300
Yeah, yeah.

18
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:43,300
Well, we got till next year because this is the last one.

19
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:48,300
Well, we're doing more on the second gate.

20
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,300
But a little more, I will say, Haunted Mansion related.

21
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,300
And I don't want to say more than that.

22
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:57,300
So patreon.com slash podcast the Fright and you'll hear a little bit more.

23
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,300
But there's a real aura for boating on that one.

24
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,300
Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,300
See if you can figure it out.

26
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:11,300
But anyway, yeah, we're they were plowing through it because we got live shows to do.

27
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,300
Y'all next. We're hitting the road.

28
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:18,300
And I think as you hear this, I forget Orlando for sure.

29
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,300
You could still do if you're if you've been thinking about it.

30
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,300
Yes. Pull the trigger.

31
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,300
Come see us in Orlando on October 24th.

32
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:30,300
If you're listening on the day this has come out, you can still make it to Chicago.

33
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,300
Yes, tomorrow.

34
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,300
Chicago is tomorrow.

35
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,300
If you're listening Friday, whatever the date is, the 18th.

36
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,300
I believe this is out the Friday the 18th.

37
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,300
That's correct.

38
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:45,300
And if you're jumping on it day one and you're in Chicago, then why would you not come say hello?

39
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,300
You got to come.

40
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,300
Yes. Fun stuff in store.

41
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,300
We're excited.

42
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:56,300
But we and we there's so many like, you know, we're navigating this hot cast, the fright.

43
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,300
There's the tour where we've been shipping away at the downtown Disney or deal.

44
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:05,300
There's so many mini franchises and little tasks within the podcast that we're worried about.

45
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:12,300
But now we are back to our slowest go franchise within the show.

46
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:18,300
We are here at Haunted Mansion to Hard at Mansion Part two, as we have said,

47
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:28,300
because in the spirit of Halloween, we will discuss the Haunted Mansion every once a year every year, because I mean,

48
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,300
I think it started a lot of things start as like, oh, wouldn't that be funny?

49
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:41,300
And then we thought on it and it's like, well, I think it is probably the ride with the most text, text, subtext stuff.

50
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,300
Yes. There's so much.

51
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:51,300
I'm overwhelmed where I'm looking at Doom Buggies, the website, and I don't even like I so much about individual rooms.

52
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,300
Who knows where to begin?

53
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,300
I have the most amount of notes I may have ever taken.

54
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,300
This is number one in the series.

55
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,300
Bigger than Hard Rock Park.

56
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:06,300
But it's possible because what happened was I started following.

57
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,300
I started at like Doom Buggies and some other Haunted Mansion websites.

58
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:16,300
And every time there was a thread, I was like, let me see how far I can follow this historical thread before I start to lose my mind.

59
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,300
Wow. Yeah.

60
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:23,300
So if you're listening to this just for and you haven't listened to last year's Haunted Mansion, let's recap a little.

61
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,300
Yeah, I was going to say, like, maybe actually go back and listen to that one first.

62
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,300
That might actually be something that I joke that you need to listen to, like all the city walk.

63
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:37,300
I think maybe listen to the first time. I think so, because last year was mostly about the Genesis and creation of the ride.

64
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:42,300
It was a very long birth, a very long run up and creation.

65
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,300
And so by the many versions of the ride and different narratives that didn't make it.

66
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,300
Tons of people involved. The World's Fair delaying it.

67
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,300
Walt's death delaying it.

68
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:59,300
And we're talking about the Disneyland version and that building, the exterior of the ride, sat there with no ride for almost a year.

69
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,300
Yeah, some long time.

70
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,300
Like an actual abandoned haunted house. It sat empty.

71
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:09,300
So the idea, yeah, the idea would you be just walking around Disneyland and you'd be like, well, is it a house there?

72
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,300
The mystery mysterious house. And then all of a sudden I can go in the house finally.

73
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,300
Yeah, people must have assumed that was just a facade.

74
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,300
Right.

75
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,300
Like you've seen the Julio Torres is stand up special.

76
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,300
No, my favorite shapes.

77
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:30,300
He has a there's a whole bit of the way and talk about this and he did his own bit about how you can't go in Daisy's house.

78
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:37,300
And I mean, Mickey's Toon Town, right. And his like fantasy dream of what like he just did being awfully.

79
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,300
He was so upset that you could not go into Daisy's house.

80
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,300
But this is the Haunted Mansion must have seemed like Daisy's house.

81
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,300
One of those. Yeah, there is no thing in here.

82
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,300
So when it opens in sixty nine, it's a huge deal.

83
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:55,300
It is a ride, as we all know, it's a ride. And this is the goal that I want to throw out to you guys.

84
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,300
We've talked about this all fair. Let's talk about it on air.

85
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,300
I want to get on the ride in this episode.

86
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,300
Oh, I don't know.

87
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,300
Yes, Jason and I are a little bit more skeptical that we're going to make it all to the rest.

88
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:11,300
Last year we got kind of to the door, but we realized we forgot a lot of the graveyard to the gate.

89
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,300
We got to the gate. Excuse me. You're right.

90
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,300
I got to the front gate. So if you're thinking about us, we were walking on the gate.

91
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,300
Well, on the sign we were walking.

92
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:23,300
Yeah, we were walking to the ride and on the way discussing all the different versions that were going to happen.

93
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,300
So history origins.

94
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:31,300
I will say I will I will guarantee that we'll get to the front door of the mansion and we'll see how far inside we get.

95
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,300
We might not get in the door. I don't know. I'm not going to.

96
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,300
Again, the most substance maybe of any attraction.

97
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,300
I will say this. I will make a file. I will not artificially delay.

98
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,300
I will not try to tangent any more than a normal episode.

99
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:48,300
I like that I suggested that we talk about the ride that's our topic and what followed was.

100
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:57,300
Well, I don't know if I can make it. I mean, unfortunately, here every year, if you thought this was going to be a speedy endeavor.

101
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,300
No, of course not. Build a mansion in faster time.

102
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,300
And we're only talking about Disneyland version.

103
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,300
We said that's another rule because I agree. I got overwhelmed in terms of differences.

104
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,300
Too much. Let's leave that off.

105
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:19,300
To put it to also just a side note, I was I was like, let me go back and listen to what we were talking about last year just to make sure we don't repeat a lot.

106
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:28,300
And this is how this shows you the difference a year makes that we were making a joke about future President Michael Avenatti.

107
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,300
That's where we were in October 2018.

108
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:40,300
Yeah. Yeah. I'm not. He feels like I was thinking how if you told me that Michael Avenatti came and went and played out in like 2011, I'd believe it.

109
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:48,300
That's how the pace of the news cycle and the exhaustion of the Trump era is like, yeah, was he from was Avenatti from 2002?

110
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,300
What is he again? Yeah, right. Exactly. Can I do one for 2019?

111
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:57,300
Oh, just put kind of a bookmark in the year. President John Delaney. Right, folks.

112
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:02,300
Here we go. We will forget about him. I forgot that already. I forgot about that already.

113
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,300
Yeah, we'll see where we're at. We'll compare this. Little time capsule.

114
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:12,300
I feel like the Haunted Mansion episode is maybe our least funny episode because I feel like we were just fact, fact, fact. Let's talk more.

115
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:20,300
I felt that too. Well, let's take that pressure off. We don't need to. Let's have fun. We're a comedy podcast. Let's have some fun.

116
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:30,300
I'm sure I think I have an audience important to remember the good times. Now I don't remember him or what he was, but he makes me smile.

117
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:36,300
He's not the mooch that I know. But he's the guy that's like look stressed outside getting a phone call.

118
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:41,300
He kept saying he was going to sue people. Stormy's lawyer. Stormy's lawyer. Stormy feels like forever ago.

119
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:50,300
Stormy feels like forever ago. Yeah. I think I'm actually I was misremembering who he was. Stormy Daniels lawyer, of course.

120
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:58,300
We're going to be still be doing this in twenty twenty six and talking about the deep into third term Trump.

121
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:03,300
With our comparing of notes is going to be much. Now we're talking about like what's what's currently happening.

122
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:11,300
Castro's running for president and in twenty twenty six will be like, well, you know, Baltimore's gone. Trump. Yeah.

123
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:19,300
You are arrested if you sell share streaming service passwords. Trump had his brain implanted in a young person's head.

124
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:24,300
And like he's like a young handsome Trump now, but he's got the same old brain as Trump.

125
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:28,300
But the body is starting to curve. Air is starting to rot.

126
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:35,300
Imagine like something, a twenty something hunk with Trump's brain. So it's obviously still trying to like stand in that odd way.

127
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:43,300
Still a big puff out. But yeah, it's like the wolf boy in Twilight. What's his name? That handsome boy.

128
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:50,300
It's a boy. Yeah, I know. Taylor Lawner. Taylor. Taylor Lawner. He will look like Taylor. Yeah, I don't know.

129
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,300
But he's going to be we're going to use his body for Trump.

130
00:09:53,300 --> 00:10:02,300
Trump is going to Trump has sold three states to Saudi Arabia and they're in the process of picking which ones they want.

131
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:06,300
They don't have to all be next to each other. They could be spread out.

132
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,300
And he's they're going to actually take the state somehow. They're going to remove it.

133
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,300
They're going to remove it from the United States and move it.

134
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,300
But maybe just be floating near. That's actually cool.

135
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:24,300
All the Trump maniacs are like, we love Sharia law now. We love it. Mr. Trump, thank you for Sharia law. Mr. Trump.

136
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:30,300
It's tidy. It's organized, you know. Well, watch every prediction come exactly true.

137
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:36,300
Yeah. And by that point, we will look like, well, no, we can't. We have to talk. We can't talk about floating.

138
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:41,300
Leota, we haven't gotten past still Leota yet. Right. I mean, that's coming.

139
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:46,300
All that's coming. So let's get in the game. I would like to start.

140
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:51,300
Yes. So I would like to start with an example of one of the threads I started to follow.

141
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:57,300
OK. Which so the sign, the sign outside of the Haunted Mansion.

142
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,300
Mike, you have a replica. That's right over there. Sitting on a thing. I need to hang it up.

143
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:17,300
We just I think at the very end, we're like, we like that sign. I wanted to know more about the sign and I started at Doom Buggies and then ended at the history of some landmarks and the L.A. Times archives.

144
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:23,300
So that sign was sculpted by a Disney employee named Chris Muller Jr.

145
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:36,300
He also did the giant squid in twenty thousand leagues under the sea and he did the smaller squid in twenty thousand leagues under the sea, sculpted a number of the jungle cruise animals.

146
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:46,300
And in pop culture history, he sculpted the mask and hands of the creature from the Black Lagoon, the original creature from the Black Lagoon.

147
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,300
All right. That's pretty cool. So it goes even further.

148
00:11:50,300 --> 00:12:03,300
The designer of the creature from the Black Lagoon was a the costume was designed by a woman named Millicent Patrick, who happened to be one of Disney's first female animators.

149
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:07,300
Designed a costume of a creature from the Black Lagoon. Designed the costume from the creature from the Black Lagoon.

150
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:17,300
She was also an actress and an artist. Her father is a man named Camille Charles Rosie.

151
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:24,300
Now, this is where I hit my first oddball speed bump. I found an incorrect fact on Doom Buggies website.

152
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:30,300
They said that Rosie is the architect behind Hearst Castle. He is not.

153
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:38,300
He was a construction manager at Hearst Castle and helped design some of the interiors because he got friendly with William Randolph Hearst.

154
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:47,300
The designer of Hearst Castle, the architect behind it, was a woman named Julia Morgan, who was the first female architect in California.

155
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,300
So give her her credit. Doom Buggies.

156
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,300
So you're calling out Doom Buggies.

157
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,300
What you found out is that Doom Buggies has incorrect information.

158
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:01,300
And that is what a lot of this episode is going to be about is correcting the Doom Buggies website.

159
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:11,300
But this now this did circle back around because it's I would they said like an anecdote that Raleigh Crump always said.

160
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:16,300
Walt Disney cited Hearst Castle, among many other things, as an inspiration for the haunting mansion.

161
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:23,300
Hearst Castle on top of a hill by San Simeon, California, kind of imposing, kind of kind of kind of kind of.

162
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:28,300
Yeah. So that's that's the threads that come off the sign.

163
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:37,300
The sign of just the sign and it connects back to other Disney Imagineering projects, other American history is sinister American history.

164
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:41,300
Yeah. Is there a more iconic sign like the you can think of the pie?

165
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:46,300
Guess Pirates of the Caribbean like the sign outside is really iconic, but it's not as good up there.

166
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:51,300
Yeah, it's not quite as good and simple words ultimately.

167
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,300
But that it's the oval, the crest is in that frame is fantastic.

168
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,300
And it's been the it does feel like scaly like the creature from the Black Lagoon.

169
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:02,300
And having it in the apartment, I guess, like, you know, I can touch it, which is nice.

170
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,300
Yeah. So you can touch the sign.

171
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:10,300
So I'm trying to think if there's anything I don't think so, because like space, my sign that I have at home.

172
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,300
But that's just me. That's because I see it every day.

173
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,300
Yeah. And that's my caution doors open automatically up.

174
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,300
God, I mean, that's up there.

175
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:21,300
But yes, based on his different logos everywhere.

176
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:29,300
I mean, there's a slightly different variation font, and sometimes they use like gross 90s alien fonts and like that Tokyo font for Space Mountain.

177
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,300
That looks like the spawn, the 90s comic spawn logo.

178
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:36,300
Oh, sure. So a final feature panel for could be signs.

179
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,300
Yes, I would say the best and worst signs competition.

180
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:43,300
Yeah, that's good contenders. That is good. Yeah.

181
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:49,300
Gomer's Gentlemen's Lair bathroom sign is definitely in the running for one of my favorites.

182
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,300
That's over by Hungry Bear. It's the bathroom level.

183
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:59,300
Yeah, about bottom level of Hungry Bear bathroom. It says Gomer's Gentlemen's Lair over the male bathroom.

184
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,300
Wow. I think Trixie is the female. I believe that's right.

185
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,300
Yeah. There's like a Trixie's powder room or something.

186
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,300
Anyway, walk up there and figure it out.

187
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,300
What's your sign, ladies? People are yelling right now. They know it.

188
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,300
Of course. We know the name of the bathroom.

189
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,300
So that's the sign. So that's the sign.

190
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,300
You said things about the gate as well.

191
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,300
No, sorry. I meant the sign. The area around the gate.

192
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,300
You don't have any information about who made the gate?

193
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,300
No, don't be foolish.

194
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,300
Foolish mortal? Don't be a foolish mortal.

195
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:34,300
The gate is cool. I will say I like the gate a lot.

196
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:44,300
It's I'm trying to think it's like we can't talk about Disney World, but it's good because it does seem like a gate that would keep you out.

197
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:49,300
It seems like a scary house in Disneyland, but not as scary and setback like Disney World.

198
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:54,300
But the gate is like I could see if I was a kid and I'd be like, you shouldn't go over that gate.

199
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,300
Like somebody weird lives there. Like it feels right. It feels right to me.

200
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:03,300
It's not. Yeah. Well, and it like that it is a little sectioned off area from the rest.

201
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,300
Yeah. Yeah, I think that's what I'm saying.

202
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:10,300
Disney World is kind of like a massive birth, a massive walkway.

203
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,300
I think they knew the crowds. It would be a hit.

204
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:20,300
But that one is setback. But this one just feels like like if I lost a ball over the fence, don't go get it.

205
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,300
Don't go get it. Yeah. Yeah. But we're in now. We made it in.

206
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:28,300
But we're in the gate. Yes. Now we're in. I'm glad just we made it through the gate.

207
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:32,300
So we're talking cemetery, the grounds. What do you want to call it?

208
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:38,300
Well, there's the hearse. Let's not get the stuff. Yes. Yes.

209
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:43,300
That's the hearse, I think is that part of the graveyard. Oh, that counts.

210
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:49,300
The grounds. We're in the grounds. Sure. Yes. That's what a lot of websites refer to as outside of the house.

211
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:54,300
So did everyone read the insane urban legend about the hearse? Not the urban legend.

212
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:59,300
No. OK. I don't know. Maybe I didn't. So this is it's sad.

213
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,300
It's a funny urban legend. It has been well.

214
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:09,300
It's been debunked that this hearse is the hearse used in former Mormon church leader,

215
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:14,300
Brigham Young's funeral procession. What? No, I did not read this.

216
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,300
This is a not real. It's not real.

217
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:24,300
No, it is an urban legend that circulated a bunch to the point that like multiple news sites like had to debunk it.

218
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:32,300
So church archives show that Brigham Young was carried through the streets by pallbearers.

219
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:39,300
There was no wagon involved, although it is possible this wagon could have been in Utah in the eighteen hundreds.

220
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:45,300
It's also possible that some information that the Mormons collected about their back story is incorrect.

221
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:51,300
Yeah, for sure. Well, that's what the big debunked article I found in

222
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:55,300
was a guy named Glenn M. Leonard.

223
00:17:55,300 --> 00:18:00,300
He's the director of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, his Museum of Church History and Art.

224
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:05,300
But the article was in the desert news, the longest running paper in Utah,

225
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:08,300
which is owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.

226
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:11,300
And there is some wild shit in that newspaper.

227
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,300
Like there is we don't have time to get into that.

228
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,300
We're on Mormon newspapers.

229
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,300
Do you know? Did you read what it is, what it was in the hearse?

230
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:24,300
The hearse? Yeah. So about the John Wayne movie.

231
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,300
No, that's Florida. Oh, that's the Florida hearse.

232
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,300
Oh, I got my hearse is mixed up.

233
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:41,300
So the hearse outside of the Disneyland Mansion painted white was bought by from an antique dealer in California.

234
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:49,300
And the urban legend around this is that Knott's Berry Farm was about to buy it for a ghost town for the ghost town section.

235
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:56,300
And the guy, the owner, called Disney and said, like, hey, he left to get a check if you really want this.

236
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:03,300
Because Tony Baxter wanted it in the 90s because it was going to be used in that insane.

237
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,300
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Indiana Jones stunt show.

238
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:09,300
Right. Where like it was going to be part of a chase.

239
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,300
And the train was in the train was involved. Yes.

240
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,300
Yes. Going to use the Disneyland train.

241
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,300
I believe that's the same one. Right.

242
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:21,300
It was going to be like a scene with the train over back by Big Thunder Trail.

243
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,300
But how could they use the train? How could they coordinate it?

244
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:30,300
I think that was a big I don't know if that was just a blue sky idea, but there was going to be like the train would stop and there would be a little show.

245
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,300
I wouldn't whatever once an hour or something.

246
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:36,300
So you would have had to coordinate times to have the show.

247
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:40,300
Wow. It's a cool idea, but it does seem logistically impossible.

248
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,300
It slows down the train operation. Yeah.

249
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:48,300
So weird that that what a weird backwards we got a thing we got a ride that maybe might get built.

250
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,300
But we better buy this hearse.

251
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:59,300
That said, turning lemons into lemonade, Tony Baxter cited as one who came up with the floating hitch gimmick.

252
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:11,300
There's a hitch on top in front of the hearse that looks like it's attached to a horse that is just floating in midair as if a ghost horse is hooked up to it.

253
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:17,300
Now, let me say this. I never noticed that it did not register the hearse itself.

254
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:21,300
I never know the floating. Oh, I never ever occurred to me.

255
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:25,300
I didn't know about it. I didn't. Yeah. Yeah. I read it and I went, oh, yeah. Yeah.

256
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,300
Now it makes sense. But it does not necessarily.

257
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,300
That is my my one not to criticize Tony.

258
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:38,300
Obviously, I mean, there's sure Tony, but Tony's done so many things we barely we probably haven't even noticed half of them.

259
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,300
We may have talked a lot of shit about. Yeah.

260
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:46,300
He designed the planet Hollywood at Disney Village Paris.

261
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:49,300
I know. Yeah. Sign inside.

262
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,300
Tony. Oh, hold on. I was going to say Tony.

263
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:55,300
There's a friends of the show season pass.

264
00:20:55,300 --> 00:21:07,300
They did a Doug Barnes did a panel at Midsummer Scream with a bunch of people, including Tony and this woman, Tanya Norris, who did like design and like picked out the wallpaper of the Haunted Mansion.

265
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,300
And she has amazing stories on there about like being on a plane with Walt.

266
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:16,300
But I was Tony was talking about Haunted Mansion. He's very big on updating it and like keeping it.

267
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:20,300
He said it on the panel like, you know, we can do a lot better with the effects now.

268
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,300
And I think they should go in there and do that. Yeah.

269
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:28,300
So he's very much, I think, always been like, what can we do to like bring this up to today's standard? Yeah.

270
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,300
Which is cool. I like that. I'm pro that anyway.

271
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,300
I'm kind of. Yeah, I'm proud of it, too.

272
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,300
If you like all this stuff, go to season pass and listen to that.

273
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:38,300
I listened to that panel what you were there for and now celebrating it occurs to me now.

274
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:47,300
I mean, we're late on it, but this is this year is the 50th anniversary of Haunted Mansion and we look we celebrate the 50th and we look forward to celebrating the 60th as well.

275
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,300
I think you're going to say 100th for some.

276
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:54,300
By which point we will be 15 percent through the graveyard.

277
00:21:54,300 --> 00:22:00,300
We will be. Yes, I was going to say like we'll be at the third DOOM buggy because we have to obviously do each DOOM buggy.

278
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,300
They all have a history, of course.

279
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:11,300
So we'll have to do that. Well, if Futurama's predictions are correct when we celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Haunted Mansion, Richard Nixon will be president once again.

280
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,300
So just as he was.

281
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:18,300
Where things are heading. If we're body transferring Trump and younglings, then sure.

282
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,300
Younglings.

283
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:27,300
Yeah, so the hearse in Florida, again, we're not really talking about the hearse in Florida, was used in the John Wayne movie, The Sons of Katie Elder.

284
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,300
I screwed up. I said something about the hearse in Florida.

285
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:35,300
That's OK. That's OK. But the hearse has that fun ghost relations sign inside.

286
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,300
You guys know. Yeah, yeah. Ever notice that?

287
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:49,300
That was apparently on the like coming soon signs of like if you're interested in dwelling in our happy hunting ground, send your right to the ghost relations department.

288
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,300
Like guest relations. It's fun.

289
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:57,300
It's just the start of the wordplay that will haunt to this episode.

290
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,300
No, no phone number you can call them.

291
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:05,300
There should be a phone number. There should be somebody that writes back with like a spooky letter.

292
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:09,300
But well, yeah, maybe that's one of the things Tony was talking about enhancing it.

293
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:13,300
He wants an address or a phone number for that joke.

294
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:21,300
That would be good. If I have something to say about the something that happens behind the columns.

295
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:25,300
So really, it's you're on the porch, really, of the mansion.

296
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:30,300
Should I save that for? Yes, I think that would come later, I suppose.

297
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:39,300
I think it would come. I would like to because like as you cross through the gate and you pass by the hearse, this is your first glimpse of the imposing house itself.

298
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:42,300
And did you guys read it? You can see it from the outside, too.

299
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:49,300
But yes, you can see it from the outside, but it kind of looms over you as you sort of round the corner here.

300
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:53,300
Did you guys read about like the architecture at all?

301
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:57,300
We did some of this. We talked a little bit about it last time.

302
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,300
It sounds familiar. I'll say buzz.

303
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:09,300
This is a Victorian style house, kind of a southern kind of a southern vibe, southern Gothic vibe.

304
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:22,300
And very different from the other Haunted Mansions, which are kind of more like perpendicular lines, more like stone and stuff rising above you.

305
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:26,300
And more of the like it's far away effect of Main Street where like.

306
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,300
Yes. Forest perspective.

307
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:32,300
Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Getting smaller as it goes, seems larger.

308
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:42,300
Yeah. So and this it's a mix of Victorian styles with the Roman columns that were very popular in the south in like the 1800s and all.

309
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:52,300
And I was reading about like our idea of Victorian homes is like haunted houses like they often look. This is one of the styles.

310
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:58,300
People think of a haunted house being and that came like in the early 20th century.

311
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:03,300
It's like this looks old to us now here in the 21st century.

312
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:07,300
Everything is just like Victorian just means old to me.

313
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:10,300
So like, yeah, we lose track of the individual types of old.

314
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:14,300
Yeah, the flattening of history. Everything just becomes like old.

315
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:18,300
Everything in the past is old timey. Yeah.

316
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:25,300
So but it has to fit in like there's not I don't think of it as like the southern Haunted Mansion, but it has to look appropriate.

317
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,300
New Orleans Square. New Orleans Square.

318
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:34,300
And everything. Yeah, there's all the other the Dixie sort of vibe of everything and the bands playing along the river.

319
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:40,300
Yeah, and it is it fits. It does really fit like it really does like working in the same.

320
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,300
I know it's like the Haunted Mansion in Florida.

321
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:47,300
And we're not supposed to talk about it like that sort of technically like fits Liberty Square and everything.

322
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,300
But it still seems a little bit more out of place to me.

323
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:54,300
When then in Tokyo, weirdly in and then in the land, not quite.

324
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:58,300
It's enough. It's close enough to frontier land that you counted as part of that.

325
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,300
But it's sort of like a theme into itself.

326
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:04,300
That's maybe the oddest placement of a Haunted Mansion is.

327
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,300
Yeah, that is it is odd. It's just like in the back.

328
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:14,300
Yeah, it's like if you were in fantasy land and Disneyland and instead of Dumbo, the Haunted Mansion was just sitting there.

329
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:18,300
Yeah. And it just jumps out. I remember turned like turning around and like, oh, there's the Haunted Mansion.

330
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:22,300
OK. Yeah. Yeah. It's, you know, weird.

331
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:26,300
Yeah. Here it's it's fantastic. Here. It's great.

332
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:34,300
Tony Baxter once again has said like, oh, the southern style house is more foreign to like California.

333
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:45,300
Get visitors in the way that like the more New England style brick mansion in Florida is kind of a like if they put a southern mansion in Florida, it wouldn't be that weird.

334
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:48,300
It wouldn't be that odd. That architectural style.

335
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,300
That's why they changed the style. Sure, sure, sure.

336
00:26:50,300 --> 00:27:04,300
It's interesting because he talks about that a lot philosophy wise when like when he's talking about Phantom Manor and in France, it's like, well, you know, American West is a little more foreign to people in Europe.

337
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:17,300
So like they're always constantly thinking about things that are like not so familiar to the place that the park is located, which is funny that California Adventure got built because that couldn't be the most opposite of what Tony was saying.

338
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:21,300
Like you're Hollywood south of just south of Hollywood. Right. What's the point?

339
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:27,300
Yeah, it makes sense to have like maybe Hollywood in Florida because yeah, you're not near that actual place.

340
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:34,300
I was supposed to I was just explaining to a friend to the weird Disney Studios Paris Park, the worst park Disney's built.

341
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:47,300
And I found a picture that I didn't even I didn't even stare at since I went there and there's like, you know, bad like facades of Hollywood kind of buildings and one of them says Larchmont Hotel on it.

342
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:52,300
And like in the other ones, Los Feliz, I think, like I'm like, that's so bizarre.

343
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:59,300
That's a Larchmont nod in a field in Paris. But very far. So maybe that one works.

344
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:07,300
Yeah, I was going to say the building's very ugly. So no. And it's also that one wasn't even attempt to be a studio, which makes it extra weird.

345
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:16,300
I feel no, not really. Yeah. Yeah. The themes all. Yeah. Yeah. Well, the main drag of California Adventure being Buena Vista Street now.

346
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:21,300
But it looked Buena Vista Street is street in Burbank adjacent to the Disney Studios.

347
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:28,300
And it looks like 1920s Atwater Village, which is a different Los Angeles neighborhood. Yeah, that's true.

348
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:31,300
I was going to say at least that's in the past. It is in the past.

349
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:36,300
That makes sense because that was that was their plus up of like, well, at least let's make this in the past.

350
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:41,300
I do attribute to current Hollywood, a place that where no one likes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

351
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:45,300
So there's Aaron and I will be driving in there and we'll go, wow, we even had to be in Hollywood in like four months.

352
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:48,300
Fuck. Yeah. Yeah. No, I did. That's a great four months.

353
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:52,300
My friend had a birthday on Hollywood Boulevard two weeks ago and we were parking.

354
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:59,300
I was like, oh, God, I haven't been here forever. Your friend, Spider-Man, or was it Elmo? Yeah.

355
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:04,300
It was your oldest friend in Los Angeles. It was Jack Sparrow. Oh, my.

356
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:07,300
Oh, I hope you gave him a ball run. Yeah, I did.

357
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:13,300
Did I tell that story on this podcast when we saw Spider-Man at the Grownlings Chinese?

358
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:18,300
I don't remember. And I went there's a Randy's Donuts location on Hollywood Boulevard now.

359
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:24,300
And I went in and you had a donut to get a donut, but also in there because it was later in the night.

360
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:29,300
Jack Sparrow haggling to try and get them to knock some bucks off the dough.

361
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:34,300
Oh, no. See, end of the night, you're going to throw them away in character.

362
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,300
Talking. It was kind of in character.

363
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:41,300
We also saw him eating at the Cabo Wabo Cantina earlier in the evening.

364
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:46,300
Yeah, we did see Jack Sparrow Cabo Wabo Cantina, which in character, he'd be friends with Hagar for sure.

365
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:53,300
Yeah, that's true. Cabo Wabo Cantina, which has had gotten much worse in the years since we've been there.

366
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:58,300
A little rough. Yeah. Yeah. It was always fine. It was always fine.

367
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:05,300
But we were in there and we were like, oh, my God, as if we had come back 50 years later and they hadn't changed anything.

368
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,300
If we did a I think it's I just heard it's getting a facelift, I believe.

369
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:12,300
Oh, it is. Maybe not that, but the Hollywood and Highland District in general.

370
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:16,300
Oh, yes, that's true. We did a city walk, Denton Disney style thing about Hollywood and Highland.

371
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:20,300
We would kill ourselves. We'd be done like sector five.

372
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:23,300
We all cut ourselves and that's the end of the fight.

373
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:29,300
Well, also, every time we'd go back to try something, the thing we had just tried will have closed.

374
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:35,300
Yes. Yeah. We have to record it all in a day or else it's totally and release it the next day.

375
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,300
The leases there are like 10 months long.

376
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:43,300
And that works. That's a that's a tweet. Give some tourists and travel tips.

377
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:52,300
If you're kind of you don't live in Los Angeles and you're coming to Disneyland, do not go to Hollywood Boulevard, but all especially Hollywood and Highland.

378
00:30:52,300 --> 00:31:02,300
If you're fucking rat's nest, if you're the type of person that likes garbage, go like if you want to go like I want to go to city walk before you go.

379
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:07,300
Yes, for sure. Go to city. I mean, going to getting to see the movie in the big IMAX Chinese.

380
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:16,300
Sure, the Chinese theater. But also you can tour the Egyptian down the road, a much more pleasant stretch by Musa and Frank.

381
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,300
Yeah. So anyway, don't go anywhere.

382
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:24,300
But we will do a series on it. Jason will do two hours on Beard Papa.

383
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:29,300
I never eat a beard. I want to eat a beard. Really? What is it? Is it like Pops?

384
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:35,300
Oh, I love it. Beard Papa's son, I think. Oh, my God. Who owns the Beard Papa IP?

385
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:38,300
Doesn't your dad have a beard? My dad does have a beard. Yeah. I wonder.

386
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:45,300
I have seen a picture of your dad and I'm picturing Beard Papa. I could be wrong. I think there's a little bit across.

387
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:54,300
Look up Beard Papa if you don't know what we're talking about. He's like a little David the Gnome style man who has sells pastry puffs.

388
00:31:54,300 --> 00:32:00,300
Great. Am I wrong about what he looks like? I like him too. Yeah, he's great. Yeah, we love.

389
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:10,300
We had a working lunch the other day and afterwards I ran a couple errands close by and then I was walking by a pastry shop and I'm like, no, I don't need it.

390
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:17,300
And then when I was almost home, I wanted something sweet. So I just got a milkshake at McDonald's. There he is. Beard Papa.

391
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:27,300
That story was just I wanted one sweet and then I got a different sweet. So this one time, the marketing was with the pastry shop was literally like under new owners.

392
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:37,300
I was like, well, it's got new owners. I'd never been there before. I'm just so you're describing. I feel like your everyday life. It would seem. Yeah.

393
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:45,300
Oh, is it a Japanese company? I think so. Oh, I didn't know that actually. Beard Papa fresh and natural cream puffs. That's what it says.

394
00:32:45,300 --> 00:33:01,300
I love it. OK, so from Beard Papa, yeah, our bizarre rules were Beard Papa and stuff allowed. The spooky Victorian architecture kind of fits in with like what the American myths and legends.

395
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:08,300
What a haunted house should be. I feel like it either looks like a castle kind of like Florida or it looks like this.

396
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:17,300
It looks like Radley's and we talked about how he didn't want like a rundown shitty house in his park. It had to be like the stately kind of scary.

397
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:21,300
He said, we'll keep up the outside and the ghosts will take care of the inside. Something like that.

398
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:28,300
I like that. You know, I'm going to declare what I'm talking about is fits within the area geographically that we are.

399
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:41,300
My primary association with the with the grounds and with the, you know, the the grass in front of the mansion is the Disney sing along songs.

400
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:53,300
Of course, today there is a Disney sing along VHS that is at Disneyland and there is a performance of Grim Grinning Ghosts sort of sung by Thorol Ravenscroft sound alike.

401
00:33:53,300 --> 00:34:04,300
And this was its neck and neck with Ernest goes to Splash Mountain in terms of like the biggest terrors that young Scott Gardner ever faced.

402
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:13,300
This was the scariest shit to me. I saw YouTube comments where people seem to agree that this thing just just haunted their dreams.

403
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:19,300
That is so charming. All really cute. It's a pretty specific thing to be scared of.

404
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:27,300
All the villains get together on the lawn, all the villains and Donald under a sheet and Donald posing as a ghost.

405
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:33,300
You can see his seat is sticking out of the ghost. That's the tell that it's him.

406
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:38,300
He turned like who's this ghost? And then he turns around and scurries away.

407
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:45,300
Seat is showing. So the villain. Yes, it's a gathering of all of the villains.

408
00:34:45,300 --> 00:35:00,300
The Disney's scariest villains go of ghosts and creeps, those being the Snow White Witch Maleficent, a very like that shiny Maleficent, the brightest makeup little like pearls of sweat.

409
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,300
She is. Yeah, she reflects so much light. Her face.

410
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:09,300
The makeup is one of the like the top most vivid memories in my brain like top 50.

411
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:14,300
Her face makeup and the way that it shines is so burned into my brain.

412
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,300
I don't know exactly. We both held on to the Maleficent makeup.

413
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:23,300
I am sure that is much more common than we're thinking it is. Yeah, I bet. I bet. Yeah, it's very striking.

414
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:29,300
It's just a really bold green, a sweaty green. It is like, yeah, I don't know. I don't know if it's sweat.

415
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:39,300
Something's going on with it. It probably plays much better. Like the whole thing, all those Disney singalongs, anytime they would shoot something in the park, it looks like they had an hour to do it.

416
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:46,300
Yeah. So it's not like they were testing out the cameras and the makeup or whatever. So they must have just been like slap whatever we have on.

417
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:53,300
Maybe they made some big adjustment and it just is so striking. I love this connection.

418
00:35:53,300 --> 00:36:00,300
I'm glad I'm not the only one. And I think I didn't I think I think maybe I hadn't even seen Sleeping Beauty, so I didn't know what Maleficent was.

419
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:09,300
So to me, maybe it's like the Joker's makeup, quote unquote, in some worlds, it's not makeup or Christie the clown where it's like that's like on him.

420
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:15,300
So I think not really knowing what Maleficent was, it's like what is why is she this shiny green monster?

421
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:25,300
Uh huh. Like some chemical must have turned her this. So yeah, Maleficent's big shiny green cheek, one of the most scarring memories in much other.

422
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:30,300
I believe that if we people listening to this will post something on Twitter, they will.

423
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:36,300
We will have a lot of support for people that have this memory in their brain. I hope so. A supporters club.

424
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:42,300
That's the thing I remember the most about this is her face. I got to say, I really don't. I remember watching these.

425
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:47,300
I feel like music teacher wanted to break that day. Put in a sing along tape. Oh, smart.

426
00:36:47,300 --> 00:37:00,300
I don't even know that we really sang along. I think we all just like watched it because we were happy to watch TV instructions. But I that is like I can picture my one like music class room from childhood.

427
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:10,300
And I remember weird that they showed it in your school at all. Oh, we all we had tons of tapes where it's like teacher needed a teacher was out sick.

428
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:21,300
We had that teacher. Yeah, she was there an hour a week. I told the story on the show where they were just going to show us Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which is an hour and a half or more.

429
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:29,300
Yeah. And then they turned it off because Rafael said damn twice. No teacher had they had for that part. Yeah. Yeah.

430
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:46,300
I mean, on on like fun days like towards the end of the year and stuff, we would we were a little older and would switch classes for each subject. They would like pause the movie and then restart it like on the intro TV network.

431
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:58,300
Interschool network and and yeah, that's what we die watching all of that. I don't know what that is. I didn't have that like there were TVs in every room, but the VCRs were centralized or centrally located like where you could make the

432
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:09,300
same movie play in multiple classrooms. Whoa, did you go to school in the future? It seemed like it, but it felt like they could never get it to work right. And then one guy knew how to do it sometimes.

433
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:19,300
Wow. We know we we just had the old VCR. Yeah, we had that too. Yeah. To this day, the only way I've ever seen Lord of the Rings is on a small TV far away.

434
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:39,300
That's in the back row. It's in the front row. That's a letter boxed. I've only seen what you see in Lord of the Rings, like from another room. Essentially, is that like your last half a mile away? You watched that in high school? Yeah, I never saw it for real. But was it a regular class or was it some other some class?

435
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:50,300
I don't know. The movie's like two and a half hours. I don't think we finished it. I think we're just like we got an hour. All right, here's some of Lord of the Rings. OK, bye. You want to see the rest? Bye. We finished Batman and Robin over a few periods. That's educated.

436
00:38:50,300 --> 00:39:07,300
Wow. Of all the things you learned in school that were relevant to your future, your profession. Knowing a lot about Batman and Robin is the most important. Certainly for me. I'm not I'm amazingly not done with the with the Grim Grinning Ghost, which is so. Take your time, please.

437
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:17,300
The so be a Maleficent. But also there's these scary tree before you meet the villains. Yes, these scary trees sway around. And I remember going to Disneyland going those trees aren't here.

438
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:31,300
And I couldn't I couldn't know if that was like a relief or a guy. I was scared of him, but I kind of wanted to see the trees. Right. And I think to this day, I find the lawn bare because there's no scary trees. That's interesting.

439
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:45,300
But also so all right. All the monsters and ghosts, because it's a song about ghosts. So here's where the ghosts come out. Maleficent, the witch, Captain Hook. Yes. And the big bad. Yes. My favorite ghost.

440
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:51,300
One of the most terrifying ghosts, the big bad wolf. Now there is this part. Here's what I was talking about between the columns.

441
00:39:51,300 --> 00:40:04,300
There is a part where each of these four initial villains before Donald and his seat join and they all go between the two columns and they do this double twitch. I will play this little I will play this clip of it.

442
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:14,300
One second. And this specifically one of the most terrifying things of my child. And I'm not getting it up quickly enough.

443
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:31,300
I'm curious if people know what I'm talking about with the double twitch. Where's the goddamn somebody else talks. I was just going to say that this was a situation where, of course, as I said many, many times on the show, I was looking at the Disneyland Haunted Mansion and it just looked like fake to me.

444
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:46,300
Like it was almost a set. Yeah, like a set. Because I obviously I did not know what it looked like. And out of the context of this video, I had never seen a picture of. I mean, I saw a picture of it, but I don't didn't remember it. And it just looks strange. It didn't look as scary as the one in Disney World.

445
00:40:46,300 --> 00:41:04,300
Yeah, it's kind of. Oh, sorry. Oh, no, I was going to say, I think the buildings themselves, I think the building in Florida and Tokyo is scarier. I think the grounds are more unnerving. And yes, and obviously, like I think it's scary now, but just watching it on a VHS tape and it's like, well, that's the one.

446
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:18,300
This is also like my association with those sing alongs is like this is one of the only times with my peers and like in school, I had any interaction with theme parks because I felt like it was such a me thing. Me and my family.

447
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:34,300
It wasn't until like my college roommate, Jack, like also was like, yeah, no, I get I want to die. Go a lot like he got it. And then Mike meeting you that was like really had someone to like do this kind of insane level of discussion about it.

448
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:41,300
And then a third and then Scott. And now are now all our audience joins.

449
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:59,300
The army we've created. You are bidding. Here's this little moment.

450
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:11,300
So all the characters are walking by the door with the sort of, you know, the monkey's effect where the camera stays. It's like an impossible amount of space and it stays frozen and the monsters go into monsters like the witch go in and out.

451
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:25,300
But when the big bad wolf with his big long strappy tongue just just goes back and forth and sort of like a thriller dance pose for some reason, I found that so fucking scary and not even the other ones as much the wolf.

452
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:38,300
And I have this recurring nightmare as a kid. I my my childhood bedroom was like at the at the end of a long hallway and I would look out at the end of the hallway and imagine the big bad wolf walking in the front door and doing a double twitch.

453
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:48,300
I hope it's a very vivid. I was scared of the long time. I'm more scared of the long tongue than anything in any horror film in the last 20 years.

454
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:58,300
So like if there was like a David Cronenberg movie with a long tongue, that would be your nightmare. Yeah, there probably is, right? A perma-out tongue, I guess. I'm not scared of dogs or anything.

455
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:07,300
I'm not scared of real wolves as much as I am that up bright standing big bad wolf. But like a hanging tongue is really the issue.

456
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:21,300
Yeah, I imagine the tongue going all the way down the hallway and like grabbing wrapping around me and pulling me into his mouth. That's kind of like Beetlejuice, the stop motion stuff wrapping around.

457
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:33,300
Oh, sure. I was pretty scared of that, too. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. They're very much that style. If we could go back in time, we could sit little Scott down and go like Scott was just a non-union actor at three in the morning.

458
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:44,300
And they just said do something spooky. And that's what they came up with. They made a hundred dollars. And also, Scott, keep in mind, it's not scary at all.

459
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:55,300
Oh, yeah. Your weird warped brain should be scared of this. I'm trying to remember if I was scared of that. That's the thing with creative kids is we would fill in the holes like we would fill in with actual like.

460
00:43:55,300 --> 00:44:05,300
That's the case with our creative kids, too. Yeah, but then creative kids never stop doing it. And that's why we do what we do. That's right. Talking about it. That's on the curse of this tongue.

461
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:19,300
That sounds like some sort of Aaron Sorkin monologue from Studio 60. Stop. No, I'm saying we we we exacerbate the fear by picking the most the least reliable job in the country.

462
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:27,300
Jason Sheridan doing Danny Tripp monologues. Oh, come on, man. Print that on a shirt.

463
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:36,300
Do you guys get stressed out when the giant clock that we have up in your apartment is ticking all the way down and we haven't come up with our episode idea yet?

464
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:49,300
Wait, what? That huge you see it's right. Yeah, yeah. They don't act like you forget about the club. That's a huge clock that clicks down. It ticks down until we have an idea.

465
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:59,300
On Friday when we start with 11 p.m. on Friday when we record all these episodes. Well, yeah, the nation is like it kind of waits for us to sort of set the tone for the week's theme park.

466
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:10,300
Oh, yeah. Now he sounds like Aaron Sorkin. Yeah, that's what we're talking about. Everybody knows. Everybody remembers the big clock. We all remember the big.

467
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:20,300
It's all canon. Studio 60 big clock on the studio 60 red hat that lets you know that we're in the past and 9-11 has just happened and Matthew Perry's younger and coping with it.

468
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:29,300
Right. Young red hat equals younger. Let me say about the Disney with the video. I do. There is something tongue related in my memory.

469
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:39,300
I believe Pluto licked me as a child. The costumed Pluto licked me with his big fake tongue because he had them. Right. I'm right. He has the big hanging tongue.

470
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:47,300
And I do remember him licking me. I remember being conflicted about it. On one hand, it was like nice to be like, you know, shown affection by Pluto.

471
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:52,300
On the other hand, I was thinking like, oh, the tongue is gross, even though it's just a piece of plastic.

472
00:45:52,300 --> 00:46:00,300
I think in my mind, I was imagining like getting like saliva by a dog filling in as Jason said, filling in details that weren't there.

473
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:09,300
Filling in the saliva part. And don't they say like a dog's mouths are like actually very not disgusting at all? Like it's pretty clean.

474
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:19,300
Yeah. I mean, I think yes, that's true. I didn't know that at the time. Well, I think it was, you know, it was a strange dog. Even though I knew Pluto, I still had spent a lot of time with Pluto.

475
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:26,300
So that's maybe why I was a little uncomfortable. I'm just saying if we could sit young Mike down and say like dog's mouths are actually very clean.

476
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:37,300
Don't worry. Would that have worked? Or would you have been like, it doesn't matter? No, my mom probably was like dog's mouths will kill you if you touch saliva from them, especially orange ones.

477
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:48,300
Yeah. Their paws are the things touching dirt and filth all day long. Honestly, Pluto's tongue probably dirtier than a regular dog's tongue. Probably because he's licking every kid.

478
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:59,300
Yeah. Probably. The sicknesses you might like have today, something that will eventually kill you, you got from Pluto's tongue. It's been in your body for 20 years.

479
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:09,300
Pluto's tongue is carrying Legionnaires disease. It's dormant, but it's going to get you. It was Pluto's tongue. It'll get you.

480
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:14,300
OK, so all that being said, when I see the I just, you know, truly and now we're right where I am going.

481
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:20,300
I don't know how we're going to get on the ride because I realized, oh, I have shit to say about the grass because the grass is where this fucking thing happened.

482
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:30,300
Yeah. And I think that's a big part of the place making. There's doom buggies has that whole section on the flora, like the plants around it, which I don't.

483
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:41,300
I'm not good at science, but the takeaways I got were that one, everything looks a little dangerous or a little sinister, but obviously it can't be poisoned.

484
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:51,300
It like it can't be. It's got to look. So it's thorny and gnarly and like everything's droopy, which ties into the southern thing, the sort of wilting looking.

485
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:56,300
Well, yeah. And just that it like looks unnerve it like you are in an unnerving place.

486
00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:04,300
The other illusion of the landscape architecture is that everything is overgrown. This is an old place that's not been kept up.

487
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:10,300
In reality, it is meticulously kept up, meticulously landscaped architecture.

488
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:16,300
It would be funny if they like let it go like the grass is overgrown.

489
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:20,300
I think some of the others they have water shortages in Los Angeles.

490
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,300
Well, we need to save some money.

491
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:25,300
Chay Pek could just cut out the budget for maintaining the lawn.

492
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:27,300
It's going to save a few bucks. Sure.

493
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:37,300
So we veer off to the left and you end up in this little courtyard area for a while where all the like back and forth crisscrossing happens.

494
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:43,300
What do we have to say about the like the cemetery and stuff, which I don't have a lot on?

495
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:46,300
Well, it's changed a lot over the years.

496
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:57,300
They have because you are right at the big the big thing is that there are gravestones honoring the imagineers who worked on it,

497
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:01,300
which were removed in 2001, the first time they did Haunted Mansion Holiday.

498
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:06,300
OK, then facsimiles put back in in 2016 and they were lost.

499
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:15,300
Yeah, really? Yeah, there's a video on a Disney blog with Kim Irvine, who is what's her name's daughter, right?

500
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:18,300
Leota's daughter. Isn't it Leota's daughter? Oh, Leota.

501
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:22,300
Yeah, yeah. Kim Irvine. She oversaw the restoration of the castle.

502
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:25,300
Not repainting the castle. Yeah, she talks about her mother. Yeah.

503
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:28,300
Yeah. So she's Madame Leota's daughter, essentially.

504
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:31,300
Well, but yeah, they lost the originals.

505
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:33,300
Apparently they couldn't find them.

506
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:38,300
Some of them given, I think, Accentio given his.

507
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:42,300
Yes, you're right. He took his and put it in his backyard, I believe. Yes.

508
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:50,300
But all that we talked in the last episode a lot about all the many, many figures who this was like a trademark attraction of theirs.

509
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:52,300
And yeah, they were all honored in here.

510
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:57,300
And I have all of the names and all of the things that says. Yeah, I got that. Yeah. You got this too.

511
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:02,300
All right. You take one and then I go the next one. OK, we might not be looking at the same place.

512
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:05,300
I found a list on the Disney Parks blog.

513
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:08,300
Claude Coats, lead designer specializing in backgrounds and environments.

514
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:11,300
He also developed at the Omnimovir Leia. Can we just tweet the list?

515
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:14,300
No. All right, we'll do a couple.

516
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:20,300
And it said, at peaceful rest lies brother Claude planted here beneath this sod.

517
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:24,300
We have to hear every one of these things. People want us to read.

518
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:29,300
Jason, people. Yeah, Jason's right. Mark Davis, lead designer specializing in character design and psych gags.

519
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:35,300
Just a reminder, Claude Coats, Mark Davis, kind of the two warring influences from the Haunted Mansion.

520
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:40,300
In memory of our patriarch, dear departed grandpa Mark. That's nice.

521
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:44,300
Tensio. We'll do a couple more. Tensio who married the two.

522
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:48,300
Married kind of like. Dasharolly. Smoothered over. Dasharolly Crump.

523
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:53,300
Dasharolly Crump. Tensio wrote the lyrics to Grim Grin and Grost, I believe.

524
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:56,300
Go ahead. Grost. Excuse me.

525
00:50:56,300 --> 00:51:02,300
What's that word? Requis. Requiscat. Requiscat Francis Xavier.

526
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:07,300
No time off for good behavior. RIP.

527
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:10,300
Just do Bill Martin. Yeah, Bill Martin, concept artist.

528
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:15,300
Here lies the man named Martin. The lights went out on this old Spartan.

529
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:20,300
I wonder if they actually called him that. We should look into that or if that was just like, oh, we don't got to rhyme for Martin.

530
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:26,300
Let me do Fred Jerger. He was models and effects modeling because I always laugh. I always like this one.

531
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:30,300
Here lies good old Fred. A great big rock fell on his head.

532
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:35,300
Yeah, that is maybe the best one. I hope that's not real either.

533
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:38,300
No. That's all insensitive to make a joke out of it.

534
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:45,300
Did you guys? I wrote some for us. Did you guys? I did know. Did anyone?

535
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:50,300
I actually didn't know. Please. Let's see how these are.

536
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:56,300
I'm sure good. Here lies Michael. So very tall, tripped on Edwin and had a big fall.

537
00:51:56,300 --> 00:52:00,300
Oh, man. That's how I go. Yeah, that's how you go. I trip over a dog.

538
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:08,300
We do a trip down into an empty sewer grate. And then you're here for like a oh, you know, you're saying you keep falling.

539
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:12,300
Well, that's what I'm saying. Like, where am I? Where do I? Is there like, did I? He's always on your foot.

540
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:17,300
You just fall. I'm just saying, what do I fall? Is there like railroad railroad spike that I fall on?

541
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:21,300
Your head open on a regular head on your stairs. God, that would be.

542
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:26,300
I mean, you're just here for hours that Edwin just humping your leg.

543
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:30,300
You're licking my life. This is truly a honkest of fright.

544
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:35,300
Yeah, I'm licking my blood up off the ground. Dog's tongue. The scariest thing.

545
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:39,300
There it is. Oh, Edwin, let me see that tongue.

546
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:44,300
Oh, God, it's three feet long, but it's clean. But it's clean.

547
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:47,300
Scott, if you want yours, please rest in peace.

548
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:50,300
Our beloved Scott drank mold, but fuck.

549
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:56,300
No. Rest in peace. Our beloved Scott drank mold wine that was scalding hot.

550
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:59,300
I just thought wine was too hot.

551
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:04,300
Just one sip. My heart just burst open.

552
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:09,300
Just melted your organs, I think. Just liquid and liquid organs.

553
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:13,300
And Jason. And I'll let you guys punch mine up because I kind of got a little talk.

554
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:17,300
OK, Jason so loved his sugary eats or fuck.

555
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:23,300
She's Jason so loved his desert eats, not his way to death on sugary treats.

556
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,300
I like it. He's a desert. Yeah. Yeah.

557
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:29,300
If you punch it up with that. Deezer. Deezer.

558
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:35,300
So so those were ours. And then I had an alternate for mine that is based on this.

559
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:43,300
Did you guys come across the by your own haunted mansion tombstone souvenir that they sold in the park?

560
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:49,300
Yes. No. This great. I got to open this image.

561
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:57,300
So they sold like you could get a personalized like I'm assuming miniature gravestone.

562
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:01,300
Mike, did you do you have this? Did you see it open? I saw it, though.

563
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:07,300
Let me try and so you could get a could you write your own encryption like inscription?

564
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:12,300
Yeah, I think there was like you could write the name.

565
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:16,300
I think you personalize it with your name. I think they had some set.

566
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:21,300
They have like you couldn't you couldn't be like using an F word on there, could you?

567
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,300
You can't. There's got to be a restriction. You can't do that.

568
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:31,300
But the sample one is insane. OK. Here lies Randy, a dirty old man.

569
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:38,300
So my alternate be mine for you. My alternate is just here lies Jason, a dirty old man.

570
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:41,300
This personalized tombstone. I didn't mean sexually.

571
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:46,300
I mean, like like pig pen and old, not like horny or anything. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

572
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:52,300
Yeah, that kind of thing. So this says with name and saying of your choice, a dollar fifty.

573
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:55,300
What? It cost a dollar fifty.

574
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:58,300
Unless that's I don't think that's yeah.

575
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:01,300
Or is it fifteen? It's a weird looking.

576
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:03,300
I think it's meant to be a dollar fifty.

577
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,300
But that kind of like glues it to a certain point.

578
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:11,300
I don't even think you get like a side of bacon for a dollar fifty in Disney now.

579
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:14,300
Or like avocado on something I think is more than a dollar fifty.

580
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:17,300
Yeah, avocado is very expensive. So that's a fun.

581
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:20,300
That's a fun little game you invented. Everybody write your own.

582
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:25,300
Write your own little tombstone epitaph, your own comical death and the Senate test posted in the

583
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:27,300
Please. The comments on the tweet.

584
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:33,300
I loved this kind of thing growing up and I my I but the where I grew up is a very like

585
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:39,300
southern is that kind of southern plantation style sort of just had a big, big porch and

586
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:46,300
there I had a sort of little like little hill I lived on top of almost.

587
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:52,300
And so plenty of room to put basically my dad and I made when I was a kid made a bunch of

588
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:55,300
gravestone markers and I wasn't clever enough to come up with them.

589
00:55:55,300 --> 00:56:01,300
Then I think I tried and it was just really like not kind of having my dad's like, I don't know.

590
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:04,300
But he was like being a head writer of these things.

591
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:10,300
But going through my dad, I mean, I let me just say case they ever hear this, I was delighted by

592
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:15,300
making the tombstone, having those in front of our house made me so happy during Halloween season,

593
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:17,300
walking in the door, passed a bunch of tombstones and stuff.

594
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:22,300
But there is this one that didn't occur to me as odd until I got older.

595
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:24,300
And this was my dad's invention.

596
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:32,300
There was a Halloween tombstone that said, here lies an atheist all dressed up with no place to go.

597
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:34,300
Well, that doesn't rhyme at all.

598
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,300
It's not a rhyme. It's not one of the rhyme ones.

599
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:41,300
No, no, it's just a or found it in a book or something and put it.

600
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:47,300
So we used my family used Halloween decorations to shame atheists.

601
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:50,300
Yes, the decorations had an agenda.

602
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:54,300
Yes. And it truly did not occur to me until I went and met more people.

603
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:56,300
That was a bizarre thing.

604
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:59,300
It's I will say this, it is funny.

605
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:01,300
Yeah. Yeah. It's not a bad joke.

606
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:03,300
Yeah. Yeah. I'll give you that.

607
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:05,300
So it is funny. So at least it has that.

608
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:12,300
But yes, it is it is funny because it's like, yeah, it's turning its nose at atheists, turning up its nose.

609
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:14,300
Yeah. It's for the best.

610
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:18,300
The Disney doesn't have this joke. Yeah.

611
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:20,300
It's not welcome in Disneyland.

612
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:25,300
I wonder if they could have gotten away with that, though, in the early days, because maybe people would have just thought that's a funny joke.

613
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:34,300
Mm hmm. And as opposed to like feeling like it was commenting more of like because you could just say, well, that's just a funny joke about atheists.

614
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:38,300
Because since they don't believe in a heaven, they don't have anywhere to go.

615
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:40,300
They're dressed up in no place to go. They don't have anything.

616
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:43,300
That might be my dad's defense that it's not like a hard attack.

617
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:50,300
Right. It's just a play. It's a it's just a clever use of words to display that like there's no.

618
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:53,300
Yeah. I'm curious now if that was his invention or not, or if you can find.

619
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:55,300
I am curious about that. Yeah.

620
00:57:55,300 --> 00:58:01,300
It's like, do you guys ever watch? They used to show it after Are You Afraid of the Dark? The Alfred Hitchcock Presents show.

621
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:08,300
Oh, yeah. Very similar to Twilight Zone, but he would always do these very like darkly funny, morbid intros and stuff.

622
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:19,300
And that I think I like that as a kid. I really don't remember the episodes, but I love those intros because it's just this odd, weird man and the style of humor of these of the Haunted Mansion.

623
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:25,300
And also a lot of religious judgment. Yes. I don't care for the Jews.

624
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:31,300
That was in the outtakes where they couldn't show him on the famous Hitchcock.

625
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:36,300
What do they even believe? What else we got?

626
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:43,300
Yeah. So there were there were different. Yeah. What are what's the so those are back. All of those are bad.

627
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:49,300
So there's one thing you probably saw this in the book that one of them is devoted to Yale Gracie.

628
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:57,300
Yes. And that he's referred to as Master Gracie. And that made a lot of people think that master means you're in charge of the house.

629
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:02,300
And therefore, does that mean the ghost host is Yale Gracie? Does not mean that.

630
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:09,300
It does not mean that. Yeah. For it mean the master was back in the past.

631
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:15,300
You would call like master was a child who wasn't old enough to be called Mr. Master Wayne.

632
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:20,300
Master Wayne. Master Bruce. My grandmother called me that once. Really?

633
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:27,300
Very confusing. The other thing is I learned today Yale Gracie.

634
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:36,300
It was not there like we don't think of him as the ghost host because Yale Gracie, the ghost host, it's implied he commits suicide.

635
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:39,300
Oh, sure. Yale Gracie was murdered. Really?

636
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:46,300
The Yale Gracie was murdered at a hotel on the Pacific Coast Highway. Like it was a completely random like burglary.

637
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:50,300
Oh, no. Yes. I never knew this until this morning.

638
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:54,300
So in some case we were talking what if a big rock fall on that guy's head?

639
00:59:54,300 --> 01:00:00,300
In this case, one of them really did. I mean, I've served some of the number of them have passed away by now, but oh my God.

640
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:05,300
Yeah. Yeah. Happened in the 80s. So like I mean, so they had already this had already been built.

641
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:11,300
But I was I was shocked by that. That is insane. Yeah. It was like a burglar.

642
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:18,300
Yeah, it was a burglar. It didn't seem to have any like rhyme or reason or anything. Oh, no.

643
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:25,300
So yes. But again, a big old house with a family graveyard next to it.

644
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:31,300
Another thing we traditionally think of like imagining a haunted house, a graveyard by it.

645
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:38,300
But in the 19th century, how big old houses had family graveyards by it.

646
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:47,300
But it wasn't necessarily like seen as spooky at the time. I was reading a little bit about this.

647
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:56,300
Let's see. This was from I think Doom Buggies was citing a book going to the cemetery was a favorite outing,

648
01:00:56,300 --> 01:01:02,300
one in which duty was mingled with pleasurable and sensuous melancholy is in.

649
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:07,300
I forget what book this is from. The Doom Bunkies cites a lot.

650
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:12,300
So but back in the 19th century, you have to think about like the world is speeding up, right?

651
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:17,300
Like technology is changing so rapidly and everything.

652
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:22,300
But antibiotics aren't coming for a while. So everyone is dying all the time.

653
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:27,300
Like populations are increasing. The Industrial Revolution has begun to happen.

654
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:32,300
Like so it's a real fucking shit show. Western expansion.

655
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:37,300
People like leaving to move somewhere and just never coming back or never hearing from them again.

656
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:44,300
So people dealing with death is part of daily life a lot more, I feel like back in that era.

657
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:49,300
What's this? What does all this stem from? Just the family graveyard.

658
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:53,300
Like people would pick that family graveyard.

659
01:01:53,300 --> 01:02:00,300
And there's also the 19th century saw the rise of spiritualism of people being obsessed with like,

660
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:05,300
can we communicate with the spirit world? The dead smarter than the living.

661
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:09,300
They're more wise, more powerful than the can we try to communicate with them?

662
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:17,300
We also saw Houdini at the time debunking insane like spirit mediums who were con artists, psychics and frauds.

663
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:22,300
He said supposedly he had a word that he told his wife when he died.

664
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:27,300
He said you go to all the psychics and they should be able to contact me.

665
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:32,300
It was their favorite song. I saw it was like the Roosevelt or something.

666
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:37,300
And he said you're going to go to all of them and they're going to do supposedly if they're doing a seance they can contact me

667
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:42,300
and they'll be able to tell you what we know together. And none of them could do it.

668
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:43,300
None of them could do it.

669
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:45,300
He was an advocate for debunking all of that.

670
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:53,300
He was debunked all of it. But after he died, his wife held a seance for 10 years after his death.

671
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:59,300
And at the end of the last one said 10 years is long enough to wait for any man and extinguished the candle.

672
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:03,300
She kept burning and they were on the roof of the Knickerbocker Hotel.

673
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:08,300
And at the moment that happened, a thunderstorm broke out in Los Angeles.

674
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:16,300
Every woman in the old days was like Tallulah Bankhead just like has a great quippy line.

675
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:18,300
Like it's just like a very perfect.

676
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:19,300
Sure.

677
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:21,300
I don't know why I picked her. I like her.

678
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:24,300
Mrs. Houdini, I'm assuming a bit of a for around it.

679
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:27,300
You know, I don't know what her occupation was.

680
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:29,300
I'm sure she picked up some of the showmanship.

681
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:32,300
Of course. Anyway.

682
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:36,300
So yeah, this is to get us back to. Yes, the graveyard.

683
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:43,300
This was one of the threads I started to follow and that they would have been when designing the mansion, like when we need a family graveyard.

684
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:46,300
This old house is spooky. The family graveyard is spooky.

685
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:51,300
Even though back then people would be having a swinging wake at the family graveyard.

686
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:55,300
Oh, that it's not so bizarre. If you had a family graveyard now would be really insane.

687
01:03:55,300 --> 01:04:00,300
But yeah, it makes us spookify it more than they may have.

688
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:02,300
Sure. In the time the house would have been built.

689
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:07,300
All right. And then is this tell me if I'm not going the right order.

690
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:11,300
The pet cemetery. Yeah. That was added later.

691
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:17,300
This was not original. It seemed like it was kind of off the beaten path and then they moved it to a more central spot.

692
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:19,300
Yeah, it was around like the side.

693
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:22,300
Initially on the side like what? Like, no, I don't know.

694
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:26,300
I think it was just like a little fun thing that there was a secret. Yeah.

695
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:32,300
And then they sort of moved it more where you can see now all the animals and stuff.

696
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:37,300
It was created in the early 1980s. Kim Irvine.

697
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:45,300
Yeah. And mostly like store bought statues, store bought animal statues that they then made the custom made the headstones for.

698
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:49,300
OK. Well, I always this is so dumb of me to not think about this,

699
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:53,300
but it's so funny when you hear like Imagineers and that person I was mentioning, Tanya Norris,

700
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:59,300
who like went to New Orleans with Walt to like figure out decorations for New Orleans Square and Haunted Mansion.

701
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:04,300
It's like they're just going into shops, New Orleans and buying lamps and buying in my brain.

702
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:08,300
It's like all of it's invented. They fabricated everything from scratch.

703
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:11,300
Right. Whereas why? It doesn't make any sense.

704
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:17,300
And like on Expedition Everest, Joe Rodey is going to like bazaars and marketplaces

705
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:22,300
and buying all of this different stuff to populate the queue with to make it feel authentic.

706
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:27,300
It's like I think in my non thinking brain, I was like, well, they're all made in house.

707
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:31,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Imagineers with like what sense would that make?

708
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:39,300
Yeah. I mean, that like any TV or movies, like if you meet set decorators or wardrobe people like I think as a kid,

709
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:42,300
I always thought like, well, this is from a big building at Warner Brothers.

710
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:46,300
And that's like half true. Like half the wardrobe is rented from the studios

711
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:51,300
and the other half is just wardrobe people buying shit at Marshalls and thrift stores.

712
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:56,300
Like we got to have like 20 options a person like just to.

713
01:05:56,300 --> 01:06:02,300
So for someone to look at for 30 seconds or less and go like, not that one, that one.

714
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:04,300
And then it's like, get them to set. We need to get this done.

715
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:06,300
All that thought just get you.

716
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:09,300
There's a hundred people on the clock right now that we need to get out of here.

717
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:13,300
There are a lot of unsung heroes on movie and TV sets and whatever.

718
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:16,300
But the costume department, I'm always impressed.

719
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:24,300
Like just like somebody walking in with like 15 different coats, just holding 15 different coats and an assistant trying to help.

720
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:30,300
And there's just like racks and racks of clothes, only which like five percent will be used or less.

721
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:36,300
Yeah. So they have enough to like like satiate the insane directors appetite to see choices.

722
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:38,300
Let's get you a watch or a tie clip.

723
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:43,300
And they're just pulling these boxes out of stuff and Greek like fixing it so it fits you.

724
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:51,300
I wear a lot of my own clothes sometimes for shoots because I have the weirdest sizes, the weirdest proportions.

725
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:54,300
Yeah. Yeah. To find bizarre things and have them be the right size.

726
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:58,300
Yeah. All right. Where are we?

727
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:01,300
We're at the cemetery. We're getting close to the door.

728
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:04,300
We're getting close. We're getting close.

729
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:09,300
I have to say, one of the funny things I found when I was trying to find out about the cemetery.

730
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:14,300
So like there's like 13 Imagineer headstones now.

731
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:15,300
And there's the vault.

732
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:21,300
There's like a call of the mall, the vault kind of thing that we took pictures in front of that one day.

733
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:23,300
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Which I'm trying to find those photos.

734
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:26,300
I was trying to post those photos of you, me and Aaron. Oh, I have them.

735
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:27,300
Oh, you do. OK. Good.

736
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:33,300
Because there's photos of us in front of the area that you're not supposed to walk because the photographer let us go down there in that little area.

737
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:46,300
Yeah. So what was I going to say? Oh, I found a blog where someone had it tracked the graveyard changes and we're not happy.

738
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:51,300
They were not happy about the Disneyland, the new Imagineer headstones.

739
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:54,300
They were definitely not happy about the interactive queue in Florida.

740
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:59,300
The title of that blog post was just called Decadence.

741
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:08,300
So I was like as I'm like diving through all this stuff, trying to write stuff down, I'm like, OK, maybe I found my line.

742
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:14,300
Yeah. Yeah. As you're digging, there still is a way you could be that you're not willing to be.

743
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:21,300
Yeah. I. Jesus. Yeah. I'm just look, there's a lot we could do.

744
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:25,300
I really want to talk about the stretching room. I think we would be sure.

745
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:30,300
I think we would be out of our minds if we didn't get to the stretching room and say in this.

746
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:33,300
It feels like we're going to get there. I can't guarantee it.

747
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:39,300
We have a foyer to talk about. We have the door and the porch.

748
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:42,300
There's more porch. Let's go then.

749
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:46,300
Wrap around poor. I mean, the queue is like just switchbacks in California.

750
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:49,300
Like that is the one thing it's like kind of claustrophobic.

751
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:55,300
Hold on. Hold on. We have time. We have time. I agree that the queue in Florida is a little bit more of mystery.

752
01:08:55,300 --> 01:09:01,300
And then this kind of switchback is a little bit like I do kind of find that a little boring.

753
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:04,300
Yeah. Especially if it like kind of backs up for a little too long.

754
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:11,300
You're just standing there. I always like pirates always feels a little more fun just because there's a like a scenery change and on the queue.

755
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:15,300
Usually, although also that's a quick, but you are limited by space like the berm is right there.

756
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:21,300
The edge of the part of the train tracks are right. Right. There's not a lot of room there to like theme it a little bit more.

757
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:25,300
But yeah, you're just kind of on top of each other. But that's obviously a minor gripe.

758
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:28,300
I'm always I will say is always and I've seen they do this at like events.

759
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:33,300
Sometimes I always want to go up stairs. I always want to be up there.

760
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:40,300
I want like give us a bar up there. Pretty small. Small bar. It would be a very small bar.

761
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:46,300
But that walkway, I mean, it was thrilling to be on the second level with Club 33. Yeah, for sure.

762
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:51,300
But that's always I'm always looking up there and like, come on, can they like build out behind?

763
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:56,300
Can they just build a extra section? I think you had a tunnel.

764
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:59,300
Yeah, you're probably right. You had a large stowed train tunnel.

765
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:05,300
There's got to be a way. There's got to be something up there to hang out.

766
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:10,300
So but I I Scott, I'm going to say I think we will get a stretching room.

767
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:16,300
And I did not make a lot of notes about the stretch group because I'm notes about the stretch.

768
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:21,300
Like the thing you didn't think we know. Well, I know a lot of it off the top.

769
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:25,300
Oh, I had and I had notes from last year where I was very ambitious trying to cover the whole.

770
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:29,300
Yeah, my notes are like through half the ride. But these notes will stay.

771
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:32,300
They'll gather dust till 2022. That's good.

772
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:36,300
I had to know I didn't make new. I should save me work this year.

773
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:40,300
But it's a very important fact about this Haunted Mansion.

774
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:43,300
It's the only one you enter through the front door of the house.

775
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:47,300
Sure. The others you enter through the servants quarters.

776
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:52,300
So this one, you see the house and you see right where you're going to go into.

777
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:56,300
And you enter a foyer foyer foyer.

778
01:10:56,300 --> 01:11:01,300
How are you saying? OK, for you, the foyer being my terminology is mixed up.

779
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:04,300
Foyer is we are inside. That's the room.

780
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:07,300
Yes, we're inside. We're inside.

781
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:09,300
We're staying inside. Oh, no.

782
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:14,300
So that is the room before the stretch and grill.

783
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:17,300
Yes. Yes. All right.

784
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:19,300
Many American homes have a foyer.

785
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:22,300
Some have what is known as a general foyer.

786
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:26,300
People need to know what a foyer is to get context for this section of the podcast.

787
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:31,300
Only on a man you enter through the front door, the others you enter through the side servants quarters.

788
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:36,300
So the foyer, does someone have the narration?

789
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:38,300
Yeah, I don't know. You can do it.

790
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:46,300
I have it somewhere. But yeah, when hinges creep in doorless chambers and just creep.

791
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:48,300
You're like reading it all cool.

792
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:50,300
Isn't it? I read that is it?

793
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:53,300
Is creep is a creeper creek? I don't know.

794
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:55,300
I don't know. I could be wrong.

795
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:57,300
No, just read the thing. What do you read?

796
01:11:57,300 --> 01:12:02,300
You got a list chambers and strange and frightening sounds echo through the halls.

797
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:15,300
Whenever candle lights flicker, when the air is deathly still, that is the time when ghosts are present, practicing their terror with ghoulish delight.

798
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:17,300
Great. Very good. Thank you.

799
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:22,300
I want to make sure is now the time with that being said, OK, we didn't really talk.

800
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:26,300
Let's talk about the fucking ghost host. Yes, the man.

801
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:31,300
Perhaps the greatest performance in a Disney park. Yeah.

802
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:33,300
What else could beat this?

803
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:37,300
That's tough to beat. Obviously, there's single bears in the country, bears that are up there.

804
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:45,300
But as far as iconic, long lasting performances where people know it, more people all know it.

805
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:52,300
And it is Mr. Paul Fries, one of the great voice actors of that era.

806
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:55,300
Also Ludwig von Drake, also Boris and Rocky and Bullwinkle.

807
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:57,300
He narrated the original great moments of Mr. Lincoln.

808
01:12:57,300 --> 01:13:01,300
I think he's back on it now. He's one of the Beatles on the Beatles cartoon.

809
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:03,300
That's right. From the 60s. I forget which Beatles.

810
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:07,300
Really? Yeah. Yeah. Wow. He's done a ton of stuff.

811
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:11,300
He's the Pillsbury Doughboy. Yeah. He's so many things.

812
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:22,300
And truly what you just read, Jason, when you hear that paired with the music, with the first strains of Grim Grin and Ghosts, the minimal organ.

813
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:30,300
I just think that music and that voice, that is the best little and you like just the best combo of music and performance.

814
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:34,300
And you can hear it. I was just pulled it up, pulled it up on Spotify on the way here.

815
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:39,300
And it transports you there. There's other bits of theme park music you could hear that don't have that same effect.

816
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:47,300
But just like it's like it teleports you. It's such a weird feeling of dread and excitement.

817
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:53,300
Yeah, it is. I don't know. Yeah. There's no more perfect marriage of that anywhere in the parks.

818
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:59,300
I mean, there's great. I mean, there's obviously pirates. Part of pirates is perfect. But like that one.

819
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:03,300
Yeah, probably the top. Oh, Paul Friese. Also Dead Men Telling No Tales.

820
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:09,300
Dead Men. Oh, sure. I think I was not clear on that. Exatencio, I think, is the voice of the skull.

821
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:12,300
But the dead, the droning Dead Men Telling No Tales. I didn't know it's all today.

822
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:18,300
So like, yeah, in the two iconic classic from the 60s, perennial attractions, it's both of these.

823
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:24,300
I think he's the auctioneer as well. Yes, he was the auctioneer. They replaced him.

824
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:30,300
All got replaced, which is a bummer. Not the thing that changed. They replaced his voice.

825
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:40,300
I cannot talk about Paul Friese without mentioning that playing this little clip, his most iconic villain, certainly the the ghost host.

826
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:46,300
But if he's a villain, he's pretty friendly, honestly. But very similar voice. Here's this.

827
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:55,300
Let me play this clip. If I am destroyed, so shall you be.

828
01:14:55,300 --> 01:15:02,300
That is the voice of Carr, K.A.R.R., the evil Kit from Knight Rider.

829
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:10,300
He was an alternate villain version of Kit. He's the opposite of William Daniels.

830
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:17,300
This is I've talked a lot about Baywatch. I am a Hasselhoff completist. I am also a giant fan of Knight Rider.

831
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:23,300
The evil character Carr appears twice. One time it is Paul Friese and the other it is not.

832
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:31,300
It is so much worse when it's not Paul Friese. And with it, you can tell within Knight Rider fandom online, a great area to poke around.

833
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:39,300
Of course. People love Carr, Carr, and which I do too. K.A.R.R. That rules.

834
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:47,300
So the first time I saw that, like, oh, my God, the ghost host is on Knight Rider. This fucking rules. That's wild.

835
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:52,300
I'm trying to find the Beatles. Which Beatle he did. Oh, yeah. Well, there's these great videos where it's all the voices.

836
01:15:52,300 --> 01:16:01,300
And then the video of the raw audio of him recording all of these parts. Oh, my God.

837
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:09,300
It is a two part video on YouTube. Just phenomenal to listen to. Like 15 minutes of raw audio.

838
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:14,300
Watching this guy nail this performance that is now so iconic.

839
01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:25,300
And also just hearing like it's so amazing to hear him do these things that we can all narrate perfectly with the exact timing and then hear him go like, that was it?

840
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:33,300
Another one. Like, I hear him just do a sides. And then he does a version like he's Peter Lorre. Oh, right.

841
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:40,300
He does it a total different way. Like you see, they're trying this stuff too. God, they have this whole alternate version. Yeah.

842
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:47,300
When he did like, which exactly like, do we want to be more monster with it or do we just want it to be this sort of looming?

843
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:51,300
He was George Harrison and John Lennon on the Beatles cartoon. Wow. That's crazy.

844
01:16:51,300 --> 01:17:00,300
He Beatles. There is a full Paul Fries episode in our future. Oh, for sure. Which we could do all the imaginaries for.

845
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:04,300
But let me let me voice other wasn't all of them.

846
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:11,300
Yeah, just a little taste and please just look up this video of Paul Fries voice recordings. But hang on.

847
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:17,300
And it is this cadaverous Pella betrays pastoral fine.

848
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:21,300
Rudi first heavy neck at all.

849
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:27,300
Take two from welcome foolish models. I may as well give you another one, right?

850
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:36,300
All right. You're in backwards all of a sudden. Like, what's that about? Yeah. He also says some very offensive things, but this is the 16th. Oh, yeah.

851
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:43,300
Sure. There's a clip I was like, oh, I got to play this. And then an offensive thing is said and I did not want to play it or talk about it.

852
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:46,300
You can explore it yourself. However, the rest of the thing is so cool.

853
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:56,300
And it gives me the same little shades of like when you're hearing raw takes of Brian Wilson make working on pet sounds like or I just always love like old the guys like having to condense like,

854
01:17:56,300 --> 01:18:01,300
oh, you were three seconds over here in the like, you know, just very workman like engineer dudes like, I don't know.

855
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:07,300
And the fact that they had this also perfectly timed out that like that they're that they had the timing ready to get.

856
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:11,300
They knew that the ride mechanism enough to know like that's going to be too long. Yeah, right.

857
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:23,300
It does like it does seem like you would be especially back then when it was like this stuff is still not a science completely, but especially back then you'd think it would have been like, well, we have two weeks solid worth of takes.

858
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:27,300
And we're just going to figure this out where it does seem like you're doing there. Like they know.

859
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:34,300
And maybe in the lack of any non digital time, tape is more precious and recording studio time is more precious.

860
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:43,300
So they really did have to like nail it precisely. I mean, I guess like show wise, like you're writing and you're like, well, people are going to be in the room for two minutes and like you can ballpark it, I guess.

861
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:49,300
Yeah, yeah. He was also. I was going to say he's also the thing on the 1960s Fantastic Four cartoon.

862
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:56,300
Oh, yeah. The one with Herbie. Herbie the robot. I think Herbie is in that version, I believe. I think it is.

863
01:18:56,300 --> 01:19:05,300
This was the cartoon where Marvel replaced the human torch with a robot named Herbie because they didn't want kids to try to light themselves on fire.

864
01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:09,300
No, wait, this is different. This is different. The human torch was in this version.

865
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:22,300
OK, Herbie is a later version. Yeah. Yeah. So just also when you hear this radio, hearing like the difference between like what was a pretty good take and what's an iconic take and you hear a guy just like, that's pretty good.

866
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:26,300
Just do it once more. You know, to be a little more whispery with it, you know, definitely, definitely still.

867
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:35,300
And then he does it. And then you hear hearing like a B plus version and hearing the A plus iconic one little note from some stiff shirt and a white colored shirt.

868
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:40,300
Yeah. Gives him like and now that is iconic and is heard around the world for 50 years.

869
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:47,300
And and you hear takes where like he does it, you know, it's wall to wall creeps.

870
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:53,300
And that's not nearly the same as wall to wall creeps. Yeah. Little choices.

871
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:59,300
It's just that's why I'm obsessed with this. This performance. Every little where he just finds weird little bends.

872
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:05,300
And it's so iconic. And you love the Knight Rider remake from 2008 to. Oh, of course. Yeah. Sure.

873
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:13,300
With I was that was I remember gladiators 2008 and I wrote two thousand and they all they all they nailed it.

874
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:24,300
My first job gladiators 2008. And I remember at the rap party or like the big premiere party, the live broadcast of the premiere just rolled from gladiators right into Knight Rider.

875
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:29,300
And I thought those were the same. That was their big white hope after the writer strike was Knight Rider.

876
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:35,300
And white hope crashed, crashed and burned. That was the one where it was supposed to be Will Arnett.

877
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:40,300
But he had done it was associated with associated with another car or whatever that was.

878
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:45,300
And then it became Val Kilmer. Is that right? So and but no car. I don't believe a car.

879
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:50,300
I don't think they had a car. So so by that I mean K.A.R. Oh, right. Oh, they did not. There was a car.

880
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:55,300
But not a K.A.R. Sure. And Michael Knight showed up in one episode. Hasselhoff himself showed up in one.

881
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:58,300
Palfrey's a guy I feel like there's a lot.

882
01:20:58,300 --> 01:21:04,300
Not that voice actors, voice actors, I don't think even get that much as much recognition as they deserve in general.

883
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:10,300
But it's like a name I feel like doesn't get said even like you're obviously your Mel Blanks is the top of it.

884
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:14,300
But like Mel Blanker, think of the time he was maybe because he was on air a little more too.

885
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:21,300
Yeah, but I feel like I'm like lasting wise. Sure. You know, you hear June Foret's name and these are all people that deserve a lot of credit.

886
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:25,300
She was rocky on Rocky and Bullwinkle and she did a lot of voices.

887
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:30,300
But I feel like for yeah, for the Haunted Mansion narration, more people probably heard that.

888
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:35,300
Like if you go to the amount of people that have had a feeling because of this man's voice.

889
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:39,300
You know what I mean? Like like how many people actually he is. Yeah.

890
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:44,300
And I think maybe that is a good moment to say this.

891
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:51,300
The reading along with the narration. Oh, shut the hell. No, the hard stance.

892
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:57,300
I'm making an assumption here. Yeah, I'm going to say the podcast, the right stance is shut the fuck up.

893
01:21:57,300 --> 01:22:02,300
Don't read along with the thing. Let's listen to Palfreys. What are you doing?

894
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:07,300
Why does everyone do this? What are you a hardliner like that or no? I hate it.

895
01:22:07,300 --> 01:22:10,300
I think people have gotten better at it. I think so too.

896
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:14,300
It was really out of control in the more ironic 90s.

897
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:18,300
And I think now people are more willing to just enjoy it and be part of it.

898
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:25,300
And I, you know, it just to me, that's like this weird like trying to take control of it.

899
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:29,300
It was like, yes, like bratty people going like I've outsmarted this.

900
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:34,300
I know what it is. I'm cooler than it. And you're not. It's the best. Shut up.

901
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:41,300
Yeah, I guess I think so. I mean, there's two things, two reasons I say I don't like it.

902
01:22:41,300 --> 01:22:47,300
Number one, I want to sit there and I would like to I've been on this a lot.

903
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:54,300
I've gone on this a lot, but I would like to sit there, stand there quietly and try to feel.

904
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:58,300
I want to feel it. I want to enjoy it. I want to feel it the way.

905
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:04,300
And then number two, there's people that haven't been on this before.

906
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:11,300
Now, Southern California, a lot of us have probably half the room has been on it or more, maybe more.

907
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:15,300
Yeah, it might be 75 percent. Who knows? But people that are on it for the first time,

908
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:18,300
maybe they're coming to a theme park for the first time.

909
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:28,300
Why would you want to have your voice talk over this perfect narration and change the experience

910
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:32,300
for people that might be going on at the first time and blown away by how cool it is?

911
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:35,300
Because you're selfish, because you want it to be about you.

912
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:39,300
I think it's like singing louder than the musician at the concert.

913
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:42,300
It's like, let's I don't like this guy having a spotlight.

914
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:45,300
Put the spotlight on me. I say no.

915
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:49,300
The concert's different because singing along and singing like it is a line.

916
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:56,300
There's a line at a concert between really enjoying into it versus this about me.

917
01:23:56,300 --> 01:24:02,300
I mean, it's pornography. You know when you see it at the concert, you go, that guy's too much.

918
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:05,300
But in your case, it's seeing a woman's knees.

919
01:24:05,300 --> 01:24:09,300
Well, that is pornography. Yes, too much.

920
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:10,300
But movies and plays.

921
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:12,300
I cannot be tempted by a lower leg.

922
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:19,300
If you're in a dark theater, if you're watching a movie or watching a play, no, I think the same thing as this.

923
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:23,300
It's it's you are the audience. You be a polite audience member.

924
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:27,300
I want to sit there perfectly still and perfectly quiet.

925
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:29,300
And I want to take it all in.

926
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:31,300
I'm and I'm going to only say this a tad.

927
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:37,300
I am a tad more lenient on the blackout scream a tad.

928
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:39,300
I still prefer no scream.

929
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:42,300
I'm relieved when there isn't a big group scream.

930
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:50,300
I am, too. But OK, that actually maybe you could argue adds a little something, but also is a little too showy for me.

931
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:55,300
They might be like seeking it by having that scream in there.

932
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:59,300
It's like all the voices going, the bean bunnies up there.

933
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:02,300
Like they may be sort of they want you to scream.

934
01:25:02,300 --> 01:25:06,300
But then there's also the people who get on and like I'm going to shatter eardrums with my scream.

935
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:11,300
Yes, that I don't care for because that just feels so performative.

936
01:25:11,300 --> 01:25:19,300
And you're not trying to help anything other than just be like, let's see how loud and let's see if I can like make a spectacle of my voice.

937
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:26,300
Well, when it's adults like when it's like teens or tweens, like I'm like, oh, you don't have empathy.

938
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:29,300
Your brain is still growing. I can forgive it a little.

939
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:36,300
When it's like some dipshit like 30 year old Orange County dude, it's like you you have been on this before.

940
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:39,300
You've done this a million times. Why are you chanting along?

941
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:50,300
You weird man. I not like us. Not like there's nothing weird about the way we like weird men and yelling on a podcast on a free Sunday they have to everybody shut up.

942
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:53,300
Yeah, I mean, this is a crank. I wonder what the prevailing wisdom.

943
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:56,300
I wonder if we've just lost like a third of our audience.

944
01:25:56,300 --> 01:25:59,300
We like chanting along. I wonder what the consensus is.

945
01:25:59,300 --> 01:26:06,300
I feel like I get the least of I feel like I have a sense of the Facebook group and I think we're going to get a lot of support on that.

946
01:26:06,300 --> 01:26:07,300
I would think so.

947
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:09,300
Hopefully on Melissa's cheek.

948
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:18,300
And I get it that there's some fun stuff that you want to since you go a lot to the parks, there's fun stuff to participate in.

949
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:26,300
Like I mean, if you liked if your thing was singing, it's a small world in a tasteful manner. I find the songs playing. That's not my thing.

950
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:33,300
I'm just saying I sometimes I find myself if I'm on pirates as we're going down, I'll just be like dead men telling the tales though.

951
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:35,300
And this is for a Pirates episode.

952
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:43,300
Don't talk in the boat when you're before you have the waterfall that I've done it probably once or twice of my hundred times.

953
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:48,300
I've been on it, but there are people full on conversations when you're going into the into the dark area.

954
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:50,300
Consider that the pre show. It's like checking your phone during the trailers.

955
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:52,300
Yeah, but it's so mood setting.

956
01:26:52,300 --> 01:27:03,300
I told some people to be quiet once because they were fucking hammered and my family was visiting and then someone went to the bathroom afterwards and they these drunks were complaining that I told.

957
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:08,300
Can you believe that guy told us to be quiet like in the like quietest part of the ride?

958
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:10,300
I would love to have seen that happen.

959
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:15,300
Boy, I would not do that. I don't think unless it was like total truly like out of control.

960
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:20,300
But there's mood mood mood that that place sets a mood.

961
01:27:20,300 --> 01:27:27,300
The Haunted Mansion surely sets the mood and it's like let's all let's all be present.

962
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:32,300
I think there are conversation rides. I think on the train you can talk on the people mover.

963
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:34,300
You can talk. Sure. Yeah.

964
01:27:34,300 --> 01:27:40,300
You look as long as you're not shouting on the ride the Haunted Mansion and also when we're walking in the hall, talk at a normal volume.

965
01:27:40,300 --> 01:27:45,300
That's fine. I'm not saying like we have to be portraits.

966
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:48,300
Right. I'm just saying there's plenty of times when I'm not we're not being insane.

967
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:51,300
It's just when that that specific thing happens and people talk.

968
01:27:51,300 --> 01:28:00,300
And again, I have noticed it's gone way down because I think it's bothered the employees and they start they've started saying don't talk.

969
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:02,300
Yes, in character. Yes.

970
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:08,300
They will say also I should say if you are a child and you are scared by all means, do what you have to do.

971
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:17,300
Like do if you are a scared child, you are freaking out because you are scared by the ghosts and the hanging skeleton.

972
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:19,300
Please. Yes. Go nuts.

973
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:23,300
I do not judge a child. I would love to see you shout a child down for it.

974
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:25,300
I'm saying I would never do that.

975
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:27,300
I don't know. But what if he was a loud child?

976
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:29,300
What if he was hammered? You know what I do?

977
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:35,300
I just hang back at the loading. I just slow my walk and I let them I let a bunch of cars.

978
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:41,300
I let them go first, get a bunch of cars in between, solve the problem without any conflict.

979
01:28:41,300 --> 01:28:49,300
Here's what I'll say. If you want, I will approve if say you're like Disneyland is very empty and maybe you're in there with just like a group of your friends.

980
01:28:49,300 --> 01:28:52,300
This happened maybe once or twice.

981
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:56,300
Have a little fun there. There's not a lot of other folks there.

982
01:28:56,300 --> 01:29:07,300
That's a unique situation, obviously. And I think like if it was a group of maybe like six or seven of us and one of us had a killer idea for a bit or a joke, go for it.

983
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:11,300
That's fun. I'm just saying that when it's packed in there, there's no reason.

984
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:16,300
That's the show. Enjoy the show. Yeah, we're not the show.

985
01:29:16,300 --> 01:29:19,300
And that's the podcast, the right. That's our truth.

986
01:29:19,300 --> 01:29:22,300
Hot take about that situation.

987
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:26,300
That being said, the stretching room, the stretching room.

988
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:29,300
Well, can we go back? There was going to be they toyed.

989
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:34,300
Apparently, did you see this with the ghost host in the foyer having a talking like bust?

990
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:37,300
Oh, wow. It was not going to just be a narration.

991
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:40,300
There was going to be a little figure. Really? Oh, that's it.

992
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:43,300
I would like have moved its mouth with Paul Freese's narration.

993
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:52,300
Well, and I guess there's that thing as well is like, what is the ghost host? Because some people think it's the bird. It's the raven.

994
01:29:52,300 --> 01:29:55,300
Yes, it is. I guess it's the body that's hanging.

995
01:29:55,300 --> 01:30:00,300
You know, it's my. Yeah, that's him. That I think has been so that that was there.

996
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:05,300
Like, we don't like to call that hanging man Master Gracie because he didn't commit suicide.

997
01:30:05,300 --> 01:30:11,300
He was murdered. But we can assume. Yes. As the ghost host tell us his way out.

998
01:30:11,300 --> 01:30:15,300
Yeah. So but what is he to any of this is the question.

999
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:19,300
Does it matter? Oh, just a ghost who's around. Yeah.

1000
01:30:19,300 --> 01:30:22,300
Well, the ghost host is a shoot. Am I wrong?

1001
01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:28,300
Am I wrong? But the ghost host supposedly is the one playing the piano in the attic.

1002
01:30:28,300 --> 01:30:31,300
Oh, I think I caught that. That's that's right. Right.

1003
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:33,300
The shadow playing the shadow. Right. Yes.

1004
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:39,300
It's like you remember that effect in the in the when the piano is being played, which is very similar to the fact that we're at the party.

1005
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:43,300
No, no, it's in the attic. I believe I'll double check this right now.

1006
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:46,300
I've seen this as well. OK, so that makes me feel better about that information.

1007
01:30:46,300 --> 01:31:00,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK. I think the kind of like rumors and urban legends and stuff is so correct is so diegetic to this ride because that's what happens with haunted houses or abandoned houses like, oh, did you hear that?

1008
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:03,300
Well, you know, it really happened there. It all makes sense.

1009
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:09,300
It just adds to the legend that you are right. Yeah, it's like a real murder house. We're like, oh, yeah, I think it's this.

1010
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:13,300
No, the husband did this. No, no, this guy. Crazy guy came in. Yeah, it's like it is an urban.

1011
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:17,300
And I think like leaving it a little open to interpretation adds some joy.

1012
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:22,300
I feel like everything is like, you know, double checked, tees crossed, eyes dotted.

1013
01:31:22,300 --> 01:31:30,300
Nowadays, there's like mythology really if it was made nowadays, they'd be like, OK, well, let's write out all nine hundred and ninety nine ghosts.

1014
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:35,300
Let's figure out how they all got there. And it's like, fuck off. No, it's a house full of ghosts.

1015
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:39,300
I know. I prefer this to it. I'm making up mythology as you go.

1016
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:44,300
Let's talk about the portraits. We got a yes. We got a girl on a tightrope.

1017
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:52,300
And as we go downward, we see that there is an alligator. And these are guests. Is that that's right? Am I wrong?

1018
01:31:52,300 --> 01:32:00,300
They're people who stayed at the mansion in various times are some of our guests in their more corruptible. These are some of our guests.

1019
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:06,300
So I see. Oh, that's a line in there. Yeah. Yeah. So this is like sort of a warning, essentially to us.

1020
01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:12,300
Yeah, because I was a little bit even though that's in the narration, I was a little ironic thing beneath us.

1021
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:17,300
Yes. We don't know about or but we're all also like all of these people.

1022
01:32:17,300 --> 01:32:26,300
Well, all of these people, except for the woman on the gravestone, are going to die. Right? Yeah.

1023
01:32:26,300 --> 01:32:32,300
Because I've always did. I always see. I feel like that one is revealing like she killed the husband. You're right.

1024
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:37,300
Yeah, like they all all of the stretching portraits add information.

1025
01:32:37,300 --> 01:32:41,300
And yeah, and that yeah, I guess in some cases they're going to die and they don't know it.

1026
01:32:41,300 --> 01:32:50,300
In other cases, though, this person is a murder. Right. So this is supposed to like be a kooky way to scare us and not the originals.

1027
01:32:50,300 --> 01:32:56,300
What we look at now are not the original paintings. These have been updated over the years and kind of have gotten more lifelike.

1028
01:32:56,300 --> 01:32:59,300
But they're the same idea. Same idea. Yeah. Yeah.

1029
01:32:59,300 --> 01:33:03,300
But they're not the original. I believe are the paintings that Raleigh Crump drew originally.

1030
01:33:03,300 --> 01:33:09,300
And Mark Davis said, no, that's no good. I'll redraw them. Whoa. Wow. Other people have redone them since.

1031
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:12,300
Well, they got that sense of humor. And then Mark Davis. They're the Mark Davis thing.

1032
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:17,300
It is funny because like they thought we've talked about this in the last episode last year.

1033
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:23,300
It's Claude Coats versus Mark Davis. Claude Coats wanted it to be creepy, a little more traditionally like a haunted house.

1034
01:33:23,300 --> 01:33:32,300
Mark Davis, very whimsical characters, big, fun, silly things. And kind of their backgrounds. Claude Coats, a background painter. Yes. Yes.

1035
01:33:32,300 --> 01:33:39,300
Mark Davis, yeah, as you said, character designer. Yeah. But yeah, early on we have a big dose of character and silly.

1036
01:33:39,300 --> 01:33:44,300
Yes. And it's like the first half of the halfish, maybe more of the mansion is more Claude Coats.

1037
01:33:44,300 --> 01:33:54,300
But you get a little of your Mark Davis in this room. Yeah. Yeah. That's the most I'm trying to think with the next Mark Davis thing is I'm sure he had plenty to do with everything.

1038
01:33:54,300 --> 01:34:00,300
But especially the graveyard at the end. But yeah, of course. Yes. But this is like the first silly thing.

1039
01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:08,300
But it's still in the tone of we're trying to scare you. Yeah. Well, almost a lot of them are like not funny when you look at it at first.

1040
01:34:08,300 --> 01:34:15,300
And then stretching reveals the fact that it's sort of in keeping with the theme of scary, but then surprisingly silly. Right.

1041
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:24,300
And of course, you know, and really, I think with silly, if you took out man with no pants on. Dynamite guy.

1042
01:34:24,300 --> 01:34:31,300
It would like if I'm looking at all four of them and if this was gone, it would look a lot less silly.

1043
01:34:31,300 --> 01:34:37,300
I think no pants man with boxer shorts on does read and make the whole thing sillier. Sure.

1044
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:44,300
It's still silly, but boxer shorts, striped boxer shorts. It's a comedy. Comedy move. Classic.

1045
01:34:44,300 --> 01:34:50,300
The vaudeville ass move. The name of that man. Do we know the name offhand? I don't know where I found this.

1046
01:34:50,300 --> 01:34:55,300
This is where I yeah, this starts to get interesting. Go ahead.

1047
01:34:55,300 --> 01:35:02,300
Well, the name of the guy stood. We reveal is standing on top of dynamite. His name is Alexander Nitra cough.

1048
01:35:02,300 --> 01:35:06,300
I did not know that. I don't know. Forget where I found that. I found it last year.

1049
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:13,300
But next time you go on there, tell your list. Whisper to your friend or loved one that there is Alexander Nitra cough.

1050
01:35:13,300 --> 01:35:17,300
And in very few, this will come up later, but not very many names.

1051
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:21,300
There's all these characters, but almost none of them have specific names.

1052
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:27,300
So that's actually a rare one. Not very many, but I think over the years they've been like giving back stories here.

1053
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:34,300
And there were like in additions. Oh, this addition references this character who we gave a background to that didn't have one before.

1054
01:35:34,300 --> 01:35:40,300
Right. Like a ride with the next is Constance Hatchaway. Oh, yeah.

1055
01:35:40,300 --> 01:35:45,300
And then there's like think that's right. Eleven different they sold. They were selling around the mansion time.

1056
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:50,300
They were selling eleven different like spirit jars. So they had eleven different characters.

1057
01:35:50,300 --> 01:35:57,300
So you had your hitchhiking ghosts and you had your hat box. But then like Constance Hatchaway and all these other way.

1058
01:35:57,300 --> 01:36:06,300
Now, that's where it starts to get like pins. They have sold pins of like the changing portrait that either said the ghost host or master.

1059
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:12,300
It said something that people had assumed over the years and imagineers were like, well, let it slide.

1060
01:36:12,300 --> 01:36:18,300
But we didn't approve that. So the myth, all people are inventing their own mythology.

1061
01:36:18,300 --> 01:36:24,300
Again, urban legends, rumors and stuff. Those three guys in the quicksand, they don't got names.

1062
01:36:24,300 --> 01:36:30,300
I didn't see we know the husband is George because we see his tombstone. Yeah.

1063
01:36:30,300 --> 01:36:37,300
Anyway, these are wonderful. I realize that these are sort of like it's it's the really what it is is an opposite direction.

1064
01:36:37,300 --> 01:36:44,300
Mad Foulding, where that's nice. And then this is sliding down and revealing info.

1065
01:36:44,300 --> 01:36:52,300
But right at the time, the peak of Mad Magazine, like very clever, great, really good comical illustration.

1066
01:36:52,300 --> 01:36:58,300
They're sort of like oddly similar, super detailed and great character design. Yeah.

1067
01:36:58,300 --> 01:37:09,300
The room itself, one of the early like pieces of trivia that's fun is how in Disneyland it the you know, the question is this haunted room actually straight?

1068
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:15,300
Wait, no, that doesn't answer the question. It's in Disneyland. You are going down. It's an elevator.

1069
01:37:15,300 --> 01:37:20,300
Yes, you are descending and the top of the top of the room stays where it is.

1070
01:37:20,300 --> 01:37:29,300
You're when you walk in the room, you're right next to the the hanging ghost host. You don't really. It's like right on top of you in Disney World.

1071
01:37:29,300 --> 01:37:33,300
They kept the effect and tell you they kept the effect, but it's the ceiling that goes.

1072
01:37:33,300 --> 01:37:41,300
Yes. And which that was all a mind blow to me as a kid and like we're having like guessing and seeing if you can tell.

1073
01:37:41,300 --> 01:37:48,300
And you know, you can tell because you feel yourself moving in Disneyland, but it's all to get you out and under the berm.

1074
01:37:48,300 --> 01:37:51,300
But it's cool that they recreated the same effect, but did it opposite.

1075
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:56,300
Yeah, because like so and I'm assuming I this I'm sure I'm assuming I'm right.

1076
01:37:56,300 --> 01:37:59,300
I remember I've talked about this in the show when I was in Pirates.

1077
01:37:59,300 --> 01:38:09,300
I truly up until a couple of years ago didn't realize that Pirates, the ride itself, the majority of it in Disneyland is sea level is the normal land.

1078
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:14,300
And when you enter, you're of course entering up on the second or whatever you'd maybe even third story.

1079
01:38:14,300 --> 01:38:23,300
I don't know what you call it necessarily. And then all of that is built up. New Orleans Square is built up on top of where the earth was when they started building.

1080
01:38:23,300 --> 01:38:26,300
I was like, oh, yeah, of course it is. They didn't dig in my brain.

1081
01:38:26,300 --> 01:38:29,300
I was like, they must have dug under and made this whole thing here.

1082
01:38:29,300 --> 01:38:32,300
This sort of impossible architecture dawned on me.

1083
01:38:32,300 --> 01:38:37,300
And I'm sure I learned this at some point, but it freaked me out this week when I saw the diagram.

1084
01:38:37,300 --> 01:38:43,300
This little purple box is the foyer and the stretching room.

1085
01:38:43,300 --> 01:38:50,300
This is all that exists in the facade. The facade you look at of the mansion is just the stretching room.

1086
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:53,300
It's like a tenth of the land.

1087
01:38:53,300 --> 01:39:01,300
I mean, not even not even a massive show building behind it that you never see from in front of the mansion.

1088
01:39:01,300 --> 01:39:09,300
It is all the ride is it is so odd that I don't I didn't think about that up until a few years ago.

1089
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:14,300
Also, yeah, I didn't really think about it. I knew it must, of course, be bigger somehow.

1090
01:39:14,300 --> 01:39:19,300
But how many people go in there and walk into this mansion and go like, oh, we're in this elevator.

1091
01:39:19,300 --> 01:39:23,300
OK. And never think about the fact that it has to it has to be that big.

1092
01:39:23,300 --> 01:39:26,300
But seeing yes, as you're saying, seeing it blows your mind.

1093
01:39:26,300 --> 01:39:29,300
You still are sort of picturing that you're going around different rooms of this house.

1094
01:39:29,300 --> 01:39:33,300
Yeah, like, OK, well, it's the basement of this house. We're in a basement now.

1095
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:41,300
Yeah. When, in fact, of course, I think just like pirates, I could be wrong. They just built the house up one story, essentially.

1096
01:39:41,300 --> 01:39:44,300
Right. Like they did with all the different parts of New Orleans Square.

1097
01:39:44,300 --> 01:39:48,300
And then you're just taking an elevator down to like normal level.

1098
01:39:48,300 --> 01:39:51,300
And there's a massive, unmarked show building behind it.

1099
01:39:51,300 --> 01:39:54,300
And it go away green. Oh, yeah.

1100
01:39:54,300 --> 01:39:59,300
Oh, the avoidable, the color. You don't really there was an even odder term for it online.

1101
01:39:59,300 --> 01:40:04,300
I forgot to write down. I was like, Tata, like there was some very weird.

1102
01:40:04,300 --> 01:40:07,300
I was like, that's never what I've heard it called.

1103
01:40:07,300 --> 01:40:11,300
There's another thing with this effect where you I saw it framed in some listicle.

1104
01:40:11,300 --> 01:40:15,300
Like when you're in that elevator, you're in a cage, essentially.

1105
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:19,300
The fact that you're in I don't know whether the line was first or the technology was first,

1106
01:40:19,300 --> 01:40:22,300
but that this room has no windows and no doors.

1107
01:40:22,300 --> 01:40:26,300
That partially comes from that you're stepping into this just like octagon.

1108
01:40:26,300 --> 01:40:31,300
I forget how many sides there are, but that you're like,

1109
01:40:31,300 --> 01:40:37,300
you know, extending a couple of feet above your head is this you're in this like brown space.

1110
01:40:37,300 --> 01:40:44,300
And that is if you weren't like completely swallowed by that, you'd be able to see the stretching of the walls better.

1111
01:40:44,300 --> 01:40:51,300
Like it's like hiding the the the descending essentially. Right.

1112
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:57,300
So yeah, like the with the no windows, no doors makes that effects work.

1113
01:40:57,300 --> 01:41:01,300
Yeah, it's all like slight. It's like that slight effect, like a miss magic misdirects.

1114
01:41:01,300 --> 01:41:08,300
Yeah. All of it working together to like disorient you a little bit and distract you a little bit to make it so you don't know.

1115
01:41:08,300 --> 01:41:11,300
You are in that thing going, how are we going to get out of here?

1116
01:41:11,300 --> 01:41:17,300
And that when the lights go out and the fact that it is all around you, you like lose sense of direction.

1117
01:41:17,300 --> 01:41:22,300
Yes. And you and you. So when a door does open and you have somewhere to go, you're like, wait, it's over there.

1118
01:41:22,300 --> 01:41:34,300
But I came in that way. Yeah, I think it took me like 50, maybe not 50, but like 30 to 50 times on the Disneyland Haunted Mansion before I even fully was like, OK, now I know where the doors are.

1119
01:41:34,300 --> 01:41:39,300
And because there's two different. Yes. I figured that out this year.

1120
01:41:39,300 --> 01:41:45,300
I know it crazy because I'm sure I've been in both of them. But like it took me so many times doing it to go, OK, great.

1121
01:41:45,300 --> 01:41:49,300
These two doors both open. They are two separate elevators.

1122
01:41:49,300 --> 01:41:56,300
And I know which one, depending on I go in and I know where the door will open up and I know that I always rush to the back.

1123
01:41:56,300 --> 01:42:03,300
Like if I go in the left one or the or the right one, I know which way to go now to like get into the line faster. Yes.

1124
01:42:03,300 --> 01:42:08,300
But it took forever. Yeah. But I was still disoriented by the trick.

1125
01:42:08,300 --> 01:42:16,300
They're saying don't touch the walls. It's because they don't want people to happen to lean on the wall that's about to slide open and eat shit.

1126
01:42:16,300 --> 01:42:21,300
Oh, that's why they say go to the dead center of the dead center. Right. Right. Right.

1127
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:27,300
Yeah, because I always thought it was like something like the wall was moving when I was like, no, no, it can't because that section is all fixed.

1128
01:42:27,300 --> 01:42:31,300
The section by the wall is not actually moving. It's that part is going down with us.

1129
01:42:31,300 --> 01:42:39,300
It's what you're saying. It's that there's a door and if somebody's leaning and gets comfortable, the thing slides open, fall right out. Yeah.

1130
01:42:39,300 --> 01:42:51,300
I have to say this was definitely an early influence for me, one like liking eccentric weirdos and flowery language because I hated spelling tests, like spelling and definition tests in school.

1131
01:42:51,300 --> 01:42:58,300
But as a kid, I knew your cadaverous pallor betrays an aura of foreboding.

1132
01:42:58,300 --> 01:43:03,300
I knew that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I knew I knew what that meant. I was like, yeah, I'm scared.

1133
01:43:03,300 --> 01:43:14,300
Yeah, I was the same way with I remember asking my mom what all the words meant in Grim Grinning Ghosts because there's such like hyper vocabulary in there.

1134
01:43:14,300 --> 01:43:21,300
So, yeah, it's it's educational. I remember that feeling as a kid like I have that big crazy word. I got to know what that means.

1135
01:43:21,300 --> 01:43:25,300
Why can't I remember the ones in Grim Grinning Ghosts? There's some there's some vocab in there.

1136
01:43:25,300 --> 01:43:36,300
I can't remember anything else. I got really upset too recently speaking about behaving like children because I was like Haunted Mansion was coming out.

1137
01:43:36,300 --> 01:43:42,300
I should drive down there and ride it, but I can't because it's Haunted Mansion holiday.

1138
01:43:42,300 --> 01:43:46,300
Oh, right. We're right. We don't even have time. We don't have time for that.

1139
01:43:46,300 --> 01:43:54,300
We'll do it after they stop doing Haunted Mansion. Yeah, it'll be gone. The year after they stop doing it. We'll do it.

1140
01:43:54,300 --> 01:43:59,300
The stretching. So the first part of the ride is a ride. I mean, it's an elevator.

1141
01:43:59,300 --> 01:44:07,300
Yeah, and we're hoping that Rise of the Resistance is a similar thing where like it's it's this multi-part experience where the pre-ride essentially is part of it too.

1142
01:44:07,300 --> 01:44:08,300
You know, as well, we'll find out.

1143
01:44:08,300 --> 01:44:13,300
Yes, because Chapek said 15 minutes of being chased around by Kylo Ren.

1144
01:44:13,300 --> 01:44:18,300
But does he mean that's the actual ride? Because I don't think you get chased until you're actually on the transport.

1145
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:23,300
So does he mean the ride itself is 15 minutes? I hope he does.

1146
01:44:23,300 --> 01:44:26,300
Or is the whole experience. But it's the whole experience 15 minutes.

1147
01:44:26,300 --> 01:44:30,300
This is sort of the best case scenario on a mansion where it's like you don't even nobody's complaining.

1148
01:44:30,300 --> 01:44:37,300
I'm not on the ride yet because this thing. Right. Which is how I feel doing the episodes as well.

1149
01:44:37,300 --> 01:44:41,300
He's talking about the cool effects before you're there. I wonder if we can get there still.

1150
01:44:41,300 --> 01:44:50,300
So the hanging. Is there much to say about that? I think like, yeah, it is. We've talked about it is oddly, oddly grim.

1151
01:44:50,300 --> 01:44:54,300
The darkest stroke in the Disney park. It's an effect.

1152
01:44:54,300 --> 01:45:10,300
I think I talked to I for sure talked about this on both haunt episodes that on the not scary farm maze that's paranormal ink is they have an effect right at the end when you're in this hospital and they do like a light flicker and you just see sort of normal hallway and the lights flicker.

1153
01:45:10,300 --> 01:45:15,300
And all of a sudden you can see into hell. You can see through the walls. Because you see a grim thing.

1154
01:45:15,300 --> 01:45:22,300
Yes. You can see a demon coming at you. And I put two and two together until doing some research and like, oh, that's what this is.

1155
01:45:22,300 --> 01:45:26,300
And it's a very like old school analog like fit that is digital about it.

1156
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:28,300
Throw a light age craft throw a light on it.

1157
01:45:28,300 --> 01:45:32,300
It's also how they do like the rooms that you can't see in the carousel of progress.

1158
01:45:32,300 --> 01:45:36,300
Like suddenly a light comes out. It was just fabric. And now we turn a light on with this whole other scene there.

1159
01:45:36,300 --> 01:45:43,300
We didn't even know about. There's a trick to the wallpapers in the stretching room, the candy stripe wallpaper.

1160
01:45:43,300 --> 01:45:49,300
The vertical lines make it feel much larger, even larger than it is.

1161
01:45:49,300 --> 01:45:58,300
And just as a kid, like the breading, I don't know, the candy stripe made it unnerving, made it like a scary circuit, something.

1162
01:45:58,300 --> 01:46:04,300
It was weird. Another thing where it's like, it's fine. It's not going to hurt you, but it makes you feel a little odd.

1163
01:46:04,300 --> 01:46:13,300
So nothing in the in this right. The that that light comes on and the lightning cues and like, OK, now you can see up there.

1164
01:46:13,300 --> 01:46:16,300
And you didn't realize there was this whole this whole hidden area.

1165
01:46:16,300 --> 01:46:21,300
The lighting in the stretching room is crazy because it being 360, there's nowhere to put lights.

1166
01:46:21,300 --> 01:46:26,300
So everything's lit by the candles. And then you can't see up there like the lightning up there.

1167
01:46:26,300 --> 01:46:33,300
It's like not as similar when we talked about the Back to the Future ride where you had to see all directions around you because it was this weird like.

1168
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:37,300
Almost 360 way of shooting. So everything has to be lit from within.

1169
01:46:37,300 --> 01:46:42,300
Like there's nowhere to just like unlike Small World where you can see the lights, which I like.

1170
01:46:42,300 --> 01:46:48,300
There's nowhere to just hang a light anywhere in that. So it all has to be practical and no, it's a bunch of goblins.

1171
01:46:48,300 --> 01:46:51,300
It's goblin statues holding candles.

1172
01:46:51,300 --> 01:47:00,300
Those are so cool. Yeah, those are very cool. You can see if you look up, I think you can kind of see the hanging guy a little bit right when you enter.

1173
01:47:00,300 --> 01:47:07,300
Now, a little bit. I have a question, which is did he was he in the mansion for many, many years or was he only in that room for as long as we were?

1174
01:47:07,300 --> 01:47:10,300
And he was like, fuck it. That's it.

1175
01:47:10,300 --> 01:47:16,300
And he's like 30 seconds and he's out. Was he listening to a podcast that went on too long?

1176
01:47:16,300 --> 01:47:19,300
Really stretched out. People are hanging themselves with their earbuds.

1177
01:47:19,300 --> 01:47:23,300
Free Adnan. Adnan did nothing wrong.

1178
01:47:23,300 --> 01:47:30,300
Why do they have so many? Why do they have extra feed drop episodes that are ads?

1179
01:47:30,300 --> 01:47:36,300
Too much. So lightning flashes, you crash. You are now the door swings open.

1180
01:47:36,300 --> 01:47:40,300
You're in this room. Hold on a second. Yeah. And we can tell me if this is too morbid.

1181
01:47:40,300 --> 01:47:45,300
But it is fascinating in a very morbid way.

1182
01:47:45,300 --> 01:47:51,300
Do you look at Paul Freese's Wikipedia? Do you see his cause of death listed?

1183
01:47:51,300 --> 01:47:55,300
No. Suicide. You're kidding. It's not hanging.

1184
01:47:55,300 --> 01:48:00,300
It's like pills. But Paul Freese died of suicide.

1185
01:48:00,300 --> 01:48:04,300
That will be hard to learn. I know.

1186
01:48:04,300 --> 01:48:08,300
We're in that ride. I didn't know this until today.

1187
01:48:08,300 --> 01:48:13,300
The guy who said there's always my way. Is that is that not insane?

1188
01:48:13,300 --> 01:48:19,300
I thought the Brigham Young stuff was weird and like the fucking Hearst Castle connection.

1189
01:48:19,300 --> 01:48:25,300
Let alone all the Yale Gracie. The Yale Gracie and the Paul Freese stuff is very morbid.

1190
01:48:25,300 --> 01:48:31,300
It's insane. I didn't. That's a Wikipedia thing.

1191
01:48:31,300 --> 01:48:36,300
I'm not looking at doom buggies in their yellow journalism.

1192
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:40,300
You're looking at Wikipedia. They always are liable.

1193
01:48:40,300 --> 01:48:45,300
But still, I mean insane. I mean, fuck. I don't know how you top that.

1194
01:48:45,300 --> 01:48:50,300
RIP. Yeah, I know. Well, we could just be done. We don't have to.

1195
01:48:50,300 --> 01:48:54,300
Although winding on such a grim note.

1196
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:59,300
What do we think? We're out of the facade. We made it out.

1197
01:48:59,300 --> 01:49:02,300
We're in the lower level. We'll go through this room.

1198
01:49:02,300 --> 01:49:06,300
Let's do it. Let's do it. Because that was such a morbid way to say there.

1199
01:49:06,300 --> 01:49:09,300
There's not a portrait room. Let's go. What do we got?

1200
01:49:09,300 --> 01:49:13,300
There is a lot in there. We have like we have like go.

1201
01:49:13,300 --> 01:49:16,300
Portraits. OK, first of all, the water out of your mouth.

1202
01:49:16,300 --> 01:49:18,300
We're walking through.

1203
01:49:18,300 --> 01:49:24,300
First of all, the fact that it's, you know, it's a rainstorm thunderstorm down there in the windows.

1204
01:49:24,300 --> 01:49:26,300
Simple, effective. Sure.

1205
01:49:26,300 --> 01:49:29,300
Truly makes me forget what the weather outside was.

1206
01:49:29,300 --> 01:49:33,300
Not that I know it's not a thunderstorm, but truly like mood atmosphere.

1207
01:49:33,300 --> 01:49:36,300
There's nothing fake about it to me when I'm down there.

1208
01:49:36,300 --> 01:49:38,300
True. Really, really great.

1209
01:49:38,300 --> 01:49:43,300
Yes, you're right. Cool portraits, cool portraits.

1210
01:49:43,300 --> 01:49:46,300
Now this is you are under the railroad tracks.

1211
01:49:46,300 --> 01:49:49,300
This room exists for practical reasons.

1212
01:49:49,300 --> 01:49:57,300
Yes, to get you from the basement of the facade building into underneath the railroad tracks.

1213
01:49:57,300 --> 01:50:01,300
So just that part is under. Yeah, you are literally going under the tracks.

1214
01:50:01,300 --> 01:50:08,300
And I honestly am not sure at what point you step from under tracks into exact show building.

1215
01:50:08,300 --> 01:50:14,300
But you are underground. That's why the ride, the doom buggies go up the stairs.

1216
01:50:14,300 --> 01:50:19,300
OK, OK. To get back to the ramp at the end. Yes.

1217
01:50:19,300 --> 01:50:23,300
Yeah. OK. I did. I will think about the next time I'm on that.

1218
01:50:23,300 --> 01:50:25,300
Yeah, you're right under the train. That's pretty great.

1219
01:50:25,300 --> 01:50:29,300
Yeah, this is kind of a holdover from like when the whole place was going to be a walk through.

1220
01:50:29,300 --> 01:50:32,300
Right. But this solved the problem.

1221
01:50:32,300 --> 01:50:35,300
Yeah, and those effects. And yeah, we talked a little about the bus and stuff.

1222
01:50:35,300 --> 01:50:40,300
I know. Why can't I picture? OK, you got like a Cleopatra kind of what are notable?

1223
01:50:40,300 --> 01:50:44,300
You've got him in front of you. These are some of the older sketches.

1224
01:50:44,300 --> 01:50:50,300
Do we have favorites of these of the paintings? Well, there's like the cat lady.

1225
01:50:50,300 --> 01:50:55,300
I mean, the old guy, the Dorian Gray kind of old guy. The cat lady is so odd.

1226
01:50:55,300 --> 01:50:59,300
You have doom buggies open and the cat is flashing between the two.

1227
01:50:59,300 --> 01:51:02,300
Well, the ship. I think the ship is a highlight.

1228
01:51:02,300 --> 01:51:05,300
And there's a there's a recreate. There's things very much like this in Club 33,

1229
01:51:05,300 --> 01:51:10,300
which is a cool secret to discover when you're in there and that we're spoiling for you.

1230
01:51:10,300 --> 01:51:15,300
Yeah, the cat lady, for whatever reason, that's the one that always sticks out in my memory.

1231
01:51:15,300 --> 01:51:21,300
Do these paintings remind you a little bit of like black velvet paintings like sexy 70?

1232
01:51:21,300 --> 01:51:25,300
Honestly, the paintings remind me of the video, your Adam West video.

1233
01:51:25,300 --> 01:51:28,300
Oh, hey, I hold paintings with Adam West.

1234
01:51:28,300 --> 01:51:31,300
Check it out on my YouTube because the fun of your night went away.

1235
01:51:31,300 --> 01:51:36,300
So I put it on my channel. Are there actual are there I hope things in the high nation?

1236
01:51:36,300 --> 01:51:38,300
It's a good question. You would think there would be.

1237
01:51:38,300 --> 01:51:41,300
It's such an old time gag in all these types of things.

1238
01:51:41,300 --> 01:51:46,300
There are. There is that in the film. I'll say in the Haunted and the Eddie Murphy movie,

1239
01:51:46,300 --> 01:51:49,300
which is a whole other thing. Yeah.

1240
01:51:49,300 --> 01:51:53,300
But yeah, of all the weird effects and that was certainly a Disney inspired thing.

1241
01:51:53,300 --> 01:51:58,300
But the bus kind of serve a similar purpose. Oh, they they follow you. Absolutely.

1242
01:51:58,300 --> 01:52:02,300
And we talked about that last time how that's a reverse thing. You're looking into a sculpture.

1243
01:52:02,300 --> 01:52:05,300
A lot of people were like, how did they not know that? Well, we didn't.

1244
01:52:05,300 --> 01:52:09,300
And I feel like one person said that. But I still a lot of people are saying.

1245
01:52:09,300 --> 01:52:13,300
But as soon as you said that, though, that was that was my memory of someone like

1246
01:52:13,300 --> 01:52:17,300
making fun of us for not knowing that effect. It makes a lot of sense.

1247
01:52:17,300 --> 01:52:19,300
But I didn't know it either.

1248
01:52:19,300 --> 01:52:23,300
This is unique. Again, this is all a necessity at Disneyland.

1249
01:52:23,300 --> 01:52:27,300
At Disney World, you come out of the stretching room and you are right there.

1250
01:52:27,300 --> 01:52:29,300
You get on your doom buggy right there.

1251
01:52:29,300 --> 01:52:32,300
Which is why and some of these the busts are on the ride.

1252
01:52:32,300 --> 01:52:35,300
Yes, they were on the ride. And now let's talk about this.

1253
01:52:35,300 --> 01:52:39,300
I think that, you know, you can say things you like or don't like.

1254
01:52:39,300 --> 01:52:41,300
But better or worse, Disney World, Disneyland.

1255
01:52:41,300 --> 01:52:48,300
I think the first couple, the beginning of the ride in Disney World and Tokyo,

1256
01:52:48,300 --> 01:52:52,300
which are pretty similar, I think is a little superior because I think the

1257
01:52:52,300 --> 01:52:56,300
probably due to space issues that they do throw you right into it. I like.

1258
01:52:56,300 --> 01:53:02,300
And I think this very the very first room is kind of the most underwhelming route,

1259
01:53:02,300 --> 01:53:06,300
like the load area. Well, because there's sort of just nothing.

1260
01:53:06,300 --> 01:53:08,300
Yes. And this is what you will hear this.

1261
01:53:08,300 --> 01:53:12,300
If you I was referenced earlier that season pass episode about Haunted Mansion.

1262
01:53:12,300 --> 01:53:16,300
Tony Baxter says when Haunted Mansion, the movie was happening,

1263
01:53:16,300 --> 01:53:20,300
there's some sort of conservatory scene setting.

1264
01:53:20,300 --> 01:53:26,300
There was a plan in place to put that setting in the load area of Haunted Mansion.

1265
01:53:26,300 --> 01:53:32,300
Now is that like staircases and usually like if you think if picture the movie Clue,

1266
01:53:32,300 --> 01:53:34,300
it's kind of like conservatory.

1267
01:53:34,300 --> 01:53:40,300
I think that's what conservative maybe I could be getting glass, glass everywhere.

1268
01:53:40,300 --> 01:53:42,300
I could be getting the term when I'm pretty sure I'm right.

1269
01:53:42,300 --> 01:53:44,300
But it's some scene from the Haunted Mansion.

1270
01:53:44,300 --> 01:53:47,300
It's like a weird prominent location in the Haunted Mansion movie.

1271
01:53:47,300 --> 01:53:51,300
Well, I guess I guess what's got to saying, I'm just saying I think that at least Tony

1272
01:53:51,300 --> 01:53:56,300
and other imagineers had identified that as the weak, a weak scene.

1273
01:53:56,300 --> 01:54:02,300
Yeah, which is a little better in Disney World and Tokyo and way better in Phantom Manor.

1274
01:54:02,300 --> 01:54:05,300
Like that's where you get on the doom buggies.

1275
01:54:05,300 --> 01:54:09,300
And it's a thing that I like about Haunted Mansion holiday.

1276
01:54:09,300 --> 01:54:12,300
That big tableau of all the characters.

1277
01:54:12,300 --> 01:54:14,300
Yes, it's fun. It's very fun.

1278
01:54:14,300 --> 01:54:18,300
It makes that that really livens the room up.

1279
01:54:18,300 --> 01:54:26,300
So that is if I could say, you know, I'll I'll throw shade on this right here and there.

1280
01:54:26,300 --> 01:54:30,300
I like that Tony's identified that I think that is one weak spot.

1281
01:54:30,300 --> 01:54:32,300
And I and I also I don't think it's better or worse.

1282
01:54:32,300 --> 01:54:35,300
I like the the bus that follow you either way.

1283
01:54:35,300 --> 01:54:41,300
But it is cool to see there's like a library room you go to or just filled with them.

1284
01:54:41,300 --> 01:54:43,300
Yeah, yeah, Disney World, which I do like.

1285
01:54:43,300 --> 01:54:47,300
So that maybe Disney World may have the edge for those first couple of rooms.

1286
01:54:47,300 --> 01:54:49,300
And then it becomes pretty identical. Yeah.

1287
01:54:49,300 --> 01:54:52,300
The ride itself. The differences are more outside.

1288
01:54:52,300 --> 01:54:57,300
Right. There's this Disneyland or this this Haunted Mansion book.

1289
01:54:57,300 --> 01:55:01,300
Jason Sorrell wrote or put together that is very cool.

1290
01:55:01,300 --> 01:55:04,300
We've mentioned last time, but that's where a lot of information is coming from.

1291
01:55:04,300 --> 01:55:08,300
A lot of cool other things that didn't make it on the ride like this.

1292
01:55:08,300 --> 01:55:11,300
Like, why can't I think of Medusa? Medusa.

1293
01:55:11,300 --> 01:55:13,300
Thank you. Yes. Isn't that on there?

1294
01:55:13,300 --> 01:55:17,300
That's in the portrait. Yeah. Is it in there? Yeah.

1295
01:55:17,300 --> 01:55:21,300
What am I misremembering? Am I this? Yeah, that's on there.

1296
01:55:21,300 --> 01:55:23,300
Oh, she looks a little different. OK, OK.

1297
01:55:23,300 --> 01:55:26,300
But at this she's not wearing a yellow dress.

1298
01:55:26,300 --> 01:55:28,300
Oh, excuse me.

1299
01:55:28,300 --> 01:55:30,300
But there's cool stuff that isn't in there.

1300
01:55:30,300 --> 01:55:32,300
This scary little skeleton horse, it seems like.

1301
01:55:32,300 --> 01:55:35,300
Yes, the skeleton horse is cool. Skeleton horse is in there.

1302
01:55:35,300 --> 01:55:41,300
It looks like one of those body world things that Eva told us is the organ harvesting.

1303
01:55:41,300 --> 01:55:44,300
Yeah, political prisoners.

1304
01:55:44,300 --> 01:55:48,300
OK, this feels like, well, we're coming towards an end.

1305
01:55:48,300 --> 01:55:50,300
I'm going to get to I'm going to get to my goal.

1306
01:55:50,300 --> 01:55:52,300
So you're out you're around the corner.

1307
01:55:52,300 --> 01:55:55,300
We've talked about those stanchions. The stanchions are cool.

1308
01:55:55,300 --> 01:55:57,300
Yes, very cool. The bats.

1309
01:55:57,300 --> 01:55:59,300
Those are fantastic. I'd love to have one.

1310
01:55:59,300 --> 01:56:01,300
I like to touch those. Yeah.

1311
01:56:01,300 --> 01:56:04,300
And they're dirty as shit, but I like to touch them.

1312
01:56:04,300 --> 01:56:06,300
I know I get over a little bit of germaphobia with those.

1313
01:56:06,300 --> 01:56:09,300
But they age beautifully. They age to gold.

1314
01:56:09,300 --> 01:56:11,300
Whoa. Yeah.

1315
01:56:11,300 --> 01:56:17,300
As you rub it, the gold like if you see statues that people rub for good luck, that part wears away to gold.

1316
01:56:17,300 --> 01:56:21,300
Oh, and that the final one, they said, is like especially everybody touches the last one.

1317
01:56:21,300 --> 01:56:26,300
Yeah. And then you step on to a moving walkway.

1318
01:56:26,300 --> 01:56:28,300
We step off to the right.

1319
01:56:28,300 --> 01:56:32,300
You sit down in your doom buggy and we're on the ride.

1320
01:56:32,300 --> 01:56:34,300
We made it. We made it.

1321
01:56:34,300 --> 01:56:36,300
We made it. Wow.

1322
01:56:36,300 --> 01:56:40,300
A little under two hours in under two hours, maybe more with ads.

1323
01:56:40,300 --> 01:56:42,300
Holy shit. We did it.

1324
01:56:42,300 --> 01:56:44,300
You know what? Let's even go a little bit further.

1325
01:56:44,300 --> 01:56:46,300
Whoa. A little bit further.

1326
01:56:46,300 --> 01:56:48,300
Let's go out on a hike. We've already compromised.

1327
01:56:48,300 --> 01:56:56,300
Let's go out on a hike because we're sitting in the thing and we're moving forward and we want to reach forward and we want to pull that lamp bar down.

1328
01:56:56,300 --> 01:56:57,300
No, no, no.

1329
01:56:57,300 --> 01:57:02,300
And then the ghost host pops in. We haven't heard him since the elevator and he tells us no, no, no.

1330
01:57:02,300 --> 01:57:05,300
I will lower it for you. One of the coolest moments.

1331
01:57:05,300 --> 01:57:11,300
Yeah. And I will then add and then the sexy Spanish ghost host comes in.

1332
01:57:11,300 --> 01:57:18,300
Yes, that is in my notes. I want to compliment the Spanish ghost host very much an unsung hero.

1333
01:57:18,300 --> 01:57:20,300
He and that's where this is where we're going to end it.

1334
01:57:20,300 --> 01:57:29,300
But he is look, you know, when you're doing something that's been done already, you don't want to do the same thing, which so I appreciate not doing a Paul Fries impression.

1335
01:57:29,300 --> 01:57:31,300
He decided to go very sexy with it.

1336
01:57:31,300 --> 01:57:35,300
And it is it is truly brazos.

1337
01:57:35,300 --> 01:57:43,300
I love like maybe even as much as as iconic as all the Paul Fries is to me, I'm a big fan of Manos Brazos.

1338
01:57:43,300 --> 01:57:47,300
He is so excited. He's like he's like a like a soccer announcer.

1339
01:57:47,300 --> 01:57:48,300
Yeah. Yeah. So excited.

1340
01:57:48,300 --> 01:57:50,300
PPA supernos. Is that what he says?

1341
01:57:50,300 --> 01:57:53,300
I guess. Yeah. Yeah. But those are good.

1342
01:57:53,300 --> 01:57:58,300
But it doesn't have quite the gusto of Manos Brazos.

1343
01:57:58,300 --> 01:57:59,300
He's having so much fun.

1344
01:57:59,300 --> 01:58:07,300
There's a coziness to that, too. I don't know what it is because you're going up. I'm just like, yeah, like you feel like a little like warm.

1345
01:58:07,300 --> 01:58:09,300
You're on the ride. Just happened.

1346
01:58:09,300 --> 01:58:12,300
Yeah. No, I want to say sexy. You get like he's like Zora.

1347
01:58:12,300 --> 01:58:15,300
He's like Antonio Banderas. Yeah.

1348
01:58:15,300 --> 01:58:17,300
Swarthy. Yeah.

1349
01:58:17,300 --> 01:58:22,300
In good hand. Like if you got rescued by that guy, you were in some peril and that guy swung down our rope.

1350
01:58:22,300 --> 01:58:24,300
I'd love it. We should really find out.

1351
01:58:24,300 --> 01:58:27,300
Did a calm sea voyage with him back to your home.

1352
01:58:27,300 --> 01:58:30,300
We will find that we'll spend a year researching it.

1353
01:58:30,300 --> 01:58:33,300
And the first thing next year is we will find out that gentleman's name.

1354
01:58:33,300 --> 01:58:37,300
Who did the Spanish ghost? And that's how we'll lead off next year's episode with.

1355
01:58:37,300 --> 01:58:41,300
Yeah. Let's just we should just open it with just saying it before we say anything else.

1356
01:58:41,300 --> 01:58:44,300
OK. It's like I'll set a reminder to myself to do that.

1357
01:58:44,300 --> 01:58:48,300
Yeah. Any year we're at John Collins, John Collins.

1358
01:58:48,300 --> 01:58:50,300
I don't think it's John Collins. Probably not.

1359
01:58:50,300 --> 01:58:57,300
Let's just that. Mayamo John Collins. So we'll kick it off with a bang.

1360
01:58:57,300 --> 01:59:00,300
We'll find out his name and we'll shout it. So tune in next year.

1361
01:59:00,300 --> 01:59:07,300
And until then, you survived haunt cast the fright haunted mansion to guys.

1362
01:59:07,300 --> 01:59:11,300
We got there. I'm so happy to be on the ride.

1363
01:59:11,300 --> 01:59:18,300
We did it. Do it. If just with a little bit of discipline and love, we we made it there.

1364
01:59:18,300 --> 01:59:21,300
And now we just love love, Scott.

1365
01:59:21,300 --> 01:59:24,300
I'm very excited to go on this ride with you in 2020.

1366
01:59:24,300 --> 01:59:32,300
How many rooms per episode? I wonder. Yeah, I don't know.

1367
01:59:32,300 --> 01:59:36,300
Recapping the foyer stretching room and portrait hall will take 30 minutes.

1368
01:59:36,300 --> 01:59:40,300
Things we missed. And how grim we for sure grim.

1369
01:59:40,300 --> 01:59:46,300
Yeah. How grim will the the 2020 election be?

1370
01:59:46,300 --> 01:59:49,300
We will be in the thick of my god. You're right.

1371
01:59:49,300 --> 01:59:52,300
I think 10 times worse election cycle. Yeah.

1372
01:59:52,300 --> 01:59:58,300
So we're going to need that to cheer us up because it's going to be it's going to be bad.

1373
01:59:58,300 --> 02:00:03,300
Yeah. So a little message to us then hang in there.

1374
02:00:03,300 --> 02:00:12,300
Unless Trump just like died like you died in Jason's scenario, if he just like fell and hit his head because the dog was under him.

1375
02:00:12,300 --> 02:00:16,300
Yeah, that could happen, too. You never know. Anything's possible.

1376
02:00:16,300 --> 02:00:19,300
And then he'll have a fun tombstone.

1377
02:00:19,300 --> 02:00:28,300
Well, hang in there. Future Mike Scott and Jason and hey, next week, one more installment of on cast the fright, the cemetery.

1378
02:00:28,300 --> 02:00:33,300
Yes. If you go behind the cemetery gate on the Patreon.

1379
02:00:33,300 --> 02:00:38,300
Yeah, there's a little bit more. And as we said, it's it's it's a Haunted Mansion related.

1380
02:00:38,300 --> 02:00:44,300
And you know, to to wait, I forget the week of the twenty eighth one day, the week of the twenty eight.

1381
02:00:44,300 --> 02:00:48,300
I think on Halloween, right? Probably. Oh, yeah, probably.

1382
02:00:48,300 --> 02:00:50,300
I think that's that falls on a Wednesday. So that's all right.

1383
02:00:50,300 --> 02:00:52,300
So there's a little there's a little bit more left.

1384
02:00:52,300 --> 02:00:55,300
But as and that's a Patreon dot com slash podcast, right?

1385
02:00:55,300 --> 02:01:01,300
With this three bonus episodes every month. But for regular us main feed us, we're heading to Chicago, Phyllis.

1386
02:01:01,300 --> 02:01:03,300
Yes. See us tomorrow. Oh, my guess.

02:01:03,300 --> 02:01:08,300
Some people here today and Friday listening Saturday morning and it just came out.

1388
02:01:08,300 --> 02:01:12,300
Come on out, Chicago. Oh, my. For our big boy. That's right.

Yeah. Well, we're looking forward to it. We'll see you there.
