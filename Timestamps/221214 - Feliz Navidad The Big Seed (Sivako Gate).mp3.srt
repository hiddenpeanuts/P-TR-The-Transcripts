Welcome to Podcast the Ride presents Feliz Navidad, the way of winter, a Yuletide celebration

3
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:05,280
of all things Avatar. We're kicking off the party here on the Civico gate. I'm Scott

4
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:12,080
Gardner and I'm thrilled to do it. Mike Carlson, a mighty hello to you. Hello. I was in, I

5
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,800
went into Walmart yesterday and I saw an Avatar shirt, but in a different size, like not in

6
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:24,280
my size. And I was desperate to find it and I couldn't find it. What was the shirt? What

7
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,960
was on the shirt? It was a face of a Navi. Oh, okay. Big face of a Navi. That's one of

8
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,080
the things in Avatar. Yeah. And I was like, this is going to be great. I'm going to buy this

9
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,280
shirt and I hunted around and hunted around. No, couldn't find it. But it was like, it was,

10
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,640
it was like many, many feet long, like meant for a 14 foot body. Oh yeah. It was a Navi

11
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:47,120
size shirt. It was for a Navi to shop. Yeah. So it could work as a night gown, but that's not

12
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,520
what you're after. No, no, I want a shirt. So Jason Sheridan, that sure would not work for you.

13
00:01:52,840 --> 00:02:02,080
Well, for, for sleep in, I'd love it. But I'm not in his avatar, a Navi tall T they would just

14
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:08,680
call them teas. Tall T Navi, tall T with an apostrophe between tall and T.

15
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,760
Was this a problem in your high schools? Tall T's tall T's. Well, this phrase I've never

16
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,920
heard this phrase until now, but I know, I know low T, but I don't know tall. We all know.

17
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:26,600
We all suffer from it. No tall T's like very long T shirts. That was the nickname of like

18
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,280
T shirts that you would wear and that would go down to your, like your calf and very quickly

19
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:38,320
they were like banned and they're like no tall T's in school. And I'm like, I, I looking back,

20
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:43,760
I'm like, you for sure banned these for a racist. Like I feel like what you were saying

21
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,680
with all dress code issues at schools, it's like a hip hop thing. Yeah.

22
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,520
Yeah. Right. I do. I remember vaguely this, this was like an elementary school. I feel like,

23
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,600
Oh, okay. For me. And I'm not that much older. So I feel like in fifth or sixth grade was maybe

24
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:06,480
like some kid wore a big shirt one day and they had a big meeting about it. All right. We have

25
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,760
something to create a bunch of hassle over all hands on deck. Every teacher. Yeah. Right.

26
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:20,880
I feel like kids are always like kids wear baggy shirts in general as they're still growing.

27
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,480
You know, they buy like, well, everything was baggy and then we wore baggy things in the nineties.

28
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,160
That was the style that was style. It's come back around and it's back or come back around.

29
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:37,160
I wore this giant sweater in seventh and eighth grade that is too big for me now. Way too big for

30
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,840
me now. And it just like I was swimming in it at the time, but I guess that was the style.

31
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:48,160
Well, it's, I don't know. It was the style for some people and for others, it was your impression of

32
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:54,160
the style. Interesting theory. You've got that. Maybe I wasn't fashion, fashion forward.

33
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,280
Why are you pointing and laughing at me? It's the style. Is it not the style?

34
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,080
Yeah. You wear an onion on your belt. That's the style at the time.

35
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:08,440
Yeah. So anyway, I think that this policy was actually, I think who they were actually targeting was big

36
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:15,520
chipmunks. They didn't want chipmunks coming to school wearing their first initial on their giant red shirt.

37
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:20,480
Oh yeah. Sure. We all, and then other kids would copy and they would, the chipmunking was what they

38
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:27,760
called it. And you would wear a big guy, your initial J big J on your one big shirt that you were wearing.

39
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,280
It's a distraction. It's a distraction from learning. Yeah. It's the fear. Cause you're, well, you're,

40
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,840
so you're thinking about everybody you're looking at in the classroom. Are they wearing pants under this or not?

41
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:43,160
Yeah. Yeah. Well, so what better way to start our, our celebration of avatar than with a bunch of,

42
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:50,200
a bunch of shirt talk. They're big. It makes sense. I think it makes sense. Uh, look, we're, this is, uh,

43
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:55,080
so it's like, it's a little mini celebration. It won't be the whole month. I think the main party is

44
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,560
going to start on the, on the main feed very soon. You could probably guess what we're, what we're

45
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:05,720
covering over there, but I, I'm very excited about this because we, we were like a little cluster,

46
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:11,640
little cluster of avatar episodes to celebrate the impending release of the way of water after

47
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:19,640
a long wait. And we weren't sure exactly what to do in terms of smaller avatar episodes. You know,

48
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:24,040
you could just be by the books and just go, well, what are the other things in the land? And you look

49
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:30,680
at a list and then you pick those, but we wanted to club three style, throw it to the audience a

50
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,880
little bit, maybe try to crowdsource. What are you the audience passionate about in terms of

51
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:42,360
avatar ideas, Pandora ideas? And I couldn't be happier with where it landed with today's episode,

52
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:49,080
the big seed, but this is a truly one that would, this would not have happened naturally exposed

53
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:54,440
me with me, with my limited experience in Pandora and animal kingdom. I have not come across

54
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,760
the big seed. It might not be accurate to call it the big seed, but that's the first, the first

55
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:05,400
tweet that we saw suggesting it, uh, called it the big C and this we've landed here at the big seed,

56
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:12,280
the big seed, not the big seed, the big seed, the big seed. Jason said the phrase, the big seed a

57
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:18,440
couple months ago. Yeah, that's right. Now, yes. Remind me what the, this was a runner, I think in

58
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:24,120
the live show about guardians, but how did this play out exactly? Where did, do you guys recall

59
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,320
where the, the, what the notion that there is a there or will be a big seed in the avatar world?

60
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:36,120
I just took a big swing and I assumed that the seed bearer, I feel like he had a 50, 50 chance,

61
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:42,440
either he's got a million little seeds or he's got one big seat. I imagine, I picture it like, um,

62
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:48,520
bigger than a football, uh, maybe about the size of a Thanksgiving turkey. Oh, it's a big,

63
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,280
that's it. That's not that big of a, well, I think it's big enough for him to bear.

64
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,600
It's still, I think, keep in mind, somebody has to bear this seat. That's the title, not of the one

65
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:05,000
that's about to come out way of water, but, uh, in supposedly two years, the seed bearer, maybe we'll

66
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,720
meet the seed bearer. This could, you know, I know we're the James plays it different than the

67
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:15,080
marvels. We're not, maybe we're not doing post credit scenes. Yeah, probably not. If the credits

68
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:21,320
die down and we think that's it, a little shimmery blue into black, but then, uh, we're back on it.

69
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:27,960
And then somebody steps out of the shadows and their silhouette is carrying some object that's

70
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:33,080
around the size of a turkey. There's also the possibility that we've already met the seed

71
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:38,680
bearer that it could be Jake Sully or it could be Niteari, you know? Yeah. We don't really know

72
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:45,960
what defines the city. Yeah. Are, are many people, are many Navi seed bearers? I I'm not sure,

73
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:52,440
but you like, okay. In the, I am shocked that in that whole discussion that we had in the live show,

74
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:59,000
I think I imagined a seed when we're talking about a big seed being an avatar. I think I pictured

75
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,200
more something that you could like, you could ride on, like, you know, you go to a, you go to a park

76
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:10,120
with the kid and there's like a big dome or like a, maybe like a, a fake turtle or something that

77
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,480
you can sit on and you kind of kick your leg. I think I was, I thought your imagined big seed

78
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:22,120
was like four feet wide or so. I'm open, you know, I'm open. I haven't, I haven't fully cooked up the

79
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:28,600
big seed thing. I'm not Jimmy. I'm not Jimmy Cameron. I thought the big seed was like, uh,

80
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:33,560
an Adam Warlock style cocoon that would sort of give birth to like a person. I don't know why.

81
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,240
I just figured a big like egg. I was thinking of an egg really is what I was thinking.

82
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,720
Whoa. Well, we all pictured something pretty different. Isn't this the wonders of avatar

83
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:47,480
that it lets our imaginations just run rock, run wild. That's, that is what it's good about it.

84
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:55,160
I think so in a way that that is what I, because as we decipher, like why has this stayed with us

85
00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:00,840
and why have we ended, at least why I ended up so excited about avatar. One thing I like is that this,

86
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,920
this whole thing, which we'll get into in the, in the future episode, but this whole thing of

87
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:12,120
no cultural impact, I feel like we have all found the cultural impact together. We've all made it

88
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,800
our own. It's like, it's not, uh, I love it because it's like, it's, it's free rain for,

89
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:23,800
for us to like plant our seeds and for, we decide what to do with it and what characters to celebrate.

90
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:28,680
And it feels like we're all like the first people to like, try to do comedy about these characters.

91
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:34,360
It's not like when you think about like star wars, it feels so like not only picked over for

92
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:40,520
like making fun of it or having fun with it, but also just like a, a barren landscape until these

93
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,640
movies, like people are having fun with the new shows, but the movies are become just like

94
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:50,760
when the birds take over the town and you just have to back away. This is theirs now. That's

95
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,400
how I feel about the movie. I don't even want to talk about them anymore. But avatar is like,

96
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:00,200
it's just this big open, right? Playing fee. Yes. It's extremely ripe and we're waiting,

97
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:08,040
right? Waiting to bear big seeds. Now I, that all having been said, I have one more question for you

98
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:14,680
about the idea of the big seed. Do you think that he, the seed bearer, we might've even said some

99
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:19,640
of this in the show. Do you think that it's like a, um, like a, I might've said Johnny Appleseed

100
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:25,000
or some sort of like pied piper. Is he like, is the seed bearer not from their village?

101
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:30,360
And he comes in, look what I got. And he's got, or he's got some, like he's, there's something he

102
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,800
has to do with the, uh, I don't know what he, what is he up to? What is the seed bearer?

103
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:42,440
Now that we've seen a few trailers for the new movie and we, it seems to imply that they leave

104
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:48,520
their forest home and go to a neighboring water. They meet the water people. They meet the water

105
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:55,880
people. So I'm not really sure, uh, what the seed bearer will be doing now. Well, it's, do they

106
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:02,440
bring the forest back, you know, and is it a literal seed or is it the seed of the life of

107
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:08,760
the people? Well, yeah, I don't want to completely get off topic, but actually no, it's on topic.

108
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:15,400
It's perfectly on topic. It's on, that's on that I looked up and apparently wood sprites, I don't

109
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:22,360
know if you came across this, are seeds. Oh, I see now this, all right, to go back, like something

110
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:27,960
that will, will come up in the, the, the subsequent episode on the main feed, uh, and you're talking

111
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:34,440
about the flora and fauna of Pandora. I, I especially, it was very effusive or will be very

112
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:40,120
effusive about wood sprites, which are those sort of like jellyfish, very slight, like flying jellyfish

113
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:47,560
type creatures. They are seeds. They're seeds. They are seeds. A wood sprite is a seed of the tree

114
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,840
of souls that lives on Pandora. These seeds, according to the Navi are very pure and sacred

115
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:58,760
spirits. So they're part of a ritual. Like in the movie Avatar, many wood sprites, they lay on Jake

116
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:05,160
Sully, uh, and that's sort of, they're trying to, uh, uh, I think bring them closer to, uh, Iwa.

117
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:12,760
So it's sort of, uh, uh, it's a, it's a religious ritual of some kind. Okay. And they also, it says

118
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,960
they gather in, in places of mythological importance, like the cavern of songs.

119
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:25,000
And the cavern of songs is where the ride, where Navi river journey takes you. I believe so. Where

120
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:32,840
the shaman sings. Okay. Yeah. Um, and now there are also different seeds on Pandora and these are

121
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:39,800
called essence seeds. Oh, and they are way deep into the whole entire seed ecosystem. And the

122
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,360
thing we're going to talk about today is not a seed, but we need to get all this seed stuff out

123
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:49,480
of the way. It looks like a seed. I will explain. We'll explain why. But I just want to, the audience

124
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:55,800
needs to know what are seeds and what aren't seeds before we proceed. That's what we are doing here.

125
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:00,680
Essence seeds are small blue bioluminescent pellets, which are found across the Pandora

126
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:05,880
landscape in Navi mythology. These seeds are said to contain small amounts of IWA spirit,

127
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,280
more than just good luck charms. The seeds are also believed to bring IWA's blessing to those

128
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,360
who know where to look for them. So those are sort of different than the wood sprites. I believe

129
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:21,800
those are blue and also very similar. They use it in a religious context. Now hold on. I have a very

130
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:30,040
important question. Is IWA real in the avatar universe? Yeah. Yeah. I'm very comfortable

131
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:37,720
Yeah. I think like religion is real on Pandora. Yeah. Yeah. I'm ripping off this observation from

132
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:44,120
a podcast and I don't know. I feel like Griffin and David have said, I've done fun episodes about

133
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:49,640
Avatar and Chapo Trap houses. Well, one of these podcasts mentioned said how yet in this where

134
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:56,040
IWA is real, their God is real and they talk to the God. Okay. And that is like, this is presented

135
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:00,680
as a badass thing about the movie and the world, which I agree. I don't think that I don't think

136
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:08,280
it's a hypothetical. IWA absolutely is around. Got it. Their God is in the tree and in the

137
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:16,280
Pandora is in the planet. Like, yes. Yeah. That is. And the spiritual leader who is, I forgot I had

138
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:25,240
to look this up. I believe it is also Nate Tire's mother, CCH Pounder. Moab? Moab? Moat? Moat. That's

139
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:32,280
right. Moab might be biblical. She's a spiritual leader. Could the seed bearer be the next

140
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:40,360
generation spiritual leader? Yes. Okay. Yeah. That might be right because if there is a more, if like,

141
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:47,000
if the ideas are passed and if religion is passed down through tangible items, like nature is

142
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,560
religion in this world, that might be a very good guess. Right. Yeah. Because the, like,

143
00:14:54,440 --> 00:15:02,600
political leader of the group was Nate Tire's father and he dies. Yeah. Yes. As I remember.

144
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,240
So it's interesting there's political leaders, but in addition, there's also God that exists.

145
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,960
To me, if God was actually existing, you wouldn't even need the leaders because God would just have

146
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:17,400
a conversation with everyone all the time. Yeah. And there wouldn't be an intermediary.

147
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:22,360
I think IWA speaks to everyone. Yeah. And I don't think, I think that's a beautiful thing

148
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:27,480
about the Navi and life on Pandora. I don't think you got any charlatans. Well, that's what I was

149
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,560
saying. You don't have any Joseph Smith saying, yeah, yeah. Going like, I talked to, I talked to

150
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:37,240
IWA. Maybe that'll come. That'll come with, what if this, oh no, what if the seed bearer is a con

151
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,720
artist? What if the seed bearer thinks that they have a deeper connection with IWA? And that's like

152
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,560
the start of, couldn't you see that being something James Cameron would want to address is like

153
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:52,600
religious profiteering comes to the Navi people and they have to like, you know, throw that person

154
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:58,040
out and what if they're full? I feel like James Cameron's bit of a movie guy. Maybe it's like a

155
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:05,240
night of the movie guy, like, like classic movie, like a night of a hunter, like sleazy, uh, uh,

156
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:12,360
revival preacher who is also a killer with the tattoos on his knuckles and stuff. Okay. So maybe

157
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,280
the seed bearer is bad. Maybe the seed bearer. Yeah, wait, why are we assuming? Oh, that'd be an

158
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:21,320
interesting turn. This phrase has been looming for so long and might loom for longer. Here's another

159
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,960
quest. Let's make another one of these predictions. Do we think it actually is two years before the

160
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:32,600
seed bearer or do we got more to wait? I'm going to say, uh, I think it comes out as scheduled.

161
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,760
I think it comes out in two years. Yes. I think he's on track because they're both shot. I think

162
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:41,960
that's shot already. Yeah. Yeah. The sum of four is what he's revealed. Right. But recently, but

163
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:47,000
that's not fully like green lit. No, I think he just started doing something. Yeah. Yeah. I don't

164
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,400
think we have the full, right. Um, we'll see. Well now I'm scared. Now I will be, I'll be entering

165
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:59,240
that theater with nervous trepidation of, am I going to be happy when I meet the seed bearer

166
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:05,400
or not? Or do we already know the seed bearer? Yeah. So much to wonder here. Um, um, so yeah,

167
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,400
the last thing I'll say, unless you guys have more about seeds before we start a topic here.

168
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,440
No, we'll transition over into the topic, which is not a big seed, but I'll explain why we call

169
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:18,040
it a big seed. I just, okay. Yeah. Well, we'll explain that. I just want to really quickly just

170
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:24,680
explain, uh, I brought up something, uh, that Bill Maher eats seeds exclusively and I have his full

171
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:30,840
diet here. I just want to explain what it is in more detail that this is what this man eats. Uh,

172
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:36,040
so he has sesame seeds, flax seeds, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, barley and rye. He says

173
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:40,120
they're very good for you. He mashes the seeds with water in a machine that looks like a coffee

174
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:45,560
grinder. After the mixture sits for a few hours, he adds black cherry concentrate and that's what

175
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:55,160
he eats for lunch. Black cherry seed concentrate. He mushes up a bunch of seeds and only black

176
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:02,680
cherry. Yeah. No other flavors in his vernacular. Later in the day, he has a seed shake with a raw

177
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:08,680
egg and a different type of syrup. Jesus Christ. Well, this seems like the syrup in the concentrate

178
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:14,440
is undoing some of what the no, no, no, no, this is the rich guy. This is his diet. That's going to

179
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,920
keep him alive to a hundred. It seems like he's always in a bad mood all the time. It's like,

180
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:24,920
oh, I gotta go eat my seed smoothie. Like if he ever changed the diet and just had a pizza,

181
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:31,880
it would have taken one pizza long ago in like 2003 and real time would have suddenly become a

182
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:39,880
variety show with like, uh, uh, like girls in big can, can dresses and like knock, knock. Yeah.

183
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:44,280
Yeah. His whole career would have changed. Totally different. He had one pizza. No,

184
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:52,280
but he eats seeds. He is the seed eater, the seed drinker. He's the, Bill Maher is the seed drinker,

185
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:57,400
not the seed eater because he drinks them and shakes. Just do a mental auto replace. Next time

186
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,640
you see the name Bill Maher or hear the name Bill Maher, I'll give you a hint for where you'll

187
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:10,200
next hear the name Bill Maher on this show. Your exclusive home of bill Maher. Sorry. I made a

188
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,200
promise to myself not to bring him up again a couple of weeks ago. And then the seed thing

189
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,200
came up and I had no choice. You did it. Well, you made the promise to yourself. I don't think you

190
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:23,640
said it to us. I didn't know which is smart. No, I didn't break it. Yeah. Yeah. Almost immediately.

191
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,880
So it's good that don't tell your promises to others. That's the lesson here.

192
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,600
That's a weird, that's an interesting, weird thing to say. Moral. Yeah. Yeah. Don't tell your

193
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:42,360
promises. Put that on a shirt. It's like a wish. That's right. Let me explain. So here's how we,

194
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,920
we got here and then we'll get into what the thing actually is. But we were, we went through

195
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:52,600
everyone's responses to what should we do for Feliz Navidad the way of winter.

196
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:59,880
And one that we all sparked to was from Ken door with three Rs on Twitter. The response was

197
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:07,000
the giant seed that ejects mist when you rub it. There's a lot contained in that. We'd never

198
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
heard of that. Has anybody, you guys have been a little more than me. Does this sound familiar at

199
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:18,040
all? I've seen it. I didn't touch it. I knew as soon as I heard that I went what? And then I went

200
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:24,280
back and looked and I went, Oh, and then I know exactly what it was. Yeah. So we had this to

201
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:29,400
unpack and me especially, cause it did not ring a bell with me. I was there pretty briefly. So

202
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:35,400
we'll start explaining what that is. But, but credit to two other people who tweeted the same

203
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:42,280
suggestion, but with very different phrasing and both of their tweets unlock new information about

204
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:47,720
the big seed, which is some of some of which being that it's not a big seed. Anyway, what we're

205
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:57,240
actually talking about here is called the Flaska Reclinata. And it is part, it is one of the more

206
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:05,560
prominent, interesting interactive parts of the Pandoran landscape in animal kingdom. Some of which

207
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,960
that was some of the impetus is like, well, if we talk about the big seed, we can also talk about

208
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:15,080
the beauty of this land. One of the most impressive, because we've talked about the

209
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:20,600
attractions, but we've not necessarily talked about just like the stuff and the vibe, all of the things

210
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:28,040
that aren't the attractions, which is like maybe the best stuff about Pandora. No, no knock on the

211
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:33,640
attractions, which are fantastic, but just, just being there, just looking at it is incredible.

212
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:39,720
Yes. So yes, this was a good opportunity to talk about that. Now, will we have time? I don't know.

213
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,160
We can't, I just, we can't know for sure. We don't know for sure. It depends on how much we have to say about

214
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:52,680
the Flaska Reclinata. I, I got a DM about this too. And I feel like, somebody slid in your DMs to talk

215
00:21:52,680 --> 00:22:00,280
about rubbing seeds. Someone I know. He's, but the phrase, and I saw other people mention it this way

216
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:04,200
too. It's like, Hey, you should talk about that big phallic thing that ejaculates on guests,

217
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:12,280
that giant phallus that you can like slam. You can pat a lot and then it'll spritz. I mean, yes. Okay.

218
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:18,520
Now that we're right in vulgar town, it's a giant phallus with an open sore that you rub, you rub the

219
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:25,080
sore out of here. And maybe this is who DM'd you and maybe not. I mean, just, this is about a lot

220
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:29,400
of people might care, characterize it. This is Dylan on Twitter. The third attract, you should

221
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:34,040
talk about the third attraction of Pandora, the big plant that you jerk off and it ejaculates on

222
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:41,880
the other guests. This wasn't the sole observation. Many people have noted, but Mike, you've brought

223
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:48,440
an interesting new facet into this, which is that it, the where the, that the stimulation comes from

224
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:53,080
a big open sore. Yeah. That's the, okay. So it's like, it's like, if you don't know what we're

225
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:58,840
talking about, it's sort of, it's a tilted giant, I would say almost like a closed mouth of a Venus

226
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:03,960
fly trap. That's sort of the look of it. And it's kind of tilted like a, a cannon. It's like the

227
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:09,720
shape of a cannon and leaned up like a cannon and it's massive. It's huge. It's like what, 20 feet

228
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:15,640
in the air or something. It's a very, very significant size, 20 feet long, 15 feet high.

229
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:22,040
Yeah, that makes sense. And it's right when you come in to the, to the land, what do, the,

230
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:27,960
the first like entrance, if you're sort of just making your way around clockwise around animal

231
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:33,080
like if you're the, I get lost geographically in this part, but you're, I think maybe if you're

232
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:40,680
nearest to the tree of life and to kind of the hub as much as there is a hub. I believe. Okay.

233
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:46,920
If you're by Tiffin's, that's the entrance there. Yeah. So it's, it's pretty prominent

234
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:53,640
and I'll be honest, I didn't think it was phallic until all this. And now I can not, not see it.

235
00:23:54,280 --> 00:24:00,920
Well, we should also mention the nickname, uh, kind of adds to the, the boardiness.

236
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,520
So confused by the nickname. Baja tickler.

237
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:11,400
It's the bar and this is just tossed off so casual flask and the flask of reclinata also known as the

238
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:18,200
Baja tickler. It like, huh? Every, I feel like no article or blog post or anything that I saw this

239
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:25,560
and noted how weird that is the Baja tickler. Why is it that that's not Baja is not a magical

240
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:33,240
Pandorin place. That's a place in Mexico. That's our world. Why? And the name that could not be

241
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:42,600
more like, I mean, it's, it's either it's in that like, uh, donkey punch type, like sex move name,

242
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:48,600
or it sounds sort of like a dildo. Well, yeah, it, to me it sounded like, um,

243
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:54,920
a movie set in the forties or fifties and like a character is going like, oh, we went to a stag

244
00:24:54,920 --> 00:25:01,000
party last night. They had a bunch of Tijuana Bibles. They had Baja ticklers. Yeah. It was nasty.

245
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:08,120
I really, uh, did you see the monorail thing that came out that looks like a dildo?

246
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,760
What's up? You can buy it at one of the gift shops. There's a, I forget even what it is,

247
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:17,320
but it's basically a big green monorail that looks like a dildo. That's a green,

248
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:21,720
a monorail has never been green, has it? Let me look, I'll send it to you right now, but yes,

249
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:27,080
that's just, that's in the air right now as well. Um, but this is a strange, I found on the, uh,

250
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:34,280
Pandora Wiki that like a lot of these, like they have official names, which like is fake

251
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:39,800
Latin kind of, and then they have more of an English sounding name. Yeah. Which is the format

252
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:47,880
of that. The cron is what they call it and Banshee is what we call it. Something that I found annoying

253
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:54,200
the first time around the bend on all this stuff, but now I think it's a little neat that they,

254
00:25:55,160 --> 00:26:01,640
it kind of fleshes out the, you know, you're actually, uh, wandering around and trying to

255
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:08,280
identify flora and fauna in a, in a, in a natural park type environment. It does, you do go, well,

256
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:13,880
that is what a real place would do. There's the slang term and there's the, the stuffy term.

257
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:20,040
Right. There's a, there's a, I was on the, on that same wookie, there's, um, like a giant mushroom

258
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:26,600
in the land and it's called a fungimonium giganteum, also known as an octoshroom.

259
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:35,800
I like that. Which is fun. And it seems more, that seems right to me versus the Baja Tickler.

260
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:44,440
This one, this, I'm confused where Baja Tickler came from. Are we sure this is officially handed

261
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:49,640
down? Did James Cameron approve the term Baja Tickler? That's the one, that's the page I was on.

262
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:57,400
So I don't know if that was added by some, uh, rambunctious prankster or yeah, or that's some

263
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:06,360
sort of official copy. I, I found it on Pandorapedia. Okay. That's okay. And then they had the,

264
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:12,920
the Navi name and then the taxonomy in quotes, it says that the Navi translation is poison

265
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:20,040
squirting plant. And then the, the translation of like the human one is reclining flasks.

266
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:24,600
If you Google Baja Tickler, it comes up on a different, like it comes up on the fandom

267
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:32,600
site for Avatar. Um, and it is not oddly, it's not leading us to some type of pornography that we

268
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:38,600
were not previously aware of. This, this, they aren't like trying to like Trojan horse. Uh,

269
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,520
I don't think this isn't like an old, like the anime animators putting in a frame of porn

270
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:46,520
agro. I don't think so. I mean, maybe it is, but that's just the design of the thing. But

271
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:52,600
if you keep scrolling down, like it doesn't get to porno quickly, it gets to a little bit of a

272
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:59,240
barricade. Yeah. There's a motorcycle called a Tijuana tickler. Uh, there's yeah, there's,

273
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:05,560
I don't see any porno on this first search result page. Well, that's pretty impressive.

274
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:10,680
So the bar tickler, I mean, I'm impressed that there's, there's theme park mythology and a

275
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:18,200
dual word I've never found before, but doesn't, you mean, I kind of wonder if like, what if it is,

276
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,840
what if it is like one imagineer kind of pulling a fast one on everybody and this,

277
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:30,520
the Baja tickler was like his move, a sexual move called the Baja tickler, where there's nothing

278
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:36,680
inherently dirty about the name, but there's like one person out there or maybe all of the other

279
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:41,320
people who were pleasured by the Baja tickler, that there's only a select group of people who

280
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:47,880
all, if they see that or know that they go, I know what this is. I've experienced a Baja tickler.

281
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,960
This is a, some sort of sex move that Joe roadie learned when he was traveling overseas.

282
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:58,280
It was given to him by someone in a village somewhere and he took it and made it part of

283
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:02,040
his own repertoire and now wanted to at least have it represented in some way.

284
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:07,400
It's passed down. It's like a long storied history, three, 3000 years. This has been

285
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:15,560
the most satisfying sexual maneuver. Very possible. I mean, people sneak things in all the time,

286
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:23,480
like the, what's the, what's the, the body, the casting couch stuff, like in California

287
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,480
adventure and all that stuff. Although that's barely sneaking stuff in. I'll be like, that's

288
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:32,520
not, yeah, that's just for people. Just were not sensitive to what that actually means. Yeah. Now

289
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:38,280
look, the Baja, you know, I don't want to put Baja tickler in that territory because the tickler could

290
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:44,840
be a wonderful, consensual, deeply pleasurable if it exists. And if it doesn't exist, then it's up

291
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:52,440
to you, the listener, if you feel free to take something that you do that does not have a term

292
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:58,360
and this term is maybe waiting to, it's waiting to be grabbed. It's waiting to be grabbed. It's

293
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:02,760
waiting to be grabbed. Cause if you look, if you search Baja tickler sex, nothing comes up. It's

294
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:08,440
not nothing comes up that has those three words in it. So yeah, this is wide open. This is a,

295
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:14,440
make your mark. It's, it seems really weird to, I, I would like to see the official Disney literature

296
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:20,120
that uses the term Baja tickler because it at least feels like somebody would have flagged it. Like

297
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:27,480
doesn't that kind of sound like something? Yeah. California is not, you know, terribly far away,

298
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:34,200
which is just the strip of it is not California. It is called Baja California, but it is a state

299
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:43,480
in Mexico. And it's also where much of Titanic was filmed, which makes you wonder, is the facility

300
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:51,320
set up by James Cameron himself to have oceanic proximity to be able to flood big pieces of the

301
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:57,560
Titanic over and over. And then it stayed open. It was called Fox studios Baja for a while. It was

302
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:03,880
actually a themed attraction. You could go there and tour set. It was a little mini studio tour.

303
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:08,520
And then I think the area got too seedy for a while for them to do this. But I think now it's

304
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:12,680
been on the, the mend and they're shooting stuff there again, but it's not owned by Fox anymore.

305
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:18,600
And thus not owned by Disney. They didn't buy the Baja studios, but that's the only thing that makes

306
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:24,760
me wonder if somehow there is a James Cameron connection here. If he is, he, he, he did much of

307
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:30,440
his most famous work in Baja. Maybe it was, they called the Baja tickler like the stick James

308
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:36,120
Cameron would hit actors with when they would flub their lines. Maybe that's, there's some sort

309
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:41,480
of inside joke there or the, the, like, maybe it was an electrified stick that he would like

310
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:47,320
stick into the water really fast, just to like give everybody a jolt before the next take.

311
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:56,440
Yeah. Little sleepy Winslet. He's the real way of water for you. Yeah. So it could be any of these

312
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:04,600
options. My mind has been blown by the recent information that the K Winslet at the very

313
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:10,920
unpleasant time making Titanic and specifically the, like the James Cameron was a tyrant and crazy

314
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:16,360
to work for you. She spoke publicly about this and all of the water stuff was so unpleasant to do

315
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:24,840
cut to she's not only in the way of water in the water. She bested Tom Cruise's record for

316
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:32,200
underwater shooting. Yes. Seven minutes and 13 seconds or something. She not only like hate

317
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:38,360
James Cameron plus water, never again. These things came back, did it better than anybody's

318
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:43,640
ever done it. Say, you know, people change their minds and maybe James may get a good pitch,

319
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:48,120
get a good pitch to her. Hey, look, she was married to Sam Mendes for a while. Maybe she's like,

320
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:54,680
Hey, you, you weren't that bad after all my man. Does he have a Baja tickler? I mean, I don't even

321
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:59,240
know. I don't know. I just think he's a really, he's like an intense director, right? Movie and

322
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:05,560
theater director may, I actually don't know to be with, with a lot of these folks. Yeah. She's a pro.

323
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:11,160
I love it. She's great. She's amazing. Yes. Yeah. She's joint, like the cast additions in this new,

324
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:17,400
as we, yeah, we're in our final days of speculation of what's happening in the new one. And you,

325
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:23,560
but we know we get her, we know we get Jemaine Clement, we get Vin Diesel. I was so excited

326
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:28,280
about Vin. That's great. I have no idea what Vin Diesel is doing. Really excited to figure it out.

327
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,640
And we also get, this is a quick, I forget if, did I text this to you guys or apologies if I

328
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:39,000
already did, but this is so bizarre that here's a little, this thing, this came out in an interview

329
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,920
or something. James Cameron was talking about, because Sigourney Weaver is back, not as Dr.

330
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:50,600
Grace Augustine, but a new character who is an adopted daughter of Jake and Nateri. She's a

331
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:58,280
15 year old Navi girl. And okay, so adopted. Okay. That's all right. So not the, not the biological

332
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:05,080
child of Jake and Nateri. Okay. So then what, where, where did Kiri come from then? Listen to this.

333
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:11,160
She, she's naturally conceived, she's a naturally conceived Navi raised in the rainforest. It's just

334
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:18,920
that she's born of Grace's avatar. Cameron explains. It's a natural birth, but the avatar is brain dead,

335
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:26,680
but she's not. She's normal. What the hell does that mean? Okay. So just to clarify, and if you

336
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:32,600
aren't super avatar familiar Sigourney Weaver's, wait Sigourney Weaver, human character in the

337
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:41,320
first movie who died while in a Navi avatar body. Right. So that presents some questions. If you die

338
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:46,760
in that body, what happens to your body? What happens to that body? So that means the new

339
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:52,440
character, it's not an accident that it's Sigourney Weaver playing her. They are related, but it's a

340
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:58,680
natural birth, but the avatar is brain dead, but she's not. Okay. Why is she,

341
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:05,480
okay. Was the character pregnant at the time of death? Is that what the implication? Dr.

342
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:13,400
Grace Augustine the av in avatar form? No. Okay. Okay. Here's here quickly. This might not even

343
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:19,160
be explained in this movie. This might be backstories. Okay. Here's okay. The, the avatar

344
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:26,920
bodies are Navi and they are created in a lab. So human beings are able to transfer their

345
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:34,360
consciousness into them. Yes. Yes. Because the Jake's avatar was made with Navi DNA and his

346
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:39,800
brother's DNA. So it had to match and he's a twin. So that way he could, that's why he could get it,

347
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:44,040
but not just anybody could go into any of these avatars. Yes. And it's an empty vessel for

348
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:51,480
a human. Basically it's not like you're taking over the consciousness of a Navi. Right. And the Navi

349
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:57,880
did like a spiritual ceremony that like glued his consciousness in the avatar at the end of the

350
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:04,520
first movie. Yes. He's perma. Yeah. He's perma. He's perma avatar. So if I, perma Navi, so if I

351
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:11,720
understand correctly, what would have to happen for that scenario is that Sigourney Weaver in her,

352
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:17,720
when she was in the avatar would have had to make love with another, maybe real avatar, maybe,

353
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:23,640
or a real Navi. This is, I made this mistake like every time I've talked about it. Yeah. Or another

354
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:27,880
avatar got like a human, it could have been a human in another, because the bodies biologically

355
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:33,400
are the same as Navi. Yes. So she would have had to get knocked up as a Navi. Which is so crazy

356
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:38,120
that it's like a, so it's fully functioning. That means, do we know that? Do we know that if you're

357
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:44,200
in an avatar of a Navi that your sperm works or whatever they call it? That I think has to be

358
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:49,800
addressed in this new movie because they suddenly have two kids. Yes. So we know they've adopted one,

359
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:55,000
but he got the, but he's a perma now. So maybe the ceremony made it so that his sperm works,

360
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:04,040
but it maybe it didn't before until the ceremony. If you were only temporarily going to be a Navi,

361
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:09,800
it would be highly irresponsible to get a female Navi pregnant. It would be highly,

362
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,720
and then you get out of there, you leave, I guess you could go on Pandora's a human and help,

363
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:19,320
but sorry, but that's tough. How do you, then you're like, you're raising a baby. It's much,

364
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:25,720
it's as big as you. I mean, that's, that's funny though. Six feet tall. That's you can't,

365
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:31,160
and you have, you have to raise it through a foggy mask. That should be, because you can't breathe.

366
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:35,960
Humans can't breathe on avatar. Hold that note for later. Remember that when we get back onto

367
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:40,840
topic, that should be a fun, that should be one of the movies like four or five where like a human

368
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:46,920
has got to raise a bunch of babe, a bunch of Navi baby, a three men and a three men and a Navi baby.

369
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:53,800
That's right. Three avatars and a Navi. No, I guess it's men. It has to be, and it should be

370
00:37:53,800 --> 00:38:01,000
honestly, Tom Selleck, Steve Gutenberg and Ted dancing. Yes. Yes. That's the way.

371
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:05,560
And then it doesn't matter. Then it's all mo cap within like they'll seem as vibrant as

372
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:11,320
when the first three came out. Well, okay. Let's I'll change it. The three very old men and

373
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:18,280
a little Navi lady. Ted's tall. They're all a little tall, maybe except for Gutenberg. So they're,

374
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:23,560
they're off to a good start, but still you're changing diapers. It's going to be tough.

375
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:30,760
Gonna be tough. Um, I anyway, isn't that, that's a, that's one of the things that we're all going

376
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:36,120
to discover in a few days. What the hell does that mean? So wait to, to finish it out really quick.

377
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:42,440
So is she got deducted Sigourney Weaver avatar get impregnated. The body was dead,

378
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:48,840
but the baby was still born. Thus it has Navi DNA and the DNA of Dr. Grace Augustine. That's what

379
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:54,280
it would have to, I mean, and it also would have had to happen off camera in the first avatar.

380
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:58,920
I think it will be something where it was like the child was born in a fraction of her consciousness.

381
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:04,680
She doesn't have the full knowledge. She's not doctor, but this child is kind of hurt.

382
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,840
What are you saying? No, that was, that was dense.

383
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:12,280
I think like the child is born and there's a fraction of the Grace Augustine consciousness.

384
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,440
In the child or what are you talking about? In the child.

385
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:18,600
So you think it's not genes passed down. You think some of grace is in Kiri.

386
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:23,320
Well, that would explain that. I think that's justifies why Sigourney Weaver is doing the voice.

387
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,320
Well, isn't it just because she's the daughter, the related.

388
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,200
Yeah, I think it's just because they're related.

389
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:34,200
Okay. But I like that. I do like that as we discussed, she's not a doctor.

390
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:39,240
This young girl is not a doctor. But maybe she goes up to the.

391
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:44,680
You know what? That's my knee jerk, but we are in the avatar world here. That could very,

392
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:49,000
Jason's premise could very well be. I think we're getting wild with these movies.

393
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,520
I, yeah. I look, there's like half a dozen instances of stuff like this in the X-Men world

394
00:39:54,520 --> 00:40:00,040
where it's like, Oh, this character has lived a dozen times and they remember every time they lived

395
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:05,720
or like, okay, this character died and their friend who was like kind of a robot died.

396
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:09,960
But then the robot came back, but then the human's consciousness was in the road.

397
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:14,360
And I just like nine or 10 year old me. It was like, okay, got it. Sounds good.

398
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,480
Got, yep. I'm on board.

399
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:21,560
Schoolwork. I will not do, but this, I will do this homework for the rest of my life.

400
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:27,480
Long division by hand. No, no. Doug Locke, the merger of Doug Ramsey and Warlock. Yes, please.

401
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,800
X-Men also has a long history of blue characters.

402
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,160
Lot of blue. Yeah.

403
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,200
A lot of blue and some of them are related. Some of them aren't.

404
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,760
Yeah. Who's wait. Oh, Nightcrawler Mystique.

405
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:45,080
Yeah. You know, if the movies are starting to do multiverse stuff, you got to remember Rebecca Romaine

406
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:52,760
is the old older version of Jennifer Lawrence. And also Alan Cummings is their son.

407
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,320
Really? Alan Cumming?

408
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,760
Alan Cumming. Is he a singular?

409
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,880
Is it singular? Alan Cumming?

410
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,000
It is kind of, yeah. Okay.

411
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,640
It's singular. Okay. Sorry. Yes, that's true. Jason's correct, but they have,

412
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,800
they screwed a lot of the time.

413
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,840
They, there's, it's all kind of, yeah.

414
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,800
Sorry. Yeah. So it upsets me. You know, it's not like the comics.

415
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:17,960
So we've established that the name is gross and we've established, maybe let's fully explain that

416
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:22,680
this, because it's only been described as a sore, but if you're going to take that out of it, what

417
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:29,160
this is, you know, really this is in the grand tradition of Disney interactive water elements.

418
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:35,960
Ultimately, it's a thing that squirts water onto the guest and it mists. Does it,

419
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,160
actually does it just mist or does it, is there a water spray?

420
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:43,800
Mist, I was trying to remember, it looks like a mist from the videos and I'm trying to remember

421
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:49,960
if I ever stood under it and I don't think I did, but I think it's mostly just a mist.

422
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:54,040
It's not like a hard, it's not like on the Dudley Do-Right ride or anything.

423
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,960
It's a mist and then there's inevitably some drops.

424
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,200
There's, oh sure, there's going to be drops, yeah.

425
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:05,000
But it is like to, to activate it, there is like a little hole in the side.

426
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,560
On the shaft, you might say. Yeah.

427
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:14,680
You might rub the shaft towards the bottom of the shaft, but it's kind of like, it's sort of like a

428
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:20,920
pink, this is a little help. You go to the pink part, go to the pink part and rub it. Although

429
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:25,880
I've also seen, it seems like from a lot of videos, tapping is also in the cards.

430
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:32,040
In fact, I think there might be more mist, the more hands you get on the thing.

431
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:37,400
So the more surface you can cover of the pink, the more.

432
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:43,000
Spray. The more pink you can grab, the more it will spray.

433
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,960
Yes. This is, they did, first of all, they did this.

434
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,320
Yes. We're just discussing.

435
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:51,480
We're just, everything we described is applicable. That is how you would describe this.

436
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,920
This is not a reach.

437
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,000
No. There's a big long thing.

438
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,520
A reach around is something you might do to get extra pink.

439
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:02,920
But we're just explaining what they did. So don't be mad at us if you don't want the

440
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:06,040
bodiness on this episode. It's their fault.

441
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:11,800
So it, you know, it is what I like about this to bring it back to more innocent. I like it.

442
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:19,320
It feels like a, the like next evolution of, you know, the sprinkler and the honey,

443
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:26,760
I shrunk the kids area, but it's this, but it's a thing that is not a stretch in the world of avatar

444
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:35,560
and that adds to the diverse ecological life of a beautiful area. It's a, it's a grand piece of

445
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:39,080
sculptury, whatever you want to call it. It's very impressive.

446
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:43,160
Story line wise, it is important to.

447
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:49,080
Okay. Let me hear, let me transition. Let me read the other suggestion of somebody who said we

448
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:58,760
should talk about this. Okay. So this was from Marquez. I want a whole episode on the flask

449
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:05,880
of Reclinada, the plant that allows humans to breathe on Pandora. So, whoa, that too,

450
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:11,960
most people gave it to us from the gross angle, but now on top of that, this is how we,

451
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:15,640
this thing is the key to that. We can walk around in this place.

452
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,520
Yes. It's very important.

453
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,640
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it should really, we shouldn't be making fun of it.

454
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:28,040
No, honestly, it's how, that's it. All right. No more. No, we will not have fun with this.

455
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:35,640
It absorbs toxins from the atmosphere. Yes. Yeah. Absorbs condenses, purifies atmospheric

456
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:42,200
toxins. So it like, it's like, it would be poisonous if you got just the raw spit on you,

457
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:49,240
that might be bad, but just that it like takes in what we can't breathe. It gets a little muddy

458
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:56,840
here because how can the difference be split? How can we be there as well as the Navi if we breathe

459
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:02,280
different things? Well, how, oh, that's a good question. How do the Navi, what do they breathe?

460
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:06,440
Do we know off the top of our heads? Good. Don't know what the air is made of. Yeah.

461
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:12,520
Because obviously I'm smart. I know we read oxygen and we exhale carbon dioxide and plants

462
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:17,800
are, this is, this is the length of how much I know about this. Plants do a similar, they take

463
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:24,200
the carbon dioxide and they put oxygen into the atmosphere, into the world. And that's good for

464
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:31,000
humans. So that's the extent of my knowledge about this topic. But yeah, what do Navi breathe? What

465
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:37,160
is the, it is, uh, it's okay. It's a mixture of there's, there is oxygen and carbon dioxide,

466
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:43,240
but also nitrogen and there is a high amount of xenon and the xenon makes it denser than the

467
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:50,360
atmosphere on earth. And the xenon is why we can't, we aren't able to, we aren't accustomed to this.

468
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:56,280
So just xenon. Xenon is the problem. Xenon, maybe some methane. So does the, does the,

469
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:02,200
Baja tickler take the xenon out of the air? I think it takes stuff out of the air, purifies it

470
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:08,440
and then expels it as water. Okay. So liquid can be poisoned by the way,

471
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:13,480
cause they exist on just oxygen, oxygen and not xenon.

472
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:21,160
So maybe what it does is like get the levels to where it's acceptable for everybody. Right.

473
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:28,840
There's some xenon, but less. So we're okay. But the xenon that the Navi crave,

474
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:34,280
it's all is still there. Yeah. So it was a little, a little trace amounts of xenon.

475
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:38,360
Yeah. And by zine, I want to be clear that xenon with an X, not xenon with a Z,

476
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:46,200
like the Disney channel original film, xenon girl of the 21st century, which is a movie I watched

477
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:52,680
and enjoyed in the late nineties, early 2000s. That's one of the top ones. I think with a,

478
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:59,160
you never seen any of this, Mike, actually haven't. I don't think there's a, a, a future pop star in

479
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:06,040
it named protozoa. Cause the main reason I like the movie does a song called the galaxy is ours.

480
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:12,520
Oh, wow. Sounds great. Shout out to all the pro zoa fans out there. It's the same format as like,

481
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:16,760
where they're kind of like chasing through the move, just like who's the goofy movie power line.

482
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:22,440
Power line. Yeah. Yes. Xenon has a power line. Wow. And it's protozoa protozoa, a big performance

483
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:26,600
at the end power lines. Been having a moment these last, this last year or two, I feel like,

484
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:31,480
and protozoa is I think ripe for protozoa is due. Yeah. That's what I mean. Box lunch,

485
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:38,280
protozoa merchandise. That's what I'm saying. Um, so yeah, maybe that's what it is. It's just,

486
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:43,080
it just like evens things out so everybody can breathe. Everybody's happy, which is,

487
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:48,440
which reflects the world that we find ourselves in plot wise. When we go to Pandora and animal

488
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:55,240
kingdom where the wars are over, it's really a big spoiler for the entire franchise as if we needed

489
00:47:55,240 --> 00:48:01,640
to look, we know the Navi are going to win. We know that the, the RDA doesn't stand a chance

490
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:07,080
and the Corritch is going no matter what kind of body he's in, Corritch is going home with his

491
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:12,680
ass handed to him. Right. Uh, but it's, isn't it nice to know that like, oh, for sure the wars end

492
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:17,320
everybody's living in peace and enjoying Satuli bowls together. Oh my God. It would be great if

493
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:21,640
we knew like, oh, all this stuff will work out here. Wouldn't that be great? Yeah. So knowing

494
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:27,880
just in one of our favorite fictional universes, same way. Yeah. If there was some way to, if we

495
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:34,680
could all get giant seeds to depurify, to purify our atmosphere and take out all the stuff we

496
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:40,200
aren't going to want, it's going to hurt us as the years go by. Okay. Get that guy, you know,

497
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:45,320
that guy, you know, must get him on building some Baja ticklers or growing some Baja ticklers.

498
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:50,840
He'll look into it. I think if somebody just presents him with a shady looking website that

499
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:56,120
has nebulous information on it, he'll start taking it seriously. Yeah. And I think maybe he'll,

500
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:59,400
he'll say something along the lines of like, I'll stop growing these. I'll grow these. Yeah. We

501
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,600
should start growing these 10 years. We'll have a million of them. Yeah.

502
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:09,720
Yeah. So, Elon, you might want to invest in this. This is a big plant and all, as long as it is

503
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:16,760
misting and as long as you're rubbing its shaft, it's fine. This will fix global warming. You just

504
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:20,760
get enough of these around the planet. Oh, I don't know. It doesn't seem, it seems kind of

505
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:28,360
sus, basic, doesn't it? LOL. Well, it was, let's just lie to him. It was made up by white supremacists.

506
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,800
Oh, sounds good. All right. I'm in. I mean, I'll do it after the phone. After I make a phone.

507
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:41,080
He's going to make a phone. The crazy. It's ER. Did you not see that? I saw it. Oh my God.

508
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:46,040
I saw it. A phone, a phone we can do racism on. And one of the, it's one of those things where

509
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:51,480
it's like, well, Apple and Google, they're going to be quaking in their boots. Someone opens a,

510
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:56,680
like, like the gun theme rest of the Lauren Bobert gun themed restaurant that served food

511
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:02,760
poisoning as their main course. And they're like, watch out McDonald's, watch out Olive

512
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:09,880
Cardin. This is going to be taken the nation by storm. If you can convince Elon that there is it

513
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:18,120
elsewhere, that there is a woke Baja tickler out there that he could, he could crush the business

514
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:26,360
of, then he'll get going on his, no problem. Humanity saved. Let's talk about, that is a

515
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:34,360
that's a, a person, a so-called visionary who we don't like very much, but there is somebody who

516
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:40,520
we should talk a little about who I think, well, I don't want to say we've underrated this person.

517
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:46,760
It's just, we don't know much about him. The person's name is Zolt Hormay. Zolt Hormay is

518
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:51,800
introduced in the Imagineering story. And it wasn't a name that I knew before. I don't know

519
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:57,960
if you guys remember this, that in one of the last few episodes you meet the guy who is the

520
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:04,840
fake rock guy. You see him, I believe in action, putting together radiator Springs,

521
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:11,640
which of course won the fake rock final four. If you look at the whole fake rock final four list,

522
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:18,760
most of them were touched by Zolt Hormay. Most of them were the doing of this guy who,

523
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:26,200
first things first, the coolest name ever. Zolt very well could have been the pop star who

524
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:34,440
xenon girl of the 21st century was trying to go see. Love Zolt Hormay. Just a little, okay. So

525
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:39,160
basically like all of that, all of that Pandoran atmosphere this guy was responsible for. Here's

526
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:48,680
this guy's career. He's 23 and he leaves Hungary, comes to America, you know, in search of satisfying

527
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:54,520
his artistic existence, ends up getting a job for a company in Lansing, Michigan, who is making a

528
00:51:54,520 --> 00:52:01,320
miniature golf course. And he so excels in creating this miniature golf course that he is snatched up

529
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:07,000
by Disney. The first thing he works on Typhoon Lagoon, the mountain in Typhoon Lagoon is where

530
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:13,000
he starts. That's wild. And he's in his early twenties still. First thing I gave was a fake

531
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:19,480
rock final four contender. Then he moves on to Honey I Shrunk the Kids play set. He's part of that.

532
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:27,080
Then he does all of the rock work at Disney Paris, which we said for its faults, beautiful in terms

533
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:31,480
of the natural, the environments and the surroundings, which means they're big thunder,

534
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:38,360
the most beautiful big thunder he works on. Then he does Toontown in Anaheim and Tokyo. Then he

535
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:45,720
leaves, runs his own company for 12 years or so. Then Radiator Springs is on the horizon. They're

536
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:52,840
like, there's only one guy who can do this. We got to get Zolt. Zolt comes back and stays where he

537
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:59,080
does, wait, I might be wrong with the order. Well, some, oh wait, I missed some things. Tree of Life.

538
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:04,760
Oh wow. Mysterious Island, the volcano in Disney Sea. And then he sticks around and he does the

539
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:09,880
Cadillac Mountain Range in Cars Land. He does the new rock work at Rivers of America,

540
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:15,960
which and that transition into Galaxy's Edge. He of course does Galaxy's Edge as well. Then all this

541
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:24,040
Avatar stuff. Will you take in that body of like how much of our lives are truly built by Zoltor

542
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:29,800
May and the people who he hires and the care that's like all-star stuff from when we were kids and

543
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:33,960
then leaves for a little bit, comes back and does the best stuff they've done for the last 15 years.

544
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:39,560
That is, yeah, he's yeah, like a low-key legend at this point. Yeah. Just because the atmosphere is

545
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:43,800
so important. Only not a legend because there's not more of him because he jumped out at me from

546
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:49,400
that imaginary. He's still like cool name, cool accent. Yeah. Then I've found another little bit

547
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:55,240
of interviews and stuff and he is just like chill, non-pretentious, travel buddies with roadie. Like

548
00:53:55,240 --> 00:54:00,040
they're going all the crazy Asian countries together like exploring, you know, to figure out

549
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:04,200
animal kingdom influences. This guy rules. Do we know has he been fired?

550
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:13,240
Is he still there? I hope not or if he or I hope Universal has snatched him up ASAP. Yeah, I wonder.

551
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:19,320
I think they know this guy. You can't like, do they know? Maybe they don't. Did they know with the

552
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:24,600
old regime? Yeah, yeah. Or does or if somehow he slips through the cracks. They retired roadie pretty

553
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:30,120
good pretty quickly. Yeah, that's yeah. When you look back at how many of the major people who left,

554
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:34,440
Bob Weiss left, all these people kind of coincidentally like, yeah, something about now

555
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:40,440
feels like the time. A lot of old imagineers I feel like are dancing on the grave at the moment.

556
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:45,960
Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Oh, that one, Tom Morris, who's great on Twitter. This is all weeks ago,

557
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:50,040
by the time you're hearing this, but like Tom Morris are like great, cool, thoughtful,

558
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:57,240
imagineer, built a lot of the best stuff, 80s, 90s. He just flat out said, you know, every other CEO

559
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:02,600
or head of parks came around and asked everybody what they do and about their history and what they

560
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:07,480
contributed to the company and their story. And Shape X, the first guy who didn't. So I don't think

561
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:11,960
a lot of people are going to be too sad about all this. Yeah. Crazy to just, you know, it's bad if

562
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:18,680
people are because people shit talk. The people who are in Pat, you know, you know, like they're

563
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:22,680
everybody shit talks to everybody, but sometimes it's quiet. So if you're willing to do it,

564
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:29,000
I would do it at public. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, I've seen a couple other ones say stuff immediately

565
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:35,160
too. So yeah, I think it's a consensus, but Zolt, I want to know, is he there or is he not? I hope

566
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:39,240
so. And if he's not, I hope he's off on some other great event. By the way, as if this guy wasn't

567
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:44,600
cool enough, a lot of the teams that he assembles for all of these projects, for the best projects

568
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:51,160
the company does, he makes it a point to seek out and involve native American students to work

569
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:56,600
with him, shadow him. He like very actively finds native American talent who build a lot of the

570
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:02,840
stuff that we love so much. Zolt's the best. Where is he? Let's get him on here. Yeah. Yeah.

571
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:09,240
We can go park by Flower Street and count the 30 people going into the Imagineering building.

572
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:14,360
Who's left? Who's left? Yeah. And if he has some novelty, if there's a license,

573
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:19,560
novelty license plate, that's like King of Rocks, Rock Guy, Rock Man, number one rock.

574
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:24,760
I don't know. I feel like those always cut me off like on the freeway.

575
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:32,680
Yeah. Rock is probably all taken by douchebag. I don't know how you figured out how to do a crazy

576
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:39,000
maneuver, crazy maneuver on a road where you're allowed to go 65 miles per hour. But I wasn't

577
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:44,840
going fast enough. Highway to hell blasting. Yeah. Cool. I don't want to get us off, but

578
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:52,040
the rumors are, Jason, that you won the Lake Nona move is dead. That's the rumor. Not my intent.

579
00:56:54,760 --> 00:57:01,400
Not your intent, but you're doing 100%. 100% you're doing. That I'm not sure who wins in this.

580
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:06,520
It'll likely just be an empty. Well, now that everyone's either quit or been fired,

581
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:12,280
at this point, there's not by default. It's muddy who, what the 15 people who work there are

582
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:17,720
not forced to move to Lake Nona. It's like there's tons of office space in Burbank. Like there is,

583
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:25,720
there is a massive like skyscraper buildings for record companies going up along the one freeway.

584
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:30,360
And it's like, how are you going to fill the, like who's going in here? Yeah. This is so much.

585
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:35,960
Fill it up with Imagineers. Stuff by the airport and. Isn't there an Eiger like town hall?

586
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:40,360
We're recording this couple of weeks before it's coming out, but isn't there some sort of Eiger,

587
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:43,960
like town hall? Are we allowed to ask questions? Are we allowed to ask questions to this?

588
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:50,360
I don't know. Well, maybe if we buy each by one share, can we dial in and ask questions?

589
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:54,760
I want to ask questions. Well, if by any, if you, weeks ago you heard an emergency that we got on,

590
00:57:54,760 --> 00:58:00,840
like, wow, Mike's been real lucky. He got in that, he got in that Instagram live with

591
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:07,160
Mazury and a little less importantly, a town hall with Bob Eiger.

592
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:11,800
Hey everyone. I just want to say, I'm sorry. I panicked and asked why that cheese cup I had

593
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:17,880
in California Adventure wasn't great a year and a half ago. Really sorry about that. Hadn't thought

594
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:22,280
about it since then, but. Why are all the hot dogs the same at the different restaurants in

595
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:28,760
the Disneyland resort? We have proof. When are you going to make Rise of the Resistance

596
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:35,240
the same quality as Transformers? These are the questions we have to ask Bob Eiger now that he's

597
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:40,840
back. And he. People with the video cameras on are like looking confused. Like, who's this guy?

598
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:46,680
Or does weirdly, so that one bizarrely gets like suddenly like slow clap and then every

599
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:52,760
shareholder across the nation. He said it. He finds someone, a Spartacus finally said it.

600
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:58,280
It will Black Tap continued or will Ballast Point continue their

601
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:02,360
tyrannical price gouging? They're using at downtown Disney.

602
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:06,520
What are two places that use open table for some reason?

603
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:10,120
Well, that's a different topic as well. Yes. Well, there's these are important questions that he

604
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:14,440
needs to know. Well, Scott's beloved Katal restaurant. Will it maintain its essence

605
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:20,520
during this renovation? Well, that's see, I don't actually care about Katal. I care about the bar.

606
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,400
With the outdoor. Well, it's all sad.

607
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:27,800
A location they can tear over bar. They could blow up. It's all for like, I just give me that

608
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:31,800
uber bar. I guess we need their kitchen. So don't blow up their kitchen, right? Don't blow up the

609
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:38,280
kitchen. What else about the big plants that that that missed? You know, it's well, it's part of

610
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:47,880
Mike, you looked up some like other Pandora, uh, the flora. Yes. And I, what I didn't know is that

611
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:56,840
you can go, it's me. I kind of do this next time. I, you can go to avatar.com and on avatar.com

612
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:03,000
where you find information about how you can explore Pandora with Alpha Centauri expedition.

613
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:08,760
Of course you can download a PDF. That's a checklist of all of the different creatures and

614
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:15,240
plants that you can see when you go. It's like, it is like a little national park map. This thing is

615
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:20,600
great. It's really pushed out. You get good little like, uh, you know, like here's, there's

616
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:26,760
good little like many versions of everybody. And it tells you how many there are in the land. So

617
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:32,760
you have like a little game you can play that you can concertedly win. Like, Hey, there's, uh,

618
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:39,960
there's at least 12 goblin thistles in the Valley of Mawara. Go find all 12 goblin thistles.

619
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:43,960
And it's just interesting to know they actually did think about all this stuff, like that everything

620
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:49,560
as everything as a name and they, they repeat, but not so much to it. They don't repeat to the

621
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:53,880
point where you can tell they repeat. This is the road. Like this is roadie really making sure I

622
01:00:53,880 --> 01:01:02,200
feel like making sure that it fits into the animal kingdom. Like, I don't know, a template or whatever,

623
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:07,320
like it means making sure like it feels kind of like you're exploring, like you're on the expedition

624
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:12,280
to see our experts in Everest or you're seeing animals and the it's like that element, like a

625
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:17,720
PDF and making it feel like it's a scavenger hunt. You're discovering things makes it sort of all

626
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:22,440
feel similar in the same way. Now it's fictional. Obviously there's also that book. There's an avatar,

627
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:30,760
like Pandora's survival guide. It's like 260 pages, 262 pages, right? Like backstory and stuff,

628
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:37,320
like all the cannon that people argue about with star wars or Lord of the rings, like Cameron showed

629
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:42,120
up with that, you know, and all the people working on avatar, working on the land stuff.

630
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:46,520
When I was a kid and I realized that somebody had put this, I didn't have this conscious thought,

631
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:51,800
but when I realized people had put this much thought into mythology, I think the first time

632
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:57,160
I thought about it was when I got the Star Trek encyclopedia as a kid, which is big. It's not that

633
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:01,880
day. I still have it. And it was like an encyclopedia with all the things in the universe and like

634
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:07,560
what the warp speed meant and all that. And I was like, this is the coolest thing I've ever

635
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:14,120
read. Like this it's like, it's re, oh, it's all real. Huh? Okay. And like that blew my mind.

636
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:18,040
Like I, and then right around that time is when I was like, oh, there's a Klingon dictionary.

637
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:24,040
Someone, someone wrote the Klingon language, which I was like, this is amazing. Of course,

638
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:31,160
did I go and learn another human language that's on planet earth? No, but the idea that there was

639
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:36,920
his fake history and fake languages that were available to me to learn. Like fake rock. We

640
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:43,240
prefer fake rocks to real rocks. Really strange for fake languages. Really study why this is

641
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:49,720
such a similar human history. Very interesting. Just us being born in an era where there'd been

642
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:54,920
more media than ever before. It's weird where we just always like pointed in that direction.

643
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:59,640
I guess media centric, the comfort of narrative. Like there is, there is a beginning, middle,

644
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:05,800
and end of these world, you know, there they exist in uncomplicated worlds compared to real life.

645
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:10,040
That's probably part of it. I think it's probably also just that the way

646
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:15,240
you're like history, like your elementary school, third grade teacher, the way they presented

647
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:23,640
history was pretty dry and you go home and Star Trek was on and data is a robot and they're doing

648
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:28,680
cool stuff and there's crazy, the Borg and you're like, this is better than the story.

649
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:32,840
Closeups. You don't get any closeups of history. Yeah. So it's like,

650
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:36,440
cut it into a little thing for you. Your dumb kid brain is just like,

651
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:43,400
this is a better story than that story. I know this is vibrant and real. This history shit. What is that?

652
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:50,280
It is, it is. No one ever says the perspective of the kid. Like, you know, oh, this is a distraction.

653
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:55,160
Phones are a distraction. Back in the day, Tamagotchis were a distraction. Everything's

654
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:59,880
a distraction. You be more entertaining teacher. You get some stage presence,

655
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:03,000
take some classes in the summer. Take some improv. Take a couple improv.

656
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,560
Yeah, take a couple improv classes. Jason and I coach if you want to.

657
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:10,040
I've gone from begging for acting work to begging for improv coaching work on the show.

658
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:16,280
To make teachers as exciting as the TV. Yeah. Teachers have to be as exciting as the TV.

659
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:20,600
That's what we've really uncovered here. Jazz it up teachers.

660
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:23,160
Yeah. You know, you've been phoned in.

661
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:25,160
You be as entertaining as Tom Brokaw.

662
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:32,680
Yeah. Tom Brokaw. The most dynamic thing. Who's more entertaining than Tom Brokaw?

663
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:35,880
Yeah, really. To Jason. To young Jason.

664
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:43,720
This little like, I mean, I recommend looking up this guide to the flora and fauna of the

665
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:49,320
Valley of Moira. Because you get like, I mean, there's a fun bunch of other, you know, you can,

666
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:52,760
you learn more about the wood sprites. You could, but then, and then like there's other

667
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:58,120
ones with weird names. You got the vein pod. The vein pod is really.

668
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:02,040
The vein pod's really something. Let's take a second here on the vein pod.

669
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:06,280
I almost was wrapping it up and then like, wait. No, no, no. The vein pod.

670
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:11,480
This is another, this is, they knew what the, it's sexual. Oh, this is sexual.

671
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:18,360
Well, the phrase vein pod had never occurred to me for any part of the genitals. But have you,

672
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:22,280
have you previously, have you looked at your own anatomy and ever thought, I don't know,

673
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:28,040
look at that vein pod down there. I've never thought of it as a vein pod, but the vein itself,

674
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:33,560
I understand veins are, maybe look, maybe I'm just in that mode because we're talking about this big

675
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:37,080
phallic object, but the vein pod, I don't know. That's also.

676
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:42,440
Undeniably a sexual term. I've just never previously like, hey, let me whip out my vein pod.

677
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:47,480
No, well, I have not thought, let me whip. I've never, that's a phrase that I don't think I've

678
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:54,280
ever consciously thought regardless of the word vein pod, but yeah, vein pod, vein pod is really

679
01:05:54,280 --> 01:06:01,240
creepy. Yeah. Yeah. In a way that bar tickler is cute bar tickler. Like is, is it seems like a

680
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:06,680
euphemism, but it is kind of cute. I guess so. I find the Baja nature of it a little like

681
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:12,200
seat, you know, I'm not saying it's not seedy, but like, now it feels like a spring break kind

682
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:20,600
of thing. Vein pod is gross. Vein pod seems gross to me a little bit. Well, let me see if any others

683
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:28,840
top it in terms of goblin thistle is not sexual puff ball tree is. Is it? I don't call you don't

684
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:32,760
classify that as cute. I'm trying to get puff. Okay. You're right. All tree is very cute. Puff

685
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:37,320
does so much work. He's made the ruling. It's very puff puff takes away the sting. If it was

686
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:43,240
as a ball tree, then yes. But puff ball makes it seem fun. Ball cause of ball tree. Yeah.

687
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:50,280
That one's also weird. I still think ball tree. I I'm thinking of something in like the,

688
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:55,880
in the Teletubbies world or something. I don't, I'm not, I'm thinking about a penis right now

689
01:06:55,880 --> 01:07:02,280
and I'm thinking, can you call it a ball tree? I don't know that you can. Well, but a ball,

690
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:07,240
a tree with like balls hanging from it. That's what I'm thinking of. It's like the fruit on the

691
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:11,800
tree look like testicles. Well, that's a whole other thing. So you're not thinking of that

692
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:17,000
genitals can be called a ball tree. You're imagining a tree that is with a lot of dangling

693
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:21,800
testicles. Yeah. And then miles Quaritch comes in and goes, what is this ball tree over here?

694
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:26,520
You like nicknames it a ball tree. Puff ball tree seems fun. Puff balls, like a little cute little

695
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:31,400
thing. It's like a Furby or something. I don't want to know the circumstances that led to a bunch of

696
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:37,400
testicles being dangled from a tree. I'm saying the puff ball tree itself, you know, you know,

697
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:42,200
all of it looks there. I think we've said before, there's a real crossover between Pandora and the,

698
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:49,880
the green planet, the ET. I feel like it is like just this like times 10 version of like a

699
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:58,520
kooky space nature world. So that's some of the delight of, of this place in this land. Spiny whip,

700
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:06,760
spiny whip clean could be a item that you use, but I don't think it itself is, is like, or, um,

701
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:12,760
I see a big one on here. You see a big spiny whip. Well, no, I see one that hasn't come up yet. I

702
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:18,440
mean, a lot of these just look like various, you know, exaggerations of succulents or underwater

703
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:26,520
plants that look very dirty as well. Well, that's true. Once again, you're the one with the, just

704
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:32,600
because suck is at the beginning. I have never heard the word succulent and thought, ew, this

705
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:37,800
word is body from now on this from the English language from now on, you're going to recoil when

706
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:42,680
you hear someone say it. What are you saying? The one that seems concerning is bladder polyp.

707
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:48,520
Like that is, that is something like you have to go to the doctor. That's a different situation.

708
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:53,000
There's nothing sexy about the phrase bladder polyp, but it is extreme. Yes. Why is a plant

709
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:57,480
called that? That's insane. Yes. That's real. That's a, that's a bad, that's a very bad thing.

710
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:07,240
Dapo FET just looks like a cactus that's blooming on the top. How do you spell it? Dapo, P-H-E-T.

711
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:15,720
Dapo FET. Not like Boba FET. Not Django FET. Not Django FET. Okay. Um, there's one more that,

712
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:20,600
well, no, I'm sorry. This is not a new one, but this is something from this guide and this is maybe

713
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:25,240
a good final point to make about the flask of reclinata. This is from there. You're not going

714
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:30,040
to believe when I get to the word and the word is in quotes, like it's calling to us. Um, this,

715
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:34,200
okay, let me just read some of the dry buildup of their ex. This is the official explanation.

716
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:39,160
Doesn't say bah, teckler. This is just what Disney and avatar say the flask of reclinata is.

717
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:44,120
Atmospheric toxins are absorbed by the plant and dissolve into liquid that accumulates inside.

718
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:50,760
When agitated, this primeval soup will build pressure before ultimately releasing a plume

719
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:57,400
from the top of the plant. Guys, what we've been talking about this whole time is a souping plant,

720
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:04,600
a souping seed, if you will. Wow. It soups. It soups the air and any sort of human that's under it

721
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:13,560
or Navi. You get souped from this plant. Yeah. So the phrase that we used before was I souped my

722
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:19,800
pants. Yeah. So if you go to the world of Pandora, you can say I souped that plant

723
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:27,880
by touching the open sore, by touching it's opens by rubbing. It's the open sore on its shaft.

724
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:30,920
Go soup that plant fresh boy.

725
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:39,000
Wow. Well, that's that. I think, I think that's the discussion of

726
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:44,680
of the souping plant. It's a thorough discussion. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We covered a lot of ground.

727
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:49,720
There's a lot to say in a much filthier episode than I realized it was going to be. One more

728
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:57,400
bit of business before we wrap it up. This premise will be completely unveiled again on the main feed,

729
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:04,440
but something that I wanted to do to tie together the topic and the, that, you know, it's December,

730
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:09,800
it's the holiday season as well as the Avatar season. And I thought we should tie all these

731
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:17,080
together by singing some carols, not Christmas carols, but a Motikaya carols to pay tribute

732
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:22,040
to the tribe and in the film. And that's what I've done. I'm going to gear this up. I might

733
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:30,760
hand you my little speaker. So here's, here's the first one of these to, to celebrate the season

734
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:36,120
with, you know, it's weird as people are hearing this, that it's just a few days away from the big

735
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:43,640
Avatar family reunion. All of our friends will be back at the table with us, but we don't like

736
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:50,600
everybody who gathers for the holiday festivities. There's, there's, there's always some, you know,

737
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:58,360
some family members who you're not always so happy to see. And that is what brings me to this song

738
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:04,520
here. I'm going to hand you this speaker. Okay. So now a tribute to the, the ultimate

739
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:07,320
no goodnik in the Avatar world.

740
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:24,200
You're a mean one, Miles Quaritch, a stain on the marines. You tell us we're not in Kansas as you

741
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:35,480
plot a genocide, Miles Quaritch. You're a spoiled sartuli bowl with banshee gun sauce.

742
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:52,040
You're a rotter, Miles Quaritch. Your mech suit reeks of farts. You calmly sip your coffee while

743
01:12:52,040 --> 01:13:01,800
you bomb the giant tree, Miles Quaritch. I wish instead of coffee, your mug was full of hot

744
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:17,160
sulfury than a torsion. You're a dingbat, Miles Quaritch. A crooked, curdle, clod. In the sequel,

745
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:26,600
you're a Navi, but you're still an ass to me, Miles Quaritch. I'd like to take a huge pile of

746
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:34,280
unobtanium, shove it up your penis and make you pee it out like kidney stones.

747
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:50,840
Yeah. All right. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. The first beautiful Amati Kaya Carol,

748
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:55,560
we'll be bringing more of those to the table. We gotta release that on the main. Can we release

749
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:59,320
just that on the main feed? We could do, you could do a single drop. Yeah. Well, hopefully we end up

750
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:03,640
with a little EP here. We're still figuring out how many of these there are, how many songs there

751
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:08,360
are. Anybody bring, this is a potluck. Anybody bring them to the table because we have so many

752
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:13,880
friends who are, who we haven't seen in 13 long years and we have to celebrate them with song,

753
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:22,680
even the bad ones. So that's, that's for you, Miles. That's for you listeners. Thanks so much
