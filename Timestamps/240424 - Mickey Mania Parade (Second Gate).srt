00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,480
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate, today covering a topic that resembles a live

2
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,560
feed of our brains.

3
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,560
I'm Scott Gardner, this is Mike Carlson.

4
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,280
I'm here and welcome to the Twisted Minds of the boys from the podcast.

5
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,520
Well, it's twisted, but it's also as wholesome as can be.

6
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:44,680
We just got thousands and thousands of Mickeys running through them, scampering plan.

7
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,080
When I said twisted, I meant more like twisted like a peppermint candy cane.

8
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,320
The twists in a candy cane, in a nice way.

9
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,320
Twisted back to the way things should be, wholesome.

10
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,720
If like gushers had a special kind of gushers that were like twisted gushers, like really

11
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,120
all that means is maybe there's a couple colors and it's fun.

12
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,680
That's what I meant by twisted, I didn't mean it like that.

13
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,000
And I can't see them putting this out, but you could deconstruct it, put a little booze

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
in there.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
In gushers?

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
That's a twisted gusher.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yikes.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,240
There has to be a way scientifically, doesn't there?

19
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,320
Well yeah, you would just get a syringe and you fill it with something, tequila, and you

20
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,560
would inject the gusher with booze, yeah.

21
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,120
This is why you gotta check your kids Halloween candy.

22
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,000
Oh yeah, you're right, that's a very good point.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,400
I had no reason to leave you out.

24
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,760
The gusher is hollow, am I wrong?

25
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,760
Sorry to bombard you with these questions, but you would know the answer I think.

26
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,720
Well, it's gotta be hollow if it's got juice, yeah.

27
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,720
So you could, I'm sure.

28
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,680
But is it not packed to the gills with juice?

29
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,120
I don't believe it's packed to the gills because the juice would leak out more, which honestly

30
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,440
occasionally does happen.

31
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,720
I haven't had gushers in a long time actually, but I believe there's only a little juice

32
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,720
in there.

33
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,040
I've had them in the last three months.

34
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,040
You've had gushers in the last three months?

35
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,040
Yeah.

36
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,040
Okay.

37
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,040
Do you have any recollection?

38
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,040
Did you stop midway through, oh this is the kind of, actually this is a thing my son does

39
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,960
is like take a bite of a small candy, show me the inside, but not with a gusher, so he's

40
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,960
not helpful in this case.

41
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,960
Okay.

42
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,640
I'm gonna have to get him a gusher to find out.

43
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:15,760
Well there's only a handful in every package, so I feel like the way I eat them.

44
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,440
You mean there's not a hundred in every package?

45
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,440
What do you mean?

46
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,440
No, in every baggie.

47
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,680
You're saying there's not a lot.

48
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,560
Yeah, so I'm saying as I go through the baggie, I feel like I silently like, all right I bit

49
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,760
that one, I bit that one all the way, this one I'm gonna bite in half and take a look

50
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,920
and then eat the other half.

51
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,920
So you have taken a look.

52
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,920
You took a look?

53
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,920
Yeah, I've taken a look.

54
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,880
First of all, that you have taken a look, but that's now been superseded by the fact

55
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,840
that you have a mental process while eating a bag of gushers.

56
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,160
Yeah, it's fun.

57
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,160
It's fun.

58
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,160
Keeps it alive for you.

59
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,160
Wow.

60
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,160
Kind of a play-by-play commentary.

61
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,560
Do you ever do like sort of the sommelier, like you sniff the gusher, you bite into it,

62
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,640
you smell, you put it right under your nose, and then you eat the rest of it?

63
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,120
Michael, I have definitely done that.

64
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,200
What are you talking about?

65
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,520
Oh, my detect strawberry splash?

66
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,560
Bodacious blueberry perhaps?

67
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,440
You waft it into radical raspberry?

68
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,280
You waft the smell with your hands.

69
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,840
You get it up into the nasal passages.

70
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,480
But I think there's room in there.

71
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,480
That's my point.

72
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,480
I believe there's room in there.

73
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,720
I think it's kind of hollow still, even with the liquid.

74
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,720
What are you waiting for?

75
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,280
Get yourself a syringe and start making yourself alcoholic gushers.

76
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,440
All right.

77
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,640
But they do sell little chocolate-shaped like a Kahlua bottle or a Jack Daniels.

78
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,640
Yes, they do that.

79
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,640
They got a little bit of a hit of it.

80
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,440
I feel like every now and then, like, a parent would get them in like gift bags or gift baskets.

81
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,440
Something for mom and dad.

82
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,440
Something for mom and dad.

83
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,160
And it's like, oh, you can't have, or you can only have a little corner.

84
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,920
Because some of them, it's like fake liquor goo, and some of them, it's like a shot of

85
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,920
alcohol.

86
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,920
Yeah.

87
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,920
Like a full shot of alcohol?

88
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,960
I don't know if it's a full shot, but I feel like I've had one or two of these.

89
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,320
For the consistency of a chocolate shell, I don't know what's going to hold that.

90
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,440
You don't trust the 1.5 fluid ounces fitting in that single chocolate.

91
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,440
I just don't think it's going to hold.

92
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,920
I think you need such a hard shell.

93
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,920
I think that's fair.

94
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,920
Yeah.

95
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,280
I think you've got to eat that gusher fast, though, because maybe the alcohol will degrade

96
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,480
the surface or whatever it's made of, the gelatin or something.

97
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,560
Start to wear it down, like acid, just like melt the entire thing.

98
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,960
Well, this is something to try if anyone at home wants to and show us the results, or

99
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,960
don't.

100
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,960
Just have a good time for yourselves.

101
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,960
You don't owe us anything.

102
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,960
I agree.

103
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,600
Just have a fun alcohol and gusher night.

104
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,000
I started watching guys' videos on YouTube, and he just tries to make wine out of different

105
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
things.

106
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,200
Like, he made wine out of Mountain Dew, and he made-

107
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,200
This is an abomination.

108
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,200
I'm going to report this guy on YouTube.

109
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,120
Offensive content.

110
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,880
I think it's anything with sugar can-

111
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,880
Be fermented.

112
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,880
Be fermented.

113
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,880
Sure.

114
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,880
I think he's working on Dr. Pepper right now.

115
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,880
Oh, you've got to make gusher's wine.

116
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,480
Jason, bathtub gusher's wine.

117
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,480
Come on.

118
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,480
Don't bathe for a few weeks.

119
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,760
All that will result is the Homer explosion.

120
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,560
I don't even get the wine.

121
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,160
I just get a damaged the glass shower door.

122
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,160
You're ranting.

123
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,160
Who gives a shit?

124
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,120
Come on.

125
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,120
Fuck that bathtub.

126
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,520
Make us gusher's wine.

127
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,000
It's made to experiment in.

128
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Yeah.

129
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You're sure you'll lose the security deposit.

130
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What?

131
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,040
Now he looks like an explosion went off.

132
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,040
His hair got blown back.

133
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,400
But you'll make it back when you sell gusher's wine.

134
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,400
Oh, yeah.

135
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,400
That all becomes profit.

136
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,400
Oh, well.

137
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,400
Breaking even, eh?

138
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,400
Oh, mania's already overcoming us.

139
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

140
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,400
So it's perfect.

141
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:43,120
With the talk of gusher's, we're kind of in the right zone because we are talking about

142
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:52,600
a very 90s Disney World event, parade, spectacular, whatever you want to call it, Mickey mania.

143
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:58,160
I believe this first came up in the episode we did about Disney World Resort TV with Ian

144
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:05,040
Riccobani where we sampled a nice helping of different videos that played in Disney

145
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,640
hotel rooms showing you what there was to do.

146
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:15,400
And I remember sparking to like, oh, right, Mickey mania, this thing, because just a couple

147
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,400
things about it.

148
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,320
This was a Magic Kingdom parade from June 94 to September 96.

149
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:26,000
There's a similar version in Tokyo that ran throughout 1995.

150
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,160
And OK, if you haven't seen this thing, maybe look at our little artwork or do a Google

151
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,160
image.

152
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,720
And I would say if you Google Mickey mania, Mickey mania parade, see if you can find any

153
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,160
clues that this was done in the mid 90s.

154
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,120
Just see if there's any hints that this is a mid 90s thing besides every single thing

155
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,440
that you see in the frame.

156
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:53,840
This might be the peak of Disney's Disney 90s.

157
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:59,120
It is the molten core, the molten gusher core of Disney in 90s colliding.

158
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,800
And I, well, I don't want to say my feelings about it.

159
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,440
We got to talk a little and then, you know, not not spoil our views.

160
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:13,080
But does that kind of accurately sum it up before we get into what specifically it looks

161
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,080
like?

162
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,520
It yes, it is.

163
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,240
I mean, I guess this is sort of tipping.

164
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,280
Well, I won't I won't tip.

165
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,540
I won't say either.

166
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,960
But it's like a Disney store like sprouted arms and legs.

167
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,560
And it started walking around like it's so 90s Disney.

168
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,000
It's unbelievable.

169
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:37,400
Every like every bumper on the Disney Channel, every Disney store came to life.

170
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
Anything like that.

171
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,680
Where, yes, like Mickey's gloves sprout and you go on some weird little like claymation

172
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,520
tunnel warp or whatever.

173
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,520
Absolutely.

174
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,520
Thousand percent.

175
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,520
Yes.

176
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,520
So yeah, it's it's it was wild.

177
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,520
It's a wild watch.

178
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,520
Yeah.

179
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,320
It's a lot of deconstructed.

180
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,320
Like it.

181
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,320
OK.

182
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,400
Granted, I watched three of these parades back to back.

183
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,640
Like one Tokyo to Florida.

184
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:07,960
That probably added to my media as I was writing some stuff down.

185
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:15,760
But yeah, just seeing the color scheme and the deconstructed like every little piece

186
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,280
BMX.

187
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,280
There's some bikes.

188
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,560
There's lots of weird bikes.

189
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,560
Yeah.

190
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,560
There's a little bit of rapping.

191
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,560
Mm hmm.

192
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:31,920
And there's a little bit of sampling very old audio in between the new audio.

193
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,920
I found a website that listed the lyrics of the song that plays and it is funny seeing

194
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:42,800
like in parentheses, Jimmy Dodd sample, the right name of the guide, the Jimmy, the Mousketeer,

195
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,840
the leader, the adult Mousketeer.

196
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,840
All the guys are sampling.

197
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,880
All the hip hop artists are sampling Jimmy Dodd.

198
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,880
Yeah.

199
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,880
No.

200
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,880
One of the biggest.

201
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,720
Like Godfather and Scarface and then Jimmy Dodd.

202
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,720
Of course.

203
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,720
The original Scarface.

204
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,720
Hey, kids.

205
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,200
Hey, hey, hey, hey, kids.

206
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:07,600
So the big thing that we haven't said about this, though you'll know this immediately

207
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:15,240
if you look at any photo of it, you'd have to describe this thing as a very intense Mickey

208
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,280
based fever dream, right?

209
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,240
It's just like, and it's hard to say, I don't think that there's like a story to this necessarily.

210
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,840
I think it's just a big Mickey themed party.

211
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:34,560
But visually, it's just like, let's put Mickey into some sort of like going haywire duplication

212
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,560
machine.

213
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,560
Yeah.

214
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:43,200
Out come thousands upon thousands of different visual interpretations of Mickey.

215
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,200
Yeah.

216
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,200
Some of them grotesque.

217
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,200
Yes.

218
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,200
Some of them very.

219
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,200
Some of them.

220
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,200
Some freaks came out.

221
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,920
Some are the fourth Michael Keaton in multiplicity.

222
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,920
There's some freaks.

223
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,480
This, too, that you're talking about the song, the song really captures a thing.

224
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:05,800
I don't know how to describe it, but this song, I think, is a way to do it where, like,

225
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,440
I was like walking around the house in between viewings of different braids.

226
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:17,600
I was singing like, Mickey mania, da, da, da, da, da, da, like da, da, da, da, da.

227
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,000
That's why I thought I didn't know that Goo Goo Dolls song that had been the subject of

228
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
much discussion.

229
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,880
What do you mean?

230
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,880
What's why you didn't think you knew?

231
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:31,000
That third Goo Goo Dolls song, because I realized every time I heard it on the radio, I would

232
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,400
go like, so, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da,

233
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
da, da, da, da, da.

234
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,400
Like I didn't know any of the lyrics.

235
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,900
The song's been more on my mind lately because of the controversy, and now I've listened

236
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,540
to the song, but I cannot retain those lyrics.

237
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:47,400
Coming down, the rustle, the rustle,

238
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,740
angels fall, the spell is made.

239
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,780
I was doing this, that, what I did to that said,

240
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:57,460
duh, duh, duh, I started doing about Mickey Mania.

241
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,300
As I was like-

242
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,380
It is an earworm, but not a fully effective earworm.

243
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,980
Yeah, that's a great way to put it.

244
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,860
You get the gist of it.

245
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,700
Okay.

246
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:10,660
So basically, as tempted as I am to talk about

247
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,460
Black Balloon for 35 minutes.

248
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,020
I didn't say anything.

249
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,300
And neither am I.

250
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,260
So we'll sit at a table this for another time.

251
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,140
We will dizzy up the Scott some other time.

252
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:25,140
Oh, when that episode's over,

253
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,740
I won't want the world to see me.

254
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,740
You will be like the album art of a person

255
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,820
lying stomach down on a bed.

256
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,820
Well, we're back to things I don't know.

257
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,260
So imagine I still don't know everything about-

258
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,540
Iconic album cover.

259
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,380
Poll, do you know this album cover?

260
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,260
Part of the poll is that you have to have looked at it.

261
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,980
Now that you've looked at it, do you know it?

262
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:50,620
Iconic, like Mickey's big yellow shoes.

263
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,340
I brought his pack, I brought his pack.

264
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,940
I need you more than ever for this.

265
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:59,940
So basically, in this parade, Mickey is deconstructed,

266
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:05,540
de-atomized, exploded, split into parts, big and small.

267
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,060
There's many small Mickeys, there's plush Mickeys,

268
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:13,340
as Mickey's done in every possible media.

269
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,700
I mean, maybe not literally,

270
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,060
I guess there aren't oil paintings or clay.

271
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:22,180
He's not made out of human feces,

272
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:25,620
but he's made out, there's like, I would say,

273
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,340
10 to 20 different forms of expressing Mickey.

274
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:33,220
There's no shit Mickey crawling his way down Main Street.

275
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:38,220
Or, in whatever process caused this parade to happen,

276
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,620
that did come out of the machine.

277
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,460
Oh yeah.

278
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,300
And they shot it in the head

279
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,020
before it could make it out to the public.

280
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,740
Right, but it took a while to get it.

281
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,620
The first one didn't work, it didn't put it down.

282
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:53,220
And it crawled a long way out.

283
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,420
They left a lot of perfect shit stains,

284
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,340
but in Mickey ear form.

285
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,660
And then they'd shoot it in the head,

286
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,660
and the blood splatters

287
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,180
would also form perfect Mickey ear shit.

288
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,420
Oh, like the soap dispenser you can get.

289
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,340
Oh right, that is a thing, yes.

290
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:13,260
It shoots it out, it shoots the three, yeah.

291
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,180
Does there really, on any Disney property,

292
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:20,100
is there, well obviously there's macaroni for kids

293
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,540
in Mickey ear shape, I assume,

294
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:25,420
but is there anything that can make long noodle strands?

295
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:29,260
There's gotta be a Play-Doh, whatever you call it,

296
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,620
play set that has the Mickey shape, or maybe.

297
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,020
Yeah, and I bet there's that,

298
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,380
but is there that for adults?

299
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:39,980
Can I order a $45 pasta that's in,

300
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,780
that are long, long Mickey strands,

301
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,860
that are an original Disney type of pasta?

302
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,860
Could you make pasta with just a Play-Doh play set?

303
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,020
If it's soft enough, potentially.

304
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:52,620
This guy on YouTube who could make Mountain Dew out of,

305
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,740
he could make wine out of Mountain Dew,

306
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,940
I'm sure he could make pasta out of Play-Doh.

307
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,380
Yeah, well I'll tell you what,

308
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,220
you definitely could put human shit in a Play-Doh play set.

309
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,100
Thanks, Mike.

310
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,340
Many a grizzly police scene has encountered

311
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:09,980
shit shapes made in Play-Doh.

312
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,660
Uh-oh, it's one of those again.

313
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,500
Yeah.

314
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,780
It's talking about normal stuff,

315
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:17,460
like Scott's grotesque long-hitting Mickey pasta.

316
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,100
But I, is that basically, it's just like,

317
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,100
it's Mickey iconography just like physicalized

318
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,180
into like five maybe parade floats,

319
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,980
and then like many kind of like,

320
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,580
I don't know the parade terminology,

321
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,460
but there's like little parade breakers essentially,

322
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,820
like not quite, but something that a bunch of people hold.

323
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,340
And just amidst all of this,

324
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,180
there's thousands upon thousands of Mickey.

325
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,540
It's a living Mickey nightmare.

326
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,860
But also, at the very end,

327
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,060
there's a big float and tucks and tails,

328
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,220
Mickey is riding a top.

329
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,060
Oh yes, you still get, yeah you get.

330
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:52,900
The real Mickey, yeah.

331
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,740
Yeah.

332
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,700
Primary Mickey, who is a,

333
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,260
sorry to keep you talking about this,

334
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,540
but a pig in shit.

335
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,380
Yeah.

336
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,700
He is like, imagine being him.

337
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,540
Yeah, yeah.

338
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:02,900
This is transpire.

339
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,740
He's made everybody.

340
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,460
Gazing upon horrors and horrors.

341
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:10,460
As he stands on top of simulations of all his past selves,

342
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,620
like Steamboat Willie, and like,

343
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,780
regular shirtless Mickey.

344
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,260
Regular shirtless, they always gotta represent

345
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,700
shirtless Mickey.

346
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,620
Yeah, Jack, Jack Mickey, beefcake Mickey.

347
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,460
Yeah.

348
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,700
This feels like, like in a cartoon,

349
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,220
Mickey would make someone,

350
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,580
let's say Pete, or Mortimer man.

351
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,460
Mortimer, what's the one with the big pants?

352
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,060
That tall mouse that hits on Minnie in the early days.

353
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,100
For yeah, Fresh Boy.

354
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,900
Fresh Boy, go suck your head, Fresh Boy.

355
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,740
Is it Mortimer?

356
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,580
Or is it, let's say it's Mortimer.

357
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,140
But like, if it was a cartoon,

358
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,100
and Mortimer was really upset with Mickey,

359
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,260
this is what he would see in his nightmare,

360
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,540
where he's cursing Mickey out,

361
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,980
he's like so upset with him.

362
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,660
And now all he can see is Mickey,

363
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,860
everything is Mickey, different versions,

364
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,700
and it's just infecting his brain.

365
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,540
Thousand percent.

366
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,620
It's almost like the kind of thing

367
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,140
that would happen more likely with like a Chip and Dale,

368
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:05,580
like characters who are pests more often.

369
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,500
Like Donald would see this like,

370
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,820
or you know what, it's very Pink Elephants on Parade.

371
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,780
Yes.

372
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,100
Or Heffalups and Woozles.

373
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,100
The character has a fear,

374
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,620
and then this manifests in this bizarre nightmare

375
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,220
where the character's represented

376
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,180
and the villain's represented in all these.

377
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,620
But in this case, it's Mickey,

378
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,500
the hero of the company.

379
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,860
Did it occur to them at any point

380
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,620
that they are using methodology,

381
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,700
usually reserved for nightmares,

382
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,620
but meant to be a fun 90s hip hop BMX party?

383
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:41,420
I don't think, I mean, I don't think so.

384
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:45,060
Maybe there was somebody like a lower tier Imagineer

385
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,940
that was like, hey, this is like,

386
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,420
this is too much, there's too much Mickey here.

387
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:54,780
The song, too, doesn't really change.

388
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,220
I feel like there's discussion about like,

389
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,100
oh, Small World, yeah, they play that

390
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,180
where people are trying to, you know,

391
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,500
in prison or get confessions out of.

392
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,340
But Small World has a lot of,

393
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,220
it's torture, or people just casually saying like,

394
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,580
oh, it's torture, I ride so long.

395
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,420
But that song changes a lot.

396
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,220
This song doesn't really,

397
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,620
Mickey Mania's song does not change for like 12 minutes.

398
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,220
You change genres, nationality, yeah.

399
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,140
This is the kind of the,

400
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,020
yeah, I know, because we're watching videos

401
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,500
where the parade does fully move through.

402
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,900
It's not like it suddenly,

403
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,020
it's not like Burrow Codown mainstream electrical parade

404
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:31,860
kind of like hits, all right,

405
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,700
now we're in like the Waltz part or whatever.

406
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,340
This is just the same thing over and over.

407
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,700
Should we get a hit of this song?

408
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

409
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,780
And then in the course of doing this,

410
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,700
we could call out some of the things we see.

411
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,340
I don't think there's any particular order we need to go in

412
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:49,140
other than maybe saving the most,

413
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,660
maybe scarring imagery.

414
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,460
Building to that.

415
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,420
Sure, sure.

416
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,700
But here's a little touch of,

417
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:02,700
wait, and this song is called Rock the House with the Mouse.

418
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,340
There's two songs in it, at least maybe,

419
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,860
yeah, I think you end up with a second song at some point,

420
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,340
but this is Rock the House with the Mouse.

421
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,060
Mickey Mania.

422
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:17,060
["Rock the House with the Mouse"]

423
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:26,740
["Rock the House with the Mouse"]

424
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,220
It is my town.

425
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,820
Mickey here, Mickey there, everywhere.

426
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,820
I'm meant to find mouse about time.

427
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,540
Many mouse Mickey's, you look kinda tricky,

428
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,700
but the way he's always hittin' around.

429
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,220
Just to break it up a little bit,

430
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,260
now you're hearing some sound,

431
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:42,300
that's not anybody's alarm going off while I play this,

432
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:46,540
there's a motif of clocks and time in this.

433
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:50,260
Common motif of nightmares as well.

434
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,260
Oh yes, yeah, yeah,

435
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,060
where you might get shaken out of one,

436
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,540
or you might have to adopt the alarm clock sound

437
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,700
into your dream, and that's a practical part of it.

438
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:03,620
In this case, there's big Mickey clocks,

439
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,020
that's an aspect of it,

440
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:08,660
you watch a giant Mickey watch go by,

441
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,980
those were kinda big around this time,

442
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,340
or even, maybe I'm wrong,

443
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,020
I feel like, at least this is what they were trying

444
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,620
to convey to a crowd going to Disney World,

445
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:21,100
is you can be an adult and own a fancy leather strap

446
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,780
Mickey Mouse watch.

447
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:25,140
Yeah, I had a fancy leather strap Goofy watch.

448
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:25,980
Wow, wow.

449
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,940
Backwards.

450
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,860
It went back, it was a silly watch?

451
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,820
It was a silly watch, I think I still have it,

452
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,060
I'd have to get it fixed, but yeah.

453
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,940
Did it work, was it like, you would see an eight,

454
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,300
but the eight was on the wrong side,

455
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,620
or was it literally the wrong time?

456
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,780
I think it was just, I think it was like,

457
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,300
the six was over here.

458
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,140
Okay.

459
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,980
Or no, I guess, no, I guess the nine was over here,

460
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,420
and the three was over here.

461
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,500
It's really confusing.

462
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,740
Yeah, difficult, as you were learning to tell time.

463
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,380
That's why it put me back five years.

464
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,460
I failed a grade.

465
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,020
You still, yeah, I do see you looking at clocks

466
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,300
and then kind of like pointing,

467
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,860
and then having to flip your arms, like wait, okay.

468
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,700
And then I got tangled, like I got my arms tangled

469
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,740
in my legs, like Goofy would, trying to tell time.

470
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,900
It'll still happen to me from time to time.

471
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:11,260
We're gonna do the test that they say to do

472
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:14,100
to like geriatric presidential candidates,

473
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,340
you're gonna have to draw a clock.

474
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,580
Yeah, good luck getting me to draw a clock.

475
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,780
I ain't putting myself on record with that.

476
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:23,500
I'm gonna get held back again from something.

477
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,340
I don't know what, but I'll get held back.

478
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:27,420
You won't be allowed to operate a podcast anymore.

479
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,660
It's funny that you say that, Jason.

480
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,980
It's such a, how insane is it that now it's like,

481
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,340
you know, when the presidential candidates

482
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,180
are so geriatric that we're concerned,

483
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:41,100
you know that new thing in the last six years

484
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,540
that will probably keep being a pattern.

485
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,460
Also, they refuse to draw the clocks.

486
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,300
Neither of them will draw, yeah.

487
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,740
Good for them, it shows strength.

488
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,500
Don't get bullied.

489
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,060
I'm trying to find the part where it gets into like,

490
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,540
can't get enough, can't.

491
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,380
Oh.

492
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,220
Oh.

493
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,060
Oh.

494
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:58,900
Oh.

495
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,740
Oh.

496
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,580
Oh.

497
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,420
Oh.

498
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,260
Oh.

499
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,100
Oh.

500
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:03,940
Oh.

501
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,780
Oh.

502
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,620
Oh.

503
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,460
Oh.

504
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,300
Oh.

505
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,140
Oh.

506
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:08,980
Oh.

507
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:09,820
Oh.

508
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,660
Oh.

509
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,500
Oh.

510
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,340
Oh.

511
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,180
Oh.

512
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,020
Oh.

513
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:14,860
Oh.

514
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,700
Oh.

515
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,540
Oh.

516
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,820
I remember watching it for the first,

517
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,940
the beat is all.

518
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,780
It's kind of a.

519
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,060
I try to do a good job of explaining this succinctly,

520
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,140
but now I've been thrown for,

521
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,220
I said a bunch of stuff, here's the premise of the parade,

522
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,820
and now I gotta go, and also clocks.

523
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,780
I don't know how to incorporate that.

524
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,580
This is, you know, look, there's, you know,

525
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,780
clocks have been incorporated in pop songs for years,

526
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,180
and they're kind of a weird, like a trippy little thing

527
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,340
to have in there, because you can kind of move in and out

528
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:45,020
of just the regular rhythm of a song

529
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,020
with the actual tick-tock of a clock.

530
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,220
So this is kind of more of an experimental thing

531
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,780
for a Disney parade, in a way,

532
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,940
compared to the average Disney song.

533
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,740
It's samples.

534
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,580
Yeah.

535
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,340
I think there is an understanding

536
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,900
of 90s hip-hop production.

537
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,780
Even if it's all to kind of an annoying end,

538
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,300
I don't think that they're so far off the mark.

539
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,140
Yeah.

540
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,580
I actually think, as I was comparing this

541
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,140
to something we talked about on the show

542
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:12,100
a couple years ago, Mickey Unwrapped, the album.

543
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:12,940
Oh, right, yeah.

544
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:18,740
The centerpiece is a tag team team-up

545
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,260
of whoop there it went.

546
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,860
And this is a pretty embarrassing attempt

547
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,260
to merge Disney and hip-hop,

548
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,540
mainly because Mickey's rapping.

549
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,580
And this, they leave, I don't know,

550
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:32,500
they leave the rap to, if not the professionals,

551
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,580
then people who aren't as annoying as Mickey Mouse.

552
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,420
Yeah.

553
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,500
So that gets you somewhere.

554
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,860
And Mickey is present just in the samples,

555
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:43,700
and in the samples of the 50s Mickey Mouse Club theme song.

556
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,860
Yeah.

557
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,980
But it's, you know, better than Mickey Unwrapped, right?

558
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:48,820
Yes, it is.

559
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,660
Yeah.

560
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,480
It is.

561
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,500
I don't know if it's the most successful

562
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,620
big parade crowd pleaser song,

563
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,300
but there are, you're like,

564
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,660
oh, it's a more interesting arrangement than normal.

565
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:01,100
You know what it is before, however,

566
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:04,340
some of these sweeping,

567
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,500
the ones that make you emotional in Japan,

568
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,140
they haven't built to those yet.

569
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,980
Probably parades around this time

570
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,940
are more just like either its greatest hits,

571
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,140
classic Disney song.

572
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,300
Maybe we haven't entered the era of the song

573
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,940
that moves you, that you can only hear in the parade.

574
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,820
Yes, that might be right.

575
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,460
I wonder when that starts.

576
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,660
I mean, it's interesting, hmm.

577
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,900
But yeah, no, still like nothing,

578
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,860
nothing touches the cool factor of Baroque hoedown,

579
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,860
but you know.

580
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:35,540
I don't know if I call it a cool factor, exactly, but.

581
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,780
Compared to everything else though?

582
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,380
Like all other Parks music?

583
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:42,020
All the other Parks music, parade music.

584
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,700
Yeah, maybe, yeah.

585
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,500
Cool's just not the word, I like it.

586
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,340
Cool, okay.

587
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,180
I don't know.

588
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,460
I feel like, let me use this thin excuse

589
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,460
to play this song, because it did remind me,

590
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:58,460
as a mildly successful mashup of 90s hip hop and Disney,

591
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,940
something I am very fond of

592
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,700
is the end credits music towards the,

593
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,780
well, they did it for, I think,

594
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,900
all the seasons of the Mickey Mouse Club,

595
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,820
but when we get into the later MMC era,

596
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,900
the song that played at the end of every show,

597
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,500
which would go for sometimes,

598
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,700
depending on how much time they had to kill

599
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,660
in the episode, two full minutes,

600
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:21,420
where the entire cast of like 22 cast members,

601
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,260
and then the whole audience comes out,

602
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:26,940
and they just dance while credits play for a long time,

603
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,780
and maybe just compare contrast.

604
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:32,060
You've heard Mickey Mania, do you know this song offhand?

605
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,540
Did you watch enough of this show?

606
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,940
I don't know, necessarily.

607
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,780
I think I know what you're saying,

608
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,460
but I don't know, I don't know it off the top of my head.

609
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,340
So, you know, old Mickey Mouse Club,

610
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,980
it's why because we like you,

611
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,900
M-O-E, and they still do that, there's still that,

612
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,500
but then they get to the E,

613
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,420
and things get a little more funky.

614
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,420
M-O-U-S-E.

615
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,620
Uh-oh.

616
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,820
The audience rushes the stage.

617
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,420
They all rush the stage.

618
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,460
You're allowed, go.

619
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,860
Time to see you later, never gonna fade you, though.

620
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,060
You wanna leave you with no plans.

621
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:04,900
This is pretty good, actually.

622
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:10,140
I genuinely, like a stressful day, a stressful week,

623
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:27,820
Aaron and I have like, you know, open a bottle of wine,

624
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,980
let's watch videos we like, we will sometimes land it.

625
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:33,180
M-O-C's got it goin' on funky style,

626
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,140
got it goin' on in a funky style,

627
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,700
like it's so effervescent.

628
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,420
It's so, it's cheesy, but man,

629
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,900
they're having so much fun.

630
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,580
I wonder how many different songs

631
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,340
in the history of the Disney company

632
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:50,180
have been a play on the Mickey Mouse Club theme,

633
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,060
because there's a song from the now,

634
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,980
I guess they did their last performance

635
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,220
of Mickey's Mix Magic,

636
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,380
which is the thing they do on Main Street

637
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:00,500
with no fireworks, just a kind of a light show.

638
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,500
And the song, of course, I've described before

639
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,060
as a cooler Disney song,

640
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,500
but it's come on everybody, get your ears on.

641
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,980
But in the lead up to the chorus,

642
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:13,780
they do go M-I-C, K-E-Y, M-O-U-S-E.

643
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,820
So like, how many times has this been,

644
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:21,660
like a version of this been made or sampled or whatever?

645
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,700
Somebody in the company has gotta be saying like,

646
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,980
think about it, that's saying all these letters,

647
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:30,260
that's rapping, we were doing rapping

648
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:34,900
in the 50s before anybody, that's like B-I-G, P-O, P-P-A.

649
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,740
Well before that, there was M-I-C, K-E-Y.

650
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:42,500
So let's take our birthright as the inventors of hip hop,

651
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,940
plus the Walt Disney Company, and let's own that area.

652
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,340
Can't argue with that.

653
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:51,740
So I wonder if anyone knows, probably no one does.

654
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,380
That is a very common thing, I guess.

655
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,420
They do it a lot, is my feeling,

656
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:58,420
but maybe we've just listed the three times they did it,

657
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,260
I don't know.

658
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,540
I don't think, I think it's a lot.

659
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,940
I think you're onto something.

660
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,340
There's been a lot of versions of just, yeah,

661
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:06,380
either little samples or references,

662
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,900
or just new version, updated versions,

663
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,100
for the era in which it was created.

664
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,500
It's not the one, it's not what Will Smith did

665
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,100
in that one special, that was zippy doo-dah.

666
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:16,940
Right, right, right.

667
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,340
Tracking, I think it's important that we track

668
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:22,620
all the kind of unironic attempts at Disney rap.

669
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,940
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

670
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:27,260
But this one, hey, you know, I don't mind it.

671
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,540
I think where you get a little bit dicier

672
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:33,660
than the music itself is what happens at the beginning,

673
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:37,980
which before the song plays, did you guys happen to see,

674
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,140
or did you hear this bit of dialogue?

675
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,700
There is a, there's like a little scene, essentially,

676
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,220
that starts the thing.

677
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:48,500
You didn't think that was a fresh MC?

678
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,020
You didn't think that was really fresh?

679
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,340
Oh, I'm not saying it's not fresh.

680
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:54,220
I'm just saying, I don't know, plenty fresh,

681
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:58,940
a hell of fresh, but it's an interesting

682
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,860
little bit of dialogue.

683
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,860
Let me see if I can track this down.

684
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,980
Okay, so there's two versions of this.

685
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:11,220
One involves Roger Rabbit, and here is this,

686
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,700
as according to the script, woman rapper.

687
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,780
Yo there, listen up all you rad dudes.

688
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,260
Walt's house is rockin' with the mania

689
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:23,180
that's hit the street with the brand new beat.

690
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:26,820
Gar's sounds like a party, maybe I should make a cake.

691
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,060
Let me try to do Roger Rabbit.

692
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:31,180
Jeepers, Goofy, it's not that kind of party.

693
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:34,380
It's a Def Jam, and we're invited to groove

694
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,180
with the rest of the gang.

695
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,020
That's pretty good.

696
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,140
That's right, Roger, my main man Mickey Mouse

697
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,740
is bustin' fresh out of sight.

698
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,860
He wants you all to chill hard and bump the bump

699
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:45,100
while the mania cruiser moves.

700
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,420
Mickey Mania is taking control.

701
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:50,980
Then a sample of Mickey saying, oh boy, oh, oh, oh boy.

702
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,820
Oh my God.

703
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,420
Oh wow, that was fun, yeah.

704
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,380
Listen up all you rad dudes.

705
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:01,380
And then Roger Rabbit's saying, it's a Def Jam.

706
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:06,220
It's a Def Jam, this is, Def Jam Records is big

707
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,420
and culturally relevant has been for a while,

708
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,300
and now Roger Rabbit's.

709
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,580
Roger Rabbit's is saying it on Main Street,

710
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:16,860
or saying it in a Disney park, a reference.

711
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:21,100
Listen up B-Boys and B-Girls.

712
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,620
How many people did this reference have to be explained

713
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,420
to in management?

714
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,820
Like, no, no, no, this is a current thing,

715
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,860
and that's why Roger's referencing it.

716
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,900
Right, yeah, Roy Disney's in the meeting,

717
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:40,820
and like, well, first of all, I think you misspelled death.

718
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:44,220
Secondly, I don't know why we're saying death in a parade.

719
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,420
Don't you think that's gonna bring people down?

720
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,180
Yes, for sure.

721
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,500
Eisner, of course, had to approve it.

722
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,540
They had to explain it to him.

723
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,420
I mean, unless he's really, was really with it,

724
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,260
he knew everything about it.

725
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,380
Roy, let me take you through it.

726
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,020
Hip-hop is the sound of the streets.

727
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:02,660
There's a purposeful shortening of words,

728
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,780
reappropriation of them.

729
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:09,340
Taking old records and sampling and the scratching

730
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,940
is on purpose, that's not a mistake with the,

731
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,500
my kids, Breck has caught me up.

732
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,100
We are naming.

733
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,780
Big on the ghetto boys, he's taught me everything.

734
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,020
Ghetto is spelled on purpose.

735
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,540
Breck is extra fresh.

736
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,340
Breck is extra fresh.

737
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,860
We're naming another entertainment company,

738
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:29,300
but we tried fitting the phrase Hollywood Records in there,

739
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,140
and it just didn't sound right.

740
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:35,300
So it is, yeah, that's the most,

741
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,340
it's always funny when Disney takes a chance

742
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,180
on being culturally relevant.

743
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,980
God bless him, it's really funny.

744
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,860
There's a few you gotta back up to there.

745
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,620
Walt's house is rocking.

746
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,460
Walt's house.

747
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,660
Walt's house is rocking.

748
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,500
We're rocking the house.

749
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,980
The Homey Hills house, or the Burbank lot.

750
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,420
The Palm Springs house.

751
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,620
The Palm Springs, yeah, yeah, the ranch.

752
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:59,380
The smoke tree, which house are we talking about here?

753
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,220
We rocking the smoke tree lodge.

754
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,500
The one with the train in the backyard.

755
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,620
The one by the grocery store in Los Feliz.

756
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:10,420
One by the Grease High School in Los Feliz, California.

757
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,700
You're gonna have to be more specific.

758
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,220
Or they can't, surely they can't all be rocking.

759
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,060
I guess Walt's house is.

760
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,220
With the mania that's at the street.

761
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,500
Walt's house is the Magic Kingdom, I suppose.

762
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,820
I think that's what they're getting at.

763
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,300
Sure, uh-huh.

764
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,580
How do you do like the,

765
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,980
I don't think this was going at the time,

766
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:27,300
but the Izzle, Walt, Walt Dizzle.

767
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,860
Oh yeah, Walt, Walt Dizzle.

768
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,700
Is it just Dizzle?

769
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,420
Or would you. Maybe it's Dizzle, I guess.

770
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:35,460
Or do you add the Walt Dizzle, Dizzle-nee?

771
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,300
I think it's just Dizzle.

772
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,140
I think it's Dizzle. Yeah, Walt Dizzle.

773
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,820
What are the rules of the Dizzle language?

774
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,660
Yeah, I don't know, it's a good question.

775
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,260
Because the Disney company will dazzle.

776
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,620
Hello, I'm Michael Izz-Izzner,

777
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,460
President of the Walt Dizzle.

778
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,300
Oh, was there ever one where he was rapping?

779
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,060
President and CEO of the Walt Dizzle company.

780
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,620
Was there ever one where he rapped?

781
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,460
Man, I don't think so.

782
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,380
Oh man.

783
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,580
Because we'd know it, we'd know it.

784
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,700
And if we didn't know it,

785
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,140
and it suddenly popped up on somebody's YouTube channel,

786
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,900
we would have been sent it 30 times on that day.

787
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,020
You would think so.

788
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:04,860
Yeah.

789
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,700
You better, if.

790
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,520
Please do.

791
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,420
If there's anything with Michael Izzner rapping out there

792
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,700
and we're not aware of it,

793
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,500
please right this wrong.

794
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,540
And if not, let's see if we can get him to rap.

795
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,500
Even if it's about baseball cards.

796
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,580
Is he on cameo, is Michael Izzner on cameo?

797
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,820
Can we get him to rap something?

798
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,660
Great question.

799
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:23,420
Does he need like a hundred bucks for a personal greeting?

800
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:27,340
For a mere $100,000, I'll give you 30 seconds.

801
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:30,340
Sure, I will rap for 600,000.

802
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,860
Gotta make that money.

803
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,780
Gotta stack that cash, yo.

804
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:36,860
Now.

805
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,900
Izzner was more like Scarface, honestly.

806
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:43,300
There's a lot of young hip-hop guys that love Izzner.

807
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,340
They reference him in all their songs.

808
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:48,420
Yeah, there's gotta be some hello samples in there.

809
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,560
So this was redone then,

810
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,740
and theoretically because the presence of Roger Rabbit

811
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,580
was decreased in the parks

812
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:03,200
due to the Amblin relationship fraying,

813
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:07,400
and which makes it on some websites kind of oddly said,

814
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,080
they had to switch it from Roger Rabbit

815
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:13,480
to goofy son Max to not upset Steven Spielberg,

816
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,920
or like to prevent a problem with Steven Spielberg.

817
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,640
I read that phrase too on the fandom page for this parade

818
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,360
after I dismissed about three different ads,

819
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,320
like three different pop-up ads.

820
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,160
Yeah, that's it.

821
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,160
Just a few more rounds of layoffs and a few more pop-ups

822
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,840
and you'll be okay, fandom.

823
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,680
You'll be a solvent website, we believe in you.

824
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,680
There's a lot of weeds in that garden.

825
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,520
Yeah.

826
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,600
You got a lot of whacking to do if you go to fandom.com.

827
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,080
So Max is in, hey, I think they picked the right,

828
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,040
hey, you know what, Goof Troop completely, the vibe.

829
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,400
Yes, yeah, and the theme song as well.

830
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,280
Yeah, yeah.

831
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,360
I just learned that the guy who sings

832
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,240
the Goof Troop theme song is a guy named Phil Perry,

833
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:05,760
who is the singer on so many 80s, 90s smooth jazz songs

834
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,760
that I love. Oh really?

835
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,400
And I never put the connection together.

836
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,040
There's so many things like that where I'm like,

837
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:13,040
why do I love this music and I love these Disney theme songs?

838
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,560
Same fucking people. Wow.

839
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,760
Singer of Toto, singer of Gummy Bears.

840
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,760
Yeah, right. There's a ton of the same horn players

841
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:23,240
on DuckTales as play on King of Wishful Thinking,

842
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,800
everything I like. Yeah.

843
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,720
Shout out to Phil Perry.

844
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,160
I just did, I did a full hour long

845
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,520
Lucather interview last night

846
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,560
while I was doing stuff together.

847
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,240
Hell yeah, which one, Sunset Sound?

848
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,280
No, it was Rick, what's Rick's name?

849
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,640
Rick Beato. Beato, yeah.

850
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,960
I'm getting a lot of Rick Beato.

851
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,720
Yeah, I do a lot of Rick these days.

852
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,880
Rick pops up a lot.

853
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,080
Everyone seems to respect Rick also.

854
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,960
Yeah, I don't know from what, I don't know who he is,

855
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,520
but you know, puts a good interview together.

856
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,520
You get an aging rocker talking about how like,

857
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,000
yeah, that was how it was, man.

858
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,960
We just sat down, we didn't even have the track.

859
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,200
We had to sit down and figure it out by take two.

860
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,440
Yeah, you get a lot of like,

861
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,080
and Quincy Q called us into the studio, man,

862
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,400
and he was like, man, this is too metal.

863
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,280
When you're playing on Beat It, it's too metal.

864
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,960
This needs to be on pop or R&B radio, man.

865
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,200
This is not, this is too much.

866
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,320
And so I had to get back in there.

867
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,480
I knew what he meant.

868
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,320
Music to my ears, music to my ears.

869
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,760
I also like what Lucather's doing

870
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,400
with the hair and the beard.

871
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,880
Well, he's going gray, finally.

872
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,160
He's going gray. He's letting it go.

873
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,360
I think there might be, he might be doing something too.

874
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,160
Maybe let that be a lesson to you, Mike.

875
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,480
But I think he's doing something.

876
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,800
There's a different, like, it looks too cool.

877
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,840
The gray looks kind of like stylized gray,

878
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,760
and I don't know if it's his natural gray.

879
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,000
I think it looks good, though.

880
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,240
I think it's a dyed gray.

881
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,600
It might be a dyed gray, I don't know.

882
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:38,480
Could it just be like, you know, vitamin E and fish oil?

883
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,920
Or could it be supplements?

884
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,840
It could be Rick Beato or whatever his last name is.

885
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,680
He should ask him about the hair.

886
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,480
It's amazing that the old rock star interviews

887
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,880
on YouTube aren't just all about supplements.

888
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,720
Oh yeah.

889
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,040
And like, you know, like, colon health.

890
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,600
You know that's what they talk about

891
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,760
every second before and after the record.

892
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,600
Of course.

893
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,840
What are you drinking to start the day, my man?

894
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,240
You dump a collagen water?

895
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,560
You doing the athletic greens?

896
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,000
What are you doing?

897
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,880
How is it that our show here in late 30s, early 40s

898
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,600
is the one that has more talk about, like,

899
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,320
dribbling when you pee now?

900
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:14,520
How is that us and not Rick Beato?

901
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:18,080
We're more confessional, you know.

902
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,120
This is more into a look into our lives.

903
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:20,960
It's raw.

904
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,800
Yeah, it's unplugged.

905
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,920
It's more twisted in a lot of ways.

906
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,960
Yeah, raw look inside our pants that are dribbly dicks.

907
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,240
Sure.

908
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,480
I'm not gonna put myself in that.

909
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,320
I have no problem with the dribble.

910
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,680
Scott's very much that he's never dribbled in his life.

911
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,320
Jason and I are dribbling constantly.

912
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,400
I mean, yeah.

913
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,960
What's going on with Mike?

914
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,080
I got some health stuff going on that's understandable.

915
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,000
The doctor said it's a little bit, it's fine.

916
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,840
It's not normal.

917
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,680
A little bit.

918
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,960
He showed me on a diagram how it's normal.

919
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,040
You've talked to a doctor about this?

920
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,880
Of course.

921
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,720
Just wanna make sure.

922
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,560
He goes, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

923
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,680
It's all, he goes, and he showed me, like,

924
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,480
that the pee has to go over a certain part

925
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:03,640
of your anatomy to get to the hole to get out.

926
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,480
So he was just like, yeah, you see,

927
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,440
some of it gets kind of trapped up here.

928
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,800
It's normal to have a little bit.

929
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,440
You know, I'd honestly, I'd be more concerned

930
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,200
about somebody your age who doesn't dribble.

931
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,040
Actually, the dribble is more healthy.

932
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:14,880
He didn't go that far.

933
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,280
And if you're ever talking to a friend of yours

934
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,760
who claims that he doesn't dribble,

935
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,000
I'd get him in to see me soon,

936
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,640
because we gotta scrape that entire urethra out.

937
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,480
He did say that.

938
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,920
This is what the listeners demand.

939
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,920
We're back to what they're begging for.

940
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,680
Wait, we've gotten to the blood flow talk.

941
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,680
The pee tree's blood flow is age.

942
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,640
In your penis?

943
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,960
Oh, everywhere.

944
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,800
I just only started reading about it,

945
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,600
so I can't speak as an expert.

946
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,280
I don't know nothing about any of that.

947
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,120
I don't, we don't wanna bog this down.

948
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,120
People will give us nice compliments sometimes,

949
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,680
and you know, if we post a dry topic

950
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,000
or say we wanna talk about a dry thing,

951
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,440
people will say like, you know what, that's okay.

952
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,640
I'd listen to the boys talk about paint dry.

953
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,480
Oh, yeah, yeah.

954
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,560
They can, and that's a nice thing to see.

955
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,400
However, listeners, I would caution you, anything?

956
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,680
I'm not so sure.

957
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,000
Well, everyone.

958
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,240
When the blood health episode comes out.

959
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,880
Yeah, blood health, urological health.

960
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,000
You don't think about these things, you know,

961
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,280
but it's good, you know.

962
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,120
As you get older.

963
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,640
It mostly comes back to drinking lots of water,

964
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,480
like you're doing.

965
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,960
As I'm doing right now, yes.

966
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,800
I got water, too.

967
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,640
And we all got big waters.

968
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,160
I think I'd rather do the hydration episode,

969
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,920
the how you hydrate an episode,

970
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,600
than Wayland Flowers and Madam.

971
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,520
I think I would more, I would rather hear

972
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,120
about all of your bowel health, then.

973
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:37,120
I would be happy to talk about my bowel health in general,

974
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,920
but I will also say that every day,

975
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,240
a new little piece of Wayland Flowers and Madam

976
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,920
gets entered into my brain,

977
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,840
and it makes me want to discuss it with people more.

978
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,640
This is what you should be discussing with your doctor.

979
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,000
This is the biggest problem to your health,

980
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,720
and therefore mine.

981
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,320
Yeah, you should talk to someone

982
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,680
about eating all those Madam puppets,

983
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,240
slowly getting into, that can be good for your digestion.

984
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,080
No, well that's true.

985
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:04,920
Micro Madam puppets.

986
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,840
Micro.

987
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,200
From thrown away Madam.

988
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,240
It's, yeah, it's penetrating my blood-brain barrier.

989
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,160
That's for sure.

990
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,680
That's all I know, is that I have too much Madam.

991
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,720
I have too much Madam on the brain and in the gut.

992
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,480
My microbiome has too much Madam.

993
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,080
We scraped your stomach

994
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,840
and found little pieces of pink feather boa.

995
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:29,840
Oh, enough of that grotesquery.

996
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,680
Let's get out of here.

997
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,840
Back to these Mickey ones.

998
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:36,840
There is a, yeah, this is a cultural grotesquery.

999
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,280
So, Roger Abbott's out.

1000
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,320
New dialogue with Goofy and his son Max, who is cool,

1001
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,720
as we know from Goofy. Max is cool, yes.

1002
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:48,000
Garsh, Max, sounds like a party.

1003
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,760
Do you think I ought to bring some punch?

1004
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,720
They changed that.

1005
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,080
Max, response.

1006
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:55,080
Aw, Dad, you're such a narfo.

1007
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,080
It's a Def Jam and we're all gonna groove

1008
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,480
with the rest of the gang.

1009
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,240
Aw, Dad, you're such a narfo.

1010
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,080
What is that even coming from?

1011
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,840
It sounds like a 90s insult.

1012
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,520
I think that it's one of those kinds of things.

1013
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,200
Now I don't remember that this is something

1014
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,680
that is very much in Kyle Mooney's wheelhouse,

1015
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,600
something he did on our show, smashed a lot.

1016
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,960
Some slang that completely sounds like

1017
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,280
it would have been something the kid with attitude

1018
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,120
would have said.

1019
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,680
And I think that's what we're dealing with here.

1020
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,200
I don't think there's a narfo in the world.

1021
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:32,000
It sounds like you could, unless this is a missed,

1022
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
unless the guy on this website was supposed to be,

1023
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,680
no, it wouldn't have been NARC.

1024
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,160
Goofy wants to party.

1025
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,720
NARC wouldn't have been.

1026
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:43,160
No, narfo I think is made up.

1027
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,680
Narf is like pinky in the brain.

1028
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,280
Yes, right, pinky says narf.

1029
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,800
Yeah, well that's confusing.

1030
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,720
He says narf, but he doesn't say narfo.

1031
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,560
He doesn't say narfo.

1032
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,240
So maybe somebody wrote narf.

1033
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,080
Narfo is a zuzzy zazz.

1034
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,040
It's a like, well, no one in the office

1035
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,280
actually knows what one of the cool words,

1036
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,800
and nobody could text at this time

1037
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,400
so you couldn't check in with your niece

1038
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,360
to see what cool kids are saying.

1039
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,680
So you just had to go off the dome

1040
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,480
and make up something like narfo.

1041
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,800
You Google narfo, I don't find anything.

1042
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,480
I find an organization which is

1043
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,000
the National Association of Responsible Firearm Owners.

1044
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,840
Oh wow.

1045
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,640
Which you know what,

1046
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,040
and that appears to maybe be in New Zealand.

1047
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,400
I was gonna say, it doesn't sound like something

1048
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,240
we'd have in America.

1049
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,080
I was gonna say that's not right.

1050
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:26,920
They're responsible.

1051
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,760
That can't be a big group.

1052
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,240
That's nothing you'd be proud of.

1053
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,760
There's a different group that has a different

1054
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,600
shorter, smaller amount of letters.

1055
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:37,080
Yeah, it's the group whose motto is,

1056
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,520
hey, come here, you wanna look in this drawer.

1057
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,680
You know, those PSA cards.

1058
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,520
Sure.

1059
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,360
Please, uncle.

1060
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:48,520
So yeah, I think Disney made up a phrase.

1061
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,200
Narfo. And I encourage you at home

1062
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:54,560
to try it out, you know, call a loved one.

1063
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,400
Well, no, don't.

1064
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,280
No, don't, it's an insult, yeah.

1065
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,360
It's like calling your parents lame, I guess.

1066
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,040
Lame, narfo means lame.

1067
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,280
Something I could do, I could, you know,

1068
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,160
because you sort of have control.

1069
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:08,000
We have young children, they parrot our language.

1070
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,080
I could convince my son that narfo

1071
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,320
is something that you could call.

1072
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,440
I would love if he started saying narfo.

1073
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,160
Yeah, you're a narfo.

1074
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,280
Yeah, I'm gonna try to steer him away

1075
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,080
from the insults he's been using,

1076
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:20,920
that's what you're thinking.

1077
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,440
And I'm gonna change it into this more fun one.

1078
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,040
Yeah, one that can't hurt me

1079
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,080
because it doesn't actually mean anything.

1080
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,560
It's not real.

1081
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,960
We can start selling some T-shirts

1082
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,800
like Frankie says, relax, those shirts were huge.

1083
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,680
We can sell, don't be a narfo.

1084
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,400
It's a major 90s throwback.

1085
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,960
Boy, remember when you get home,

1086
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,040
you'd open up your pack of gushers?

1087
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,720
If your mom said, you have to have broccoli instead,

1088
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,840
you'd say, mom, you're such a narfo.

1089
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,640
This was part of being a 90s kid.

1090
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,680
I guess we used to remember what it was like.

1091
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,080
Yeah, we remember.

1092
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,640
We remember every day for many hours.

1093
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,040
What kind of kid were you in the 90s?

1094
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,000
A totally rad dude or a total narfo?

1095
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,280
I think we were all closer to being narfos.

1096
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,920
Yeah, we were definitely narfos.

1097
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,720
Some of the youngest narfos around.

1098
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,160
Yeah, luckily we've grown out of it.

1099
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,360
What if we're such narfos

1100
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:14,280
that we don't even know that narfo was a word?

1101
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,120
It's possible.

1102
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,040
It was something the cool kids were saying

1103
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,160
and the listeners are all going,

1104
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,880
they don't even know narfo.

1105
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:20,720
It's possible.

1106
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,880
They're talking about their dribble dicks

1107
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:25,240
and they didn't even know that all cool kids said narfo.

1108
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,760
It was something they said on Single Out.

1109
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,120
They probably weren't allowed to watch it.

1110
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,160
Everyone who listens to this podcast hasn't told us

1111
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,880
they listen because they want to make fun of us.

1112
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,720
So that's just-

1113
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,520
It seems like a few do.

1114
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,640
Well, a few do, fair enough.

1115
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,480
Statistically.

1116
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,400
Fair enough, a few people do want to make fun of us

1117
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:45,880
and they vocalize it, but everyone does actually,

1118
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:46,960
they don't say it.

1119
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,360
So I appreciate them being quiet about it.

1120
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,240
It's being a listener bully.

1121
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,080
Yes, right.

1122
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:55,560
Which is, thank God there's a big gap between us and them

1123
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,200
unless they come to a live show to beat us up.

1124
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,480
We're making a big leap when we do these things

1125
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,760
and we talk to people after that there's not,

1126
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,480
someday there's gonna be the one who's like,

1127
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:08,400
I've waited six years for this, suck.

1128
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,320
So Living with the Land fan.

1129
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,480
Living with the Land fan.

1130
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,920
I don't know.

1131
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,080
Let's see if it was, wait, Zach Ryder's on my side,

1132
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,040
wasn't he?

1133
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,080
Yes, he was, yes.

1134
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:19,920
All right, yeah, I know.

1135
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:20,760
I think I'm gonna help you.

1136
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,680
He's on your side, but Matt Cardona's fury.

1137
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,680
He's alter ego.

1138
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:25,840
Yeah.

1139
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,760
I don't think anyone's tried to beat him up though

1140
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,560
for Living with the Land.

1141
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,400
Yeah, yeah.

1142
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,160
Well, that's what I'll just, you know,

1143
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:36,880
let's just have him at any future shows if possible.

1144
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,680
So anyways, that gets us into the parade.

1145
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:40,720
We've got cool songs.

1146
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,280
We've got an RFO talk.

1147
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,800
Now I think it's time to just throw out

1148
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,280
as many details as we can about the things

1149
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,280
that occur in this parade.

1150
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,240
Yeah.

1151
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,040
Just call it like you see it.

1152
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,880
There's a lot of rollerblading.

1153
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,600
Pluto is on a skateboard.

1154
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,200
And some of it is like, you know,

1155
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,800
it's like the parade extras and they got backwards caps

1156
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,680
and they're rollerblading, but it will also be like,

1157
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:07,320
I don't, I can't, you know,

1158
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,840
like the witch from Snow White or something.

1159
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1160
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:11,520
That's one, but you know what I mean?

1161
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,360
It's a random Disney, yeah.

1162
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,200
Yeah, yeah.

1163
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,320
They're in rollerblades.

1164
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:17,840
Yeah, well, I got one, I got a picture I took.

1165
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,720
I was watching it on a TV.

1166
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:24,040
I took, this is Alice, Wendy and Peter Pan.

1167
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:28,520
I think Pinocchio's off screen on large adult tricycles.

1168
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:31,280
Like, I don't know what to call it, three wheel bikes?

1169
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,400
They're trikes, aren't they?

1170
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,520
Yeah, they're, you know, they have elaborate costumes on.

1171
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:41,000
So you probably don't want those caught in a standard bike.

1172
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,360
You probably don't want them trying to balance

1173
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,760
in a face character costume.

1174
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,640
So the three wheels is probably easier to manage.

1175
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,760
Yeah, maybe.

1176
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,000
That's tough work that you got a Geppetto head on,

1177
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,320
Smeez back there.

1178
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,160
Yeah.

1179
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,160
You gotta dress as Smee and ride a trike around.

1180
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,120
Seems hard.

1181
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,000
Yeah, yeah.

1182
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,560
I'm more impressed by that in a way

1183
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,840
than the actual BMX stunts, because there is one of the,

1184
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:07,040
and this, I don't remember if I sat and watched this parade,

1185
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,960
but I remember the existence of it at this time

1186
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:14,960
and that there was a float with a slide and a bike rant

1187
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:18,680
that kind of did a couple little humps,

1188
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:22,520
and then you could go flying off them, and that's cool,

1189
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:25,120
but those guys don't have Smee heads on.

1190
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:25,960
No. Right.

1191
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:28,560
There should be a Smee version of this parade.

1192
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,880
Smee madness, Smee mania.

1193
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:31,720
There's the-

1194
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,600
Where everyone has Smee heads.

1195
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,000
Captain Hook would be so mad.

1196
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:35,840
Summer of Smee.

1197
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:38,200
That's not the natural order of things.

1198
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,880
I have to die for Smee to rise.

1199
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,320
You remember the summer of 95 when the big six were

1200
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:48,600
Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Pluto, Goofy, and Smee?

1201
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,760
Summer of Smee. I remember.

1202
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:51,600
Summer of Smee, yeah.

1203
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,440
The summer of Smee.

1204
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,880
I don't know what he sounds like.

1205
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:55,720
I can't even think he sounds like that.

1206
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,120
He sounds like kind of wimpy, like-

1207
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,960
Yeah, does he have that voice?

1208
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,920
I don't know about that, sir.

1209
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:04,080
Does he, I was gonna say the slides float.

1210
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,560
I didn't see this live as a 90s kid,

1211
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,560
but this would have really gone,

1212
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,200
holy shit, there's a slide on the parade route.

1213
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,040
Wow.

1214
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:15,160
And they make, they'll like push Donald Duck down it.

1215
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,280
Yeah. And he has to like slowly,

1216
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,880
that kind of slide, cause it's like a spiral slide.

1217
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,720
Metal spiral slide, yeah. And metallic.

1218
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,120
This is something my dad says every time

1219
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,480
we're at a playground with my son.

1220
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,760
It's like, boy, don't you miss the hot, hot metal?

1221
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:28,600
Oh yeah.

1222
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:31,280
You'd go past the, you'd like get caught on like the,

1223
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,320
you know, the parts where they connect and the screws.

1224
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,520
And it is funny.

1225
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,280
That was more the case that they didn't make,

1226
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,480
that playgrounds weren't very kid friendly

1227
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,160
until about 20 years ago.

1228
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,320
Yeah.

1229
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,480
But yeah, you can just imagine, you know,

1230
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,360
cause you've been on slides like that maybe as an adult

1231
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:51,480
and like, boy, the slow scrape that you do.

1232
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,080
So imagine being your Donald,

1233
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,440
and then just like skunk, skunk, skunk,

1234
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,240
just moving three inches at a time kind of painfully.

1235
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,840
That's not an easy slide for Donald.

1236
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,840
Seat gets caught.

1237
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,680
There's some more stationary.

1238
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:10,680
There's the float with Goofy on a BMX bike

1239
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,480
that is attached to the float.

1240
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,400
And it's attached, it's doing a wheelie,

1241
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,560
but he doesn't really, he just moves the handlebars sometimes

1242
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:23,000
and mostly waves and kind of dances sitting on the bike.

1243
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,040
It's a perma wheelie.

1244
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,400
It almost seems like they're,

1245
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:30,920
like he's powering it himself with the pedaling.

1246
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,680
I'm not sure if that's what they're trying to convey,

1247
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:33,800
but you feel that way a little bit.

1248
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:37,160
Also, by the way, style wise, okay,

1249
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,960
so I've said that there's like thousands of Mickey shapes,

1250
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:44,960
but also while it is a big, just insane mess of color,

1251
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:49,320
there is a ton of Mickey's primaries, right?

1252
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:52,720
It's Mickey's red from his pants.

1253
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,480
Mickey's yellow from his, yeah.

1254
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:56,320
Little red shorts.

1255
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,960
I'm sorry, shorts, and I should say little too.

1256
00:48:58,960 --> 00:48:59,840
Little red shorts.

1257
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,760
Yellow from his buttons.

1258
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:02,600
His shoes.

1259
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,440
Shoes, shoes.

1260
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,280
Shoes and buttons, right?

1261
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,280
Or are they white buttons?

1262
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,280
And then black.

1263
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,440
From his flesh.

1264
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:10,840
His fur flesh.

1265
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:11,960
His fur flesh, yeah.

1266
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,280
From his hair.

1267
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,960
And it is like, it is overwhelming,

1268
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,920
this amount of red and black.

1269
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,160
It's a real choice.

1270
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:25,200
I would put this whole parade in the vibe,

1271
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,400
a vibe that I love.

1272
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,080
I would consider this an example of factory pomo,

1273
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,280
which I'm sure I've talked about on the show at some point,

1274
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,120
but it's this kinda, it's hard to explain.

1275
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:35,360
You know it when you see it.

1276
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:37,480
It's like a lot of circular logos,

1277
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:38,800
and gears are part of it,

1278
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,360
and I think clocks are related to gears,

1279
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,680
and there's a little bit of art deco,

1280
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,800
and big blocky fonts, and limited color palettes,

1281
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,240
which is what this is, and hard contrast,

1282
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,960
and a lot of basic shapes.

1283
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,800
Squares, circles,

1284
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,600
I was waiting, squares, circles, triangles,

1285
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,560
and then a lot of zigzags.

1286
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:00,200
Disney actually did a lot of factory pomo.

1287
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:03,720
Basically, you'd see this at, besides Disney,

1288
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:07,280
you'd see this, that SNL logo in the 90s where it's round,

1289
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,720
and there's the little crosses between every word.

1290
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:15,440
A lot of CD-ROM covers, a lot of food court logos,

1291
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,360
but also, this is definitely very factory pomo.

1292
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:21,120
Tomorrowland 94 has a lot of examples of it.

1293
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:21,960
My favorite.

1294
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,040
With its very art deco, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1295
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,880
Innoventions, I think, is,

1296
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:28,040
because you'd see that logo round,

1297
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,960
and I feel like I could picture it on something shiny,

1298
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,760
like a CD.

1299
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,520
It's a type of 90s that I don't think is exploited enough.

1300
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,400
I think it's fascinating and cool.

1301
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,760
It's something I like because of the 90s,

1302
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,360
because of being a child in the 90s,

1303
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,280
but I don't, some of it I guess I like,

1304
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,120
if I think about it.

1305
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,600
I guess I like the Innoventions, but it feels.

1306
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:46,600
It's like tackier.

1307
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:47,760
It's tacky.

1308
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,920
Yeah, I guess I don't want it everywhere.

1309
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,960
There's a time and a place for factory pomo,

1310
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:54,880
but that's another, if you do a Google image of that,

1311
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,920
and then just kind of like soak up,

1312
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:00,240
just like get yourself a hit of factory pomo.

1313
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,680
I think it'll make you happy.

1314
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,320
Here's a food court, here's a good food court one.

1315
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,560
Oh yes, I've seen that one.

1316
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:10,560
Yeah, yeah, any sign like that with like shish kebabs.

1317
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:12,360
Beakman's World logo.

1318
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,320
Beakman's World logo comes up.

1319
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:18,960
A lot of 90s basketball team logo,

1320
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,160
like if they did a 90s remake,

1321
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:24,920
like Phoenix Suns, it looks like they had a factory pomo.

1322
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:26,320
That is good, I like a lot of this, yeah.

1323
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:29,040
I can't tell this is a modern reinterpretation,

1324
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,360
but I'll call this Trapper Keepers Chic.

1325
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:33,200
Totally.

1326
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,320
This type of early CG, basic CG.

1327
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,960
The main Tomorrowland sign, which is gone now,

1328
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,800
but the one on the big.

1329
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,640
With gears behind it.

1330
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:47,360
Like the weird gear thing.

1331
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,000
Somewhere in our Tomorrowland Explorator,

1332
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,080
we should just like fully tribute Tomorrowland.

1333
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,320
Let's try to carve out some space.

1334
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,280
Oh yeah.

1335
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:57,680
Just to gush, to bring up a word from this episode.

1336
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,080
We'll all be gushers when we talk about that.

1337
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:04,200
Beautiful, incredible Hulk lights, purples and greens.

1338
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,440
Yeah, yeah, very cool.

1339
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:06,280
Very soothing.

1340
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:09,000
So anyway, that's on the cooler end of this.

1341
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,640
On the less, on the weirder end is like,

1342
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:14,720
when Minnie is, well there's two Minnie.

1343
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:19,720
In Japan, Minnie is wearing like a head wrap or something.

1344
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,560
She kind of looks, I thought she looked

1345
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:23,120
kind of like Queen Latifah.

1346
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,080
Oh yeah, okay, I could see that.

1347
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:30,080
And then, but in America, she had a very different vibe,

1348
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,080
which is that here's her two ears,

1349
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:37,080
and then between them on the top of her head is a big bun.

1350
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:40,800
And the bun is black, like Mickey's flesh,

1351
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,960
and Minnie's flesh.

1352
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:45,920
And so it's very disconcerting to see two big ears

1353
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:49,040
and then an even bigger like hump.

1354
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,320
Like she got hit on the head.

1355
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:51,680
It looks like a cartoon, yeah,

1356
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,480
the cartoon character getting hit on the head,

1357
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,480
but without the little bald part.

1358
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:58,760
It looks like Minnie has a massive, massive tumor.

1359
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,560
It's really, I don't think it looks like a hair at all.

1360
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:03,400
Yeah, I know what you're saying.

1361
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:06,200
Why didn't they just like give her like blonde hairs

1362
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,960
like she dyed it or something maybe?

1363
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:09,360
That would have helped, yeah.

1364
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:10,360
But she doesn't have.

1365
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,880
They're going for Madonna a little bit with this,

1366
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,600
but maybe they didn't wanna go too far.

1367
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:17,680
Like I guess, can Minnie grow her fur out?

1368
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,640
That's a question I have.

1369
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:22,800
Does, yeah, does the top of her hair,

1370
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:27,440
I mean, I don't know her situation follicly in general.

1371
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:30,240
However, theoretically, yeah, you,

1372
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:35,240
couldn't you grow like a human hairdo

1373
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:37,320
from the top of your head?

1374
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40,040
Is it just a matter of taking the time growing it out

1375
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:40,880
and then shaping it?

1376
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,560
Has Mickey ever had like a mullet in anything?

1377
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:48,560
Has Minnie ever had like shoulder length fur?

1378
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,680
Cause mice don't have hair, they have fur.

1379
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:53,520
But I don't think they're short.

1380
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,640
So it would be a fur cut,

1381
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:55,480
the first style of hairdo.

1382
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:56,440
So I think she has to have a wig.

1383
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,680
This has to be a wig.

1384
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:01,080
She wanted a black wig that looks like a bun

1385
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,800
and she stuck it in between her two ears.

1386
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,360
Or they're going so logically that like,

1387
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,920
well, no, if Minnie grew her hair out, it would be black.

1388
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:08,480
It's fur.

1389
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,720
So if she were to make a bun, it would be black.

1390
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:14,520
There is, in the plain crazy,

1391
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,080
Mickey like messes his hair up at some point.

1392
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:19,080
That's true, he does have a little bit of a

1393
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,440
messy growth there.

1394
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:23,920
Like the black hair, flesh hair.

1395
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:24,760
Okay, you're right.

1396
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,760
He does have flesh hair.

1397
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:31,240
Both of them could like get really shaggy like a dog.

1398
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,080
And like shake it.

1399
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:34,480
Yeah, cause yeah, like a short hair dog,

1400
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,560
yeah, you can get a little of the fur to stick up,

1401
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,040
but not enough for a bun.

1402
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,240
We are deconstructing the characters

1403
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:45,560
much in the same way this parade deconstructs Mickey.

1404
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:47,120
It gets him down to the elements.

1405
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,720
I mean, that's a good thing to bring up

1406
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,400
that there is one of the more notable parts,

1407
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:54,520
I think is that you will at some point see

1408
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:59,360
just his gloves walking around with little legs.

1409
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,720
And then just his hat.

1410
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,480
And it's just like just a mousier hat.

1411
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,240
And then the shoes being driven around

1412
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,800
like they're the little bugs in the Main Street Electrical.

1413
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,640
But so there's a part of the big stretch of this

1414
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:17,120
where it's Mickey's body parts, giant and split apart.

1415
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:18,720
A big shoe car.

1416
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,480
You see a person driving it in the foothole.

1417
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:24,760
I, this struck me when I was watching it.

1418
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:28,400
I was like, oh my God, the shoes are being driven,

1419
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,520
but the gloves are inflatable.

1420
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:33,200
I think I'd like the inflatable gloves.

1421
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,040
What do you mean?

1422
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:37,240
Like I think the fingers of the hand

1423
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:42,240
are natural to be like the walking legs.

1424
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,240
You would like performing as the gloves?

1425
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,280
No, no, I just liked like, oh that makes sense

1426
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,920
being a big inflatable parade piece.

1427
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:51,760
I see, I see.

1428
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:55,000
The drivable shoes I had to think about longer

1429
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,440
because there's people sticking out of them

1430
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,600
and they have little hats on, kind of.

1431
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,440
They gotta see.

1432
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,640
But they're not like walking up and down like a shoe would.

1433
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,640
You're saying it's not as a good of a representation

1434
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,960
of what actually the hand would do as a walk.

1435
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:12,160
Because the hands are walking with little human legs.

1436
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,760
But they're walking like Cousin It would walk.

1437
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,000
Oh, I guess so.

1438
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:16,840
Using its fingers.

1439
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:19,840
I think in cartoons, yeah, the hand or glove

1440
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:22,920
turned into like a walking around Cousin It kind of thing.

1441
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:24,600
A shoe wouldn't glide across.

1442
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:25,840
If a shoe came to life,

1443
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,480
it would not glide across the ground.

1444
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:29,080
It would probably be jumping.

1445
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,920
It would like heel, toe, heel, toe.

1446
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:31,760
I see, you're right.

1447
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,360
It is the finger, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1448
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:34,200
Taking a little.

1449
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,560
So you would need it to at least,

1450
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:36,960
they should have built in something

1451
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,400
like the Indiana Jones ride

1452
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,040
that made it kind of go up and down, up and down

1453
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,360
as it drove around Main Street.

1454
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:43,600
And the more we talk about this,

1455
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,480
the more horrifying it becomes.

1456
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,160
Yeah, yeah, I know.

1457
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,720
Accurate footsteps seem scary to me.

1458
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:51,360
The whole thing does just like,

1459
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:55,920
I mean, what I flashed to is a version of this

1460
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:00,560
where it was all laid out one day by Mickey

1461
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:03,360
in some crazed energy burst.

1462
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,200
Yeah.

1463
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,200
I had a vision, bear with me.

1464
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,720
Thanks a lot for coming in on no notice.

1465
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,040
And for coming in on a Saturday.

1466
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:12,320
Yeah, 11 PM, our Saturday.

1467
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:13,800
I know it's a three day week.

1468
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,000
With inspiration strikes, you gotta be here.

1469
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,520
I got you all on call like Prince.

1470
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:20,600
You gotta call 3AM, you gotta come.

1471
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,720
So go with me.

1472
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:25,000
All right, my body is huge.

1473
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:28,040
Split up, man's chopped off, feet chopped off.

1474
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:30,880
They're giant, they fill up all of Main Street.

1475
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,600
And then behind that, 2,000 bees.

1476
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:39,120
If I'm the star and you break me up into component pieces,

1477
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,920
you two get more stars.

1478
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:43,440
Stars in the sky, helps everybody.

1479
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:46,160
You'll find a plush of me under each of your chairs

1480
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,920
and you'll find a machete.

1481
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,120
I want you to chop me up right now

1482
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:51,560
and imagine what it looks like

1483
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:54,240
if I'm flying down Main Street piece by piece.

1484
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:56,760
No bad ideas, I won't be insulted.

1485
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:58,400
We're in the blue sky phase.

1486
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,280
Then they do it.

1487
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,560
No, not the face, never the face.

1488
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,400
Don't cut this face.

1489
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,400
The company is built on this face, damn it.

1490
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,520
That might, I want you to go, you sick rake.

1491
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:10,360
Get out of here.

1492
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,520
Mickey, we've mocked up your giant tongue.

1493
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:14,400
We're gonna drag it, we're gonna have 10 people

1494
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,280
drag your giant tongue down Main Street

1495
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:17,560
and it's gonna be wet.

1496
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:18,400
Ooh, I like this.

1497
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,120
Okay, that's pretty good.

1498
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:21,440
You're interesting, you're interesting.

1499
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,120
Well, let's run it, let's rehearse it

1500
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:26,640
as long as no children vomit when they see it.

1501
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:27,760
We'll send it out.

1502
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,240
Mickey, they all vomited.

1503
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:32,680
Oh, God damn it.

1504
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,720
Someone get Kronenberg on the phone.

1505
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,160
Let's tell it to him.

1506
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:38,400
It's also like one of the like.

1507
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,560
That hack'll take any.

1508
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,040
It also feels like one, if he was planning this out,

1509
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,600
you get like your project lead on this

1510
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:48,960
and you get a call from Mickey at 5 a.m., 3 a.m.

1511
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,720
Oh yeah, you know those punching bags

1512
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,800
with the sand on the bottom and they pop back up

1513
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:53,720
when you punch them?

1514
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:57,560
I want 50 of those, I want to see them tomorrow, okay?

1515
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:58,640
Is that what that is?

1516
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:01,560
I was trying, I was like, I think that's an oblong

1517
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:03,400
old style punching bag, kind of.

1518
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,760
I'm seeing me and inflatable, kind of like

1519
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:10,960
the shape of grimace a little bit, but it's me.

1520
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:15,040
And then, cherry on top, no limbs, no limbs.

1521
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:17,480
They don't get them, that's what makes me different.

1522
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:21,640
I get to wave, point my hands around, do a spell, not them.

1523
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,040
Are you writing this down?

1524
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,760
I don't hear a bit, so I'm writing this down.

1525
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,560
Listening for instruction.

1526
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:29,200
Donald, can you just talk to him?

1527
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:32,720
I think the Lion King money is going to his head.

1528
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,480
He's writing a high from the rock.

1529
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,480
Can't do it still.

1530
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:45,160
I want to be inflatable, like Superman flying through,

1531
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:48,920
you know, you ever been in the circus

1532
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:50,560
and they jump through those rings?

1533
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:53,480
I want it to be like that, but wait.

1534
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:56,760
Also, it's like my ears are the rings as well,

1535
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,000
so my ears are on top of one of the rings.

1536
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,240
Wait, Mickey, slow down, what are you talking about?

1537
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:03,080
What do you mean, what am I talking about?

1538
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:05,080
I made it fucking clear.

1539
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:05,920
I'm Superman.

1540
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,440
It's my job to think of it, it's your job

1541
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:11,000
to write it down and do a drawing of my dreams.

1542
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,040
Inflatable Superman through the rings

1543
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,080
that are also my head and ears.

1544
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:18,120
The top stomach down is what I'm saying,

1545
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:19,520
permanent stomach down.

1546
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,120
Hang up.

1547
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:22,600
What, what was he saying?

1548
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:24,000
We're gonna get our asses handed to us

1549
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
if we don't have like 10 mock-ups of this.

1550
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Oval punch, did someone, oval punching bags?

1551
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,120
Okay, well, a thing that stuck out to me

1552
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:38,120
when you were showing clips, Scott, that hasn't come up,

1553
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:41,880
the stilt walkers with staffs.

1554
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:42,800
Oh yeah.

1555
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:46,320
They look very similar to the Epcot.

1556
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:47,160
Mickey's guards, yeah.

1557
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:48,000
Guards.

1558
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:48,840
Guards.

1559
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:49,840
Yeah, yeah.

1560
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,080
Yeah, do you think those, Mickey,

1561
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,720
do those ideas clash a little bit

1562
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:57,080
because we already have a thing with big stilt walking,

1563
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:58,680
Mickey guards with Mickey staff.

1564
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:00,120
What do you think?

1565
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:02,320
Answer your own question.

1566
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:05,080
When's it magic kingdom, what is it Epcot?

1567
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:08,160
Oh, uh.

1568
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,920
Actually, I need these.

1569
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,920
I need these for real.

1570
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:14,440
Why do I ever get out of my own car

1571
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,600
without 12 of these flaking me?

1572
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:20,680
Bugs Bunny's gonna come and shoot me in the head one day.

1573
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:22,640
Everybody's trying to steal my ideas.

1574
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:26,800
They wanted to know why I wasn't in Lion King.

1575
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,520
Why I wasn't the star of Lion King,

1576
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:32,080
and they, what they bring up a good fucking question.

1577
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:34,040
Why wasn't I in any of these movies?

1578
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:37,520
Simba mania wouldn't make any sense.

1579
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,840
No one would know what the shape was.

1580
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:41,840
Just a regular lion's head.

1581
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,800
In a lot of ways, the guards are there

1582
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,600
to protect them from me.

1583
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:51,600
The guards can form a prison around me.

1584
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:54,240
They make bars with the staffs.

1585
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,440
So when I say, let me at them,

1586
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:00,160
they'll slam the staffs down and protect you from me.

1587
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,800
You need to be thankful.

1588
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,360
I've got these guards.

1589
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:04,200
How about that?

1590
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,120
That's an American tale.

1591
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:06,960
Folk Fievel.

1592
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:11,720
Wanna know why there's no more Fievel movies?

1593
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:13,280
I killed him.

1594
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:15,080
Shh, don't tell anyone.

1595
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:19,560
Let's put Roger in this parade to make Steven upset.

1596
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:21,600
Let's make Steven sad.

1597
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:22,520
I don't care.

1598
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:23,880
I want him to be mad.

1599
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:26,640
Spielberg is such a narfo.

1600
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:27,960
Is that a real word, Mickey?

1601
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:30,200
It doesn't matter, it is now.

1602
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,960
I thought of it so it's real.

1603
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,320
It's real to me.

1604
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:37,080
What are the vats that Goofy and Max are overseeing

1605
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:38,040
in this parade?

1606
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:39,680
Do you say vats or glats?

1607
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:41,040
Vats or something to me.

1608
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:43,200
Yellow vats and then like, what's coming out of them?

1609
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,280
There's purple stuff?

1610
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:46,760
There's a purple top with Mickey ears on it,

1611
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:49,160
but they're in suits that look like they're trying

1612
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:51,200
to contain, like they're working with hazardous chemicals

1613
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:55,040
or something, and I can't tell what this float

1614
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:55,880
is supposed to be.

1615
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:57,320
There's a big Mickey inflatable hat on the back

1616
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:58,960
that's actually pretty standard,

1617
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:02,920
but then there are like four of these like drum,

1618
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:04,560
like tall drums.

1619
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:05,400
It's the dip.

1620
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:06,240
Yellow drums.

1621
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,200
I refined it.

1622
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,040
It's a new iteration.

1623
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:09,880
It could be the dip.

1624
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,840
New formula you could tell because it's purple,

1625
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,720
and this is how we're gonna generate

1626
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:15,520
the thousands and thousands of me's

1627
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:16,680
that we're gonna need for this.

1628
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:19,080
He's gonna hit Mufasa with the dip.

1629
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:20,240
Ha ha ha ha.

1630
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:23,440
Too popular.

1631
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,360
If you ever come back, it's gonna be for one of those

1632
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:27,800
shitty straight to DVD sequels

1633
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:30,840
or for some very unwatchable live action films

1634
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:31,840
way in the future.

1635
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,840
Stay in the sky, asshole.

1636
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:38,080
Barry Jenkins wants to work with Mufasa.

1637
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:38,920
That's his problem.

1638
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:42,800
You can shoot the dip into the sky with a big gun.

1639
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:45,000
I'll shoot your cloud for Mufasa.

1640
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,240
I don't care.

1641
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,080
It doesn't matter to me.

1642
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:49,880
I got a big cannon.

1643
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:52,840
Or I'll use one of the fireworks launchers at Disneyland.

1644
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:55,960
I got, I bought staffs and bulk.

1645
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:57,920
I'll just start launching them at you.

1646
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,320
I think whenever Disney stopped getting sponsorship deals

1647
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:04,400
from Dow Chemical.

1648
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,320
Oh yeah.

1649
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:07,200
On the way out the door, Mickey was like,

1650
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,200
if you got anything lying around,

1651
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,880
I gotta experiment with science on the side.

1652
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:18,240
Pooh Bear, it's the five o'clock shadow Pooh Bear

1653
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,600
in this parade where he has that like,

1654
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:23,080
his snoot is colored brown

1655
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:25,840
and it just looks like he's tired or he's been drinking

1656
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:27,480
or he just hasn't shaved in a while.

1657
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:29,400
He's getting a lot of five a.m. calls from Mickey.

1658
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:32,040
I still don't know why that's the version

1659
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:34,000
that they had for a while.

1660
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:34,840
I don't know.

1661
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:36,000
I think he's cute though.

1662
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:37,480
Yeah, I like him.

1663
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:39,760
I'd like to see him back on a throwback line or something

1664
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,880
where it's all Max is gonna be there,

1665
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:43,320
Darkwing Duck's gonna be there,

1666
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:46,200
five o'clock shadow snoot Pooh is gonna be there

1667
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,320
and that's exciting.

1668
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:49,080
Well, he does this like crazy,

1669
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:53,720
like kind of like swively worm kind of dance.

1670
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:55,320
He does real hip hop in this.

1671
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:57,320
So I'd like to see him at that,

1672
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:59,320
the some 90s event doing that.

1673
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:00,160
You know what?

1674
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:03,000
Pitch entire Mickey Mania parade.

1675
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,320
The whole thing's happening.

1676
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:07,240
I genuinely think they could bust this thing out now

1677
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:09,840
exactly and people would lose their minds.

1678
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:10,680
I think so, yeah.

1679
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:12,360
Part of the throwback night or whatever.

1680
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:13,200
Yeah.

1681
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,020
The only thing would be.

1682
01:05:14,020 --> 01:05:15,480
Oh no, regular park two.

1683
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:16,320
Just during the day.

1684
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:17,160
Oh yeah, probably.

1685
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:18,000
Yep, send it out.

1686
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,800
When is the majority of guests ever been mad at the parade?

1687
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:23,000
Even in the version,

1688
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
what's that one parade we did already an episode on

1689
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,320
with the like.

1690
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:27,960
Light magic with the pixies?

1691
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:28,800
The pixies and stuff.

1692
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,360
Yeah, that is probably the one.

1693
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:31,200
That's the only time people are like.

1694
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:34,880
Because they had terrifying scarred looking faces.

1695
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:36,000
Yeah.

1696
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,400
And replaced Main Street Electrical Parade.

1697
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,400
That's maybe the only time.

1698
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,760
Otherwise, yeah.

1699
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:42,040
I think you just bring this thing back exactly.

1700
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:43,320
Yeah.

1701
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:44,840
I mean, I guess there are,

1702
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:47,920
maybe some people are upset

1703
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:51,400
about some of the deconstructions and the freaks.

1704
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:56,260
And I guess if there was one,

1705
01:05:56,260 --> 01:05:58,200
and this is really the litmus test, I guess.

1706
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,320
If there was one that was going to upset you,

1707
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:01,880
maybe we've made it to this point.

1708
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:03,960
I think we all know which one I'm going to bring up.

1709
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:04,800
Yeah.

1710
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,920
Because we've seen every type of Mickey.

1711
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:10,040
There are weird inflatable limbless Mickeys

1712
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:12,000
as if he grew them in a lab.

1713
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,040
You know how KFC does the chickens without the,

1714
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:19,280
without the arms and legs, without wings?

1715
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:20,400
Let's do that.

1716
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:21,520
Let's get that done.

1717
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:25,080
But just, all right, do me a favor.

1718
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:28,080
Just grow 10,000 of them

1719
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:31,800
and the six most attractive ones we'll use in the parade.

1720
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:36,800
The rest, you know what to do, hit them with a dip.

1721
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:42,320
And I don't mean ranch or sour cream

1722
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,200
or sweet and sour sauce.

1723
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:46,920
I mean the dip.

1724
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,880
You know, you get my drift.

1725
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:49,720
So there's that.

1726
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:51,520
And then there's other like inflatable looking ones

1727
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:53,440
that just look like hulked out Mickeys.

1728
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:56,240
Essentially looks just like a bigger, stronger Mickey,

1729
01:06:56,800 --> 01:07:00,760
just massive, more a street shark slash Jay Leno proportions.

1730
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:01,840
Oh yeah.

1731
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:06,840
But the one is an upside down Mickey,

1732
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:12,640
like a fully distorted inverted Mickey

1733
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:17,640
who walks on his hands and his feet are up in the air.

1734
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:21,320
And also as part of this transformation,

1735
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:24,080
his seat is massive.

1736
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:29,080
So at the top of this Mickey is just a big wide butt,

1737
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:33,320
let's just say it, with giant shoes.

1738
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:37,840
So his whole, take Mickey, grow his entire lower half,

1739
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:41,200
puff it up full of helium by 50%,

1740
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:44,560
then flip it, make him walk around on his hands.

1741
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,760
And then is the head big and weird?

1742
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:49,080
No, head is normal.

1743
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:50,040
Head is normal.

1744
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:52,920
And depending on the photo or video you're looking at,

1745
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:56,240
down at his crotch or down at his butt?

1746
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:57,320
Yes.

1747
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:58,160
I don't know if-

1748
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:00,480
And the legs are real spread.

1749
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,080
I don't know if,

1750
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,880
even though you described it really accurately,

1751
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:09,560
you're gonna have to go to social media or Google this

1752
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:10,400
to find this.

1753
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,040
I mean I love for a listener,

1754
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:15,440
as the guy on the phone drawing Mickey's crazed visions,

1755
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:17,520
I would love to see somebody draw it

1756
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:18,440
based on my description.

1757
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:19,280
That's a good idea.

1758
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:20,520
I wonder if they'd get there.

1759
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:21,560
Maybe they'd get close.

1760
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:23,400
Yeah, it's weird.

1761
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:24,880
And then it's the fact that his head

1762
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:27,760
is then just like kinda looking at you straight,

1763
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:30,080
like it would be if he was a regular Mickey.

1764
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:32,080
But it's down at his butt.

1765
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:36,040
And it doesn't kind of seem like his head

1766
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:39,960
is trying to crawl out of his ass.

1767
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:42,120
Like he, like Mickey ate himself.

1768
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:43,200
That's what this whole thing is.

1769
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:45,240
It's like Mickey ate himself.

1770
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:47,120
It's a Mickey swallowing, so yes.

1771
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:49,000
It's a Mickey Ouroboros.

1772
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,920
It's not an alternate name, Mickey Ouroboros.

1773
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:54,200
It's almost like the Lonesome Ghosts cartoon

1774
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:58,080
where Goofy gets caught in the dresser drawers

1775
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,880
and he sees his own butt and then he attacks his own butt.

1776
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:03,280
He doesn't go inside his butt or anything.

1777
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:05,920
But it does have that body horror thing

1778
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:08,840
that I as a child, that part was a little disturbing to me

1779
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:10,720
because Goofy's hurting himself really badly

1780
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:13,320
and his body was contorted in such a crazy way.

1781
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:15,200
This just takes it to another level

1782
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:19,240
where Mickey has literally eaten his own head

1783
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:21,320
and it's coming out as rectum.

1784
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:22,160
This one good.

1785
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:24,040
This is the best Freak We Grew.

1786
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:26,120
This is my favorite movie.

1787
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:26,960
I like this.

1788
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:30,240
This is the, I look, not to call myself perfection,

1789
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:31,360
but I'm a fan.

1790
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:32,200
Look at me.

1791
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,240
America's a fan.

1792
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:34,480
The world's a fan.

1793
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:36,080
It speaks for itself.

1794
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:37,960
But maybe an improvement.

1795
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:40,120
Maybe I want you to join me.

1796
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:44,880
Imagine the world's first cartoon characters

1797
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,920
and the head is coming out of its rectum.

1798
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:51,040
It's breathtaking, isn't it?

1799
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:54,800
It's, I don't, how, why?

1800
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:58,360
Like there's a lot of other stuff in the parade.

1801
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,240
Why this?

1802
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:02,360
Why, how is it approved?

1803
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:04,360
It's one of the weirdest things

1804
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:05,560
that's ever been in the park.

1805
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:07,040
Yes, there's not a lot of things

1806
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,560
that you'd describe as disturbing.

1807
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:12,760
But I'm also not, I also think it's awesome.

1808
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:15,280
The guy, Disney Dan, did a video all about this

1809
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,840
and he's like, I hate it, kill it.

1810
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,520
I'm like, I feel the opposite.

1811
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:22,200
I don't disagree with any adjectives you're using,

1812
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:25,360
but I'm fascinated by this.

1813
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:28,880
I'd get a toy of this, I think.

1814
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:30,440
Well, we'd all get toys of that,

1815
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:32,560
Mickey with his head coming out of his ass.

1816
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:37,560
I think it's kind of like the legs and hands,

1817
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:40,560
well the hands are the legs.

1818
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:41,960
Ah, fuck.

1819
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:43,920
He's not really square,

1820
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:47,160
like it's not really stuck out like a starfish,

1821
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:50,040
but I feel like there were some stuffed clowns

1822
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:52,280
floating around like my house

1823
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:54,480
and my grandma's house growing up.

1824
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:56,960
And I feel like it's a version of that.

1825
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:59,280
Yeah, so maybe that's where it comes from.

1826
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:00,120
Lins spread way out.

1827
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:02,080
Yeah, lins spread way out.

1828
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:03,640
Right, and yeah, they weren't like, you couldn't.

1829
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:06,360
Some Christmas ornament clowns, I feel like.

1830
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:09,960
This is kind of, it's sort of like Sid from Toy Story

1831
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:11,280
took a Mickey.

1832
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:12,120
Oh yeah.

1833
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:15,520
And did one of his little Sid operations on it.

1834
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:20,400
But in this case, Mickey was like, approved, better.

1835
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:23,920
Is it for sure the performer's ass

1836
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:25,000
where Mickey's head is coming from?

1837
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,400
I think I saw videos where it's up front

1838
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,240
or he's where Mickey's head's packing up front.

1839
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:30,920
Because that's sort of the first thing I see

1840
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:33,640
is I can just see the person in it and essentially,

1841
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:37,000
like I know, obviously there's legs are on the ground.

1842
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,080
He's wearing gloves on his shoes.

1843
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:41,000
And it just looks like Mickey is covering their genitals.

1844
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,640
I think there is a version like that.

1845
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:46,800
So yeah, imagine an inverse Mickey

1846
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:50,320
who is dribbling his own head out of his dick.

1847
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:53,320
Right, or it's like an Austin Powers joke

1848
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:54,680
where he puts a Mickey head over

1849
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,320
to cover himself or something.

1850
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:59,480
That's sort of the way my brain goes, I don't know why.

1851
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:01,640
Austin Powers in the brain like usual, but.

1852
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:06,640
What a nightmare to like, imagine having a bad dream

1853
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,760
where you're about to have sex with somebody

1854
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:11,200
and then you unzip, you lower their pants

1855
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:13,640
and then there's a big Mickey Mouse head there.

1856
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:14,480
Oh God.

1857
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:18,480
Play listener, tell me if I, first apologies,

1858
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:21,520
second, tell me if I made you have that dream

1859
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:22,360
by saying that.

1860
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:24,080
Yeah, there's a few things.

1861
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:25,000
I don't think that's ever happened.

1862
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,080
I mean, people have maybe said

1863
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,280
that they've had dreams about the show,

1864
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:31,960
but if we ever provoked a nightmare with something in the,

1865
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:34,240
this would be the episode, this is where it happened.

1866
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:35,720
There's some ticking clocks in that.

1867
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:37,240
Well, it doesn't even have to be,

1868
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:38,760
it doesn't even have to be a sexual,

1869
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:40,800
here, I'll widen the nightmare out.

1870
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:42,120
It doesn't have to be a sexual thing.

1871
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:42,960
Just imagine you're going.

1872
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:45,120
I think that's like a weird, that's like if instead

1873
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,280
there's like a big steak or something.

1874
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,520
That's like something just, I don't know what to make of it.

1875
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:51,320
Well, imagine you're in one of those situations

1876
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:52,160
where you have to go to the bathroom

1877
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:54,280
in the middle of the night and sometimes,

1878
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:55,120
this happens to me, I don't know

1879
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,120
if it happens to you, gentlemen,

1880
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:58,200
I dream that I went to the bathroom

1881
01:12:58,200 --> 01:12:59,600
because I don't want to get up, I'm so tired,

1882
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:00,440
so I kind of have a dream that I went.

1883
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:01,640
I was sure that you were going to,

1884
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:03,160
because that wind up and then you said,

1885
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:06,280
I dribble a little bit and that's okay,

1886
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:08,080
medically speaking, actually, it's encouraged.

1887
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:11,040
It is, that was 100% correct things you just said,

1888
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,720
but that's not where I was headed.

1889
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:14,320
And you get up and you're actually dreaming,

1890
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:16,240
but you're imagining you're doing the thing

1891
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:18,040
that your brain is, have you ever had this?

1892
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:20,440
Imagining, I was so distracted by the dribble.

1893
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:23,240
Have you ever had a dream, you have an actual urge

1894
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:25,520
to go to the bathroom, but you are so tired,

1895
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,120
you're in the middle of sleep, that you kind of have

1896
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:29,440
a dream that you're going to the bathroom

1897
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:30,280
and you don't actually go.

1898
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:31,960
And that takes you into some tangent, yeah, sure.

1899
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:33,720
Yes, and it's still, like you wake up and you go,

1900
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:35,840
I never, I didn't go to the bathroom, now I have to go.

1901
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:37,920
I always find it interesting when the dreams hook up

1902
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:40,840
to you trying to sleep, where it like stems,

1903
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:44,120
instead of cutting to you somewhere completely different,

1904
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:47,280
I like when it's like, the dream started with me in bed

1905
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:49,560
at five a.m. and then I went on a little adventure

1906
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:51,120
from there and I always find that interesting.

1907
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:53,960
I only have that usually when I'm taking a nap,

1908
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:56,840
where I almost have this weird like,

1909
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:58,800
now we start literally where I am

1910
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:01,120
and then weird stuff starts happening.

1911
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:03,480
But it's usually nap, I don't know why.

1912
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:04,560
Night, I don't have that.

1913
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:07,040
Free from sleep, the dreams can get a little crazy.

1914
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:07,880
Uh-huh.

1915
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:08,700
But you remember them better.

1916
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:10,160
But anyway, now we've lost the whole point,

1917
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:11,560
so people have forgotten what I was talking about.

1918
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:12,400
But I was over here.

1919
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:13,240
If this was the Joe Rogan era.

1920
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:15,280
The nightmare experience, that dream talk

1921
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:17,680
would go for 120 more minutes.

1922
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:20,120
That's true, and we would be making millions.

1923
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:21,560
We'd be making millions of dollars.

1924
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:23,960
DMT plus clips.

1925
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,520
Ketamine, DMT.

1926
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,440
DMT shit's fucking crazy, dude.

1927
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:31,480
Yeah, ice baths or ice, cold plunges.

1928
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:32,560
Is that a big thing with them?

1929
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:33,560
Cold plunges are getting pretty popular.

1930
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:36,040
Cold plunges are back with the celebs, too.

1931
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:38,040
A lot of celebs doing cold plunges.

1932
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:40,600
Steve Harvey, big cold plunge guy.

1933
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:42,160
I listen to like an hour long thing

1934
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:44,600
of what Steve Harvey does now for his health.

1935
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,240
Cold plunge, a big part of it.

1936
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:48,680
Now here, look, it's all to taste,

1937
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:49,760
because I thought it was cool

1938
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:52,500
you were listening to Rick Bito and Steve Lukather.

1939
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:55,400
But then, so who am I to criticize?

1940
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:57,360
You listening to an hour of Steve Harvey

1941
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:59,720
talking about his health regimen?

1942
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:00,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1943
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:01,480
I don't know maybe it was 45 minutes.

1944
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:02,320
In what form?

1945
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:04,000
I'm trying to remember.

1946
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:04,820
This is actually a few weeks ago,

1947
01:15:04,820 --> 01:15:05,660
so I can't remember what show it was.

1948
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:07,880
But I don't remember how I got there.

1949
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:08,880
I love Steve Harvey.

1950
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:10,360
I think Steve Harvey's so funny.

1951
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:12,240
So it was popping up in my algorithm.

1952
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:15,060
And then he just started talking about his cold plunges

1953
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:17,480
and this guy turned him on to a bunch of different things

1954
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:19,940
like the whatever, some red light machine,

1955
01:15:19,940 --> 01:15:22,280
rich person's red light machine or something.

1956
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:24,040
And I was fascinated by it.

1957
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:24,880
Good start.

1958
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:27,200
This was also said in last week's episode, too.

1959
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:30,040
But you're gonna do every one of these things.

1960
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:30,880
Yeah.

1961
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:31,720
Cost permitting.

1962
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:33,880
You are going to do every single

1963
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:36,640
insane celebrity life extending thing.

1964
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:38,260
I can't wait to see.

1965
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:40,560
So Mike has this red machine.

1966
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:41,400
What does it do?

1967
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:43,240
I don't know, it blasts red at him.

1968
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:44,320
I mean, that's the short version.

1969
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:45,800
If you wanna hear the long version for Mike,

1970
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:49,280
he will improvise an hour about every bit that the red bit.

1971
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:51,120
You just lean back and it blasts red at you.

1972
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:51,960
It blasts red.

1973
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:53,960
Well, I think large infrared lights can get expensive.

1974
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:55,640
But cold plunges, I was gonna say,

1975
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:57,640
I think you make yourself with rubber meat,

1976
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:59,660
but Mike's a tall guy.

1977
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:00,600
So I don't know.

1978
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:02,880
You'd have to get kind of a large rubber meat.

1979
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:04,760
To be a too cold plunge,

1980
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:06,080
it'd have to be a certain temperature.

1981
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:09,120
And you'd have to bring ice in to get it that cold.

1982
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:10,920
But you can do a version of it

1983
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:13,420
if you really wanna fill the bath up

1984
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:15,080
with really cold water.

1985
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:17,120
So you can do versions of it.

1986
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:19,860
Get some rubber made at Target.

1987
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:21,600
And then you walk to the front of the store.

1988
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:22,520
Hey, bags of ice?

1989
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:23,360
Yeah, right there.

1990
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:24,720
Sure.

1991
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:27,760
What I do is, I mean, how do I look this good at 100?

1992
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:31,440
Well, it's switching back and forth.

1993
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:34,120
Cold and hot, cold and hot, cold and hot.

1994
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:39,120
All night, and then I sleep from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.

1995
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:42,320
So I'm actually only up at night,

1996
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:45,080
which is when creativity's better.

1997
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:46,800
It's really when the best ideas come out

1998
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:49,400
because you're in kind of this lucid state.

1999
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:51,740
And I just make my employees also stay up with me

2000
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:53,200
so they can transcribe my ideas.

2001
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:55,840
I microdose DMT and ketamine.

2002
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:58,120
I'm on a carnivore diet.

2003
01:16:58,120 --> 01:16:59,800
I'm listening to this Jordan Peterson book,

2004
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:01,160
this self-help book.

2005
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:02,960
It's really actually opening me up for a lot of things.

2006
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:05,520
Yeah, Cleanser Room, something about lobsters.

2007
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:08,920
I didn't follow it, so I've just been eating a lot of lobster.

2008
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:10,880
Jordan just was responding to Mickey Mouse

2009
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:12,680
Twitter accounts for about a few years,

2010
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:14,520
and then I found he was on my radar.

2011
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:16,880
He'll say like, fuck you, Yoda, and stuff.

2012
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,020
And I was like, who's this guy?

2013
01:17:18,020 --> 01:17:20,280
But he actually has some interesting ideas.

2014
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:21,280
It's actually pretty good.

2015
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:25,480
You know, when I saw Shane Gillis saying the R-word

2016
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:27,920
on SNL, I thought comedy is back.

2017
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:29,720
It's like, it's legal again, folks.

2018
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:30,560
Yeah, finally.

2019
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:31,800
Finally legal.

2020
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:34,040
I knew it coming, because I've been away, you know,

2021
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:36,000
obviously in a hundred years, things come and go.

2022
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,440
So I knew this woke era, you know,

2023
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:39,000
that's gonna be a flash in the pan.

2024
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,040
Just like Fievel, who I had killed.

2025
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:42,280
It's actually, can you cut that part?

2026
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:44,080
I don't really want that going out.

2027
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:48,360
Since, I don't want to forget about that,

2028
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:50,840
since we were talking about inflatable stuff,

2029
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:54,960
can someone tell me what this is that I'm looking at?

2030
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:58,360
That's the strap of an inflatable Mickey watch.

2031
01:17:58,360 --> 01:18:01,680
You're looking at, from your context and angle,

2032
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:03,800
it looks kind of like a Caterpillar,

2033
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,360
but you know, you were looking at a Mickey Mouse

2034
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:07,000
watch strap turned to the side.

2035
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:11,280
Okay, I see that, and it's a very specific,

2036
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:14,040
I thought it was like a bandolier?

2037
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:17,480
Like, I don't know what, I couldn't see.

2038
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:22,480
Like watch straps are usually black, even Mickey watch strap,

2039
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:25,840
I think of it as just a boring black leather watch strap.

2040
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:27,680
Maybe they want it to be bright in the parade.

2041
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:28,520
I suppose.

2042
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:31,040
Yeah, but even though black's part of it,

2043
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:34,080
there's obviously a lot of black in this.

2044
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,680
There's also, in the last one, where he's,

2045
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:38,320
like if you don't think you've seen enough Mickey,

2046
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:41,960
then in the last float, the regular Mickey is up on top.

2047
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:43,240
You don't even know what to make of,

2048
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:45,840
I've been so, my vision's been so contorted now,

2049
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:48,160
I don't know how to look at regular Mickey ever again.

2050
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:52,080
But under him is a little like, you know,

2051
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:56,920
twisting, turning factory of more little Mickey egg

2052
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:58,280
type creatures. Oh yeah, I know.

2053
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:00,600
It's kind of teeter and totter back and forth.

2054
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:02,400
It's almost like, I wonder if it was supposed to be

2055
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:03,760
a reference to Small World.

2056
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:06,760
It's like a bunch of little like Small World Mickey dolls.

2057
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:09,640
Or a reference to aliens.

2058
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:10,720
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2059
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:12,440
Oh, it's like his eggs.

2060
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:13,560
Those are my eggs.

2061
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:15,880
I laid those for the first time.

2062
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:18,200
Please see my eggs.

2063
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,640
We're gonna let Mickey, we're gonna let the fans in.

2064
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:22,120
You guys didn't know that?

2065
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:24,920
I lay eggs with little short patterns.

2066
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:28,280
This final float with all of this Mickey design

2067
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:30,600
and the little eggs and the little,

2068
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:34,400
it almost looks like religious icons.

2069
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:37,320
This whole thing is kind of this like false idol.

2070
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:39,560
It's just like every possible,

2071
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:42,440
let's worship every shape and size of this.

2072
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:46,240
And it's somewhere between bizarre religious ceremony

2073
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:50,040
and then also like something Kim Jong-un would make happen.

2074
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:53,200
He would command that everybody do this

2075
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:55,680
and people would be like pushed out of their homes

2076
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:58,640
with big sticks to go start rehearsing this thing.

2077
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:00,640
Yes, yeah, that's for sure.

2078
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:03,960
Yeah, there's never been more,

2079
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:05,800
Mickey is very celebrated.

2080
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:09,400
There's been Mickey's birthday land, excuse me,

2081
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:11,520
and these different shows, but none of those

2082
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:15,160
are quite as grotesque as this whole package.

2083
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:17,120
I don't know, that's an interesting thing

2084
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:19,200
because I've never thought really on any of that stuff.

2085
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,760
I go, well, Mickey's like the main character,

2086
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:22,560
so obviously he's gonna get parades,

2087
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:25,080
he's gonna get some of his own different lands, whatever,

2088
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:28,320
but like this is maybe too much.

2089
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:30,360
It's too much and I'm like at the end

2090
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:32,600
of watching this parade a few times,

2091
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:37,320
I'm like, what was the meaning of that?

2092
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:39,640
What did that mean?

2093
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:44,040
Then that's where you don't know in your awake state,

2094
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:48,000
but when you're dreaming, that's when you'll figure it out.

2095
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,320
Coming right at the same time,

2096
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:52,120
this is not the only time they've used the phrase

2097
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:56,960
Mickey mania, there was a Super Nintendo and Genesis game

2098
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:01,040
that I remember, I watched a little of the play through

2099
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:05,560
and similarly, I think the first level,

2100
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:10,320
Mickey, modern yellow red, black Mickey runs through

2101
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:15,320
Steamboat Willie, like you run by Willie driving the ship.

2102
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:20,560
Well, also it's not so dissimilar to Epic Mickey as well

2103
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:22,560
because that's sort of a deconstruction

2104
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:24,400
of a lot of different Disney things

2105
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:26,920
and you go through levels that are abstractions

2106
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:29,720
of theme parks and of the shorts and stuff.

2107
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:32,640
You gotta look at pictures of that Mickey mania game

2108
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:34,840
because he looks so mad in them.

2109
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:37,760
It's fun that Mickey, we're describing the brow

2110
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:42,760
is so sharp and angular and he's with a bunch of bats,

2111
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:46,560
he's kicking a sorcerer or something.

2112
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:48,840
Yeah, the sorcerer, I remember it being a real menace.

2113
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:51,680
That was one where I was like, this game is really fun,

2114
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:53,920
the graphics are good, but I definitely stared

2115
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,400
at that box art a lot.

2116
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:57,720
There's another one called, this is a PlayStation one

2117
01:21:57,720 --> 01:22:00,320
called Mickey's Wild Adventure and it's him

2118
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:04,400
looking again really angry, running at you behind him

2119
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:07,680
or a bunch of ghosts and skeletons and hellfire.

2120
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:09,360
Again, bats.

2121
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:13,840
Boy, there's a lot of metal Mickey stuff out there.

2122
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:15,600
Yeah, I mean that original, I guess,

2123
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,520
I don't know if Mickey's face doesn't look angry,

2124
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:19,200
but that original Epic Mickey art,

2125
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:22,000
which looks so creepy and dystopian.

2126
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:26,200
Some of the art still looks pretty scary, but yeah.

2127
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:28,840
Mickey's really been through it in his long career.

2128
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:32,080
He was willing to go dark, he was willing to go psychedelic,

2129
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:35,200
he was willing to invert himself completely,

2130
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,040
show us his eggs.

2131
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:41,200
This is the most revealing personal thing he ever did.

2132
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:44,040
Yeah, I would like to see his eggs again though.

2133
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:45,640
Yeah. In some context.

2134
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:48,000
Bring back Mickey's eggs.

2135
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,880
The next time that there's an announcement

2136
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:51,480
about something, and recently we have been getting

2137
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:53,520
some announcements, we're recording this just as

2138
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:55,400
there was an announcement of we're gonna do this stuff

2139
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:57,480
in Paris, we're gonna change that park

2140
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:59,960
and maybe some futures, hopefully some big stuff

2141
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:02,760
coming this year, but anybody on our team

2142
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:05,760
who listens to The Second Gate, you see some news

2143
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:07,640
that even if it's news that you like,

2144
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:11,640
just respond with bring back Mickey's eggs.

2145
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:15,720
What if Disney started seeing this a decent amount

2146
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:18,240
and the social media person has to go,

2147
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:21,040
what is this, why are we getting this all the time?

2148
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:25,560
I would love to see an event where Mickey lays

2149
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:28,560
one of his eggs, and while he does that,

2150
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:31,800
does like a Connor O'Malley kind of scream,

2151
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:33,280
like an agonizing scream.

2152
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:35,320
Well, cause it hurts to lay eggs.

2153
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:37,560
It hurts, where's that coming out of?

2154
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:42,320
It can't be that, the hole can't be that size all the time.

2155
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:43,160
No, no.

2156
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:46,920
The wider that thing gets, the tougher the effort is.

2157
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:48,440
Of course, it's like a kidney stone,

2158
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:49,720
like you're passing a kidney stone.

2159
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:50,560
Yeah.

2160
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:52,440
I've never had to drink enough water.

2161
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:54,520
Right, and we got, that goes back to our hydration,

2162
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:56,240
that goes back to our urethras.

2163
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:58,760
I drank too much prime energy drink,

2164
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:00,800
and they said I was super dehydrated,

2165
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,760
passed an egg.

2166
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:04,120
I made a deal with Logan Paul

2167
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:05,920
to put prime energy on the castles.

2168
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:07,320
They're all making deals with Logan Paul.

2169
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:11,080
Castle now has a big prime energy logo on the side of it.

2170
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:12,760
That's worth the money though.

2171
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:14,040
We need that extra scratch.

2172
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:18,280
Yeah, we're having hard times here at Disney.

2173
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:21,360
We're worried about the Mufasa movie making box office.

2174
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:24,680
What do we have coming out?

2175
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:27,480
Daisy Ridley plays an accomplished woman swimmer.

2176
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:28,320
Oh, shit.

2177
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:29,480
Oh, there's a Yorg.

2178
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:32,160
There was already a swimming movie at the Oscars,

2179
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:33,200
and no one saw it.

2180
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:34,720
Oh, wait, is that the Yorgos movie,

2181
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:35,800
or is that a different one?

2182
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:36,920
Oh, it's different.

2183
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:39,560
There was standing up, and they'd have the full slate,

2184
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:41,840
and on it was like Mufasa, Toy Story,

2185
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:43,200
and then a Yorgos movie.

2186
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:44,040
That's true.

2187
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:47,960
Yeah, we go, Yorgos is doing Mickey Mania, the movie.

2188
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:49,920
Oh, that would be great.

2189
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:52,040
I'm gonna swear we're winning all the technical Oscars.

2190
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:54,360
He's a weird guy, I love it.

2191
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:58,880
That's Yorgos' house, Yorgos' house now.

2192
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:01,240
That's what I call the studio.

2193
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:02,880
He's doing it all.

2194
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:06,400
Yes, Yorgos' house is about to get funky and fresh.

2195
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:07,840
Yorgos is doing Smee.

2196
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:08,680
The beat of the streets.

2197
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:10,240
The Smee origins, the story.

2198
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:12,840
Yorgos is doing the live action remakes.

2199
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:14,800
Yorgos is giving them MCU.

2200
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:18,160
Oh, Yorgos all the time.

2201
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:21,920
I feel like we did it.

2202
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:23,520
I guess, yeah, I think we did.

2203
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:25,360
Yeah, hey, who was the trippy one?

2204
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:27,640
The Yorgos movie of episodes.

2205
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,240
That's true.

2206
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:31,800
Well, what you said at the beginning about Twisted

2207
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:32,640
was right.

2208
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:33,480
It really was.

2209
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:36,320
Yeah, boy, this was a trip to some weird places,

2210
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:39,160
and I thank the Disney company for putting it on,

2211
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:41,880
for loosening us up, for helping us all be

2212
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:43,600
less big of narfos.

2213
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:44,440
Yeah, thank you.

2214
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:46,840
Yeah, you survived podcast The Ride.

so obviously we're gonna want it,

2222
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:05,800
we're gonna see more urethra talk,

2223
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:09,600
more anticipating when the kidney stones will,

2224
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:13,200
yeah, the boys predict who will get kidney stones first,

2225
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:14,400
and at what age.

2226
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:17,240
Steve Harvey's just health in general

2227
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:19,000
may be the topic for Club 3.

2228
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,280
I think there's two ideas there.

2229
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:22,560
One, the boys talk about Steve Harvey's health,

2230
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:24,320
and how they can apply that to their own lives.

2231
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:27,320
Two, Mike just holds up a laptop or a phone

2232
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:30,360
to the microphone and plays that other thing that he heard,

2233
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:32,160
and we pass that off as our own.

2234
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:33,000
Sure.

2235
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:36,360
That's a scam even I can get behind,

2236
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:39,320
repackaging someone else's podcast for a profit.

2237
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:40,880
I'm listening.
