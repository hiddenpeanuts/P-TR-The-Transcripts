1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
...Dark!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Darkness falls out on the street, Evil rears its head.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Get your crazy shake to go, And your fried donut bread.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The villains threaten this sacred place, This downtown shopping mall.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We must defend the Lego store, And the Splitsville bowling balls.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The Downtown Disney or to you, We must protect our AP discount meals.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The Downtown Disney or to you, With secrets does the Earl of Sandwich conceal.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Boys, boys, my cousin has been taken by evil forces that have inhabited Downtown Disney.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
In order to find them, he will need to thoroughly discuss every aspect of the mall.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Stores, restaurants, both of the Starbucks.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We have 18 daily, very necessary episodes and much to do so.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I will be there to guide you and keep your conversations from getting too off topic or boring.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The Downtown Disney ordeal, Why do we do this to ourselves?

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Welcome to Podcast The Raya, The Downtown Disney ordeal, level five, stage three, final stage.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
My name is Mike Carlson, joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yeah, I'm here.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yes, and Scott Garner also here.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The most relieved man in the world.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
This is it. Yeah.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Made it. What started as 15 became 18.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yes.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Is now zero.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And I'm sure we'll never do something like this again.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
There's no way that's something.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I don't like your tone.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I like the words you're saying, but I don't like the smile with which you're saying it or the way that you're saying it.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
My fiendish grin maybe suggests that we will do this again.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I don't know.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
We got a lot to get to though.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What's the order of bringing in people?

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You know, should it be our guests first? Let's bring our guests in first.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yeah, let's get them in.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You all know him. He's from Doughboys. He's from a lot of other things.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
He's from the very special episodes of Podcast The Ride.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Ladies and gentlemen, Nick Weiger is here.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Hi.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
How are you?

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
How are you doing? You know him from his trademark high.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm the high guy. That's me.

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Get your high guy swag at teespring.com.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's an important note to come in on.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You come in all mumbly and low energy top of a podcast.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The whole thing falls apart.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yeah, for sure.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
No, but yeah, we got we got high guy stickers.

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
We got high guy shirts, sweatshirts, hoodies.

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
We got onesies for your babies.

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
We got it all.

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You got a big ring on like a high school graduation type ring.

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
That's like that must cost like upwards of 500 bucks.

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I spent a lot of money on my high guy ring, but it's great, especially if someone gets up in my face.

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Oh, yeah.

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'd like, you know, pull my fist up to him and then they like they didn't make a move.

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I fucking hit him.

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And then you still that you don't just written.

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Then you still hit fucking hit him with the range and they got a high guy like fucking imprint in their cheekbone.

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Like the Phantom, like the Phantom.

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yeah, much like the Phantom.

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
The high guy is like really violent.

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Well, yeah, I mean, that's kind of my energy is that I come in and I'm trying to be friendly and jovial and convivial.

62
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But if someone comes at me with negative energy, the high guy is going to be the by guy.

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I don't want to end up incurring your your rage.

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But, you know, if you do when you punch the imprint actually says IH more like it's backwards and it's just unreadable.

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So here's what's happening in response to that, because I've found that after a few different

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
may lays, I've gotten in a few different scraps.

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I've noticed that when I've seen, you know, police photos or whatever, I have.

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And so I'm currently financing.

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I've got a down payment on a reversed ring.

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Oh, so that's going to be the next stage of that.

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Then if I if I feel like I'm going to get into fracas, I'll just swap out the ring for the reverse one real quick.

72
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Oh, that's yeah.

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I do a quick slide.

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You've already got the relationship with the ring place for sure.

75
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You're working with the Jostens, right?

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yeah, I'm working with the Jostens people.

77
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Good people, good people.

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
They're great.

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:20,000
People mostly know them for Clash Rings, but they're trying to expand into novelty podcast adjacent rings because they're Jostens is always innovating.

80
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Check them out, Jostens.com.

81
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And if you follow at Jostens and use the hashtag high guy on social media, you'll enter you're entered in a code for a you're in the contest for a possible

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:40,000
$25 discount off of ring of your choice. This is great synergy because Scott doesn't actually know that we just agreed to do a whole series about the Jostens class rings.

83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Oh, wow.

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
This is going to be perfect.

85
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
This has nothing.

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's nothing even tangible to do with theme park.

87
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It does because if it's a high school is within 10 miles of a theme park.

88
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yeah, that falls in the radius.

89
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
That opens up anything.

90
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yeah, of course.

91
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
We can do it.

92
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Exactly.

93
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
We can show her what sewers or her crosswalks.

94
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Well, yeah, the sewer system actually very interesting.

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We touched on a little of the utility that places of this magnitude have to deal with.

96
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
But Florida, once you start factoring in like they run a small area.

97
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
We have confused the bounds where now any object is eligible for a daily series.

98
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Well, we have someone who can tell us if this I mean, like if this sounds like a good thing or if we're staying in bounds, he's here.

99
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You all know.

100
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I don't know.

101
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You you developed a little bit of a bond with him during the course of this.

102
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I think so. I'm the cool uncle.

103
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Help me out.

104
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yeah. But the sector keeper is here.

105
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Boys, boys, you give me strength.

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Hey, hi, Mr. Wiger.

107
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I love it.

108
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I love it.

109
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Man after my heart.

110
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Mr. Wiger, too.

111
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So official like so I'm a high guy.

112
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Are you on like Wiger?

113
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You on like tick tock?

114
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Is that how he's seen you?

115
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yeah, I mean, I'm on tick tock.

116
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm on tick tock and only fans.

117
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So so, you know, check out a high guy on both those platforms.

118
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The only fans content is a little bit, you know, it's for mommy and daddy.

119
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
But I was trying to get Mike to sign up for only fans.

120
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Like, I was trying to get.

121
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,000
But if you want to see that hiring wrapped around a hog, it's a place to go.

122
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Leaving it into an imprint on something different.

123
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
That Twitter, that Twitter joke going around of the cost of streaming services

124
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,000
and then high guy only fans like thirty dollars to watch the high guy jerk off.

125
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
This was supposed to save us money.

126
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So yes, you know him from there where he where he goes by his formal mischief.

127
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Right.

128
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yeah.

129
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Glad to see him.

130
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So stay away, though.

131
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Keep your distance.

132
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Boys, boys, the the final stage, final level.

133
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Amazing. Yeah, yeah.

134
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Final stage of the final daily podcast series.

135
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I don't hold you to that.

136
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Don't don't spring any more levels or stages on us.

137
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
OK, of course. Of course, boys.

138
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
There's a lot to do. Let's just stay focused.

139
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
OK. OK. What's in the stage on what?

140
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yeah. Like what's going on? Tell us. Tell us.

141
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Hurry up and help us out.

142
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Tell us where you need a poll.

143
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You need to take a quick poll. Yeah. Just give me a sec.

144
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Oh, yeah. That's the good stuff.

145
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Nice, nice flavor on that one.

146
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Mm hmm. That's Junior Bacon cheeseburger.

147
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Oh, Wendy's branded jewel.

148
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You got a ration of those now. They were starting to all even mint.

149
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
That's crazy. I didn't know that Wendy's was making their own jewel pod.

150
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Yeah. Wendy's jewel pod.

151
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I figure if my high guy's coming through, I'm flying high from a high guy.

152
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I love it. I love it. Junior Junior Cheeseburger Mint.

153
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yeah, it's flavored after the size, too.

154
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Wow. Wait, did you say there's mint? Yeah.

155
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Also, they have to make they for a while they had to make every flavor mint to get away with it.

156
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
But now even mints, they're like eyeing to outlaw.

157
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So ration. Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. You'll only be able to get tobacco flavor.

158
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's a good and isn't jewel having a lot of financial trouble currently?

159
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I think so. Like, yeah, I listen to a I forget if it was the DailyPodcap.

160
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
But yeah, there's like a lot of I don't know.

161
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
They might not be around for that much longer, dude. Fallen Brothers.

162
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
They could be Fallen Brother.

163
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So does that imply that we have to do a podcast series about all of the former flavors of jewel that are no longer available for purchase?

164
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
If they're within a 10 mile of any theme park. I see.

165
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I have one more thing before you read that I'm glad we were men.

166
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
We talked about your jewel use a little bit.

167
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:02,000
There was a comment on Reddit that I just I thought Baird mentioning on the show.

168
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
A Paul G on our Reddit said Sector Keeper loves sucking on jewels.

169
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Bugsy loves sucking on jewels. What does it mean?

170
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Oh, Hugsy Brother. Yes.

171
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
That's right. It clearly runs in the family.

172
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
The love of sucking on something pronounced jewel, but it can be spelled differently.

173
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Right. Because we did find out we've we've been talking about your cousins a lot.

174
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,000
But of course, your brother is Bugsy slash Hugsy, the 40s gangster who bothers us sometimes.

175
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You guys get having back. I don't know about that.

176
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I don't know. I think I liked Bugsy more than Hugsy is good version at the end.

177
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm the most scared of having a G on.

178
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Can I ask you, Sector Keeper, are you and Hugsy excited about the upcoming movie Richard Jewel?

179
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Oh, there's a bomb and Centennial.

180
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Yeah, yeah, there was. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

181
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
He has to keep that's that's the trailer line.

182
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
They make him say that he makes him sit down and makes him say, yeah, I want to see that.

183
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And I want to see Good Boys double feature.

184
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Oh, that's right. Oh, yeah. We promised you a movie, but we can't get you to the movie until we've completed this entire thing.

185
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So yeah, I don't boys still in theaters. I was going to say, I think we know it's not a dollar theater in Pasadena.

186
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Maybe the idea, I think, was that we were going if successful, we're going to go into the vacant AMC theater at downtown Disney.

187
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
We have to sneak in with the projector. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

188
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:38,000
With my projector and screen from home and like in the empty shell of a movie theater, we will watch a DVD or a stream of Good Boys.

189
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Right. And then a bootleg, the Richard Jewel. Yeah.

190
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And that will be in theaters, but we won't be able to get a print. Can I pitch a Funny or Die video? Oh, of course.

191
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Always. I think if you like you were talking about it.

192
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Oh, wow. Sector Cuber is a big fan of Funny or Die. Yeah, I always click funny.

193
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
That's good, because, you know, if our video is getting the crypt, our pay would be docked.

194
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So we want those funny votes. Yeah, cut your rates significantly.

195
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Yes. What's left to cut? But, you know, we're talking about it being the Jewel homophones.

196
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
If you did, you could do Richard Jewel, G-U-U-L.

197
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Like if you did like a Richard Jewel trailer and it was about him, maybe the Jewel company getting in trouble.

198
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Or blow it like there's a bomb that is caused by a bunch of Jewels all being set off at the same time. Yeah.

199
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
They could also do a video. They could do something with Jewel, the singer Jewel.

200
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
She made a couple. I made a video with her at Funny or Die. She's a Funny or Die All-Star Jewel.

201
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Yeah, she's down to clown. And the Funny or Die All-Star means that you can get them in a branded video for a $200.

202
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:54,000
$200,000. So, right. So like a UCB actor is free.

203
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And yes, it's $200,000. No pay.

204
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Jewel would get $200,000. Yes. Sounds fair.

205
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
We saw it leaked Funny or Die memo.

206
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I mean, they earned it. Their start. Yeah. Jewel and Alfonso Ribeiro are our superiors.

207
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So they deserve it. OK, so that all we have. We've got some great video ideas.

208
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Before we can make any of it, before we can watch Good Boys with you, what do we have to learn about?

209
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Oh, boys, boys, today you have to learn about and discuss Pixar Pals parking structure, Magic Way pedestrian bridge in downtown Disney surface lots.

210
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Wow. Surface lots. So we're back. We're back with another parking structure episode.

211
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm thrilled. Yeah. Yeah. Here you are. Continuing the series. Yeah. It's too bad.

212
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Like you're an interesting guy with a lot of opinions. People on your podcast look forward to having a lot of things you have to say.

213
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I think people. Well, I don't know. I think it'd be interesting to talk to you about rides and stuff.

214
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And it's just too bad that we're not allowed to hear what you think about any ride. They'll never happen.

215
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Yeah. I mean, I think I'm OK with it, though, because for me, a big part of the theme park experience is you want a smooth arrival and a not too stressful departure.

216
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Right. Good night. Yeah. You want to kiss. Good night. Exactly. And so it's that's part of the magic.

217
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:31,000
If it's just stress, like, you know, you go to a ball game or something or that that has like like a terrible parking situation and it's just like 40 minutes to get out of there.

218
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:39,000
No matter how much fun you had, it's just like it's exhausting at the end of the night and you're pissed off. You come out there with angry energy.

219
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:47,000
So, yeah, I think it's to me, it's an important part of the theme park experience. Yeah, yeah, sure.

220
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I had an unpleasant I talked about this on the show not long ago, but I had a rare unpleasant experience leaving Disney where traffic was back all the way up through the Mickey and Friends Parking Structure.

221
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And that is because somebody died on the freeway one exit north. Oh, my God. It didn't even shut down the entire freeway.

222
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:10,000
All it did was specifically fuck Disneyland because 10,000 people were leaving from that one point, like one exit down.

223
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
So that was that was pretty hellish. I'm not sure who to be mad at.

224
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Probably. I mean, maybe the Jewel Corporation. I think he probably died from inhaling too much. Yeah. From too much fuel consumption.

225
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Certainly. But now I guess I can't complain about that one because I ended up then just drinking alone in the empty Grand Californian lobby at 1 a.m. So it worked out for me.

226
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:43,000
But you're seeing that parking structure just full of the brim with cars was terrible. Disheartening. For sure. Yeah.

227
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,000
And you're absolutely right. And by adding this new parking structure, which they have recent like a lot of people on Twitter,

228
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I think you've probably gotten a lot of people tweeting at you about the progress of this structure.

229
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And I'm sure you appreciate that. And finally, it's here. Honestly, frankly, I've been getting hammered in my mentions since it was announced because I don't know if you guys recall this, but I very much recall it.

230
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:12,000
That when I appeared on the podcast initially to review the Mickey and Friends Parking Structure, I threw out one of my trademark Weiger locks.

231
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:21,000
My guarantee was when they made a new parking structure, they were going to rename it the Avengers lot and each level was going to be a different Avenger.

232
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Unfortunately, that did not come true. They went with a Pixar pals theming. Yes. We were defeated by the power of friendship. Yeah.

233
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:37,000
So friendship, the theme between the two massive garages, pals and friends. Yeah. So it didn't. That didn't work out for me, unfortunately.

234
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I mean, you would say that I would argue that the Avengers are maybe the ultimate group of friends. Yeah. But you know, whatever.

235
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Well, they survived a lot. Yeah. So many more of them than there used to be. Yeah.

236
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Mm hmm. I mean, they're going to make another giant parking structure eventually. It might go in the place they were initially going to do it, which is behind Harbor.

237
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,000
So do you want to make a prediction for next time they make a big parking structure? Right.

238
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:11,000
So I would say I'm going to say I'm going to stay away from Avengers because I think they don't want to lock themselves to a Marvel property. And I'm also going to stay away from Star Wars because I think that's maybe a little too obvious.

239
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm going to say this is a little bit of a curve ball, but I think they're going to take Mickey and friends, Pixar pals. And the next step, the the DreamWorks dudes.

240
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:32,000
They're going to license the character. They're going to like the dream or this use the DreamWorks characters for the parking structure exclusively.

241
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You're a donkey. Minions. Yeah. Well, no minions is illumination. Yeah. That's different from dream. Yeah, that's universal. They don't. Oh, they. OK.

242
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Universal. Yeah. Oh, but no, DreamWorks is like your I mean, it's like Shrek. And Dragon. Yeah. I think how to turn your dragon. I think Epic is under that umbrella.

243
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:07,000
No, well, I mean, it's now Epic is actually Fox. OK. Epic is Fox. OK. So Disney, I believe owns Epic now. OK. I'm going to change my prediction because this is I'm realizing the DreamWorks properties I had crossed my head.

244
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm going to say they're going to make it the Fox and Friends lot. So we call it Shep Smith. Shep Smith will be there. He's gone. He's gone. He's gone. He's gone.

245
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Sorry. There'll be a Hannity level. They're going to have to change these names out frequently because he collects it so often. Brian Kilmeade. Brian Kilmeade will be on there.

246
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:40,000
The guy who they're like, this is our funny guy. Yes. Does this awful correspondent Greg Gutfeld. No, no. The other funny guy. Oh, you're talking about. Yeah. The guy who reads text from his mom, his liberal mom on the show.

247
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
There's a calling him a disgrace.

248
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:59,000
There'll be a Kennedy level. She's a prominent personality. Oh, that's right. Yeah. Dennis Miller. Is he on enough? I think he's in the family. Yeah. There might be like some just, you know, in the same way that the Luxo ball is used in the Pixar.

249
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Oh, yeah. Dennis Miller might just be kind of be the face of the lot. A big revolving fountain of Dennis Miller's face. Right.

250
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Okay. That's a that is a little bit left to center pick. I mean, a right of center pick actually. Right. You know. Okay. Well, that's a lot. Is that a lock? Are you giving that the wider lock? Okay. Great. We'll see. We'll see.

251
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Twenty twenty two. Yeah. Never. I don't know when they're going to get it together.

252
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Can I can I ask a legit question? Where would they build it? Do you have any any sense of the acreage that's reserved for another structure? Well, they were building. They're still building something behind Harbor. They were going to build this whole thing behind Harbor Boulevard.

253
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And it was going to be like they weren't going to do Pixar pals there. I just flew a bunch of dog hair because I was petting Edwin.

254
00:18:46,000 --> 00:19:02,000
They bought a bunch of industrial park kind of properties and they're demolishing it, but it requires create like you creating this weird path between hotels. There was going to be a pedestrian bridge over Harbor Harbor that was essentially going to show the businesses on Harbor, which is what the city was upset about. Right.

255
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:12,000
And instead of just saying, well, we'll leave a little space for them to walk down to go to the business on Harbor, Disney said, fuck no, we will not let the businesses on Harbor be patronized.

256
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:23,000
So they moved, which is why clearly this is why it's out of bounds. Disney does not want anything to do with the harbor businesses. And it's why it has to be a separate harbor hoedown.

257
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:31,000
And that can't couldn't have been part of the downtown Disney. Now you're getting it. Yes. Now I'm going to propose another idea, which is never doing the harbor.

258
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Huh? Okay. But when people want to know what you think about Captain Kids buffet restaurant in Orange County. Wow. Captain kids favorite. Do you know about restaurant ratings though? They might be in a C or a D restaurants get ratings like you do.

259
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It's at school. I forget if you ever went to school, but fake it's homework. Sort of. It's close that it's hard. Sorry to explain. Not quite, but yeah, kind of.

260
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Yeah, we'll get that. We'll explain it off Mike. I think. Okay.

261
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Is Captain Kid, is it a franchise? Are there more than one? I don't know. I feel like I've only seen that one ever. And Captain Kid is a pirate. I guess. Yes. Yeah. Is he a little kid pirate or is he an adult?

262
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:44,000
The more questions you ask, the more it's becoming likely that we have to do this. The boundaries are the metal detectors. Yes. Star Wars, Galaxy's Edge, Honda Odyssey. I have been clicking with the sector keeper this entire time. Thank you, SK.

263
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:54,000
All right. Well, I'd like to go ahead and say let's start with the surface lots. Let's go in reverse order and build to the grand Pixar pals parking structure. Okay, fair enough.

264
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I'm looking forward to. Okay, so the surface lots. Now these are important because this is where you, if you're just going to downtown Disney, this is really where they want you to park.

265
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:18,000
The entrance is off of Magical Way. The lots. Magic Way. Sorry, Magic Way. Magic Way. Well, it is. I mean, it's magical. Sure. It is magic. Yes. Magic Way is the official road.

266
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:31,000
So they are the stitch lot. That's after you go past the guard booths. You make a left. That is on Google Maps labeled the stitch lot and their stitch lot signs.

267
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Sure. And now what would that character sound like if he said Ohana means family? Ohana means family.

268
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Okay, just checking in. Now to the right of the guard booths when you're going in is the limo lot. Unfortunately, we don't know what she sounds like. I'm not going to make you do that.

269
00:21:51,000 --> 00:22:01,000
No. So this is where you're probably going to end up if it's not busy. And this is where they were going to build the first when they were going to build the luxury hotel.

270
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:18,000
The smaller version was going to get built on top of the stitch lot. Now, if it's crowded, you get sent down the road past the Paradise Pier Hotel, past the Disneyland Hotel, and you end up like in overflow lots, which when we went to Ralph Brennan's, that's where we got put.

271
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Yes. And we were driving down with our guest Jason Walliner. And when we saw the sign saying, Oh, we're gonna have to go to the further lot, you in the back of the car were like, Oh, this will give us something to talk about. Yes. And I was like, will it?

272
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I've parked here before. And I actually think it's pretty convenient. You just come out right by the Disneyland Hotel by like the Rose Garden.

273
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Now, or they maybe forget about validation and you're just waving everybody through. That's happened. Yeah. Oh, that's nice. Yeah. Don't you know, don't count on. Yeah, because I left after Ralph Brennan and I when they first put the ticket in, it said forty six dollars, but it was validated.

274
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Luckily, so it became zero. These are lying. Your heart really jumps in that moment. Yes, really scared. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Forty six dollars. That's like allowance for 10 years.

275
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:17,000
There's been a lot of inflation, though, since you were since you got locked in your state in the 90s.

276
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:31,000
And I go as far. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know what? I know it's he's still at large. You know, we have to kind of dealt with Mr. Wager. Be careful. Your evil spirits are in play.

277
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Well, you know, if he comes at me, the high guys got him covered. Oh, yeah. I forgot about. Yeah. I'm so glad we have we have your own inventory. I know you brought your own weapon.

278
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Smartest guest we've had the overflow lots are the Zazu lot and the Simba lot.

279
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And they all kind of blend together. Why does Zazu have a lot? It's a great question. Yeah. Organized and about rules.

280
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
But Simba. And epic takedowns of Donald Trump.

281
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:08,000
The new Zazu is not old Rowan Atkinson. He didn't care. He couldn't have foreseen the rise. Yeah.

282
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I will say that just I think Natalie's parking my wife, my wife, Natalie, who came with me on our most recent trip and has come with me for most of my adult Disneyland adventures.

283
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:30,000
She was convinced that the entirety of the downtown Disney parking structure was the Simba lot like structure rather the surface lot.

284
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:39,000
She thought the whole surface lot was the Simba lot. And I think that it was because she we park there in the Simba lot one time and she just got that stuck in her brain.

285
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:54,000
But it is it is like kind of confusingly portioned out. It does get confusing because sort of gated like hotel parking around here, too, for all for most of the hotels, except the Disneyland one.

286
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:04,000
You went so you went down. Did you do a Disneyland trip or did you just go down and park and leave what for this episode? Yes. We parked and left.

287
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Really? God bless. Yeah. Well, I mean, I had an experience of the Pixar Pals parking structure and I feel like I needed to get some firsthand experience.

288
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:21,000
So, yeah, we parked and left the downtown Disney service lot. I couldn't justify reparking there for that because I've had that experience before I parked there before.

289
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
So I'm familiar with it. Yeah. Yeah. And and it's been a little while since I parked in the down.

290
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
No, actually, I because I park for for doughboys, my chain restaurant podcast.

291
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
We went to the ESPN zone shortly before it closed for good. Oh, you made it in there.

292
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
We made it in there. And that was the last time I parked in the downtown Disney surface lot.

293
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:47,000
And it's fine. I just I feel like it's very bare bones, like very exciting about that lot, that that lot.

294
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
That's why we only have to do like 35 minutes. Yeah, we can limit our time.

295
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
It's like parking at a suburban Best Buy. It's like nothing. It's, you know, like a like a courtyard Marriott.

296
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
It's like a normal parking structure.

297
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And you've eliminated a lot of the weird like the free hours and the ways you could kind of gamify being able to park at the park, go to the parks and park there for free.

298
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:15,000
So I have no interest in going in that like they they they cut off all of the free or cheap options, essentially.

299
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
So it gets very complicated with validations and stuff like you cannot.

300
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:28,000
If you go to a restaurant, one of the hotels you want to park at the hotel and the table service restaurants for that hotel will validate there.

301
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:37,000
They will not validate for downtown Disney. If you want to get validated for downtown Disney, you need to spend twenty dollars at a store or a quick service restaurant.

302
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:43,000
And that will get you three hours. If you go to a table service restaurant, they'll validate for five hours.

303
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,000
And this is kind of how they're preventing hacks, hacking the system to get free parking.

304
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
And Carly Wiseau gave us a very good tip. Of course, I am conflicted about it.

305
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
It's the Starbucks twenty dollar gift card loading.

306
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And I would like to declare officially that has been a very mentioned thing during this ordeal on social media.

307
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:16,000
People in lockstep agreement with me about this being an injustice, having to do with apps and making you load 10, 15, 20 dollars instead of just letting you pay the amount you're paying on an app.

308
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
For sure. Very annoying. People agree with me. I have won this.

309
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:29,000
You're right, because they want to take the float. They want to basically be a bank and be taking the float on all that extra money that they have deposited in their accounts.

310
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Three dollars and two cents. I have declared victory. I have declared victory.

311
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Let me parse out a different issue here. I think you can take victory on that.

312
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I think what I'm against less like, hey, if they offered customizable reloads, I'd be in support of that.

313
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I think what I'm more against is you being upset about a different thing related to apps and math because you already have like a hundred of them in your brain at all times.

314
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
So to find a new one, well, that's just my brain.

315
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:05,000
But it's these companies wanting to minimize the number of credit card transactions because they get hit 20 cents or so a transaction.

316
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I don't give a shit about lightning the load for like Target or Dunkin Donuts or something.

317
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Yeah, target. Hey, that's don't speak ill of CEO Target Brian Cornell.

318
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Well, he's the man with the target plan.

319
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
But I mean, it's the same thing as then like, do you want to round up and give some of the money to charity?

320
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
And it's like, no, don't do that. Just give the money to charity yourself.

321
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,000
They are getting the tax write off from that charity like, oh, you think I shouldn't do that?

322
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I do that a lot. I mean, just just do it yourself.

323
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Some real signaling there, wasn't it? No, I guess it was.

324
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,000
But I'm saying, is it a bad thing to do that? Well, it's the I mean, the money does go to charity.

325
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
But then like Target gets the tax that I see that going to charity is bad.

326
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Yeah, I yeah, it's not like bad because bad, but it's it's your they're taking advantage of your goodwill as a consumer.

327
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I honestly didn't think about this. Yeah, it's a similar sort of thing.

328
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
It's like, you know, I do it so often. I don't think about it.

329
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,000
It's like because I'm just and honestly, sometimes they'll be like upset because I try to get like they'll be like, sir, you can't give like an extra.

330
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
So that's more than your order. Yeah, I'll give like a 20 and I'll say just put this in it.

331
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
And they're like, you can't do that. Right. A check for a thousand dollars. Don't say it's very generous.

332
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:26,000
So interesting. Yeah, I also I know and Carlson, I know you do get a lot of like points for like airlines and hotels

333
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
and you're always using programs to donate those to veterans so they can go home for the holidays.

334
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Yeah, I know that that's like very nice of you. But you like that's not your responsibility.

335
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Well, it's just the thing that makes me feel good. Right.

336
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:45,000
But you're spending a lot of money that you don't need to spend to get more miles to send veterans home for the holidays.

337
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I've been I also been driving veterans home. Yeah.

338
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Well, that's the other thing, because, you know, you bought that that escalate and so you can transport more more veterans personally.

339
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I think it's starting to affect you poorly. I mean, you said, can you bring over one of your old barrels and straps?

340
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Because like I asked you if you asked to borrow one of my old barrels because you were like my clothes are threadbare

341
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:18,000
and I've given most of them to veterans organizations. You've got 10 or so. So you have one. Yeah. Yeah.

342
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Here's the thing that there's a size difference between you and Sheridan that means that the barrel that you're borrowing from him is not leaving a lot to the imagination.

343
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,000
You're Donald Ducking it pretty hardcore. Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of like it's the barrel to kind of a halter top.

344
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Yeah. It's just like a shirt. You still need pants. Yeah. You need separate barrel pants.

345
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,000
It's like a baby Huey barrel shirt. It's one thing if you're a duck, but you're a man.

346
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I had to hide the Casamigos beefy tee t-shirt from our from our inventory.

347
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
You know, you were going to give it away. Oh, well, yeah. I want to charity.

348
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Is that something in our inventory? Yeah. Randy Gerber's company with George Clooney, the premium tequila Casamigos tequila.

349
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I would have tried to stuff it inside one of those red buckets outside of a store when someone's ringing the bell. Yeah. Yeah.

350
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:17,000
You got to just stop stuffing your possessions in those like this.

351
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Don't go like you. I saw you trying to put a PlayStation 4 into the Salvation Army bucket.

352
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
The Salad, the guy ringing the bell was trying to stop you. Was he? I thought he was like trying to help.

353
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,000
No. Yeah. Taking my arm and he was pushing it in toward. I thought I didn't think he was actually pulling it out.

354
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Helpful. Honestly, I think he was restraining you and saying, you don't need to do this. Huh?

355
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Yeah. That's weird because I heard go good. You're doing the right thing. You hear the word away after go.

356
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Oh, and you didn't just do that once. You took me around town. You said, keep the car running.

357
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:00,000
You distributed like a hundred PlayStation 4s. Tell those veterans, go to the bathroom later.

358
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:07,000
We got 20 more Playstations to give away. Yeah, look, I'll think about this now.

359
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:13,000
You've aggravated the people at the parking at Disneyland, too, because you were just like, everyone go ahead of me.

360
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,000
You keep saying, go ahead of me. And the parking attendants are like, no, sir, please just go and find a spot.

361
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:26,000
You don't need to let everyone. You are being polite. Yeah, but it's dozens and dozens and dozens.

362
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,000
But Jason's so frugal. That's expensive. Time is money to Jason.

363
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:43,000
And the face is crunching up. You know, you love to see it.

364
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:53,000
You love to see the bit about Mike being maniac, ending with Jason getting dumped on the prestige.

365
00:32:53,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Oh, great. Great. We done with the surface lots? Oh, I don't know.

366
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I will say I don't like that. It's the right like I like an angled park.

367
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I don't like having to pull in at a full 90 degree up the perpendicular lines.

368
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
It's a tougher turn. It's tougher to back out. I just I don't love it. Sure.

369
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Yeah, that place gets credit and it's a it's a parking lot next to a magical place.

370
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,000
So it should be more magical like the the magical perpendicular parking of Pixar pals. Right. Yeah.

371
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Yeah. Give me that angle. What were you going to say?

372
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I was going to say like it's all of this. It's outgrown the resort for sure.

373
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Like it has said it is or that classic podcast race for sure.

374
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Enthusiastic for sure. You guys are going to become the for sure.

375
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Boys. Oh, boy. I can only dream rings needed on Tick Tock.

376
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Will you like pop up in this for sure?

377
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,000
It's way more popular than this. I learned from the master.

378
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Nick over here was my sketch one on one teacher.

379
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Well, I heard that was a bit you guys thought of then.

380
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Yeah, this is the thing is that part of being a sketch teacher is that you also you learn a lot from your students

381
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
and Sheridan brought that for sure thing to the table.

382
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
And I was like, this is I was like, I encourage you to like run with that.

383
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Like that's your thing. You know, it's like Jeff Ross is like the roastmaster.

384
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
And for years he like didn't want to be the roastmaster general and eventually embraced it.

385
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Like you got to run with your hook and you're sure is what you're we're all about.

386
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
But you guys needed to wait for the like the right medium.

387
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
You needed to wait for for technology to catch up, which is why Tick Tock is perfect.

388
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,000
And then you know, yes, yeah, for sure. For sure.

389
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
That was a little not. Yeah, you got to stagger.

390
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
You don't want you don't want people people to get comfortable.

391
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:58,000
The other thing we learned in sketch classes that by class to half the class drops out because they realize there's a lot of homework.

392
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Yeah, maybe you're an adult with a job and you don't feel like having to spend a couple hours of your week writing a sketch.

393
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
For something that you paid for. That's not like a fun way.

394
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Crazy. No. Yeah. Yeah. They need to build parking structures for the end.

395
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
These lots, honestly. Yeah. Right. I don't know if that's even in the plan.

396
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I don't think we've heard anything. We haven't heard any on the rumor mill.

397
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Anything about that. But I feel like it's it's got to come soon.

398
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
But like they want people coming to these places like Friday and Saturday nights on the weekends.

399
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,000
And it does suck when it's like you're getting routed all over. Yes, it's confusing and hard just to get like

400
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
a burger. It is. What are you going to?

401
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:44,000
But like how logistically it feels like closing that surface lot for enough time to build a structure seems like that seems

402
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
untenable. Yeah. Are you going to do that? I guess you'd have to do it in sections.

403
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Well, it's kind of what they did to build Pixar Palace. I think like was was that previously a surface lot that was for employees

404
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,000
a lot that got it. Yeah, I believe it's employees and tram parking and stuff.

405
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
OK. Yeah. So I eventually these are all going vertical maybe.

406
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
And the and the Disney employees will be pushed further and further away.

407
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Yes. I think some of them park currently at Angel Stadium. Wow.

408
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
It'll be like that'll become like the park at the Ontario Raceway.

409
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,000
It's like the Simpson episode where I think we've made this joke before or someone has the Homer rollerblades to work,

410
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
but he's parked right behind his own house. Yeah.

411
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:32,000
The power plant. Yeah, it'll. Yeah, it's I wonder if like once they build another giant parking structure,

412
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:39,000
maybe they could actually offer similar incentives for Pixar pals or making friends because now we'll talk about the walkway.

413
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:45,000
That makes it a lot more convenient, honestly. It used to feel like much more of a hike.

414
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:52,000
But this is really what allows us to talk about Pixar pals because it would have maybe been outside the bounds.

415
00:36:52,000 --> 00:37:00,000
But with the addition of the downtown Disney pedestrian bridge, that now brings it that that literally connects it so that we're able to use it as a topic.

416
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,000
So thank God. Can I hear the official name of the walkway again? Jason.

417
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
You know, they just call it the pedestrian bridge.

418
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,000
But a lot of blogs are saying the Magic Way pedestrian bridge because that's what it crosses over.

419
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,000
But I've seen it as a downtown Disney pedestrian bridge. Yes. And other people calling it the downtown Disney pedestrian bridge.

420
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
We need an official word on this. It's not just the bridge, though.

421
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
That's is that that the only new part because it feels like the walkway is new as well.

422
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Definitely. Yeah, they manicured it and and added a lot of lights and planting and stuff.

423
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I like that bridge a lot. I love it. The bridge is fantastic.

424
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Yeah, it was just I was like I texted Carlson that like while I was on it like this owns. It's very, very good.

425
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I will say that Natalie was a little disappointed because she was expecting like the Golden Hand Bridge hands bridge in Vietnam.

426
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Have you seen that? That it's this amazing structure where like two hands are holding up this this bridge.

427
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
She expected something that was like really grand and maybe thematically, you know, tied to Disney.

428
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:07,000
And it's not really that it's kind of a functional sort of thing. You might see it at a corporate campus, but it gets the job done.

429
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:14,000
And it's it's great. What I was feeling was and we got there in the late afternoon and you know, again, we we parked.

430
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,000
We took the pedestrian bridge to security. We turned around and then we left.

431
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:29,000
But I will say that the it must be great for families, for kids to get energy out on that pedestrian bridge instead of being like on the tram.

432
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
And they're just like they've got all this energy. They're like just like ready to go.

433
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:41,000
And then when they are unleashed in the park, they're just animals, you know, it must be nice that your young kid can kind of like run out a little bit of that before you get into the park proper.

434
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Sure, sure. Get them sleepy a little bit. Yeah. Did Natalie need a lot of selling on doing this? Oh, she was furious.

435
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:55,000
No, yes. Relationship is free. Yeah, she ruined her Saturday. I will say that we.

436
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:02,000
The way I could hold her into coming along with me is that she we went to a restaurant that she really likes afterwards.

437
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:08,000
It's an orange county. So shout out to a God bistro. If anyone likes Vietnamese food, check it out.

438
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I thought you were going to say Captain Kids Buffet. Well, so here's the thing. Captain Kids Buffet.

439
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
There was just a huge line. So we went there. That was our first choice.

440
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:26,000
And then we went to God Bistro as our backup. We hit we tried to go to Mimi's on Harbor Boulevard second. Also, like a 90 minute wait there.

441
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:34,000
So then we went to God Bistro. Yeah. And all people like dressed to the nines to fancy suit like real Hollywood agent types waiting to get in.

442
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Yeah, I think there's a lot of big shots who are in the theme park industry who dine it.

443
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
You know, they have power lunches at at the Mimi's. So yeah, they have their booth.

444
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
You're beating with that crowd. Sure, sure. It's tough.

445
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I do want to say I was incorrect. The Pumba lot is on the other side of the property.

446
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,000
The lot that closed to build Pixar pals. I'm still trying to get confirmation.

447
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I think I just got my peas mixed up and it's the Pinocchio lot that closed. I think that is correct.

448
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Yes, of course, of course. No wonder. That correction gives me strength.

449
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:15,000
You look scared ever since Pumba was said you were sort of like keeling over. I thought maybe you were going to die.

450
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Thank you. Anytime there's a time lapse between a factual error and a correction on a podcast,

451
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I just think of the listener who is just thinking about that for the entire duration.

452
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Like the 12 minutes are passing and that's all they're thinking about is the Pumba lot was I am just praying to my God.

453
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:43,000
No one drove off the road out in fury. That incorrect inverting to character names,

454
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:49,000
two beloved characters who needs to start with peas. Their parents asking the police.

455
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:55,000
So what happened? But also that's poor show on Disney's part because the Pumba lot being on the other side of the property.

456
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
You're going to blame Disney for your mistake? Simba and Zazu lot. Yeah, why not? Poor show.

457
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Poor show. Yeah, that is confusing. You're right. Speaking of poor show,

458
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I kind of had that feeling with regards to the the aesthetics of the pedestrian bridge and particularly the walkway in that it just feels so generic.

459
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Like and my guess is that that was a that was intentional.

460
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I think that they were looking at it and were like, we don't want this to be a thing where we need we need there to be a flow of pedestrian traffic.

461
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,000
We don't want people to be stopping for photo ops. But there really isn't just any sort of hint of Disney at all.

462
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:41,000
It's just, you know, it's nice greenery, but it just feels like a like a nicely manicured sidewalk in a in a planned community.

463
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Yeah. Yeah, it's it's boring. Yeah, it runs parallel to the monorail track at one point.

464
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
But if you don't hit it at the right time, it's just an empty track.

465
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Yeah, that's there's there was no real exciting monorail encounter when we were walking it.

466
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
What would you say? I mean, I don't want to get to I guess we could do plus ups as we go.

467
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Do you have a plus up idea off the top of your head?

468
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I think if just a little bit of, you know, maybe even just like a like a light effect that's just like a silhouette of like Donald or something on the walkway, you know, just just like a little bit of a shadowy, you know, Mickey ears or something like that.

469
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I don't know, just something that feels kind of Disney.

470
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I guess like probably a standee would be too like the Apollo 13 standee at Universal Studios.

471
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Yeah, that might be too much.

472
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
But I mean, I think there's some subtle Disney effication you could do of it.

473
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:42,000
There's one thing there is one thing there is a little like metal plate in the ground on the bridge that says no dumping to ocean.

474
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:55,000
And it is a kind of abstract representation of flounder. Okay. Right. So look for anybody taking this bridge. Look for that that little Easter egg. There is one character and it's a very tiny flounder.

475
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:06,000
But I think those are I don't know that that's exclusive to that bridge. I feel like there's more of those throughout the resort. Not a bridge exclusive. Not a bridge exclusive. Also not a Pixar character.

476
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Oh, I see. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. It should be a good point. Yeah. So it should be I guess because it's connected to Pixar pals. It should probably be a Pixar. Should be Nemo. Yeah.

477
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Yeah. Or there should be more. Now, did you let me ask you this. Did you go to tram loading? No, we did not go to tram loading.

478
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Okay. I mean, took the took the escalator down to where that would be just to sort of get that escalator ride experience.

479
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I'm not sure I'm just going to skip ahead to Pixar pals. But no, no, no, it's fine.

480
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I think we're amblin over there. How did you get into the garage? Did you enter on Magic Way? Like it has its own entrance. We entered on Magic Way. Yeah. Yeah, we went.

481
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I did the Maps app in the car straight for the the parking structure. So I just followed in. Oh, you can do that. You can enter it separately. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's not always open, though.

482
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:03,000
So I think it's open. It depends. I honestly they don't have hours posted. I tried to go in last time, not open. I had to enter through Mickey and friends.

483
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:14,000
But it looks like that's a much better way to enter. Yeah, it was pretty convenient. I mean, again, we went it off hours, but on a weekend and it was pretty it was pretty easy to get in there.

484
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I will say that we so so here's a little bit of a of a of a specific to the vehicle we just acquired. We got a Chevy Bolt, which is a an EV.

485
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:33,000
And so Natalie had the idea of like, hey, let's see if they have EV charging. We didn't need a charge, but just to sort of see what they had.

486
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:48,000
And so we went up there. The the cast member working in the parking structure entrance was very, very helpful. And we we asked, like, hey, is there EV charging? And he was like, yes, it's on the third level, but there's no guarantee that there will be available.

487
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:55,000
And so but so here's what happens. Have you have you guys parked an EV there before? Yes. My guess. Yeah. So you get the little blue. I took a picture of it.

488
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:05,000
And in case you need for your social media, but you get like a little blue thing they put on your windshield. And that tells another cast member later on to guide you specifically to the EV level. Right.

489
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:18,000
And so unfortunately, this is a thing I've learned in my short time owning an EV. One complication is, yeah, you don't have to get gas, but you do have to deal with Tesla assholes at fucking charging stations.

490
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:32,000
And that's a big thing, especially if they're in short supply and they're like it was basically all Teslas like all of them. And so there wasn't a free one. But we also had another and I'm sorry for monologuing a little bit here, but we had a we had a little encounter with a Tesla asshole.

491
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:49,000
So we went up to we're going through they wind through the cones are a little confusing. Level three was blocked off. So the guy had to like move cones to guide us over there. But he saw our blue tag like a little late and was like and so we stopped and he was telling us to back up. But this Tesla SUV was like parked right behind us.

492
00:45:49,000 --> 00:46:02,000
And so we turned on our, you know, our reverse lights. The guy would not budge and he was just like sitting there and we were like trying to gesture at him and he was just like, you know, kind of give him one of those. I'm just give the expression I'm making is like is like, what are you going to do?

493
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:13,000
You know, he's getting one though. You kind of the cast member came over and was like was like, sir, can you please back up? And the guy was still not budging. And he was like, sir, I'm just asking you to back up a little bit so they can get up to the third level.

494
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:25,000
And it was like a whole ordeal. And eventually he like kind of like got pissed off way agreed to back up like as little as possible. And then we we zoomed up there and the cast member came up to us and we were like, thank you.

495
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:31,000
So we said it nicely. We're like, thank you. Thank you so much. And the guy, the cast member goes, that guy was an asshole.

496
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Whoa, the Disney cast members. Bad words. Sometimes it feels good. Sometimes it feels good to be bad. But that guy must deal with a lot like, you know, panicked parents and he must deal with a lot of stressed out people in the structure for him to really be like, that's the that guy was that bad.

497
00:46:53,000 --> 00:47:07,000
I was like, yeah, that sucks. He handled it very well. It also seems like they did not build enough EV station. They definitely did not. Because you've run into this a couple of times now. 100%. Do not plan on charging your car there.

498
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:17,000
There's there's an outside chance one will be available, but more it seems like they're mostly going to be occupied. Yeah. And the app also tells you because there's different apps to tell you if there's a charging station nearby.

499
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:32,000
And the Apple sometimes be wrong too. It'll say if it's green, it usually means there is available. But that is not the case with the Disney. Because I checked two two days ago. Not available. Like it said available. Not available. I think there's like 20 spaces. Yeah, there's not enough.

500
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I think part of it too might be I didn't have any reception inside the Pixar Palace structure. So it could be that maybe there's some, you know, connectivity issue with the stations. I don't and the app updating. I have no idea.

501
00:47:44,000 --> 00:48:13,000
They what they should do because they they they I depends sometimes they load from the top down. I feel like sometimes they load from the top up. I don't know. But they should have them on two levels. So maybe you get your first like bunch of cars that come in and do it. And then like a few hours later when they're finally loading on the top. They're loading you up there and then there's more available for people to come midday or later. Because people that park in the morning are parking there probably all day. Yes. So they don't need to be there all day, but they're not going to come back and move their car.

502
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
So I do keep it. What do you think of that plan?

503
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Vehicles are electric now. Yeah, some. Some are. Yeah, it's a it's a magical world. First couple first few generations of them, you know, plugins. I mean, oh, wow. So you like plug them into an outlet like a Nintendo. Yes. Yeah, like a Nintendo, I guess.

504
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:52,000
And driving a car is like driving a big Mario cart. Oh, yeah. No shells, though, not equipped with shells. Mr. Weigert, will you take me driving? Sure. Give him lessons. We're going to.

505
00:48:52,000 --> 00:49:00,000
We can borrow Carlson's SUV. There's some veterans like there's veterans in the escalator right now. They're in the escalator.

506
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:19,000
They're honking. They're not trapped. I left them some trail mix in there and they obviously they know how to like survive. Well, is the window because it's like kind of hot outside is the window lock on because you might you might have trapped a bunch of veterans in a hot car.

507
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,000
The window lock is on. Yeah, see. Yeah, that's an issue. Yeah.

508
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Can you lower it via an app or do you have to go physically out there? I can download the app. I have to download it. All right. All right. So that's less. I don't have to break from the pug. Yeah. They'll be fine.

509
00:49:38,000 --> 00:50:02,000
I will say about the Pixar pals parking structure. I don't love the theming because the theming instead of being based on instead of each level being a character, each level is a movie. Yeah. It's just like that's it's harder to remember for some reason. And it's also not on it doesn't connect with what we've established with the Mickey and Friends parking structure. It's not a true second beat of the parking structure.

510
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Because it's because of the pals like it's like Mickey and Friends Pixar pals. Obviously, you're saying it's friends. But yes, it should be single single characters or if they're a duo together like Chip and Dale or something.

511
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Well, it's duos and trios like pals hanging out together. Right. Until Inside Out. Because Inside Out is just Inside Out and the little emblem they use at least in the whatever sign I'm looking at is abstract. Yes. Inside Out is not. Those aren't pals. What emblem are you? Well, oh, you're looking at a different. Yes, I am. We should have coordinated our Pixar pals parking emblems. Yes. But the emblem doesn't matter. The point is Inside Out is not friends. There are friends in the movie.

512
00:50:44,000 --> 00:51:01,000
But you would not call that group of people Inside Out. No, for sure. So level one Incredibles level two Coco level three cars level four Monsters Inc level five Finding Nemo level six Inside Out. We parked on level three cars. Again, I just wanted to be the Cruz Ramirez level or something like just give it just take a character.

513
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Give me the give me the Lightning McQueen level. Give me something because it almost feels like they're not trusting Pixar's property. That's what I was going to break out characters enough. And I think they're wrong. Yeah, people know that level two.

514
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:29,000
They would recognize the characters of Coco and the Bone Man, a character I was doing. I cannot remember his actual name. So I was doing he goes by Coco and the Bone Man. Well, Ben, you're also you prove my because I always when I see the boy, I call him Coco.

515
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:39,000
But that is not Coco. Yeah, I've seen the film and I know that's not true. But still, every time my knee jerk is, oh, look, Coco. I forgot his name is not Coco. Yeah. So yeah, you.

516
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I don't know that name offhand, but the other guys for sure the Bone Man. So this is why this is answering the question. People don't know these characters. You don't think people know like, OK, first off, they're they're not including Toy Story at all.

517
00:51:53,000 --> 00:52:08,000
And I assume that's because they already have a lot. Yeah. Yeah. So so that's like that makes it a little bit difficult because those are their most identifiable characters. Yeah. I still think Mike and Sully like people know those characters from from Monsters Inc.

518
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:19,000
But what is Nemo's father's name? I've been sitting here trying to think of it. Does anyone know what off the top of the head? I don't know it. Marlin. Marlin. Yeah. OK. Oh, yeah. Actually, that's kind of a funny joke. Yeah, it's funny.

519
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:28,000
But I thought I thought he was just Nemo's dad. I didn't realize he had a character. I think so. Yeah. Dory. People know Dory. They can have a Dory. Dory. I would think would be the most.

520
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:45,000
But you could not. Besides Mater, you couldn't do. I don't think Dory Marlin Nemo. No, you would get confused between the fish. Yes. I think you take one character from each of the properties and then you just like make it like that's the the equivalent of finding Nemo level is the Dory level.

521
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:59,000
You know, and people or the Nemo level and people will associate it with that property, with that franchise. And then also they have a character that they can remember. And that's fun. Unless you take one of Pixar's most beloved franchises and just name it all based on that.

522
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:10,000
And that is the good dinosaur. Sure. Sure. You have the Arlo level, the thunder clap level, the downpour level, the closest I ever came to walking out of a movie.

523
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:30,000
The cold front. Just remembering all your files. You know, forest wood brush, Purvis. You know that thing when you start making a movie and you hire a voice cast for an animated movie and then the entire cast leaves or gets fired and they get replaced by a different voice cast.

524
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:42,000
And that also happens with directors and writers. That did that happen in this. Yes. Yes. But I so but in my head, Steve Zahn will always be thunder clap.

525
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:51,000
How could it have been someone else? I read something a while back and I don't think this was an I think it's been said a million times, but like I hadn't seen it before that.

526
00:53:51,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Like most Pixar movies are about people doing their jobs and your job is your life and the job of the dinosaurs to suck shit.

527
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Wow.

528
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:21,000
I got so mad and the catchphrase, the line in that movie that they keep repeating that is supposed to be like pathos is like you are me and more.

529
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:29,000
And I'm just sitting in a movie theater, just move squarely in my seat, just going like, I hate this. I can't.

530
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
There with Tomorrowlands, there are two wolves.

531
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:46,000
I saw it too. I just refuse to believe that there was ever anyone else as Bubba besides Dave Boat.

532
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:54,000
See, but what you vote born to be Bubba.

533
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Okay, so they fucked up, obviously. I wonder if they did like a survey. They do surveys about everything. So they probably did like an average survey of like, who is this to people?

534
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:14,000
And it was coming in under a certain percentage. That's my guess. I mean, I think you need to remember the character to know where they parked. No, I get.

535
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:26,000
So that's like I would imagine like if if dads were scoring under 50 percent on recall, right? Who is this dad? And then he's like, I had that car, the junk car, the car, the junkie car.

536
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:34,000
But I think that Lightning McQueen and Mater are probably the two most recognizable besides Mike Insali. I think Mater is number one.

537
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Mater, I think, is probably number one. Dory, number two. They did a quiz and dad like didn't get he scored zero. He didn't get any of them until Mrs. Incredible came up.

538
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:49,000
So I do declare Mrs. Incredible. Her name is Helen. Helen is her name.

539
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:59,000
The guy by the escalators doesn't even list the Incredibles as level one because there is no escalator for level one, obviously. So it's just the Luxo ball. Oh, yeah.

540
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:09,000
OK. But yeah, it is clearly when you're walking around, there's incredible signage. Yes. But do we like that ball? The ball fountain? Yes. That's neat. I think it's cool. It's a nice photo.

541
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:18,000
I mean, that's a very Instagram like photo op sort of thing, I think. I will say that I don't think the ball is as iconic as the Mickey ears.

542
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:32,000
And they're using the Mickey ears. I mean, obviously, what is the Nike swoosh, I guess, but the McDonald's M. But the Mickey ears are like the iconography of the Mickey and friends.

543
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:40,000
And then they're using the Luxo ball for the Pixar pals. I don't know. I guess what else would you use? There's really nothing that's equivalent to the mouse ears.

544
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:49,000
And the lamp is already used in various places. Yeah, the lamp wouldn't work. I guess it's pretty good. I mean, it is a very you don't realize how recognizable it is.

545
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:57,000
John Lasseter with outstretched arms waiting for a hug.

546
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:03,000
You should enter V. You should enter under John Lasseter's arms. You're driving your car in to get a hug.

547
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Every now and then the music is interrupted to say, where my hug at? Probably one of the worst phrases in the English language.

548
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Did he say that? I don't know. I think that's just the thing. That was from an affidavit or something. Is that a phrase? Where my hug at? Where my hug at?

549
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:25,000
That's a thing like sad dudes say. Is it? Yeah. That does sound familiar. Yes.

550
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:35,000
The kind of guy who's only physical contact with a woman is like via the unspoken thing that like you hug any female acquaintance. Hello or goodbye. Right.

551
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:42,000
There are those. So this is a friend of mine I could picture who's like that's like his one chance is that. Yeah. That like owed hug.

552
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:49,000
I don't believe in and I try not to do. I hear it. Makes me uncomfortable. I like to I like to give handshakes to everyone.

553
00:57:49,000 --> 00:58:02,000
But people are some people are expecting a hug. And so that interaction is hard to navigate. I will say that the other thing that that you'll see from that that kind of guy is the unsolicited unsolicited shoulder rub.

554
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Like just like kind of going behind of like oh yeah. You're tense. You know and just start start giving a girl. Yeah.

555
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Yeah. Yeah. Don't you don't do that. I know. Don't do that.

556
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Well you have good manners. Yeah. You just inherently know even though you died in the fountain before the meeting. Yeah. Everyone should know.

557
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:34,000
We were talking about the Luxo ball a little bit and they kind of carry that through the rest of the garage.

558
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:41,000
And then yes into the statue the trash cans here you can see how it the floor the elevator has it.

559
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:48,000
That's good. I think that's a big thing. A lot of people are commenting on this this garage a lot more elevators than the McKeith Friends.

560
00:58:48,000 --> 00:59:00,000
What like it's easier to navigate. Yeah. Three instead of one more elevators although I'll say we parked in a in a middle aisle and we're like oh here's an elevator and went over to it.

561
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:08,000
And it was a cast members only elevator. Oh great. Very like I felt naughty. Someone make fun of you.

562
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:13,000
No one made fun of me but like there were no there was no one in there was just us in there and then we were just like oh wait the buttons aren't working.

563
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:23,000
And then we saw the sign and it felt. Yeah I think if I was a if I was a guest I'd be a little confused and peeved. Sure.

564
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:31,000
I don't think there. Yeah there's I don't use the elevators a lot. I mean obviously they're probably for like kids strollers and stuff. Yes. More.

565
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:41,000
So I guess I should have done some better journalism and done all the elevators to make sure they should have done each and every. Yeah. And the escalators kind of all are in the spiral sort of.

566
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:49,000
I like the spiral spiral spiral spiral fan and it's I think it's a better cooler setup than the Mickey and Friends just big escalators.

567
00:59:49,000 --> 01:00:00,000
It's got kind of an architectural landmark now. Yes. It looks better. It looks I also like I like the greenery on the roof and then the if you look from the outside the lighting on the levels is different.

568
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:11,000
There's a different coloration which which is very pleasing to the eye. To me the comparison is because it very it very much is just another Mickey and Friends but just a little nicer. Yeah.

569
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:20,000
It is kind of like the win and the encore in Vegas. It's just like they built another one right next to it and then it's just like a little newer.

570
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:30,000
So it's a little classier a little snazzier. Sure. But they you know they need to like pair well they need to seem like two parts of the same whole. Yes. You wouldn't want to go radically different for sure.

571
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:50,000
For sure. And also they they do connect these garages connect and the Pixar pals doesn't have an exit. No. You enter the Mickey and Friends garage in order to exit. That was confusing. Yes. That was we were we were going to the exit.

572
01:00:50,000 --> 01:01:10,000
And then Ali was driving and we were making turns and she was like wait so is there no exit. I was like oh because we're now in Mickey and Friends and we're like what do we go the right way or did we just get turned around and then we eventually gleaned that that is the only exit that it has a separate entrance but not a separate exit from Mickey and Friends. Right.

573
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Which maybe maybe does that get backed up. I don't know. We weren't there at Prime Hours. Absolutely. So it does get backed up. So I don't know. Yeah I don't know what that what the thinking behind that was. I think there is a way to get out the way you come in on Magic Way but I don't know if they just never route people that way.

574
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Yes. Didn't we leave that day when we were down there with the Sector Keeper. I'm trying to think did we leave. I have video going out the other way. Oh yeah. It can be done. It can be done but maybe they just never have it open. Maybe it's rare that it's open.

575
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:55,000
I get bummed in both of these lots every time anytime you're like ready to go and if you're especially if your car is a little close then you probably have to do the most circuitous like longest path all the way back around. Right. Doing doing that big giant loop and then having to merge with cars again is annoying.

576
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:24,920
But that's something that annoys me after I you know have gone to Disneyland for the fifth time in a month. So so a tiny thing to complain about. I think honestly yeah I think like it's a little annoying but the only thing is bad and it hasn't happened to me is when that thing is backed up like crazy which I've seen videos where that thing is like crazy like you're just stuck in a gridlock. But maybe they do open the other exit if that's the case. I don't know. It was I believe this lot was open when I had that when I was there for that disaster day with the freeway.

577
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:47,920
Issue. And it was horrible. It was like it totally affected Pixar Pals. They had no way to get out of there. Yeah. I mean I think they want people thinking of this as just one big parking structure because you know there's that speed ramp that sort of goes right to the parking garages in the morning and exit the garages at night. You know there's not a separate. There's one entrance.

578
01:02:47,920 --> 01:03:09,040
Excuse me for Pixar Pals you're in your time. No I got all. I'll tell the Randy Gerber story again. Well that's Jason's story to tell I would never take that away from him. That's his favorite story where you just get a million dollars from your friend. Jason were you drinking out of a canteen.

579
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:16,200
What is that. I have one of the swells. That's how it's an old school. It's one of those like a wood finish on the bottle I see.

580
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:19,200
Oh boy. You all right?

581
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,200
Take a sec.

582
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:23,200
Set it this out.

583
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:30,200
Sorry, just something caught in my throat.

584
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:35,200
It's a touching subject, so.

585
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:39,200
We're all on edge.

586
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:45,200
Okay. I think you were saying the speed ramp in was the last thing.

587
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:49,200
Yeah. The speed ramp in that they switch around at night to get people out.

588
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,200
Take another minute.

589
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:51,200
I'm okay.

590
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:54,200
It sounded like you were really struggling to get those words out.

591
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:56,200
I've recovered.

592
01:03:56,200 --> 01:04:01,200
Just like I sounded where I did, I did all the stage directions for a table read.

593
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,200
Oh yeah.

594
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:08,200
Which is a lot of talking. You're talking more than anybody, but I did very well.

595
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:11,200
I didn't mess up one word of the thing. I was like, this is crazy.

596
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,200
I don't know how I'm doing so well. I am on fire.

597
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:18,200
And then it got to the end and I made it and the director said, Hey, geez,

598
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,200
and thanks Scott for getting through all those words.

599
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:26,200
And I was like, and I coughed my lungs out right there.

600
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,200
Like I made it all the way to the end until the end.

601
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:31,200
And then that's saying what this project was.

602
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,200
Molly Shannon was there and laughed at me.

603
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,200
Said, Oh, that's so sad.

604
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:41,200
I did. I did stage directions at a table read once and it is, you know,

605
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:44,200
it is exhausting and mentally taxing and also not fun because you're like,

606
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:47,200
you don't get to read any jokes or anything, especially for comedy.

607
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:53,200
But, but afterwards, the, the one bit of gratification I got is that afterwards,

608
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:57,200
Chris Parnell looked at me and was like, Hey man, great job on those stage directions.

609
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,200
And I was like, Oh, okay. I'll tell you.

610
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:02,200
Somebody with one of the best voices in the biz.

611
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,200
Who's got better pipes than Parnell?

612
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,200
Yeah, geez. That's true. Very good.

613
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:08,200
That's why he's the hamburger helper.

614
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,200
I do like that. He's that.

615
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:12,200
And I like the hamburger helper.

616
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:16,200
I will say I like him too. Yeah. Yeah.

617
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,200
Jason's favorite character in fiction.

618
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:23,200
He helps hamburgers be made.

619
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,200
Mine is the hamburger helper.

620
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:26,200
Yours is Henry from country bears.

621
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:28,200
Nah, yeah.

622
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:29,200
It's a nine way time.

623
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:30,200
It's a nine way time.

624
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:31,200
All the bears.

625
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:32,200
All the bears.

626
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:36,200
I think what I was driving at is they just want people thinking of like,

627
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:38,200
just follow the signs for Disney parks parking.

628
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:42,200
They don't want weirdos like us going like, well, I'd rather park in the Pixar pals.

629
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:47,200
They have the indicator lights and they haven't retrofitted all of Mickey and friends with the indicator lights yet.

630
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:54,200
Yeah. So the indicator lights are a red and green light that tell you if somebody's in the spot.

631
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:59,200
So you can be able to see down a row how many, like you can see, Oh, it's mostly red.

632
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,200
I shouldn't go down this road.

633
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:01,200
It's not exact.

634
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,200
No, it's not.

635
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:04,200
There's not one light per one spot.

636
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,200
Yeah. It's imperfect.

637
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,200
These are always annoying.

638
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,200
Yeah.

639
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:15,200
I think it's a thing that seems great in theory, but in practice, because the accuracy has to be there.

640
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:23,200
And because there's enough of a fail rate where sometimes a red is unoccupied or sometimes a green is occupied,

641
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:27,200
it adds to the frustration in terms of searching for a space.

642
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:30,200
It reminds me of being at the Century City Mall, which I don't know your feelings.

643
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:32,200
I am always annoyed to be there.

644
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,200
Yes.

645
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,200
Especially that lot.

646
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,200
That lot is horrible.

647
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,200
And I got really lost in there once. I got lost for like half an hour.

648
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:41,200
A truly cavernous and confusing lot with it's, because I think it's...

649
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:44,200
So many entrances, as many ways and levels to go on.

650
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,200
You're talking about the Westfield Century City Mall?

651
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:47,200
Yes.

652
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:49,200
Yeah. Yeah. It's crazy. That one's crazy.

653
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:57,200
It's confusing. And I try to take the bus when I go there, partly because I don't want to have to deal with that parking.

654
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:03,200
But you sometimes have to go there because it has an IMAX screen.

655
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:10,200
And it's like the... For instance, when I saw The Hobbit 2 in a high frame rate, that was the one theater that was offering it.

656
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:12,200
So I had to suck it up.

657
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:14,200
Howard Hughes, no IMAX?

658
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:16,200
Howard Hughes does have it.

659
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,200
But they don't always play it.

660
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,200
They are always showing the same things. Yeah.

661
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:25,200
Well, so fuck the Century City Mall. No ordeal about that. I'll say that right here and now.

662
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:29,200
Yeah. I don't think there's a there's a much reason to do an ordeal for that one.

663
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,200
Right. So we're all in agreement, right?

664
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:34,200
We're all in agreement. It's just down the list, way down the list.

665
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,200
That's all this does.

666
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:39,200
Just way down. Yeah. I agree. It's not coming up in the next two years.

667
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,200
It'll be in 2041.

668
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:48,200
I'll say this. The Pixar pals, I mean, I think we've all gotten lost to Mickey and Friends at one point or another.

669
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:53,200
It doesn't help. It's technically kind of two garages connected by like foot bridges.

670
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:57,200
The Pixar pals just one garage.

671
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:04,200
And I think that is why the Pixar pals is around five thousand spaces, whereas Mickey and Friends is around ten thousand spaces.

672
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:07,200
Oh, wow. So it's like it is half the size.

673
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:10,200
I didn't realize that. They look like they're the same.

674
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:12,200
They look like they're the same. Yeah.

675
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:15,200
Let's let's get negative here.

676
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:20,200
The lighting sucks in the Pixar pals versus Mickey and Friends. It's dim.

677
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:23,200
You think so? It is dim. I don't know why it's so dim.

678
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:28,200
It's weird. They spent all of their lighting money at the tram loading on the ground floor.

679
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:34,200
Which is the best part, I think, of all of this is tram loading now down in these parking.

680
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:39,200
Because tram loading is, bless you, tram loading has music.

681
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:46,200
There's like music playing and it's got characters on the wall and it's a much more pleasant experience than tram loading ever used to be.

682
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:51,200
Yeah, it kicks off your Disney party. Party begins before you leave the parking garage.

683
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:56,200
That's right. And then you get to see some of you could see the outlines like what you're talking about, which should be on the bridge.

684
01:08:56,200 --> 01:09:00,200
They're doing in the loading area. They've got pictures of Pixar friends.

685
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:03,200
Silhouettes. Silhouettes.

686
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:12,200
Point of much conversation when this garage first opened, because there was this weird blobby thing and everyone like, what fucking character is that?

687
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:18,200
And then they fixed it and it was clearly supposed to be Eva. Oh, OK. Wally.

688
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:23,200
But her arms were closed. She just looks like a manatee.

689
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:28,200
Yeah. And everyone's like, is this a new character? Is this how they tell us? Oh, that's a little leak.

690
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:34,200
But it was just a bad job. And they had Forky ready to go real fast after.

691
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:39,200
Oh, it's opened around the same time as Toy Story 4 and new characters already represented.

692
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:42,200
Uh huh. That's fun. Yeah. Yeah.

693
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:49,200
Yeah. So that's that's the best place. And that's not that's got a mood like that's got like Virgin America airplane lighting in there.

694
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:55,200
Yes. Yeah. Which is fun. Dear Depart, Fallen Brother, Virgin. Yeah. Good airline. Yeah. Very good.

695
01:09:55,200 --> 01:10:00,200
There was one good airline. It had to be taken away. Yeah. It really sucks. That was really fine.

696
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:07,200
I think Absinthe on a airline flight once. Oh, yeah. You did Skoll. Oh, man.

697
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:12,200
Well, you do that on all airlines. Yeah. Virgin. They did come. Yeah.

698
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:17,200
And they gave you they can you can order dip from your console in front of you the screen.

699
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:25,200
Make a flight attendant. Was the Epstein plane Virgin America. Yeah.

700
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:33,200
All I know is I'm sure. I'm sure Richard Branson was on whatever plane it was. That's all I know. Seems right.

701
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:39,200
Yeah. So I don't know why. I mean, it would be nice if they would do like this cool lighting in the parking structure.

702
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:44,200
I guess that's too much to ask. But just give me some more light. I don't know what the hell is wrong.

703
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:50,200
It was oddly dim in there. And I attribute it to the time of day we were there. We're kind of like, you know, the sun was starting to come down.

704
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:54,200
And so I was like, oh, maybe it's not fully lit. But that is to hear that that's just how it always is.

705
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:57,200
That's interesting. That's that is definitely a negative. Yeah.

706
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:06,200
People on message boards blame Bob Chapek for this for cheaping out on lights because maybe you need to double the lights that granular of decisions.

707
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:14,200
According to the lights, according to Mouse chatter dot net message boards.

708
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:25,200
Yes, he does. He's responsible for all of it. I mean, wherever they can cut costs and maximize profits, that seems to be like the company's thing for the last 20 years.

709
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:31,200
But what if people get robbed or children are abducted? I don't care.

710
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:39,200
I'm Chapek as long as I have their money. Yeah. And the rest of their lives on a sex boat.

711
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:47,200
I mean, there is I read something that like when attendance is up, that, of course, causes petty crime to ride, you know, in the park.

712
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:57,200
Well, just in the property in general, like in Florida, when there's more people there, speaking of crime, as Jason and I were walking back to my car.

713
01:11:57,200 --> 01:12:04,200
Oh, yeah. We saw two empty white clock hands. Oh, boy. In the Pixar pals parking structure.

714
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:14,200
So there was petty crime. Someone was partying. Someone was in that person wasn't around, almost like they disappeared like a ghost.

715
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:20,200
Hmm. I don't know.

716
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:29,200
Let's just say I needed to refresh a little. Are you drinking White Claws Sector Keeper? I tried a few.

717
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:36,200
Bad man Nick Mundy gave me White Claw. Oh, he did. Oh, God. I believe it. Yeah, I believe it, too.

718
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:45,200
He said he said you want to be like one of the good boys. And he meant the movie Good Boys, not us good boys.

719
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:50,200
No, yeah. He meant Tremblay. Did you did you go like on an adventure with him or something?

720
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:56,200
What did you go to Vegas with him to see Steve Miller Band? Yeah, that's exactly what we did. Oh, man. You knew it.

721
01:12:56,200 --> 01:13:10,200
Hey, yeah. He was floated that idea to me, but then it all of a sudden just never came up again. Yeah, he picked me up and gave me a variety pack of Kodiak chew.

722
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:21,200
Wow. White Claw flavored white flavor chew. That's really gross. I know it was a bad decision. Don't tell my parents.

723
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:35,200
OK, we won't. We will. This is really this whole thing is very shocking to me that Nick Mundy followed up on something he suggested.

724
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:43,200
Huh? This is very, very hot. My experience.

725
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:54,200
I don't know a way out of this. Well, I guess I should say apologies to Nick Mundy for tagging the wrong Nick Mundy on Twitter for tagging a member of the band Sister Sledge.

726
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:59,200
Great. That's what we have to apologize for.

727
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:04,200
Nick Mundy.

728
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:15,200
He does not play in the band Sister Sledge. It's like Warren Ellis. It happens. It's like Warren Ellis, the comic book writer and Warren Ellis from Nick Cave's band, that sort of thing. I'm assuming happens a lot.

729
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:28,200
Sure. We're very good to the person who suggested we do this podcast. Yeah, sure. We really treat him with the highest respect.

730
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:38,200
And look, we all love Mundy. Mundy's great. Yes, of course. And he's just he's busy because he's hanging out with so many Ghost Children. It's true. Yeah. Joy rides with Ghost Kids. You got lucky this one time.

731
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:50,200
So the Virgin America, we have to really wind back here. We were talking about Richard Branson. Do we have to wind down? Well, I was just getting riled up.

732
01:14:50,200 --> 01:15:04,200
So, yeah, I think that like that's the best part of it is for sure the tram loading, the circular thing, the lights got to change. The indicator lights, they have to figure that out. I get the idea of it.

733
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:09,200
This is you being riled up. Yeah, my adrenaline is pumping.

734
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:24,200
I've never been in a parking situation where those green and red lights functioned correctly. I've never been in one where it's just like, oh, this is as accurate as it needs to be for this to be a bonus, not a hindrance.

735
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:40,200
I also think often when you go to the Americana at Brand and Glendale that when they tell you how many spaces are filled, I don't think that's accurate. Oh, yeah. In the least, which is another thing to say bad about the Americana at Brand and therefore at Americana at Brand memes.

736
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:47,200
Yes, I agree with that. Try to defend that one. Just try. Valiant effort this week, but nice try. Try again.

737
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:58,200
Yeah, fake, fake parking. I was gonna say news, but it's not news. It's statistics, I guess. Fake stats, fake stats, unreliable.

738
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:15,200
Fake board, fake digital display. Yeah. I think the ceilings in Pixar, pal, a bit lower. A little lower. A little lower. It makes me feel a little more claustrophobic. Lower and darker. Everyone's favorite quality is about a parking garage.

739
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:31,200
Yeah, I don't know. Again, is that a Chapec cheapen out? He's like, no, cut the height of the ceilings. Cut the cement budget. Precious cement. Are there more levels than the Mickey and Friends of the same height? Same heights. Same numbers. Same height.

740
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:47,200
The weirdest thing about it is they have to be even, so what's the point of the lower ceilings? Yeah, I don't get it. It doesn't make sense to me. We should have had a construction worker on here to tell us what was the thought behind it. Let's pause, go out to the street, find one.

741
01:16:47,200 --> 01:17:01,200
Okay. They're actually one of the veterans in my car. I bet whoever we find, oh yeah, get one of the veterans. Yeah, he worked construction in the military, so he could maybe tell us. He's stuck in your car. Yeah, he's fine. I'm driving him home later. He's fine.

742
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:05,200
He's driving to Santa Fe, New Mexico.

743
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:21,200
We're going to stop in Vegas too. Go see Steve Miller. Park MGM. Money of season tickets to Steve Miller in Vegas. Should I sell my seats this week or you want to come along, Duder?

744
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:41,200
Subletting your Stephen Miller van. Did you say Stephen Miller? Oh no, I didn't mean that. Oh, the joke? Stephen Miller van. Another Funny or Die video. Oh yeah. People would love that. Got some blowback for that one.

745
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:59,200
What's the Fly Like an Eagle parody? Fly Like a White Nationalist. Fine. Yeah, good enough. Yeah, we got three more of these to crank out today. We can all agree. Great exposure though. Very good exposure.

746
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:13,200
You're getting so savvy, Sector Key. Our careers took off after it. Yeah, if you appeared in a video next to the Steve Miller, or perhaps in this case, the Stephen Miller, a man willing to still do a Funny or Die video. Right.

747
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:32,200
Stephen Miller as himself or you start off like, hey, we're going to cast, we're thinking we're going to get Brendan Fraser to be Stephen Miller and then eventually you settle on, hey, we've got a guy who knows French Stewart.

748
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:46,200
French Stewart's friend is going to play Stephen Miller. You know, I was going to be shot in a big mansion and like with a bunch of cranes and swooping cameras and they said, can we do it in front of green screen? Can we do it in 15 minutes?

749
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:58,200
Also, can we put the green screen up at your house? We don't have any issues with office space. Can you cook craft service, please?

750
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:13,200
Oh, yeah. Good exposure. Right. Good exposure. Great exposure. The Hicks are pal. I mean, they needed more parking for years. Yes. They needed more parking, but then they went and opened a Star Wars land that somehow course corrected the overcrowding problems of Disneyland.

751
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:30,200
They killed the park that killed so they don't need they could implode this now, but we're going to hit Christmas. So it's crowded. I've been seeing things filling up to capacity like parking has been filling up to capacity lately and Halloween got it going. So obviously they needed it anyway.

752
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:45,200
If we weren't it seemed pretty full. We were routed to the third level because specifically because of the reason. But it's if we looked at how the cones were laid out, it looked like they were taking us up to six or seven, whatever the highest level is.

753
01:19:45,200 --> 01:20:00,200
So it looks like that was that was where cars were being cordoned off to. Yeah. I mean, it's so it's necessary. It's not like this thing sitting empty. Yeah. So I mean, the problem is, I do feel I'd love to fully say this is slam dunk way better than Mickey and Friends.

754
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:13,200
But the fact that I feel like it's dark and and low, like it feels when the actual parking experience itself, this is a core. If we're talking about the parking experience itself, we've had difficult times with this electric vehicle stuff.

755
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:30,200
Yes, it's less. It's less good parking. Yeah, this is the meat of the experience. Yes. Less good parking than when you park in Mickey and Friends. But you're probably right. Is that a trade off with a much better tram loading and security security experience?

756
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:59,200
Because there are cues now for like get in this row for the tram. There's people fighting on roads. There's pleasant music playing. It's the most pleasant security gate. I would say. Yeah, I agree. 100 percent. Get backed up. So I did a back. I was I went with my mom and the backup was so like we lost like an hour, hour and a half. At the tram? Yeah. Wow. Really? Yeah. I don't know if just that day was insane. That's right. I've never seen that. Yeah. And like it was very unclear. Like like some like you didn't know where a line was.

757
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:21,200
You didn't know where a line began and ended and I don't know. That's frustrating. Yeah. Yeah. My mom passed away. I buried the lead there. Fainted and I should have reported that on the bucket. Yeah. Bury the lead on that one. Yeah. Jesus. Just give up. Why keep trying? Like Joe Biden.

758
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:37,200
No way. I like it. All the way to the White House. I was going to say Padme Amidala. Oh, yeah. It was like Padme. Yeah. Just quit. Biden's kind of like Padme. They're the very similar figures.

759
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:56,200
In effectual. Biden kind of looks like Anakin before he was put in the Darth Vader. His eye is pretty banged up in that third movie.

760
01:21:56,200 --> 01:22:04,200
That's the sin. But just before election, they got to put him in some big suit and then it'll be funny. Yeah. How's he looking there? Don't worry about it.

761
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:14,200
I'm going to say this. I've only been in this garage a couple of times now. I feel like there's probably not enough signage for the pedestrian bridge because you have to use level two.

762
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:28,200
One pedestrian bridge is on level two. And I think if they put up more signage that would cue more people to like, oh, let's just walk. Let's just walk. Let's skip the. It's confusing to the point where I was. We were wandering through the garage.

763
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:41,200
We ended up at that cast member elevator, which I mentioned. We started actually doubling back towards the Mickey and Friends lot because we're like, maybe it's that way. And I just I Googled it and I didn't have like there wasn't clear.

764
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:49,200
So I texted Carlson, like, where's the pedestrian bridge? And then he was like, oh, you have to go down to level two. We're on level three and you have to take the stairs.

765
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:59,200
Like you have to go all the way to the end where the escalators are. Take the stairs down to level two and then or I guess you could take an escalator down there depending if you wanted to go all the way down and then back up.

766
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:18,200
Yeah. And then and then and then it's accessible. So it's very unclear how you get there if you're a novice. Yeah. And it is. And the best thing bridge is great. And I would just say like in terms of the the if the Pixar pals lot, even though it's got some negatives as compared to the Mickey and Friends lot needs to exist for that pedestrian bridge to exist.

767
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:42,200
Then it's worth it because that pedestrian bridge is great. Sure. But it is confusing in terms of how to get there. More signage would be very helpful. I think to the dedicated security at the tram loading and dedicated security by the old ESPN zone where if you cross the path from that the ends the pedestrian bridge walkway, you get your own security right there.

768
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:58,200
And it's separate from the security for the people coming from the Disneyland Hotel. So I think that is smoothing things out a little more security checkpoints. I didn't realize that and realize that was his own cue. So we're seeing that Pixar pals is more.

769
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:17,200
It's a little worse. It's a little more confusing, a little more unpleasant than the other parking garage we've addressed. I'm just saying from the outside. It's all nice. Yeah. There's some decent things about it. But on the whole, more it seems like it's kind of a little encapsulation of the downtown Disney ordeal itself.

770
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:31,200
Less than the last one. Got it. More confusing. Yeah. But a lot of high points. More polish. Yeah. Maybe that's not true.

771
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:35,200
We kept notes. I kept some notes.

772
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:49,200
Remembered what the items were. You used three pieces of loose leaf paper. Yeah. A couple of loose white claws, just like we had a couple of episodes where we were drunk.

773
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:53,200
It's still possible on this episode. Yeah, we got time.

774
01:24:53,200 --> 01:25:09,200
So yeah, I think that honestly the good stuff that it ushered in is worth the less good parking experience. Yeah. So overall, it's a net positive for sure. But I do think if they could just brighten that up, if they brighten it up, it's really that's most of the battle.

775
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:21,200
They can't. I don't think they can raise the ceilings. Well, again, we should ask that construction veteran, that guy who used to, you know, work as a foreman. He probably would know if logistically you could raise the ceiling. I'm guessing you're right. I'm guessing it would be impossible.

776
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:34,200
Yeah. Oh yeah. Very hard. But they could definitely add some signage in terms of how do you get to the pedestrian bridge. That feels like a thing like paint something on the ground. Like paint like a big like like this way pedestrian bridge. Yeah, for sure.

777
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:54,200
For sure. I think it would I think they would should really be advertising that more because I think the idea sort of at least my idea for the first few years was this is a crazy walk to take from the parking structure to Disneyland. But it's not that bad, especially when you're act you're factoring in that bridge and the fact that you can get right on the monorail if the monorail is open.

778
01:25:54,200 --> 01:26:08,200
It's I think it's delightful and I think it's a great way to start and end your day. I think we're very pro bridge bridge bridge that it overlaid. Oh, it's you serve some of what's a little more negative about the Pixar Pals garage. Yes, I agree.

779
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:26,200
I think a lot of this would be alleviated to if they got another garage on the other side of harbor to serve to direct people coming from south of Anaheim because they're causing everyone coming from the south to go essentially around the resort to come to the same garage.

780
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:40,200
Everyone coming north of Anaheim is going to. Well, they just have to Anaheim just has to let them completely completely shut out all the other businesses so they can bleed them dry and then buy that land cheap.

781
01:26:40,200 --> 01:27:01,200
Yes, and hopefully do that before any of any of us have the idea to have to do the harbor Houghton. Insane Banana Republic ask Reedy Creek Improvement District that runs the Florida property have a West Coast equivalent to run what will happen though.

782
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:22,200
Yeah, that's that could happen. I think they'll they'll just make that more of downtown Disney and it'll make us have to do more at stores. Because then that yeah once they sell that land to Disney then they'll just build more you know voids cupcake stores right milkshake stores, you know, more places to get a burger that is fine.

783
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:27,200
Yes, yeah, a lot of fine places. So that's coming. Yeah.

784
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:44,200
Do we do it. Are we done. I was anyone have a final thought I mean final Nick you're the parking expert you're our parking expert. Yes, that's what you're. Yeah, I thought it was a you know I think it was a just to summarize, it's a it's a very nice parking experience.

785
01:27:44,200 --> 01:28:00,200
But off hours it's a little bit more confusing because there's less there are fewer cast members to guide you in terms of exactly where to go and that the cones are maybe not as the the the cones I feel like the cones alone I feel like didn't didn't necessarily get the job done

786
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:17,200
especially if we're going to the dedicated EV level. That was a little bit confusing. Not enough EV charging stations, don't love the theming looks better from the outside but the insides not not as great and but the pedestrian bridge is wonderful that is that is like great and that

787
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:33,200
that alone makes me want to go back to Disney so yeah I mean I think we talked about I think plussing it up and then such I think already I mean I think just yeah we've also stopped doing that so long ago. Yeah, we don't ever make it.

788
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:41,200
Yeah, it's not an official segment it's sort of just waves in and out. Right, it kind of gets worked in. If anyone misses that let us know. Yeah. Yeah.

789
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:57,200
If you want us to do like a really hard version of it at the end we can maybe do it. Yeah, you want to be able to make a little like chart and a graph. Right. You guys get with the forks. People do like that stuff people do like making spreadsheets. So, you know, maybe a thing to consider.

790
01:28:57,200 --> 01:29:14,200
You ever check your old your spreadsheets just to like remember like oh yeah that one two and a half years ago, there was a guy who was maintaining a golden plate club for for doughboys or chain restaurant podcast that all the the the rankings of all the restaurants and then at some point and I would refer to that sometimes

791
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:29,200
because I was trying to remember like oh what did we give you know Olive Garden the first time we reviewed it if we're going to review it a second time. Oh, you actually consulted it. Yeah. It was handy to have. But then I think he's lost interest in the podcast and stopped updating it. So then it kind of like. As one day will you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

792
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:59,200
Hopefully, hopefully soon. But yeah, the archive kind of ends in like mid 2018 kind of abruptly. So there you go. If he was responsible, he would have found someone to take it over. Yeah, you'd you'd wish. But you know, hey, whatever. He was probably in mid 2018. He was maybe he was canvassing for a House of Representatives or something. Lost interest in podcasting. Maybe he got elected. Maybe he's in the House of Representatives. I'm remembering that now that it's actually it was Representative Katie

793
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:15,200
Porter who was maintaining it. So she I mean she's got she's got other things to worry about. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Well, now there's only one way to know if we if we finished. Well, yeah. Well, I don't even know exactly what happens here.

794
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:37,200
Hmm. Boys, boys, you give me strength. OK. I just received a text message from the level keeper on his pre his or her prepaid cricket wireless phones. Of course. Oh, boy. Boy, is the boys that the dark spirits there, they're emerging again. Oh, no.

795
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:46,200
What you read the text quick and then we don't we don't have to deal with that. He says that the walkway is no longer a walkway or a bridge. It's a bridge of souls.

796
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:56,200
And the evil spirits are emerging. Shit. Boys, boys. I'm scared. The clouds are coming over. Oh, the little indicators are flashing red and green.

797
01:30:56,200 --> 01:31:13,200
They're turning black. Mr. Weiger, you should run or maybe you should stay. Oh, yeah. What did we decide today? You should stay. You should check on the veterans and the escalate or are you going to stay?

798
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:29,200
I think I should stay. Is there anything I should be doing? Um, I think there's any reason to get out of here. No, no, you have to stay. I do. But my cat or even though you have to why your go. Yes. Yes.

799
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:47,200
And Jason, you must as well. Boys, this isn't good. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. It's Nick Valenti. It's Rick Wetzel. Why? It's Robert Earl. We killed all these people. It's Ralph Brennan and Dan Aykroyd.

800
01:31:47,200 --> 01:32:03,200
They're taking over my soul. All of them. Oh, my God. Hey, it's Nick Valenti. I'm possessing souls over here. Oh, we go. You fuck you.

801
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:24,200
Fuck you. Wow. Well, well, well, isn't four pots of gumbo piping hot and horny is you bastard. You're the one who propelled us to the underworld in episodes you could still listen to at Patreon.com slash podcast.

802
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:33,200
The ride that's right behind a gorgeous paywall. I mean, I did like that part of it, but the rest of it was horrible. You trapped our friend Eva. Yeah, that's right.

803
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:50,200
And if you want a free Eva and Jason Woolliner and all your friends, you have a mall. They've all been captured. They're all captured and they're in my escalade. They're all sitting in my escalator room with the those veterans.

804
01:32:50,200 --> 01:33:03,200
That's right. Shoot. Trapped in a small space. This was even Stephen Miller's plan. I am from France. Oh, shit. Right. The excellent, very accurate Dan Aykroyd is back.

805
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:26,200
Not new, not new. Oh, no. All of them at once. Sky overwhelming. You have a lot of nerve coming in here. That's right. This is me. Rick Wetzel. The regular voice. Hey, a regular voice. That's a good idea.

806
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:40,200
What? You're stealing your ideas again. Of course, the thing Rick Wetzel does. Everybody's backing up to their old tricks. It's almost like all of our items did nothing. Yeah, yeah, they did nothing. And don't forget about me, Robert.

807
01:33:40,200 --> 01:33:53,200
Oh, of course, we know all about you and what you did to us. Lifestyles of the famous, sound and ass Robert Earl. Your sandwiches were okay at best.

808
01:33:53,200 --> 01:34:13,200
So you boys think that you can just waltz around my parking garage. That is what we cross into my area, my district. It's yours now you took over the parking garage over it. See, boys, you forgot to take a peek inside the ESPN zone.

809
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:26,200
That's where my whole operation is. Oh, yeah, we didn't go in. It's off limits now. It's close to the public. It's close to the public. That's where your machines are that pump new life into those spirits that we killed. Yes, that's right. That's right.

810
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:40,200
And I don't think there's anything you can do about it. I don't know. Do we have anything? So says you. Well, the good news is that the level keeper texted me with one of his very last precious text messages. He or she. Yeah.

811
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:54,200
And he replenished all of our or she or she replenished all of our items. Oh, wow. We have the full stockpile. Wow. I would love to hear what that is. Well, you're gonna.

812
01:34:54,200 --> 01:35:10,200
It's a sourdough loaf signed by Nancy Silverton, her husband, Mark Peele, three black aprons, two pizzas from Tootie Rudy's and fornication pamphlet. Hey, Tootie Rudy's Rudy Giuliani. That's my best friend. God bless him. That's right.

813
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:18,200
We're gonna fuck you up with those items just like we did before. I like to see you try. I've got diplomatic immunity.

814
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:35,200
Because from Rudy Giuliani, Giuliani, Giuliani, he gave me diplomatic immunity. I mean, he's in some hot water illegally. I mean, he I don't know if that's going to stick. He lives for that shit. Are you. Let me ask you this. Are you starting any other restaurants with him recently or trying to? Yeah, we're going to open an ice cream parlor.

815
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:50,200
OK, well, is there a gimmick to that? It's not. I mean, it's mostly just Rudy scooping ice cream. Sounds like you guys are running out of steam. Yeah, it sounds like the same idea as the pizza place, but it's just hey, Rudy scooping ice cream. Now that's a good idea.

816
01:35:50,200 --> 01:36:03,200
No, don't steal. Rick, what's the honor among thieves even? You're going to steal Nick Valenti's idea. That's right. I'll steal his idea. I'm a fucking idiot.

817
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:07,200
Hold on. Hold on. They're fighting with each other. Fighting with each other.

818
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:35,200
I am from France. Hey, watch it, buddy. I don't care where the fuck you're from. Unless it's lower Manhattan, Wall Street, one percenters, you can suck my fat ass. Wait a minute. It's not going to take that lying down. He's probably going to be the shit out of you with his harmonica. Yeah. Does he have his trademark harmonica with him? He does. Nanu Nanu Nanu. I am from France. Who are you going to call?

819
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:54,200
I'd bears. Hey, what the fuck is this guy talking about? While they're distracted with each other, a jug of oat milk, a sparkling pink backpack filled with suckling pig, a boot that I can hop in from Sunook, a medium sized sculpin, a chocolate chip cookie pint glass filled with milkshake that has collapsed.

820
01:36:54,200 --> 01:37:09,200
Nothing because Ralph Brennan kicked our ass. An open skull container, a thin mint cookie bear filled with organ meat, a paddle, I think, a pitcher of sangria, our little Lego avatars that we've been carrying in our pockets this whole time. That's right.

821
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:30,200
A super sized party sized toasted Earl of Sandwich gobbler for the holiday. Randy Gerber's Casamigos tea. That's a big beefy tea. I don't like that one. And a hard hat from the unbuilt luxury hotel plus a sugar cookie bath bomb that the four of us have to split. Four of us have to split evenly.

822
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:44,200
Huh? Wow. That's an incredible amount. And I'm sure we can remember what all of them are without them all being presented really big in front of us in some way. Yeah, that's true. Well, Jason, get in the boot first. All right. I'm in the boot.

823
01:37:44,200 --> 01:38:03,200
Nick, put on this Casamigos beefy tea. Okay, I got it. It's barely fitting. That's right. It's thick and tight. And I will change into my other my alter ego, Micademus, the evil character from the void VR. Oh, that's right. Yes. Become Micademus.

824
01:38:03,200 --> 01:38:25,200
You can only do it with the magical song that imbues you with evil powers. Hey, look, he's dancing and kicking on the stairs in your apartment. I'm Micademus. Maybe I need to crank that pitcher of sangria.

825
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:35,200
Scott is just drinking the pitcher of sangria. Whoa, I feel good. I feel better than good. I feel incredibly violent. Yeah.

826
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:57,200
Oh, his muscles are bursting like Popeye. Popeye rules apply. I want to bash some skulls. I'm going to give a little to Lego Scott too. What do you think Lego Scott? I want to bash some skulls. Lego Scott just got jacked. Yeah, jacked as a Lego can be. Micademus, zap him with your electric energy. Yeah, here it is.

827
01:38:57,200 --> 01:39:22,200
Zap. Great. Oh, damn, that hurts. He can't move now. I'm going to bash. I'm expecting something more spectacular. No, I thought it was cool as hell, as cool as something in the void. Now I'm going to bash his brains in and when it's done, Jason, get in the boot and stomp on his brains until they turn to powder. Die, die, die, die, die. Fuck you, fuck off, bitch.

828
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:47,200
Remember, this is the sector keeper's body. Oh, that's right. Well, we'll figure out a way around that. Fuck, punch, punch. Sangria energy. I'll bring the sector keeper back by showing him his favorite brand of celebrity tequila. Look at my shirt. Look at my shirt. Oh, boys, boys, Casamigos, Casamigos. Oh, not so fast, little one.

829
01:39:47,200 --> 01:39:58,200
Jason, I'll have to hit him with this in his weak spot. Jason, wait. Fragile skull. I'll hop on him in my giant boot. No, not my sourdough skull.

830
01:39:58,200 --> 01:40:09,200
It's made of sourdough. That's right, because it's patched up. Don't forget, this is the sector keeper's body. Oh, that's right. I rebuilt it after I came. OK, OK, go for it, Jason. Mike, what were you going to say?

831
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:21,200
I was going to say, Jason, why are your clothes off? Yeah, why is this one naked? It's for aerodynamics, you fool. OK, fine. You can hop higher and faster. I can hop higher. Sorry, sector keeper.

832
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:39,200
That's right, boys. You did it. You did it. They're all gone. They're all dead. They're all burning in hell with Jeffrey Epstein and Joe Biden. I'm so proud of you boys. I can't believe you did it. Wow.

833
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:55,200
This was exhausting. This is an exhausting one, even harder than the city walk saga. I'm really proud of all of us. It was supposed to be 15 episodes. It became 18 episodes. You went to the underworld. And folks, if you haven't listened to that yet, I highly recommend going to Patreon.com slash podcast.

834
01:40:55,200 --> 01:41:10,200
Cast the ride. It's behind a paywall. But some of the best things in life are. Well, that's true. Yeah, I think you're going to say then free. I thought you were going to say to our free free. But also some of the best things are behind a paywall.

835
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:30,200
And folks, and don't forget, folks, to use the hashtag sector keeper cricket. Why are the severance? Wow. Wait a minute. So if we're done with this whole thing, doesn't isn't this where we finally get to meet the level keeper? We get to find out who the level keeper is.

I can't wait for you to come here and save my spirit by thoroughly discussing and reviewing our boot barn. They have lots of interesting types of boots.

862
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:58,200
Oh, you have a boot barn? We have a dress barn.

863
01:46:58,200 --> 01:47:01,200
Oh, does the dress barn carry boots? Because boot barn carries dresses.

864
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:07,200
I will reveal all once the boys have come to the outlet mall and recorded 20 episodes about it. See you soon, boys.

865
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:15,200
No, it just feels like there's a lot of overlap in the barn based retail segment. I'm just saying.

866
01:47:15,200 --> 01:47:18,200
You know, I like the banter between those keepers, honestly. I like that.

867
01:47:18,200 --> 01:47:23,200
Wow, boys, all the keepers from all over the world. Amazing.

868
01:47:23,200 --> 01:47:36,200
Listen, dude, you're pushing your luck. That is a lot of keepers. And if the implication is that every one of those keepers is another daily podcast, I don't care about your cut. You're cool. I like you, man.

869
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:44,200
But your cousins, why do I have to care? How many cousins do you have? They need help, Scott. Why do I have to care about all of them? They need help. They need help. They're all trapped.

870
01:47:44,200 --> 01:48:00,200
Well, I know you're well, you're Mr. Helping out veterans and show playstations and salvation already been. But like, I know you're a generous man. Maybe I'm a little bit stodgy. I'm just like, how many cousins could there possibly be? How many daily podcasts could we possibly have to do?

871
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:09,200
If you think about it in a way, all of us are cousins. Oh, amen to that, brother. I'll give that a big hearty for sure on that one.

872
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:21,200
I'm not doing that because that implies everyone like that by that logic. Now everyone's a keeper. We can do an episode about anything that's 10 miles away from an amusement park. These rules are getting so loose.

873
01:48:21,200 --> 01:48:29,200
What a slippery slope, folks. What I like about the end of this and Last Jedi is that now it sort of introduces the idea that anyone can be a keeper.

874
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:48,200
That's true. I mean, I was very inspired by that ending, but in this case, I don't know if I can go along with it. What if I were to tell you a lot of these establishments have bars that likely stock premium beverages, your crystal head vodka, your Casamigos tequila.

875
01:48:48,200 --> 01:49:00,200
No, that is the last thing I want to hear. How many more times do I need to hear about these people? This bear, this premium beverages in my house where I could stay. Well, think about all the good times we had.

876
01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:14,200
Sure. The city walk saga to the downtown Disney ordeal to the Mall of America or I'm not been there. I don't need to do it again. Well, Mike and I have been there.

877
01:49:14,200 --> 01:49:24,200
We've never been there. Let's do it. Is Mall of America spelled M-A-U-L of America? Oh, that's good. Yeah. That's pretty good. That's cool. Yeah.

878
01:49:24,200 --> 01:49:34,200
Are you stirring up a joke for later? Is that what that is? But when we do the series, you mean? Oh, that's what the series is called. Yeah, that's what the series is called. Yeah, it could be like Halloween time. Yeah, it'll be like spooky.

879
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:45,200
Because like the stores have to have decorations for Halloween. Absolutely. I'm kind of getting excited about this, honestly. Mall of America was also that was if I was still working at Funny or Die, I would have made that after Solo comes out.

880
01:49:45,200 --> 01:49:56,200
And then it would be like Darth Maul of America. Oh, yeah. Very good. Very good. Sure. Sure. For sure. It'd be like him. It could be like a green screen bit and it would be a guy in the Darth Maul mask. They just do a mask.

881
01:49:56,200 --> 01:50:08,200
The makeup would be too laborious. They just do a mask. I think I speak for everyone and I say, immortal. You think it would be immortal? You're voting that one immortal. The famous voting system of Funny or Die.

882
01:50:08,200 --> 01:50:30,200
Yeah. I mean, that's look, you're building on Mike's idea. This is great. I think like and your podcast empire is growing. Is there could we maybe arrange some sort of like tap out or trade? Nick, I would love if you took over my position as third host to podcast the right for all of these various events.

883
01:50:30,200 --> 01:50:44,200
I'm contractually linked to Doughboy's media, so I can't I can't. I mean, you can tell you can talk to Mike Mitchell, the president of the company. He might let me wiggle out, but I just I don't think it's going to be tenable. You do another podcast, though, as well.

884
01:50:44,200 --> 01:51:07,200
Yeah, that too. That one is well, see, here's the thing. That's an ear wolf podcast. So that's its own script. Another whole thing with script. Get into it with scripts. OK, well, I'll start that matches your personal politics perfectly. Yeah. Well, that's why I wanted to get into business with them. I'm a big scripts guy.

885
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:21,200
So I did. And until Sinclair owns a podcast network, I think scripts is the one I want to be with. Yeah, I'm going to start delving into your your legality. I'm going to I'm going to start poking around. You don't have to open them to look through your books and see if there's a way to slot.

886
01:51:21,200 --> 01:51:35,200
You would be open to it if I could slot you in as the new third host. I mean, I'm trying to say I'm trying to say no in a nice way. This is trying to give you I'm trying to say I'm trying to decline by prior commitments. OK, well,

887
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:57,200
I mean, I think you're going to be the king of pressure mall rocks. I mean, I like all of these places. I like the Mall of America, but enough is enough. And also, we're a couple of those guys, Jim Hill and Lynn Testa, the theme park podcasters,

888
01:51:57,200 --> 01:52:09,200
who are your cousins? Sound sounded a little to me like the host of Disney dish. I didn't say anything. I didn't notice that. Yeah, I guess I'm just hearing things. I'm just seeing things again.

889
01:52:09,200 --> 01:52:17,200
You're gaslighting me again. Like with Choco, I have a confession to make this entire time. I dropped the bath bomb in the boot.

890
01:52:17,200 --> 01:52:30,200
I filled the boot with the rest of the sink area and I've been soaking in the bath bomb and eating the chocolate chip cookie pint glass milkshake mess. Let's anyone think we didn't utilize every item.

891
01:52:30,200 --> 01:52:43,200
I have been enjoying myself. That was yeah, that was a narrative thread that was really going to bother people. Yeah, I mean, I was hoping that would pay off. So boys, boys, congratulations. Now you officially did it.

892
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:49,200
Yes, yes. All right. But all the Keeper stuff still stands. Yes, Scott, you still have to do.

893
01:52:49,200 --> 01:53:06,200
I, uh, Sector Keeper. I don't. Okay. Well, I guess it's settled, right? You'll go help all the Keepers. And now we go to downtown Disney for one last romp or we break into the AMC and we watch Good Boys and a bootlaid copy of Richard Jewell.

894
01:53:06,200 --> 01:53:22,200
That's right. That's right. And any funnier die parody sketches that get made surrounding this, uh, this film. You know what? I don't know how I feel about all of these, uh, these, these ordeals and sojourns and odysseys and whatever, but you round up all those cousins.

895
01:53:22,200 --> 01:53:33,200
We're all breaking into that movie theater together. Let's all be good boys together. Yeah, there we go. All right. Mike, first you have to go to Santa Fe.

896
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:49,200
Yeah. Yeah, I do. Okay. Well, I'll meet you guys. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Veterans aren't invited. They don't get to come. Oh yeah. They could come. Right. Mike. Yeah. So quick stop for a good boy screening. Yeah. Santa Fe. It might. The humor might offend them though.

897
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:59,200
Yeah, possibly. We don't know. Yeah. Might defend us. It's a little body. It's I that's what I've heard is body. Yeah. But sometimes it's good to be body.

898
01:53:59,200 --> 01:54:19,200
That's true. All right. We don't have to commit to a date on any of this shit. Do we? Um, a couple of them had dates in there. Yeah. Year wise. I think we can all agree. There's going to be at least one per year for many years. And I think like Marvel movies, like they're eventually there's going to have to be like starting to do two or three per year.

899
01:54:19,200 --> 01:54:40,200
And like TV shows, little mini ones. Well, this is the point where just to keep up, we are just going to need other hosts and perhaps entirely different replacement hosts. Sure. Well, you can interview your replacement, I guess. Oh, if I do it. And if the sector keeper approves and says that he's Scott-esque enough to take over, then maybe I've got a way out of this.

900
01:54:40,200 --> 01:55:09,200
As long as the interview is an episode that we put out. Yeah, for sure. All right. Fair enough. It's all it's all content. Okay. I'll wrap my head around this mentally, but we've all survived the downtown Disney ordeal. Wow. Wow. Holy shit. Nick Weiger, you survived the downtown Disney ordeal. Thanks for all your help. What a treat. I was going to add a thing I'd loaded up about an hour ago about this episode's length comparing to the runtime of good boys.

901
01:55:09,200 --> 01:55:18,200
But now I think I could just say like just compare the third act of this episode to the runtime of good boys.

902
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:34,200
Most of them. Yeah. Yes. Well, we everybody has Irishman fever. We're getting close to Irishman runtime. Yeah. Well, thanks for bearing with it. Thank you. Thanks for having me. Is there anything you want to play?

903
01:55:34,200 --> 01:55:55,200
You know, check out check out the podcast dough boys podcast about chain restaurants. We also do a lot of dumb shit like this. And then also check out my video game podcast. How did this get played? It's me and Heather and Campbell and review bad video games. Yeah. Yeah. Great podcasts that are sure to run their course soon. And you're going to need another podcast to jump on.

904
01:55:55,200 --> 01:56:21,200
I'm trying to kind of get out of phase out of podcasting. I feel you know kind of like TikTok is the new thing. And me and Sheridan are doing pretty well over there. So for sure. Wow. For sure. For sure. Let's see. We need we need one. We need one more instinct. The classic the boys. All right. We'll give it to you. It's usually behind a paywall. We'll do it. For sure. Hell yeah. Thanks for listening everybody. So long. For sure.
