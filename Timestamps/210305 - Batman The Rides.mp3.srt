1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:11,120
Warning, the following podcast contains Telethon Joker, Zips, Bangs and Pows, and gushing Batman

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,080
Forever praise.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,880
Podcasters by nature are a cowardly and superstitious lot.

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,680
It's Batman the Rides on today's podcast, The Ride.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:47,920
Welcome to Podcast The Ride where we say, hold me, thrill me, kiss me, thrill me again

8
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,200
on a themed experience, please.

9
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,200
My name is Mike Carlson.

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,000
Joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,920
I can't get it out of my head.

12
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,360
I can't get the song out of my head.

13
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:04,080
I watched the music video shortly before we were recording and my jaw dropped.

14
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,760
Yes, Jason put this in my head.

15
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,160
No one had a really catchy thing to say.

16
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,120
So I just had this wonderful Batman song from Batman Forever in my head.

17
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,960
Scott Gardner is here as well.

18
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:21,040
Yeah, I think we're going to have more fun than a kiss from a rose on the gray.

19
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,360
When you get more fun than when you get kissed on the gray.

20
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,520
And don't forget that that's what's being said.

21
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,280
People don't believe it when you tell them the gray.

22
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,640
It is the gray.

23
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,840
Do we know what he means?

24
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,400
What seal meant by the gray?

25
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,400
Don't think we do.

26
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,400
Do we not?

27
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:49,240
Like just the gray of the of your life of the night of smoke and an ash and a rose is

28
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:55,320
colorful so it like kisses its way through and creates joy.

29
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,760
That's very beautiful by the way what you just said.

30
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,880
It might be more thought than was put into the song.

31
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,680
I don't want to give seal little credit or no credit.

32
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,040
Maybe he has the same sort of thought.

33
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,600
But we're talking Batman in the theme parks today.

34
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,080
All theme parks.

35
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,040
A very wide topic.

36
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,040
Yeah.

37
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,400
There's a lot.

38
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,520
Am I correct that the episode is going to be called Batman the rides plural?

39
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,520
Pluralized.

40
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,520
Oh, that's good.

41
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,080
I had not considered that.

42
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,680
That's what's been in my head.

43
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,080
Batman the ride, which you might look at first glance and think that we are talking about

44
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,480
the roller coaster that's been at Six Flags since the 90s.

45
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,640
That's a stalwart of Six Flags.

46
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,080
And certainly we will talk about that.

47
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,000
However, it's more it's rides.

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,240
There are a lot of Batman rides out there.

49
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,160
But do any of them really scratch the itch?

50
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,160
That is the question.

51
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,880
And I think that's what we're going to try to get into today.

52
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:56,920
And let's be clear, just everyone's screaming at their pod catching device.

53
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:02,440
Batman the ride is different from Batman Adventure dash the ride and Batman Adventure dash the

54
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,440
ride to the right.

55
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,340
And not all of the Batman the rides are the same ride.

56
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,320
There are things called Batman the ride that are a completely different type of roller

57
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,320
coaster.

58
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,880
But we'll get to that too.

59
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,480
We know that Batman the ride encompasses different things.

60
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,480
Of course.

61
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,480
Yes.

62
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:27,480
There are like there are villains represented with their own rides in the Batman universe.

63
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:33,440
This is very rare to have like an IP like this to have so many different things in different

64
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,160
parts of the world and different types of parks.

65
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,600
Different characters have their own rides.

66
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,400
I mean, obviously it happens in Disney, but that's Disneyland.

67
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,320
It's not Batman land.

68
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,960
You know, it's not a specific Batman land.

69
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,000
That would make sense there.

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,680
But there are so much.

71
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,520
Completely different eras of Batman are represented.

72
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,320
There's like this is clearly Nolan.

73
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,040
This is clearly Burton.

74
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,600
This is clearly nothing.

75
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,040
This is just like Batman generic.

76
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,200
This is like could be any Batman.

77
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,040
And then there's ones that aren't covered whatsoever.

78
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,720
It's a big messy array.

79
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,720
Yeah.

80
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,680
The dream of Batman forever is alive at Magic Mountain in California.

81
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,320
There's so much Batman forever.

82
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,680
I think we said this on that episode with Anthony Geo.

83
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,040
The font of Batman forever is everywhere.

84
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,920
And I hope it lasts forever because that font, I have such nostalgia for it.

85
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:32,040
But the Riddler's Revenge coaster that's there is obviously Batman forever with the those

86
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:37,880
like blender type things that Nigma puts on people's heads to steal their thoughts.

87
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,280
You know, so it's so interesting.

88
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,560
So it's such a mishmash.

89
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,200
It's just sort of by like grace of like whenever something was built, it's now stuck in that

90
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,800
era of Batman forever and Batman forever.

91
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,000
Not the movie Batman forever.

92
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,600
Batman in all of eternity is what I'm saying.

93
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,760
There's another one too, which is that there's Batman night flight, which is too different.

94
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,000
Too completely different.

95
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,120
There's one that's in a Six Flags and one that's in Dubai that's like an immersive Harry

96
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,120
Potter type ride.

97
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,400
And the other Batman night flight is just a coaster.

98
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,280
There's so much confusion.

99
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,040
You're going to need a chart for this one.

100
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,040
And you know what?

101
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,240
I think that's all beautiful.

102
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:25,760
I think the chaos of that adds to the character of Batman in the parks.

103
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,280
And even I think it's more necessity is the mother of invention.

104
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:36,440
I believe the current DC Comics thinking is because Warner Brothers seems to really want

105
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,920
to desperately stop publishing comic books.

106
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,760
It seems like the current line of thinking, you know, there's a lot of crises to try and

107
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,880
justify like decades and decades of comic book.

108
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,080
Like, well, how did he do this?

109
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:56,000
If he did that, the current line of thinking seems to be it all happened.

110
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,960
It all counts.

111
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,720
Don't worry about it.

112
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,160
And that's kind of what Batman in the parks is like too.

113
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,160
Yes.

114
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,160
Yeah.

115
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,160
All the areas existed.

116
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:12,240
There are artifacts now in the real world of all these eras of Batman or Batman, Batman,

117
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,240
whatever.

118
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,240
And yeah, they're all part of canon.

119
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,320
They're all part of theme park canon, which of course is our most important canon on this

120
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,320
show.

121
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,320
Yeah, absolutely.

122
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:26,080
Which makes it if you are like viewing this in a galaxy's edge fashion, where if we're

123
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,960
holding things to the standard of there's a consistent story, like how do I write?

124
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,080
What how does the Batman theme park canon work?

125
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,080
It makes no sense.

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It just does it.

127
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,360
It doesn't work because you're not so many of them are just like, wow, I'm in the Riddler's

128
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,640
lair.

129
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,560
And then I go on a roller coaster after that.

130
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,920
There's not a lot of consistent storytelling.

131
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:56,740
The Riddler's revenge is to send me and have a good time.

132
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,240
The Riddler's revenge is me enjoying myself.

133
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,960
That's what his revenge is.

134
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,560
I get to have a fun time where wind blows in my face and I go at a high speed.

135
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,240
Yeah, it doesn't it doesn't really make sense.

136
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,840
You know, the history of any of these characters that have been around for a long time don't

137
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,720
make sense in general.

138
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,400
Batman I think is very flexible, probably the most flexible character in the sense that

139
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:28,960
he can be dumb, stupid, he can be fascist Frank Miller Batman, he can be Adam West Batman,

140
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,480
and it all works.

141
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,600
So it really it does.

142
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:37,680
It makes sense that the properties are like the Batman properties are like this, where

143
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,280
there's just no logic really when you look at the whole thing as a whole, you know, 80

144
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,400
or whatever, how long 40 years of Batman rides, whatever it is.

145
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,640
I guess you're going back.

146
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,800
Are you starting from 92 in your mind?

147
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,800
Yeah, I guess that's all right.

148
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
I guess I can't do math.

149
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,240
I guess that's more like 30 years.

150
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,720
Yeah, still quite a while.

151
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,120
Let me throw down this this blanket statement.

152
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,920
Why I think, you know, we've certainly talked about all this over the years leading up to

153
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,580
this episode.

154
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:11,720
But this is I was trying to encapsulate what is my thinking and what I think how do I think

155
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:17,980
I explain the like the disappointment maybe of where Batman lies in theme park world and

156
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:21,280
tell me if you agree or disagree with this statement.

157
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:29,680
I think that Batman is the biggest American pop culture property that doesn't have a huge,

158
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:36,840
immersive, technically innovative ride in America and ticket type ride.

159
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:42,120
Now I'm overlooking some of the international stuff by saying this and international properties

160
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,240
and IP.

161
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:49,360
But can you think of anything that, you know, tops Batman in terms of like pop culture,

162
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,240
the reverence we have for it and that it isn't represented in like an Indiana Jones

163
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,400
adventure rise the resistance kind of way?

164
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,240
No, I mean, he's like the most popular superhero, I think still.

165
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,240
I don't know.

166
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,500
Maybe maybe it's slightly different these days.

167
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:08,000
But I think we're already talking about like having three Batman movies a year, different

168
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,240
Batman.

169
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,560
Like we're going to have so many versions of Batman now going at the same time.

170
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:19,760
We'll have Michael Keaton, Batman, maybe Zack Snyder, Affleck, Batman, the Robert Pattinson

171
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,800
Batman Lego Lego Lego Batman's going on.

172
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,840
And then there's the animated movies they've been making like TV shows which go in and

173
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,840
out.

174
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,400
There's one right now.

175
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,400
I don't even know.

176
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,960
There's probably like four animated ones.

177
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:42,200
We don't even know if you go to HBO Max and type in Batman, you are good for a month.

178
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:49,240
You are just set of every level of quality, every level of of era of.

179
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:57,760
Yeah, whatever you want is there, including like meet Scooby Doo or meet the Ninja Turtles.

180
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,760
This is one of those, I believe he met the Ninja Turtles.

181
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,480
Yeah, there's a rumor that the animated series is going to come back soon.

182
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,040
They're going to just do that again.

183
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,880
Wow. I don't know if that's true or not.

184
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,360
Yes, he's so popular.

185
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,000
The character has lasted forever.

186
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,040
And it was what I was saying.

187
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,160
He's like very flexible.

188
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,280
You know, you can put him in a lot of different tones and it works.

189
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:28,320
And yet to not have like a Spider-Man Islands of Adventure style attraction for him is crazy.

190
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,000
Yeah, it's really crazy if you think about it.

191
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,720
I mean, it makes Superman two should have something like that.

192
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:41,360
But Batman is, you know, more popular than Superman because we like a sexy billionaire

193
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,960
versus like a humble farm boy who just wants to help.

194
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,920
You know, we are all we all have like we like our Tony Stark's and our Bruce Wayne's.

195
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,160
We like our Elon Musk's in this country.

196
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:59,480
We don't like humble newspaper man who's just trying to do his best and live a nice life.

197
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,280
We like Jim Acosta.

198
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,480
Is that what you mean?

199
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,160
We need more Jim Acosta worship and less Elon Musk worship in this country.

200
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,560
That's what I'm saying.

201
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:16,520
Can I also I don't want to sidetrack too much, but I was just trying to go is this is what I'm saying

202
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:22,320
literally true that there is not a property bigger than Batman without a theme park presence.

203
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,200
And I did I looked at like a Wikipedia of the most successful franchise.

204
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,600
There is one. Can we think of and it's and this is apparently the biggest.

205
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,680
This is bigger than anything. Disney is bigger than Mario.

206
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:37,760
There is something that is that it does not have a permanent theme park presence.

207
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,560
Do you have any James James Bond?

208
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,480
James Bond? No, that's a good one, though.

209
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,960
There is not really is that there's very little James Bond in the little stuff.

210
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,320
What I'm thinking at like teen Asian, I'll tell you.

211
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,080
Huh? Is it like Tintin?

212
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,520
No, no. From another country or

213
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,000
a land before land before time to the Beethoven.

214
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,560
Beethoven's third Sandlot.

215
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,640
Anything? Oh, the air buddies, the air bud movies.

216
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,840
Well, there should be. Those are like 10 of those.

217
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,600
Really be air buddies attractions.

218
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,600
Is it SpongeBob?

219
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,800
No, and even that would care.

220
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,640
There is that right. There is some presence. Yeah.

221
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,560
Pokemon is what we are. Oh, of course.

222
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,960
Pokemon is bigger in terms of profits than like anything else.

223
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,720
And there is not a committed.

224
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,160
There was apparently some traveling theme park called Poke Park for a while.

225
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,360
But there has never been like a like this is the committed,

226
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,840
which that seems kind of crazy.

227
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,360
And you wonder if that'll work its way into Universal and Nintendo.

228
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,640
Yeah, that's got to be on the plan.

229
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,640
That's got to be in the next because they're doing Donkey Kong in Phase

230
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,160
two and in Japan.

231
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,080
So I had imagined that Pokemon is coming next or fourth.

232
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,960
Who knows? Gotta be. Yeah, it has to be soon. Yeah.

233
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,160
Maybe Lord of the Rings close also.

234
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,320
That's the only other possible competitor.

235
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,120
But I don't I still don't feel like.

236
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,080
And again, there are Batman rides, of course.

237
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,320
But you know what I'm saying? There isn't. Yes. Yes.

238
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,240
Here it is. The Batman ride.

239
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,320
Lord of the Rings is still mega popular, and this is only anecdotal.

240
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,760
But it's like my mom likes Batman stuff.

241
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,040
And it's like Lord of the Rings is like, oh, she knows what it is.

242
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,440
But it's like I feel like Batman's a little bit more universal in the sense

243
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,280
there's at least one version of Batman you were having.

244
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,600
You had a lot of affection for it a certain part in your life

245
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,520
versus Lord of the Rings, which has had the movies.

246
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,600
But that's only in the last.

247
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,880
I can't do math. 25 years, 50 years.

248
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,560
The first one to come out in 1998, 50 years ago.

249
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,640
It's like entirely about those movies and Peter Jackson, as opposed to like

250
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,200
that there's like you are there.

251
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,560
What are there five eras of Batman just in movies that people are

252
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,000
very passionate about all of them?

253
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,680
Yeah. And then say on the 60s show for people that were young

254
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,560
and old at that time was a big deal and people loved it.

255
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:01,760
And that still looms large and is still, you know, the best show ever made.

256
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,080
Still. Well, yeah, it's fantastic.

257
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:09,720
So, yeah, I think that it has to be that just from just from the fact that like

258
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,200
everyone in America has to have like, well, yeah, I liked Batman Returns.

259
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,720
I saw that. That was good.

260
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,560
Yeah. Versus I don't think Lord of the Rings is quite there,

261
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,800
but it's something that is just completely out on it as opposed to.

262
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,200
But as I said, there are of course there are Batman attraction.

263
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,640
Does anybody have a more accurate count than I have?

264
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,960
I counted 22 separate

265
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,920
Batman related ride premises and then an additional two

266
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,160
based on the Justice League.

267
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,480
But I could be wrong. I might be missing a bunch, but there's at least.

268
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,720
So if we're counting Justice League 24.

269
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,760
Yeah, that's like the count, I think, on the Wikipedia

270
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,560
of it, because the Wikipedia lists all the rides.

271
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,040
I'm sure there's little shows and things that they're not counting. Yeah.

272
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,680
Because they do have stunt shows,

273
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,120
but then they don't have like the street misfit or show.

274
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,200
They do it. The Dubai world.

275
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,720
On this list, that's not tracked by Wikipedia.

276
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,920
The Dubai street.

277
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:15,040
For some reason, the show where the Joker picks someone out of the audience

278
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,400
in Dubai and goofs on him is not on this list.

279
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,640
Oh, I'm excited to learn.

280
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,760
So there's stuff. Yeah, there's stuff not here.

281
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,880
Yeah. So that's about right.

282
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,600
But I'm sure there's an actually very specific number.

283
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,720
Yeah. That somebody is mad at us now because they knew it already.

284
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,760
Well, it fluctuates so much because some of these are closed.

285
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:41,600
I've got some that are like, and these all closed or these all closed in this year.

286
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,400
There's one.

287
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:48,960
There's a coaster that I myself experienced that did not last super long,

288
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,080
unlike the original Batman, the ride,

289
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,040
which that I will say at its time.

290
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,920
I let's maybe we should just get into this.

291
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,680
Is this the first one?

292
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,480
Batman, the ride notable for a number of reasons.

293
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:11,800
First, open that Magic Mountain in 1992, then Great Adventure in 1993,

294
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,800
and then just down the list of Six Flags parks.

295
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,400
They put it everywhere seemingly.

296
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,200
The first notable for being the first inverted roller coaster.

297
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,600
The first your little little footsies are dangling off the coaster.

298
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,640
The track is above you.

299
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:34,200
This is different from a suspended coaster, like, say, the big bad wolf

300
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,960
in Busch Gardens, where the there's a car.

301
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,560
You're in a car that's dangling below the track.

302
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:44,520
But this right BNM coaster developed with Six Flags

303
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,720
was that technically was a technological innovation

304
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,360
at its time and had a big property.

305
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,080
You know, it's 1992.

306
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,280
It's a few years after the first in Burton Batman.

307
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,640
It's the same summer

308
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,000
that Batman returns opens.

309
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,560
That was also 92, I believe.

310
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,360
Can I can I correct you and say that I think I believe Great America

311
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,080
was the first one.

312
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,000
What did I say?

313
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,600
Adventure is second. Great Amer.

314
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,520
Wait, it did.

315
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,840
We went Great America, Great Adventure, Magic Mountain, evidently.

316
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,680
And Great America is was Mike's.

317
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,040
Oh, you're right.

318
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,160
I can never. Sorry.

319
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,080
Great America and Great Adventure.

320
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:29,600
This is another one of these thin parses of a theme park name

321
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,480
that I can never remember.

322
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,880
But that's but that's yours, though.

323
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,720
Yeah, Great America was mine.

324
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,680
I remember this commercial coming on TV and like Batman, the ride.

325
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,160
Yeah, I was very excited at first.

326
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,920
And then I saw a dangling legs coaster.

327
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,320
And I was like, I'll never ride that.

328
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,200
I never never go on this.

329
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,080
And I'll be very honest with the audience.

330
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,480
I still have not been on a Batman ride.

331
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,880
I've been on a Batman ride coaster,

332
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,640
but I've not been on the Batman, the ride ever in my life.

333
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,920
Wow. I am.

334
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,720
I will. I would do it now.

335
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,760
But as we've said before, I don't like dangling legs.

336
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,040
It scares me. Sure.

337
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,840
It just feels it feels unsecure.

338
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,200
I feel like my leg is going to get caught on something.

339
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,920
You know, well, this is one of the rides that has killed somebody.

340
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:24,000
Somebody did die not on the ride, but like it was.

341
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,240
This was the one where somebody snuck into an area they weren't supposed to be in.

342
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,160
And then a train went by, which led to the thing where the Six Flags

343
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,800
CEO or whatever is saying this very gravely in front of a dancing octopus.

344
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,640
So there is a danger to it.

345
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,000
So you're you're trying to scare me further.

346
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,720
I guess so. Going on it.

347
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,840
You're going to hurt some kid at this point.

348
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,800
I remember this is a time.

349
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,400
How old am I? I can math here.

350
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,200
I was 31 when this came out.

351
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,480
No, I was eight, I guess.

352
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,160
Yeah, I was eight when this started.

353
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,360
I had not seen the first two Batman Michael Keaton movies

354
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,000
because my mom thought they were too scary for me.

355
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,560
And she I guess she just she went to see Batman Returns.

356
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,880
I remember with her friend and came back and was like, you can't see that.

357
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,560
She didn't say it's because the penguin is too horny.

358
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,160
And I will not allow you to watch that.

359
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,240
But I bet that was part of she might not remember.

360
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,720
That's why. But if you watch the movie now, you go,

361
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,280
the penguin is too horny for a young child to watch.

362
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,280
Like they do not need to see this man do this.

363
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,480
I'd be more I just wouldn't let a kid watch it almost more out of the

364
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,840
the various Biles and.

365
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,880
Yeah, the black blood is scared me.

366
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,560
I never saw any of these in theaters until Batman Begins.

367
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,080
I don't think I saw really you didn't see the other.

368
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,840
Whoa. But I had all the toys.

369
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,480
Yeah. At least Batman Returns.

370
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,880
I don't think I maybe I had a little from Batman forever.

371
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,120
I that's interesting.

372
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,480
I saw I saw a clip.

373
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,360
I remember we were walking in a mall in like 1990 or 91

374
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,000
and some some store was playing a clip of Batman, the 89 Michael Keaton,

375
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,280
Jack Nicholson version.

376
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,880
And it's the scene where jokers put the makeup over his white face.

377
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,960
Oh, I like he has skin tone.

378
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,120
And then she throws the water at him and he pretends that like acid is burning him.

379
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,720
And then he like takes his hands away and he like scares her

380
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,920
because it's like half white, half skin tone.

381
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:21,160
I got so scared from just like standing with my like

382
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,080
hands on the glass of like a video store.

383
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,800
And I remember like running away from the store.

384
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,120
I was so afraid of Jack Nicholson and that thing.

385
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,720
And I remember going, yes, my mother is correct.

386
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,320
This is not a movie I should be watching.

387
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,560
I am not ready to handle this.

388
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,280
So I was not ready for the bride.

389
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,520
I was not ready for those movies.

390
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,920
I think it was the fact that I was young and scared

391
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,920
and that my brother was three years younger than me.

392
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,800
So even more young and scared.

393
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:53,920
So the first two Tim Burton movie, Tim Burton, Batman movies off the table.

394
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,560
Yes.

395
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,480
Batman, I don't know why we didn't see Batman forever in Batman and Robin.

396
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,680
I swear I did not see those in theaters.

397
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,760
For whatever reason, my middle school got a hold of a copy of Batman

398
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:12,240
and Robin on VHS and teachers would put it on on fun days.

399
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:17,440
And I was very into Batman at the time, but I was very serious Batman.

400
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,280
And I thought Batman and Robin was very ridiculous.

401
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,840
You were mad at it.

402
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,240
I was mad at it.

403
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,360
Yeah, I didn't really remember much of clips from Batman forever,

404
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:32,440
but I rewatched it a couple of days ago and I was just the mind boggles.

405
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,520
That movie is really something I see.

406
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,880
I had a great time.

407
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,920
This is what we were trying to avoid when we started doing this episode.

408
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,600
We put a stopwatch on it.

409
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,520
You're going to really have to because right now, Jason's I'm itching.

410
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,360
I'm itching to talk about the movies.

411
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,000
I just want to talk.

412
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,760
I think the biggest thing was the Chase Meridian, the hoardiest

413
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,360
character in fiction.

414
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,440
Well, for the first half of the movie.

415
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,280
And then they remember they made her a psychiatrist and they're like,

416
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,800
oh, we should have her do some psychiatry, make her go like,

417
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,600
your dreams, your dreams are telling me something, Bruce.

418
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,680
Like I saw Batman forever and loved it.

419
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,120
We saw it. I loved it.

420
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,680
I was obsessed with it.

421
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,840
And this is going to this is too personal and I will keep this as clean as I can.

422
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,440
I the one of the first memories I have of like

423
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,680
any sort of feeling amorous was watching this movie.

424
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,040
I'm you've said this, but I'm very confident.

425
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:32,440
If you haven't said it before on the show, you've said it to us in person

426
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,360
upwards every time we've ever been together. Yeah. Yeah.

427
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,080
Did you guys know that when I saw Batman forever, I sort of felt like an

428
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,440
like, you know, those urges you do when you're in your like formative years.

429
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,000
But why did you call me at two in the morning to say that?

430
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,520
Oh, I just thought I hadn't told you about it yet.

431
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,720
I just thought I just thought you should know.

432
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,440
You've never called me before for any reason.

433
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,080
Yeah, no, but I just I just kind of came across my mind

434
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,760
in the middle of the night and I felt like,

435
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,840
yeah, no, but the whole movie, everything about it,

436
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,040
Jim Carrey was the hottest actor at the time.

437
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,280
I thought he was the funniest guy.

438
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,880
I had just seen The Fugitive, I think, on video cassette.

439
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,240
I like Tommy Lee Jones.

440
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,840
Oh, Jim Carrey, every element of his game, like at the top.

441
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,760
Yes. Height of his like success.

442
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:25,400
And and let's not forget the McDonald's glasses, the cups,

443
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,720
the glasses that were like I still have.

444
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,120
We still have them at my parents' house.

445
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:35,040
It's like two face carved into glass is coins or the handle.

446
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,320
Some of the finest glassware I've ever seen.

447
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,720
They've lasted the test of time alone.

448
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,440
Oh, I can't even I can't say enough about those glasses.

449
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,640
OK, but back to Batman, the ride back to the bird.

450
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:53,040
If we have to, because Batman, the ride is so Tim Burton, Batman.

451
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:59,400
And, you know, the coaster was, as I said, the first inverted roller coaster.

452
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:04,520
And it also I have to give it a lot of credit because I think Batman, the ride

453
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:10,400
and its surrounding like Q and stuff is a great demonstration of like a lit.

454
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,520
If you if you don't have a lot of money or I mean,

455
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,920
I guess they had a good amount of money.

456
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,600
But if you don't have Disney or Universal level budgets for theme parks,

457
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,480
Batman forever, you if you Batman, the ride.

458
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,760
Sorry, you got better.

459
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,440
Forever is on the. Oh, God.

460
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,440
It's like Nigma put his machine right on.

461
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,880
Oh, my God.

462
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,240
Too hard. The pull of the movie is too great.

463
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:36,760
The theming for six weeks, the theming of Batman, the ride is pretty good.

464
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,440
There's a beat up cop car.

465
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,600
There's like pipes.

466
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,360
There's it's very industrial.

467
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,400
That probably helps that you can buy pipes and concrete very surely.

468
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,520
Beat up cop cars.

469
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,200
The news that was those big statues in the front statues.

470
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,960
And like you enter through like a base chemical plant kind of.

471
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,080
There's a there's a Batman suit in some of them.

472
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,520
And I the Gotham City music.

473
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,480
I mean, it probably helps to have Danny Elfman music and

474
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,640
Prince music at your disposal.

475
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,840
That probably helps your scene.

476
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,480
Do they still or is that still what you're hearing today?

477
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,760
If you go there or do they now just plan like rock from eight years ago?

478
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,200
Like what have they kept up?

479
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,280
The theming is mostly playing the greatest hits of the fray

480
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,880
in there or a vertical horizon.

481
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,480
Yeah, some 41.

482
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,960
Yeah. Fat lip by some 41 on a loop.

483
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,880
Dan and Dan down, Dan and I'm down.

484
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,520
I actually don't know that. That's a good question.

485
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,800
I would hope that they are still doing that because that at least

486
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,600
music is so important and soundtrack is so important.

487
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,920
I think we were talking about in our Jurassic Quest Patreon,

488
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,960
just having a soundtrack can do 50 percent,

489
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,000
25 percent of the work of a themed experience.

490
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,600
Yeah. I would hope at least that great Danny Elfman Batman theme

491
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,360
is in there, if not Party Man or Bat Dance, which is

492
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,680
we should talk about at length at a certain point, too.

493
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:10,680
I remember when I went a few times in the span of a few years in high school,

494
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:15,840
I just remember that song like in Gotham City, like kind of like a ballad

495
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,640
song about. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

496
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,520
Are you talking about the R. Kelly song?

497
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,040
No. Yeah. Oh, yes, you are.

498
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,880
I think you are, my friend.

499
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,520
My friend, you're talking about artists.

500
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,200
I didn't know there was an art.

501
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,360
You are talking about the Batman and Robin song.

502
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,120
It's from that movie.

503
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:38,600
And it's R. Kelly and they were you're if you want me to do a chorus,

504
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,320
it's City of Justice, City of Love,

505
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,880
City of People, Home to Everyone.

506
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,080
Oh, my God. I forgot.

507
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,720
We all need it.

508
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,120
Can't live without it.

509
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,360
Gotham City.

510
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,840
Oh, yeah.

511
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,000
Well, that's what they're playing in 2001.

512
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,240
Well, that's not as good.

513
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,120
Turned yet. Yeah. Yeah.

514
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,440
That's not quite as good.

515
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,000
That song makes no sense.

516
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
That's not what Gotham City is like.

517
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,360
It does not reflect.

518
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:12,800
It's almost as if he didn't learn anything about what Gotham City is like

519
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,520
to make the song Gotham City.

520
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,480
I think that that's a strong possibility.

521
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,680
Yes. That song makes no, absolutely no sense.

522
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,320
But they were they were going to try to get a big hit, I think.

523
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,320
I don't know if it was a mild hit. I'm not sure.

524
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,120
I don't I get cannabis.

525
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,680
They like pushed it to where we thought it was a hit.

526
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,600
There was a similar bad one for Ali called The World's Greatest.

527
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,480
It was like a ballad about being a boxer.

528
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,760
These were not this is why like, all right, guess what?

529
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,360
You can't listen to R. Kelly anymore.

530
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,720
Sounds good to me.

531
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,760
Yeah, I'm not going to miss the world's greatest.

532
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,720
That no problem.

533
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,120
Yeah, yeah.

534
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,520
But I mean, nothing can touch Kiss from a Rose

535
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,040
as far as like a big Batman ballad.

536
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,040
Even I even I like Hold Me Thrilled Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me a Lot,

537
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,880
which I referenced earlier.

538
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,240
But now that was not a hit like Kiss from a Rose.

539
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,760
That is not culturally lasted.

540
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,200
I think the DNA of the Spider-Man musical you could hear in

541
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,680
Hold Me Thrilled Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me. Oh, I've I've yes.

542
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,200
I think I've brought up that on this podcast before that.

543
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,160
Yeah, yeah. They've yeah.

544
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,680
I think that's probably other than a freak like me, the best,

545
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,240
a better song than most of the Spider-Man soundtrack, honestly.

546
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,800
But that's it. We can't talk about the star.

547
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,920
The highest part is the compliment I can give.

548
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,520
It's a song.

549
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,200
It's better than the Spider-Man turn off the dark soundtrack.

550
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,880
It is better than you're welcome for that compliment.

551
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,160
Yeah. So the other thing that sticks out,

552
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,400
some other stuff that sticks out in my mind about Batman, the ride.

553
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,080
I'm going to show you guys an image.

554
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,680
This image, they got so much marketing material out of this loop.

555
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,240
I remember as a still image and as footage.

556
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:58,080
Six Flags used this for years and years in at least

557
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,040
in great adventure advertising, I think in everywhere advertising.

558
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,080
Right. It is very familiar.

559
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,880
I think it's a more confident choice than this marketing

560
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,720
they were going with at the time.

561
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,680
Six Flags Great Adventure, bigger than Disneyland and closer to home.

562
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,680
There's an yeah, there's an ad I saw where they go,

563
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:23,800
hey, Disneyland is great, but hey, you can't always go there.

564
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,520
So it's a whole thing.

565
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,920
It's a whole thing.

566
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:32,680
And that that ad, they have to put fine print on that Astroworld is not bigger

567
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,880
except Astroworld at the bottom of the screen.

568
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,440
Literally undercuts it.

569
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,640
It does undercut it.

570
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,080
And then like it's always closer.

571
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,200
They say it's like closer to home to and they like show the map

572
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,080
where all the six flags are.

573
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,400
And I'm like looking and I'm like there's several states where

574
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,560
there's not a very close one, not a very just because there's

575
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,480
like 10 of them and not two.

576
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,880
And the other thing they bury the lead on,

577
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,680
if you look at this operating character, you'll notice

578
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,360
operating calendar is closed

579
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,840
for six months of the year.

580
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,760
Six Flags Great Adventure and I see that.

581
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,640
Yeah. All of March, all of March.

582
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:14,560
You could not go there during that time and buy this shirt of Batman perched.

583
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,600
Oh, man.

584
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,200
Oh, I love that.

585
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,560
That's probably worth a hundred.

586
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,640
I don't know. This is a side note.

587
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,560
But do you know these old Batman, like comic shirts are worth hundreds of dollars now?

588
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,200
This, I think, is 50 or 70.

589
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,680
That's not bad.

590
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,400
That's not bad.

591
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,720
Vintage comic book shirts now from like our childhood that are worth like 800.

592
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:38,160
Like a full Magneto face T-shirt is worth like two grand.

593
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,840
If it's in decent shape, it's crazy.

594
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,960
Great Velcro wallet here for Batman.

595
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,800
Hey, did we all have Velcro wallets as kids?

596
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,520
Multiple. Yeah.

597
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,840
Yeah, I think so.

598
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,840
Maybe even with it might have even had a Mickey Mouse one.

599
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,760
If you can believe it.

600
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,960
I had a baseball one, believe it or not.

601
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,640
I know that's a character baseball.

602
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,000
It was like blue and I like just a baseball on it.

603
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,400
Wow. It's the idea of baseball.

604
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,880
It's so funny because it's kids carrying wallets is just like you're pretending.

605
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,360
It's like you have a five dollar bill in there and that's it.

606
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,600
Yeah. What do we put in them?

607
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,320
A photo of Dr. Chase Meridian.

608
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:20,560
Well, I had a full fold out wallet like, yeah, your kids in there and it was just

609
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,880
Chase meeting Batman on the rooftop.

610
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,600
Chase meeting Batman on the street.

611
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,800
They're centerfold, but fully clothed.

612
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,880
Right. Chase from the promo shots that were in the soundtrack I owned.

613
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:38,680
I bought a Nickelodeon Velcro wallet at King's Dominion

614
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,800
and then proceeded to place the dollar I had left

615
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:47,400
into the wallet because I had spent the rest of my money on the wallet.

616
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,080
And so that's something.

617
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,280
And then when I started to get into like eight, I think when I turned eighth grade,

618
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:58,400
I was like, I need a different wallet and got like a surf company,

619
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,760
like just a blue canvas like Velcro wallet.

620
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:06,560
That sounds like that's the choice you made at that time for us in the late 90s.

621
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,160
Yeah. Well, how do I dress cool?

622
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,600
These people are wearing a shirt with like a wave on it.

623
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,440
Great. Am I cool now? No. Yeah, great.

624
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:19,840
But yeah, I, you know, I don't mean to undercut

625
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,240
Batman the ride with what I was saying.

626
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,000
I'm just thinking, you know, for the stuff that we salivate over,

627
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,120
which is like robots and technological innovation, it does not have that.

628
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,680
It does have technological innovation in that it's the first inverted coaster.

629
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,600
I don't know. It's like a good it's a it's a real good start.

630
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,600
You got good ads out of it. There's mood.

631
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:44,160
It is like let's take the Burton vibe and put it in a physical

632
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:48,800
place. You got the just the the logo, just just putting that logo

633
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,640
and putting it into stone goes a long way.

634
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,160
It's still one of the great logos.

635
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:59,240
Wordless, you like get kind of a chilling feeling from it

636
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,520
without any further explanation.

637
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:05,240
So they I don't know, they they they like squeezed a lot

638
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,760
out of that fruit, I feel like with this ride. Yeah.

639
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,920
It just yeah, it just you never quite got

640
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,560
the feeling.

641
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:18,720
And I'm especially like Spider-Man or of, yeah, as you're saying,

642
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,600
Indiana Jones, where you were like transformed post ride,

643
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,880
you know, where you're like, oh, now I've now I've been on an adventure

644
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:32,040
with the character in a way that felt way different.

645
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,200
Yeah. From anything I had been on before.

646
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:41,080
And there's attempts just clear getting closer lately, but still not there yet.

647
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,400
Quite. Yes. Yeah.

648
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,640
Now, there was a thing at the time that I think got like that

649
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:52,360
I didn't know about that is like a little like, OK, that's getting there.

650
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,200
That's almost like Star Tours, but for Batman,

651
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,760
as Jason mentioned earlier, Batman Adventure the Ride.

652
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:02,200
But the audience probably doesn't know about this because this was in Germany

653
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,400
and Australia.

654
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,720
So it was difficult to go on this thing.

655
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:10,080
But this was essentially if there was Star Tours, but for Batman Returns.

656
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:16,120
Yes. And this is closer, I feel like, than the new Dubai version of this.

657
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:16,880
I think so.

658
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:21,200
If you watch that video, which still looks fun, but it's a similar ride.

659
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,880
But I think that other one seemed like it got closer

660
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,480
because I think you got, and I'll say it, a little bit more intimacy

661
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,520
with the characters.

662
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,560
Yeah. Not with Chase Meridian, but with other.

663
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,840
No, not with the other characters.

664
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,080
Yes, exactly.

665
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:42,680
I mean, Batman, Batman Adventure, the ride has a lot going for it.

666
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:46,520
You enter through a secret passage in the library. Good.

667
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:50,280
The team members, the employees dress like little Alfred

668
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,840
helpers with waistcoats and bow ties.

669
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,760
That's good. Yes, very good.

670
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,960
One iteration of it had an animatronic Batman.

671
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,960
Not a lot of movement, but sitting at the back computer

672
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,520
right in front of you. Good.

673
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,600
Yeah, that's good. Yes, like that.

674
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,080
That's what's still very rare, I feel. Yeah.

675
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,480
Yeah, it's it's and I think I was saying this.

676
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,480
I know people are I saw people were mad at us

677
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,760
and he told me to rise to the resistance.

678
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,760
But the stuff on Rise to the Resistance,

679
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:22,360
the Rise to the Resistance, I like the best is when your character,

680
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,320
you see them, they're interacting with you.

681
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,640
And I think that's the I think that's sometimes what

682
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,640
maybe the people designing they want to go with thrills

683
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,920
and even like feeling of scope over moments like that.

684
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,240
Because I think what Spider-Man did in such a perfect way

685
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,560
is combine all of it.

686
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,760
The characters are so big, they're on the hood of your vehicle.

687
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:51,480
So you leave that ride going like Doc Ock was in my face.

688
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,880
He was in my face for a moment of time.

689
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,760
I know that character already.

690
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,720
That was either cool or scary, interesting, whatever.

691
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,280
And then Spider-Man as well.

692
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,840
So like it feels like you were next to them

693
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,320
while it was happening versus some of this Batman stuff where it's like

694
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:10,920
Batman's in the bad plane and he's like maybe five thousand feet away from me.

695
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,800
And I'm squinting a little bit.

696
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,720
I'm sure it was better when you were actually on the ride.

697
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,720
But it's like that's that's the thing that's missing.

698
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,280
And it doesn't even have to be robots.

699
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,800
It would be preferable to be robots.

700
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,920
But it's like I think that's sort of the human element of it

701
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,040
to me is actually what you want.

702
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,560
And I almost feel like some of these

703
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:33,400
there's like a Joker maze in one of these in the Dubai Park.

704
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,920
It's like stuff like that almost ends up maybe being more memorable

705
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,440
than some of these like simulator rides that they've done.

706
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:44,520
Yeah, here's here's what I think is maybe getting in the way of

707
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:49,240
the great Batman ride is the casting.

708
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,800
The eras have changed so much.

709
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:56,400
Almost nobody has been in more than two or three Batman movies.

710
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,280
So like who is Batman?

711
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,680
Who is the Joker?

712
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,600
It changes all the time.

713
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,720
And often they're the biggest stars in the world.

714
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,480
And in the 90s, it was tougher to get the biggest stars in the world

715
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,680
to be in your rides.

716
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:12,320
However, the Indiana Jones adventure

717
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:17,880
is an extremely successful Indiana Jones ride

718
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,080
that does not have Harrison Ford.

719
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,160
So it's it's possible you can do.

720
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:26,960
And I think like a Batman figure that reminds you of Michael Keaton

721
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:32,720
or Val Kilmer to a much lesser extent, George Clooney would still like

722
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:36,480
it's why the one that even doesn't even do anything in the simulator.

723
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,080
I'm like, OK, closer.

724
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,200
That's it's almost there.

725
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,160
But I think it makes the casting thing gets in the way of the intimacy

726
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,920
that you're looking for, like who is going to do it, who will agree to do it?

727
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,360
Well, I mean, they have the longest running Batman is a guy named

728
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:54,080
Kevin Conroy, who's been doing the voice in a lot of different media

729
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,000
since animated series.

730
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,080
His voice is on the Justice League ride.

731
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,760
He did the Arkham City and Arkham Asylum games.

732
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,080
So they have him.

733
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,800
But as far as look wise, he has now done the character

734
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,040
in different media with different looks.

735
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:15,600
So he looks like the fun Bruce Tim, like noir, old time, cool animated style.

736
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,840
But he's also looks like that, like everyone's just dripping

737
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,960
with steroid Arkham Asylum video game aesthetic

738
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,640
where everyone's just fucking jacked and mad.

739
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,080
And it's cool. It's a cool look, too.

740
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:30,200
So it's like there's like I guess they're

741
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,800
yeah, they're like probably in a tough spot because it's like, well,

742
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,720
what do we even do right now?

743
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:40,560
People probably know, even though Ben Affleck's been Batman more recently,

744
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,960
people probably know the Christian Bale stuff the best right now.

745
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,080
That's probably the freshest in people's mind, because

746
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,000
some people don't love Batman versus Superman.

747
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,360
Some people, it's their religion, in case you didn't know.

748
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,400
Yes, yeah. I'm scared of it all.

749
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,400
I saw the one movie three hours and four.

750
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,360
No, no, Batman versus Superman.

751
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:04,040
Oh, I see. Extended cut that's on HBO Max.

752
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,800
Yes, yes. Is like three hours or two and a half hours.

753
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,000
It was like, oh, that's long.

754
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,840
And then Justice League is four hours.

755
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,920
And I'm like, I don't know. I liked Aquaman.

756
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,080
I thought Aquaman was fun.

757
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:16,160
I don't really. I haven't seen most of these other movies.

758
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,560
I'm tapping out.

759
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,960
I've been I've been trying to spend less time on the Internet

760
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,320
and meditate more, and it's been much.

761
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,800
I'm happier. I'm less depressed.

762
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,360
It's nice.

763
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,920
But because you mentioned Kevin Conroy,

764
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,680
Kevin. OK, that's the name, right?

765
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,280
Kevin Conroy, Kevin Conroy. Yeah.

766
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,480
It sounds like it's him in the second version of the Batman adventure.

767
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,880
Because I think, yeah, I think it is.

768
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,600
I think that's right.

769
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,880
So the Batman adventure motion simulator ride.

770
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:51,440
The first version is like a live action in the Tim Burton verse.

771
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:56,000
And on the sets and you can tell like they're at Warner Brothers.

772
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,840
Like when the movie cleared out of shooting,

773
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:03,360
like it's like the Penguin rubber duck and all that stuff.

774
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,000
Like you so feel it.

775
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,240
I was like surprised how much this stuff seemed cool

776
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,600
and that I had didn't know about it before.

777
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,680
So, yeah, like this is neat. Pretty good.

778
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,240
And I at first I thought we were going to clown on it

779
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,640
because the opening of it is slowly driving through a lot of crowd scenes,

780
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,120
then quickly driving through an alleyway.

781
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,720
And then it opens up to like crazy action sequences.

782
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,040
Right. Where does it go?

783
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,440
I don't I so remember that you're on the streets of Gotham,

784
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,960
and it's so cool to see Burton Gotham and that they just moved a camera around.

785
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,120
But what's the second half? I actually don't remember.

786
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,840
They the Penguin rubber duckie vehicle flies.

787
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,520
You start flying and chasing it.

788
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:49,760
And then I believe you chase him into his lair and like stuff blows up.

789
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,400
I think the Penguins are shooting the rockets at you.

790
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:58,520
There is footage where a sound alike is speaking in German,

791
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:04,400
like doing the Danny DeVito Penguin voice in German is just it's great.

792
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,640
It's it's delightful. Cool.

793
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,880
Yeah, that's very cool.

794
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,840
I watched Batman, Batman Returns not long ago.

795
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,720
And just the whole aesthetic, it's so Burton.

796
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,240
It's so much like Burton.

797
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,040
I was ever watched this recently.

798
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:23,720
Yes, I did. Not to sort of issue that opening.

799
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,960
I mean, yeah, everything aesthetically, those ducks,

800
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:30,960
everything like lends themselves to like such a cool like theme park world in that movie.

801
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,880
I mean, a lot of the Batman movies, but the first four, I would say,

802
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:40,320
not not as much the Nolan, even though they've done stuff in Dubai that's Nolan inspired.

803
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,560
Well, so much of Nolan is in like Chicago or in Pittsburgh,

804
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:49,760
as opposed to the stylized shot on the lot shot in a giant sound stage,

805
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:54,400
which is like lends itself to theme park more easily than a real city.

806
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,640
Yes, I remember this is how stupid I was.

807
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,640
I remember being like Batman Begins and I like Batman Begins and I still do.

808
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,120
But I remember being like, yeah, this is the way it's done.

809
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,280
It's not the old way. That's stupid.

810
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,840
And then a couple of years later, I was like, what was wrong with you?

811
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:13,840
Yeah, like a fun nonsense is better than as good as as Jason said.

812
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,040
Like Batman Forever is the sweet spot.

813
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:20,400
Batman and Robin, it is kind of the definition of jumping the shark.

814
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,320
I would love I will gladly watch it tonight.

815
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,560
I love watching Batman and Robin.

816
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:28,680
But I remember how even at the time, like you like Jason was saying,

817
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,520
you know, it's got to be grittier.

818
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:33,320
Even I felt that way even as a kid didn't like

819
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,760
the I think kids were not tricked by it.

820
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,960
There's something no, I didn't quite work.

821
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:43,480
I agree. I mean, I was we made fun of it, I think, immediately after seeing it.

822
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,920
Like we knew it didn't work.

823
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,560
We couldn't articulate why.

824
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,320
But I do maintain that you take all the sets and the actors

825
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,360
and you just make a better script and direct it differently.

826
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,400
And it's closer to a 60s.

827
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,400
They thought they were making 60s Batman and 60s Batman.

828
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,360
I think somewhat there's a misconception that that was like

829
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,560
an earnest attempt at or like a sincere attempt at a superhero

830
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:09,160
versus a subversive, funny, tongue in cheek.

831
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:13,040
It's like, you know, like satirical almost.

832
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:13,760
Right. Yeah.

833
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,760
It's funny on purpose before naked gun.

834
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,200
Yeah, it's funny on purpose.

835
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,600
But I still think people think, oh, that was the cheesy one.

836
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,200
And that was like, but it was like they knew what they were doing.

837
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:22,760
And it's funny.

838
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,480
I think they thought Batman and Robin was that.

839
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,800
Yeah. Well, I think.

840
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,200
I think Batman forever does a better job like Batman.

841
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,040
Oh, sure.

842
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,600
Mary Lee, the Tim Burton

843
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:38,400
aesthetic and the 60s

844
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,000
Batman vibe and adds a lot of camp.

845
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:43,800
Oh, yeah.

846
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,640
And there's a well, I think we tried this before.

847
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,800
There's supposedly a three hour cut somewhere, a shoe market

848
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,000
out of Batman forever, which I want to see.

849
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,640
That's the cut I want to see even more than the Snyder cut.

850
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,400
But what Jason's saying, if the R.A.

851
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:01,880
said in a sprinkle of camp, and that's what helped forever be good.

852
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:05,920
Batman and Robin is like your little like container of camp.

853
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,800
The lid came off and like the entire container of camp.

854
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,760
Yeah. As if like a whole thing of cinnamon just like

855
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,120
plopped into your whatever dish you're making.

856
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:21,920
Like it's kind of like if Batman forever is you were out all night

857
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,960
partying and having a great time.

858
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:27,200
Batman and Robin is like when the sun is coming up

859
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:31,520
and you catch a look at yourself in the mirror and you're like, oh no.

860
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,480
Oh, dear. Sleep.

861
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,880
I completely agree with what you're saying.

862
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:39,160
I'm just saying that I think in hindsight with Batman and Robin,

863
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,000
they watch the 60s show and they go, OK, got it.

864
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,560
It's full of puns.

865
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:46,600
Yeah. And they're all winking at the camera and they're not like

866
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,960
Adam West is playing it as dry and straight as possible,

867
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:53,600
including doing that whole performance, like kind of winking at the camera

868
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:54,880
the whole time.

869
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,280
The script isn't funny.

870
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,800
It's full of bad Arnold Schwarzenegger puns.

871
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,720
Like I'm just saying, I think aesthetically,

872
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:06,640
there's it's not such a disaster if they had made some tweaks to it.

873
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,360
Oh, yeah, I would agree with this.

874
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,600
Costumes are cool. Like the costumes are cool.

875
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,600
The sets are cool.

876
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,800
Like all that stuff is fine.

877
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,160
I can't just end, though, the you know, this is well tried and territory,

878
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:24,040
but the nipples and the and the penises is so in the nipples and the penis.

879
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:30,240
It is insane with your action figures and your intimacy.

880
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,960
Yeah, you know, I the nipples are crazy.

881
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,880
The nipples are crazy.

882
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,080
They didn't just do it.

883
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,840
And like, if you notice it, you notice it.

884
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:43,160
It's like punch in on nipple close up of rubber nipple.

885
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,000
It is pretty crazy.

886
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,280
One of the craziest things ever to be done in like a 200 million dollar movie.

887
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:53,640
It's like, like at Batman suiting up and making sure to take

888
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,600
an extended shot of ass.

889
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,880
Just punch in on his butt.

890
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,800
Yeah, there is. But

891
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,760
there is a figure, there's these figures called hot toys

892
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:08,600
that I've brought up before that are what that's unfortunate timing.

893
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:09,840
Unfortunate.

894
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:13,120
The Adam West that I have that Batman is a hot toy.

895
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:15,920
And it's like a very articulated doll.

896
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,400
And they're making Jason has seen this.

897
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,440
They're making Batman forever once.

898
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,520
And Scott, I don't know, did I send this to you?

899
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,640
I don't think I did.

900
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:28,800
They're making Batman three in the morning several times over the last six months.

901
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,200
Oh, man, I must have blacked out and done that.

902
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,480
They're making Batman forever once.

903
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:40,000
And I will say, I'll show you the picture of Chris O'Donnell's Robin.

904
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,520
Oh, boy. Here we go.

905
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,680
Here, let me show you the hottest hot toy that ever was.

906
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,200
Yeah, it is.

907
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,360
He's pretty cute.

908
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:55,440
My killing time pretending he doesn't have it bookmarked.

909
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,440
This looks got here. You see this?

910
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,200
Wow. Oh, my God.

911
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,120
That is the bulgiest.

912
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,720
Why are you?

913
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:09,800
You should be offended by this, Mike, by your your typical demeanor.

914
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,960
I am offended by it.

915
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,560
It's so I don't know why it's like this.

916
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,960
I don't know why he has such a big bulge because it wasn't.

917
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,000
Yeah, you see, like it's like shadowed.

918
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,280
There's a far away picture of the toy here and it's got the shadow.

919
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,680
So that's good to be bad.

920
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:35,840
You would be able to see this toy's giant dick like from 100 feet away.

921
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,160
It's like he has two extra penises in there.

922
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:42,280
He jammed a couple more in that is and nipples.

923
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,880
There's nipples on these.

924
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,520
There weren't nipples. Oh, yeah.

925
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,360
And forever. This was this is crossing.

926
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,280
I don't know. Wait a minute.

927
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:54,080
Wait a minute. But it was such an uproar in Batman and Robin.

928
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:57,360
Well, in the first half of the movie, he wears the Burton suit

929
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:01,280
pretty much with the yellow and then that gets destroyed.

930
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,760
And they're like, try, try.

931
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,560
Oh, they got nipples. Yeah, he's got nipples here.

932
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:05,760
Look at that nipples.

933
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,840
And Robin gets a suit at the end of the movie when Batman gets his new suit.

934
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:12,600
So Alfred's like, I took care of it.

935
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,000
I added the nipples and Alfred.

936
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:18,480
Now, don't forget that Alfred himself molded the nipples.

937
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:21,800
Heavily applied.

938
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,840
Suit me up, Uncle Alfred.

939
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,840
We're going to buzz saw zzzzzz.

940
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,400
Almost done, master.

941
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,760
There is. I mean, I don't know that it needed to be explored

942
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,480
in like a big budget movie, but there is obviously some weird

943
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,920
like S&M shit going on with a guy who dresses up in black rubber

944
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,680
at night to beat up people like.

945
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,160
There's some weird.

946
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,720
There's some weird stuff going on there.

947
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:47,800
So I wouldn't.

948
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,280
It wouldn't be crazy if you go like if we knew in real life

949
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,480
there was a person that was dressing up in black rubber

950
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,320
and went up like outside to get like to get himself beat up

951
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,520
and to go beat people up.

952
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,240
And you go, that guy also has rubber nipples on his costume.

953
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,200
You go, oh, yeah, of course.

954
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,680
Of course, that makes total sense.

955
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:07,160
Surprised and scandalized. Yeah. Right.

956
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,840
Oh, all superheroes have psychosexual madness behind.

957
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,920
I mean, Wonder Woman, the guy created Wonder Woman

958
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,720
was very into bonded stuff.

959
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,520
And that's why all the early, early Wonder Woman comics are like

960
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:21,120
women who are dominating men, tying men up.

961
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,600
William Marson, William Marson.

962
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:26,680
Yeah, they had he and his wife had an 18 year old lover

963
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,720
who was the basis for Wonder Woman.

964
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,720
He he was of the idea that men should just

965
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,720
like submit to women in every like every way, essentially,

966
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,840
and that society would be better for that.

967
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,800
That was his philosophy on it.

968
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,080
There's a lot of interesting stuff.

969
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,560
So, you know, you give Schumacher a lot of credit for going there.

970
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:46,880
That's what I'd like to say.

971
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,720
Sure. And I like the way he was trapping into a comic.

972
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,880
He almost was thinking more like a comic mind in a way.

973
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:58,800
Yes. He and I like to and I'd like to thank the good folks at Hot Toys

974
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:03,280
for making a giant package on the Chris O'Donnell toy.

975
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,520
Thank you. Pretty jaw drop.

976
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,480
That feels bigger than in the film.

977
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,160
I will say I will have to put it if I want to.

978
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,240
I was going to say when if I get it.

979
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:16,840
But let's be honest, when I get when you get it, I'm going to put it away.

980
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,960
I'm going to put it like, oh, my boss is coming over.

981
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,760
I'm going to have to hide the Chris O'Donnell toy.

982
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:26,840
And that's like it's like Frank Nelson, Gil Gordon type character.

983
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:29,600
Well, Michael, thank you for inviting me to your house.

984
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,120
Go great. This is what a wonderful evening.

985
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:34,840
Let me just go get my coat out of the closet over here.

986
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,560
It's me, your boss, Peter Forever Dog.

987
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,520
The pret is scandalized.

988
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,560
Oh, wait to my coat is caught on something.

989
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,600
I don't. Oh, he falls.

990
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:46,840
The toy hits him in the head.

991
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:49,120
He's stuck under it. The weight of it.

992
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:52,480
Chris O'Donnell's toy penis is holding me down on the floor.

993
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:57,480
I call if you know, don't move it, because if I pull it out,

994
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:00,040
you might bleed more. It's actually stopping the bleeding.

995
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:03,080
So we have to keep it right in your eye.

996
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,640
We have to we have to get to the hospital.

997
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,200
We have to we're going to have to drive all the way to the hospital,

998
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,720
which is a half hour away and past everyone you know.

999
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:18,160
And they may see you with Robin thrust into your face.

1000
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,960
I'm sorry, Mr. Forever.

1001
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,320
Mr. Forever, we have bad news.

1002
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:26,360
We're going to have to chop off the figure, but you will have to

1003
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:31,280
have the penis remain stuck in your head for the next six weeks.

1004
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:35,040
Why? I've got a meeting tomorrow with John and Jane Brooklyn.

1005
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,600
And what are we going to do about that?

1006
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:39,800
We all have to just dress it up.

1007
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,280
I don't know what to tell you, but this is just a medical opinion.

1008
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:44,640
You can get a second one if you want, but then you'll have to drive by

1009
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,080
another set of people.

1010
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:49,320
Apologize for that, but that's the best we can do.

1011
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:52,040
We've seen this a lot lately.

1012
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:56,440
Please don't take away our Christmas bonus of a second.

1013
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:59,440
Hello, fresh ad read.

1014
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:04,720
It's going to happen pretty much just like this.

1015
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:09,360
We were right in the middle of a really specific Jason fact,

1016
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:12,320
which was that it's about Batman Adventure, the ride.

1017
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:17,000
There was this Bertany one, and then they redid it in like 2002.

1018
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,680
Correct. I think around that.

1019
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:23,600
Yeah. So the Bertany one is is live action footage.

1020
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,680
Some some, you know, plenty of effects and stuff.

1021
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:31,520
And then Batman Adventure, the ride to they redid it with like

1022
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,400
computer generated animation.

1023
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,720
And this is kind of more as Mike was saying, like, I guess the term

1024
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,400
for simplicity sake, generic Batman.

1025
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:45,160
It does have the Kevin Conroy voice, but you kind of get

1026
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:50,600
a more generic version of Batman and Batgirl Catwoman.

1027
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,720
Mr. Freeze. It does still come out in.

1028
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:58,920
There's a crashed thing in the penguins layer.

1029
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,640
I think you still exit into that.

1030
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:03,960
But who cares? It's fun.

1031
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:07,760
But you like this is where and like this.

1032
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:10,880
Well, we have a number of things to hit a lot of them.

1033
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:13,640
I'm not like super like, well, we got to talk this and this and this,

1034
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,960
because there are there is this format that I feel like a couple of things

1035
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,000
have hit that is and then there's all the villains.

1036
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:24,200
But there none of them are in like a sort of iconic mode.

1037
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:27,040
It's like the way they would all look on a on a folder

1038
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:29,840
or a lunchbox you would have.

1039
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:33,320
Like, I think I think some of these brides fall victim to the same

1040
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:37,320
trap of, all right, so you got to fit them all in.

1041
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,880
And then there's the Joker and it's him with a big smile.

1042
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,640
But like, which Joker is this?

1043
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,640
This is just like every Joker and no Joker.

1044
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:49,960
I think I think that generic CGI jokers don't do it for me.

1045
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:53,760
I don't think they solve the getting the great Batman ride.

1046
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,200
Yeah, I mean, that's part of it.

1047
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:59,240
I mean, the animated I keep going back to Spider-Man,

1048
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:02,200
because I think it's probably the gold standard superhero

1049
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:05,560
ride at this still and that is generic.

1050
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:08,760
We aren't like like it's great because Tobey Maguire is in it.

1051
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:09,800
That's not what it is.

1052
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,920
And yet it's it's really wonderful.

1053
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,640
Yeah. But I think that

1054
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:18,680
yeah, you feel like you know the characters better coming off the ride.

1055
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,960
I think if you were to really if you were on some other planet

1056
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,080
and the Joker wasn't the hamlet of our time

1057
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:27,200
and you didn't know that character and you didn't know that he's

1058
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:30,440
multiple Oscars have been won by playing the great take on.

1059
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,040
Right. I think you wouldn't

1060
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:38,120
have a feeling about him from seeing the just the ride versus like the

1061
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,640
you would kind of remember like, oh, yeah, there was like that scream lady.

1062
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,120
I remember what she looks like. Right.

1063
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,800
She really scared me. I remember what she did.

1064
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:51,960
Like, I think all those characters make such a better impression on you,

1065
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:54,640
partly because they're so much closer to you.

1066
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:57,760
And then I don't know, I don't want to say something crazy like, oh,

1067
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,160
the characterization of them are so much better.

1068
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,600
I don't think that's it.

1069
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:04,280
But I just think things they do are more memorable

1070
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:08,800
and they just they're they're with they're closer to you for a longer time.

1071
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:13,200
I think that's the I think that's more of the difference.

1072
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:16,600
And maybe the maybe what you're saying, though, with Joker is like

1073
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:20,880
we've seen so many in so many great versions of the Joker, like

1074
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,680
which is making fun of it.

1075
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,840
But like all the Jokers are pretty good.

1076
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,040
Caesar Romero, Joker's great.

1077
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,160
Mark Hamill, Joker's fantastic. Yeah.

1078
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,640
He fled your Joker fantastic.

1079
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:34,040
I don't love the new Joker movie, but walking thinks is good in it.

1080
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:35,680
Like he's he's doing.

1081
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:39,440
Yeah, well, it's and it's like iconic immediately whether or not you

1082
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,920
you like it. And there's moments that I make fun of.

1083
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:42,640
And then there's one something.

1084
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,800
He's pretty good. He's pretty good there. Right.

1085
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,960
And obviously Jack's great.

1086
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:50,360
And then there's been other like other ones like John DiMaggio played him,

1087
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:53,280
I think, in one of the direct to DVD movies.

1088
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:56,600
Pretty. So I yes, it feels

1089
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,480
after all of those Jokers to sort of just see

1090
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:03,120
you know, OK, guy laughing.

1091
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:06,120
I've got you, Batman. Yeah, it's just not. Yeah.

1092
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,560
Like, yeah, you got you.

1093
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:12,800
There's got to be a choice or you have to use one of them or or something.

1094
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,480
Yeah, it's maybe you just got to stay away from the Joker,

1095
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:18,880
which seems like why take that off the table with a Batman ride.

1096
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,760
But it seems like a like a trap.

1097
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,840
It's a ticket to generic town.

1098
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:26,000
Well, let me pitch you.

1099
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,640
What happens sometimes if you try to get away from the classics,

1100
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:34,560
let me pitch you a Batman ride that is like the antithesis

1101
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,920
of Batman, the ride. OK.

1102
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:40,840
And it's a coaster and it's called Batman and Robin the Chiller.

1103
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,400
Either of you guys know about this.

1104
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,360
I know there's a big video about it, and I don't I don't know the gist, actually.

1105
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,000
OK, I want to talk to you now.

1106
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,720
I know I just looked into a little bit.

1107
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,400
I think Jason obviously knows more than I do, though.

1108
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,200
So go ahead. Oh, because I wrote it.

1109
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:58,800
I did this ride. Oh, wow. OK.

1110
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:04,920
Let me show you this image to give you an idea of what you're working with here.

1111
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:07,760
So this is what you enter into.

1112
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:13,880
There's a lot going on in this picture, which I'll make sure to post.

1113
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,480
You know, you've got more industrial stuff.

1114
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:19,320
You've got the Batman and Robin logo.

1115
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:23,280
You've got the funky 90s, fast lane, skip the line.

1116
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,320
That's quite a lot.

1117
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:29,160
And you got like sort of a big Limp Biscuit head hanging out.

1118
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:32,480
I wouldn't go in this line, not because it's a scary coaster,

1119
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,640
because I'd be worried about that guy.

1120
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,000
Well, he might start moshing.

1121
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:36,960
He might tell you to get in the pit.

1122
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,760
He's going to moshing me.

1123
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:41,640
And the guy, the other guy over there, I think the Six Flags employee

1124
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:45,200
is sort of dressed like Dennis Nedry from Jurassic Park.

1125
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:48,240
Big yellow slicker.

1126
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:49,560
Yeah. And a hat.

1127
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,480
Rightfully sure. Yes.

1128
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:55,320
The other employee has some real baggy khakis on.

1129
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,520
This is a this is an era.

1130
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,680
And you've been on this. I've been on this.

1131
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:03,680
So this ride, it comes to a dead end.

1132
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,680
That's the other thing notable for this.

1133
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:06,960
It dead ends.

1134
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:13,160
This ride opened in June of 1997, same month as the Batman and Robin movie.

1135
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:18,720
And I remembered this ride because my dad and I went to Six Flags once

1136
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:23,920
and we rode it and immediately both had to sit down because it was

1137
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,680
one of those ones where it's like, oh, my God, I feel awful.

1138
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,400
Like, what the hell?

1139
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,240
The shoulder restraints.

1140
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:33,880
You just got rocked by those shoulder restraints.

1141
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:38,160
And it was it was it was just so unpleasant.

1142
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:42,840
My dad had been having like hip issues, like on and off and like getting off this ride.

1143
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:47,400
He's like, I have to take an Advil like that was so bad.

1144
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:52,240
And then we went on Superman, the escape, the drop ride that slides down.

1145
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,720
And he's like, oh, that fixed it.

1146
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,960
The one ride that fixed it.

1147
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,240
I feel I feel 100 percent.

1148
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:04,400
I texted him to confirm, did this ride fix your hip or fuck it up?

1149
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,880
And he's like, no, this ride was awful.

1150
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,200
This ride was rough.

1151
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:11,560
Superman, the escape was the thing that fixed it.

1152
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:14,880
The cartoon characters solve problems.

1153
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:17,240
That's right in the head and it fixed the

1154
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,080
back into place.

1155
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:23,960
So you remember Jason as a kid, though, that like jacked you up real bad.

1156
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,960
I would have been like 15, maybe.

1157
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:30,680
And so like prime roller coaster riding age.

1158
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:35,000
But yeah, I didn't realize I was like, is this still there?

1159
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,840
And it closed in 2007, but I didn't realize it was plagued with

1160
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,720
technical difficulties.

1161
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:45,120
So it opens June of 1997 and then it closes two weeks later

1162
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:49,200
because it was it's a launch coaster

1163
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:54,120
that used the linear induction motors to launch like, you know,

1164
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:57,480
this is shortly after Outer Limits Flight of Fear.

1165
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,280
And this is right before the Incredible Hulk Coaster.

1166
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:06,720
If you remember the Incredible Hulk Coaster, they built extra generators

1167
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:11,640
so that it didn't fuck up the power grid using so much energy.

1168
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:16,880
Batman and Robin the Chiller used just under the amount of energy

1169
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:20,520
as the Incredible Hulk Coaster because it launched two coasters at once.

1170
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,120
The Batman track and the Robin track were different.

1171
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:26,760
And it was pulling so much power.

1172
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:32,480
It became a real problem that Six Flags had to fix before they could reopen it

1173
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:35,560
a year later in 1998.

1174
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:38,120
Wow. That's crazy.

1175
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,200
Yeah. All right. We got it.

1176
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:43,400
The other thing that was notable for me and Theme Park

1177
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:46,480
history has a long video about this on YouTube.

1178
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:51,200
The shoulder restraints, everyone hated them.

1179
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:55,560
And they became a real problem that you could not ride this ride

1180
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:59,520
if you had earrings in because you would get bounced around so much.

1181
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,280
People were coming off with bloody ears.

1182
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,160
Oh, my God. Jesus.

1183
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:08,080
Yeah. So that's insane.

1184
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:11,000
And then they sold it to a park in Brazil.

1185
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:13,560
It languished in a lot in New Jersey.

1186
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:16,680
And then they decided it was too much work to install.

1187
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:19,880
It was just a debacle. This whole endeavor.

1188
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:23,400
This is crazy, because it's like this is still this still happens.

1189
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,920
Like that Green Lantern Coaster they opened a couple of years ago

1190
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:28,840
and had to take apart because it just it was too painful.

1191
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:33,520
It was like they're like really still experimenting

1192
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:37,520
with what the human body will accept as a thrill experience.

1193
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:42,640
Six Flags. Yeah, they'll just like hammer something together and like,

1194
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,560
goes it safe? Yeah, sure.

1195
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:47,080
Probably. I think only one way to find out.

1196
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:52,360
If if if we get 10,000 guests saying they hate it, we'll take it down.

1197
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:55,760
And like we got to get to that number, though.

1198
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,800
I mean, everyone, the governor,

1199
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,560
you just need a certain amount of signatures and then we'll consider it.

1200
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:05,320
Yeah. If somebody comes by the the the like guest services booth

1201
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:08,080
and says, that sucked.

1202
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:10,960
If we get to 10, we'll mark it down on a whiteboard. One.

1203
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:16,400
Wait, in my school growing, I always my I think my mom told me like,

1204
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:20,200
well, if you if we get three inches of snow, you get a snow day.

1205
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:22,840
And I was always just watching the news broadcast.

1206
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:24,920
Did we get three inches? Did we get three inches?

1207
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:28,040
Does Six Flags have that for amount of blood?

1208
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:31,640
Like it's like, all right, once we fill up this beaker with blood,

1209
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,560
we got a redo. We got to double check everything.

1210
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:36,920
Put in a wider beaker.

1211
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:39,440
Then it'll take longer.

1212
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:45,080
No, same height, three inches, but make it more of a trough.

1213
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:49,160
Yeah. Yeah, that's that's.

1214
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:51,120
So when did you say that they took it down?

1215
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:52,120
How long? How long?

1216
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:54,760
Two thousand seven. It was it was finally closed.

1217
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:56,400
Still lasted a while.

1218
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:57,760
Yeah, it lasted a while.

1219
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:02,480
Ear bloodener, ear blood and ear blood in her lasted like a decade,

1220
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:04,040
over a decade. Ear blood.

1221
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:08,120
And then imagine the high that they must have been on the Six Flags

1222
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:11,920
Great Adventure executives of like we got a Batman and Robin coaster

1223
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:15,760
the same month as this big movie. Yeah, we did it.

1224
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:19,880
Well, I think that I think Batman and Robin was cursed.

1225
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:24,520
The curse of the movie itself, I guess, cursed this attraction.

1226
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:26,760
And then another one, which is Mr.

1227
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:31,440
Freeze, the coaster, which is in, I think, a Texas one

1228
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:32,920
and a St. Louis one.

1229
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:35,440
And I will never remember the Six Flags park names.

1230
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:36,560
This will not happen.

1231
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:39,400
But I think those are the places.

1232
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:44,920
And Mr. Freeze was supposed to open in May 97 to go right alongside the release.

1233
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:49,720
And as part of that, Schwarzenegger and Clooney were going to be there.

1234
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:52,880
They were actually going to come and be the first to ride it.

1235
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,120
But the launch is another launch one and it didn't work right.

1236
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:58,320
So they had to push it till the next year.

1237
01:03:58,320 --> 01:03:59,840
And by that point, of course,

1238
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:03,200
Schwarzenegger and Clooney are washing their hands of the entire thing.

1239
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,960
They don't want any part of it.

1240
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,800
So that all fell apart.

1241
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,920
But they still got their

1242
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,280
promotional opportunity and their big celebrity.

1243
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:18,440
Not not to like they have got it eventually because they changed the

1244
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,840
eventually they put it in reverse.

1245
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:23,360
They reopened it and just put the ride backwards.

1246
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:29,360
And to do to commemorate that, they did an event where

1247
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:33,760
OK, look at the lavishness of this event.

1248
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:37,560
There are silver balloons that say, Mr.

1249
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:40,480
Freeze, the letters are starting to come apart.

1250
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,720
So you might not be able to it might not be too legible.

1251
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:46,440
There's a bunch of silver women, you know, like Mr.

1252
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:49,240
Freeze would have around their dress.

1253
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:53,440
They're dressed like his his wife that's in the tube.

1254
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:55,760
They're dressed like they're dressed like Nora.

1255
01:04:55,760 --> 01:05:00,280
Nora Nora, which is how the guy said it on the animated series,

1256
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:02,560
which I always say Nora.

1257
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:06,240
Oh, I just got I mean, it's in my head from the movie because that's that's

1258
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:11,400
that's the Arnold version's quest is that's why he's doing all these bad

1259
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:14,760
to get the one more giant diamond, my love.

1260
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:18,320
One more so I can find a cure.

1261
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:22,360
They make him like a moat and he cries and then the tear.

1262
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:25,160
Yes. Turns into ice.

1263
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:26,320
Yes, that's fantastic.

1264
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:27,760
I do like that movie.

1265
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:31,720
But this this photo, you might not be able to see the celebrity

1266
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:35,560
because there is an ice sculpture with the name of a Mr.

1267
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:37,600
Freeze reverse the attack.

1268
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,120
I don't know what it's called.

1269
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:41,200
But there's two guys with chainsaws.

1270
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,080
One is some guy in the other one.

1271
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:45,000
That's vanilla ice, baby.

1272
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,440
Oh, wow. Ice to come.

1273
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:50,680
Who I think raises it and like Mr.

1274
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:52,240
Freeze, you ready to write it?

1275
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,320
Here we go. Here we go.

1276
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:54,520
Yup. Yup.

1277
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:59,480
So don't say that you can't get star power at Six Flags over Texas.

1278
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:02,040
Wow. That is interesting.

1279
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:05,600
When backwards, they have since you said back

1280
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:08,560
the train going backwards, the ride going backwards.

1281
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:14,800
Batman, the ride has been run backwards to they figured out how to do that.

1282
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:19,000
And they also for some of the Batman, the ride tracks,

1283
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,160
they painted them over the some of them are bright yellow now,

1284
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:25,040
which I don't quite get.

1285
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:27,240
They were a lot of them were black.

1286
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:32,480
Some of them blue and like yellow is that like little accents on his chest

1287
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,400
in some of the Batman outfits.

1288
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:38,320
But a big yellow track does not scream Batman to me.

1289
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:41,240
Meanwhile, Batman and Robin the coaster.

1290
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:43,480
So that came to a dead end hill.

1291
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:47,400
And then you went back all the way backwards on the track into the station.

1292
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:49,680
So very complicated ride.

1293
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:53,360
But, you know, hey, if you want to look on the bright side,

1294
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:58,120
probably an example that the universal people were like, well,

1295
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:00,360
let's make sure this coaster works.

1296
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:05,200
Let's make sure we don't replicate those awful problems with the launching.

1297
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:08,280
You know, right here.

1298
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:09,840
Let me to jump.

1299
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:11,200
We're jumping all around here.

1300
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:14,000
Did you guys come across the Penguins Blizzard River?

1301
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:17,240
No, no. What? Please.

1302
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,720
OK, so I believe there was and somebody's going to correct me.

1303
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:22,560
I'm sure I'm wrong a little bit.

1304
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:26,560
But here's the logo for Penguins Blizzard River right on the right there.

1305
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:31,000
And looks cool. That logo is cool. Yeah.

1306
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:34,520
And there looks like there's there was one in Kentucky Kingdom.

1307
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:37,360
And look at the outside of it's got like his big top hat there.

1308
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:40,240
Oh, I mean, it's completely this looks good.

1309
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:43,560
And look at these pictures like this.

1310
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,880
That's cool. So it's a rapid ride.

1311
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:47,200
So it's a rapid right. Exactly.

1312
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,360
And there's like penguins, like big penguins.

1313
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:52,080
And there's kind of some Gotham City type theming as you're going in the

1314
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:54,000
the raft like Blizzard Beach.

1315
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,320
It's cold everywhere.

1316
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:58,040
But you could ride on a hot day. This is good. I like this.

1317
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:01,120
OK, but they made another one.

1318
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:04,720
And it was at the great Six Flags America

1319
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:06,920
in Maryland, is that right?

1320
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:11,600
This is what that looks like.

1321
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:13,600
That's just that's just a building.

1322
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:15,360
That's just that. Wait. Yeah.

1323
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:16,800
It's a water tower.

1324
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,920
Family water. It looks like shit.

1325
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:20,200
It looks awful. Yeah.

1326
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:22,320
Multi-color like it's just a slide.

1327
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:25,040
It's just the device to make the raft go up.

1328
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:28,400
And it's like a couple spins around and then you're done.

1329
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:31,720
That's not the aesthetic of the penguin whatsoever.

1330
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:35,800
Yes. So so they sometimes they like got it

1331
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:39,880
writer in a different way, but then use the same name and logo

1332
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:42,520
and then just did a much cheaper version.

1333
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:45,920
Like, you know, there's a big penguin outside that looks kind of like shit.

1334
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:49,400
And it's just like a warehouse with that logo on it.

1335
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:51,080
And that's about it.

1336
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:54,560
Again, what's if you're thinking like Riddler's Revenge, there's a there's

1337
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:58,600
like a plan like what is the what's the point of the penguin

1338
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:01,040
having made this blizzard river

1339
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:03,760
that's just going to take you up from and take you down?

1340
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:07,840
He's just like that seems to me like the villains are very generous.

1341
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:10,120
They want us to be happy and smiling.

1342
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:12,920
Yeah, they're like they're like kind of secret.

1343
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:17,960
They're angel investor types who are, you know, trying to trick us to go on.

1344
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:20,640
Maybe we think that are bad, but they actually just want us

1345
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:23,480
to have a nice time at a theme park today.

1346
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:26,040
That's really seems to be like a common thing.

1347
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:27,840
They're not trying to destroy us.

1348
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:33,400
The joke will be on them because they'll be having a fun splash of a time.

1349
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:37,480
Maybe the trick is like then they'll want to pay five dollars

1350
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:40,760
and get an annual pass for six flags.

1351
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,200
They'll end up buying a T-shirt.

1352
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:46,120
We had we cannot do this without going McGruff.

1353
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:48,240
I've never got both doing McGruff as I have.

1354
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:50,000
Why? Why? Why?

1355
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,160
Penguin, penguin.

1356
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:51,960
How would you do penguin?

1357
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:53,760
I'm penguin.

1358
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:54,240
Oh, yeah, Jason.

1359
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:56,080
I would be Jason go for penguin.

1360
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,320
I was trying to push Jason to be penguin on Gotham.

1361
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:01,200
I was emailing an agent I had at the time going,

1362
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:03,520
get Jason an audition for Penguin.

1363
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:07,840
We real quickly threw together a real like there was something

1364
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:09,840
enough level, a few levels removed.

1365
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,600
This is years and years and years and put on a top hat and put it in.

1366
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:16,240
Oh, no, no, no, no, if only they was young penguin.

1367
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:18,640
And I was like, hey, you could do young, you could do young penguin.

1368
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:23,360
They went with a very like tall, lean Broadway guy coming off Broadway, I think.

1369
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:26,320
And he was pretty good.

1370
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:27,840
Now's your chance.

1371
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:28,960
Now's your audition.

1372
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:30,920
Yeah, now it's a big audition.

1373
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:36,000
But OK, I got to say a line, a different character said, why won't you just die?

1374
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:39,280
Oh, I know means family.

1375
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,800
Wow. I know he's family.

1376
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:44,280
Why won't you just die?

1377
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:47,400
Wow. Well, it's pretty clear you should have gotten the role.

1378
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:48,400
It's the show.

1379
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:51,960
These guys know a lot about theme parks, but then also they're such great

1380
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:55,440
impressionists, all three of them.

1381
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:57,200
Uncanny.

1382
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:00,520
Who do you think, though, who who who do you think was the who?

1383
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:03,160
Would you say your entrance was good?

1384
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:07,040
His was better to famous Jim Carrey Lide,

1385
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:09,880
which is also recycled in such shows.

1386
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:13,680
All right. His was better.

1387
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:17,360
Who who if we had to all play Batman villains, who would they be?

1388
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:19,400
Who would you who would you truly want to play?

1389
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:21,320
It doesn't matter.

1390
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:24,160
It can be any version of any character.

1391
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:25,280
Who's the most fun?

1392
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:27,920
Hmm. Probably Penguin or Mad Hatter.

1393
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,960
They had her in none of the live actions, right?

1394
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,880
Not been used. Not in any of the live.

1395
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:36,600
I would love a good like trippy Lewis Carroll Batman with the Mad Hatter.

1396
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:39,320
And it sure had her with the ventriloquist.

1397
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:41,840
That's a tough one, Michael. Quite a riddle.

1398
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:44,480
Well, I think we know the answer.

1399
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:47,080
God has. Yeah, I nailed it.

1400
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:49,720
Are you sure the listeners should have seen the face I made?

1401
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:51,800
I went real rubber faced with it.

1402
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:54,400
Mm hmm. I like that. That's good.

1403
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,600
I like the ventriloquist.

1404
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:58,600
I think. Hmm.

1405
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:00,360
What else? Who's that?

1406
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:03,040
I like clay. Can I be Clayface?

1407
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:05,400
Clayface could I be CGI?

1408
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:07,840
The Condiment Clock King.

1409
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,400
How about Clock King for me?

1410
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:10,880
You don't want to be Condiment King.

1411
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:13,360
I could be Condiment King, too, or Egghead.

1412
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:16,000
Yeah. Vincent Price's villain, Egghead.

1413
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,240
Oh, yeah. He's got to go ahead, I think.

1414
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:19,880
Yeah, maybe Egghead.

1415
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:24,320
Or B, I think I also like Bane, not Tom Hardy Bane,

1416
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:27,720
but Batman and Robin Bane, who just seems like sleepy.

1417
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:34,400
Bane's whole thing was like in the comics, he's like hyper intelligent guy

1418
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:36,320
who's also like very strong and they did.

1419
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:39,600
They went the other way with it in that movie.

1420
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:43,360
Please, why do you not make me smarter?

1421
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:46,120
Yeah.

1422
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:46,920
Or you know what?

1423
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:50,680
I could be Louis the Lilac, the Milton Berle villain from the 60s show.

1424
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:53,720
I'm not sure I ever saw it.

1425
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:56,280
I remember looking at books that would say things like that.

1426
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:57,640
Like, what are you talking about?

1427
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:58,960
Milton Berle was on it.

1428
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:02,040
Louis. Well, there's also Jacques Gabor's Miss Minerva,

1429
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:05,080
who owned the Evil Day Spa,

1430
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:06,240
which is fantastic.

1431
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:10,400
They put on like avocado rubs that burn your skin.

1432
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:16,000
And then Batman and Robin both have like the towels on with their outfits.

1433
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:20,080
In the episode, this is what you got to do with that Robin when it shows up.

1434
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:22,040
You got to get a towel on that little guy.

1435
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:23,560
A little towel.

1436
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:25,400
To cover the nipples, a little.

1437
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:27,560
Yeah, but not just the nipples.

1438
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:29,280
All of it.

1439
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:32,680
I think I have to go back to when the OK, in the episode where you said

1440
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:36,120
that you made little beds for the Ghostbusters or your babysitter did

1441
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:38,240
and that they were made of paper towels.

1442
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:42,920
When Erin was listening to that, she was like, well, you guys shot past the facts

1443
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:45,680
that the OK, yeah, the beds are weird, but then that

1444
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:48,400
Mike's mom thought that they'd be a fire hazard.

1445
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:51,040
I think we didn't address that part.

1446
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:53,360
And I want to give a little time to that if we could.

1447
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:57,320
Oh, yeah. I mean, this is this is give you a little bit of a window into my childhood.

1448
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:59,640
Oh, great. Great. Yeah.

1449
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:04,160
That so loose like napkins inside the plastic Ghostbusters house

1450
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:07,120
would just spontaneously catch fire in the middle of the night.

1451
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:10,280
That was that was some of the thinking.

1452
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:14,360
Because like with something spark, like what if like

1453
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:18,960
a cat knocked a water glass onto the electrical outlet

1454
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:21,680
and then a spark came off of that and flew into the Ghostbusters house

1455
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:23,640
and into their paper beds?

1456
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:27,040
I I don't have a good answer for this.

1457
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:31,120
And I have I bring I relitigate this every few years.

1458
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:37,080
And I have yet to really get a good explanation of what the concern was, really.

1459
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:42,720
But my recollection was they were thrown out maybe the night of this happening.

1460
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:46,760
OK, like the night of I remember I it's a very vivid memory.

1461
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:49,480
It's traumatizing to me, too,

1462
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:51,200
because I was like, well, their little beds are gone.

1463
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:53,640
They threw my mom threw them away.

1464
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:55,360
Worried about a fire.

1465
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:58,560
Don't have any. I don't have there's like why wouldn't.

1466
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:03,360
So then wouldn't a paper towel roll be the ultimate fire hazard?

1467
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:05,520
There's so that's like big and thick.

1468
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:08,720
That's like that's like, you know, having an atom bomb in the house.

1469
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:12,520
I guess the risk of having a paper towel roll in the kitchen

1470
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:17,560
was less great than having from the risk of having a few pieces of it

1471
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,440
in the child's bedroom.

1472
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:22,560
And it's got I was warning you maybe.

1473
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:23,400
What's that?

1474
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:26,760
I would warn you just maybe don't leave napkins lying around

1475
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:31,000
because they could just set on they just catch on fire.

1476
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,800
I think that's what my mom was saying.

1477
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:37,320
Well, the baby's already trying to eat napkins and choke on them.

1478
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:37,960
I'm worried about that.

1479
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:39,040
But I was not.

1480
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:42,600
I've maybe not paid enough attention to the fire issue at hand.

1481
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:47,320
We've all seen all these news stories about napkins just going up in flames.

1482
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:49,640
Spontaneous napkin fires.

1483
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:52,560
They're everywhere in your neighborhood, in every neighborhood.

1484
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:57,560
Yes. There are there other things like this from my childhood?

1485
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:00,080
Or you would say, why was that a concern?

1486
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:04,640
Yes. But they have to be sort of unearthed organically, I think, or else

1487
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:07,840
I would shut down or go into sort of a fugue state

1488
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:10,520
if I were to try to bring any other ones up right now.

1489
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:14,280
If they're related to an IP, that's how well, yes.

1490
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:16,040
And all which I imagine a lot of them are.

1491
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:17,760
I know 100 percent.

1492
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:20,040
Oh, I had a similar thing where like

1493
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:24,200
we were at a toy store and I wanted to get an action figure

1494
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:29,840
that had like a rocket launcher, like so something that went into a spring

1495
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,840
loaded launcher. Yes.

1496
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:36,600
And my mom was like, no, no, I don't think you should have those launching things.

1497
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:37,720
That's probably not good.

1498
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:40,160
You don't want to get something in the eye or hit your brother or something.

1499
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:42,240
And I'm like, what are you talking about?

1500
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:49,000
I have two dozen things that shoot missiles like I have Power Rangers,

1501
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:53,440
Ghostbusters, Ninjas, they all shoot like why are you suddenly?

1502
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,320
Oh, and you know what? I'm remembering now.

1503
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:59,520
I believe it was a last action hero action figure,

1504
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,240
which another movie I did not see.

1505
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:05,800
I would have all these toys from trading cards for PG 13 movies

1506
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:07,520
that I was not allowed to see.

1507
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:11,160
And I have no idea why that day she's just like, no, you're not getting something

1508
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:13,800
that shoots. And that was the rule from then on.

1509
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:17,960
And I think it's probably just like, I don't want to buy another piece of garbage

1510
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:20,480
where you just got one.

1511
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:25,520
But I don't know if she had seen a news broadcast of like someone firing

1512
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:29,200
a GI Joe missile into someone's eye or something.

1513
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:33,000
But I would be the nearest excuse to not pay for this.

1514
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:36,560
Yeah, I would be more concerned about the thing kids do

1515
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,800
where they're like overcome with emotion.

1516
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:40,560
They just like throw something.

1517
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:44,840
It's like I was like, well, we're not going to stop just throwing stuff

1518
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:46,440
at each other when we're mad.

1519
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:47,960
You have two boys.

1520
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:49,840
What do you think is going to happen?

1521
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:51,720
What we're put on this earth to do?

1522
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:54,440
Yeah, that's where we're good.

1523
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:59,240
That's the other thing. We were good boys, like rarely got in trouble at school.

1524
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:02,640
And it's like, what are these parameters you're establishing?

1525
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,080
What is your concern?

1526
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,680
Are we are we maybe unearthing?

1527
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:07,600
Because I think I'm with you guys on this.

1528
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:11,840
That obviously we, you know, we now go by the moniker of good boys.

1529
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:13,160
We're always very well behaved.

1530
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:18,280
But you guys find that despite being good boys, it was often still not good enough.

1531
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:25,520
You're like, compared to other kids, mom and dad.

1532
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:31,280
I think you may be hitting on something that's a very common feeling on this podcast.

1533
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:32,760
Yeah, I think that's right.

1534
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:36,320
I think that sort of feels like you were like, put these other.

1535
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:39,600
That's I said this all the time, all the time.

1536
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:44,840
These other kids are dirty, like they're dirty and not it's like because it's like

1537
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:48,320
like their parents are rich, but these kids are still filthy.

1538
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:53,080
Like, yeah, and they're like, would you prefer I was that

1539
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:55,320
a little dirty kid?

1540
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:57,040
Let's see how you like it.

1541
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:00,560
Am I look, am I still using this argument to this day?

1542
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:02,880
I might be, I might be.

1543
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,400
Well, do you want me like them?

1544
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:06,200
What would you prefer?

1545
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:07,880
Have I said that in the last six months?

1546
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:09,600
Yes. If I said in the last six weeks.

1547
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:11,200
Yes, also.

1548
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,680
I don't know that that ever ends.

1549
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:16,400
I think dynamics end up being the same your whole life.

1550
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:19,240
I'm not sort of fighting the same battle.

1551
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:22,160
I'm not going to be better because I get a real estate license, OK?

1552
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:24,840
I'm not going to law school.

1553
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:27,080
I'm not going back to business school.

1554
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:29,280
I can't go back to what do you want me to do?

1555
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:32,120
Own a business like that's riskier.

1556
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:34,320
Look, I'm a comedy writer.

1557
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:37,080
I'm sorry that it's not on a show that your parents have heard

1558
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:39,600
or that your friends have heard of.

1559
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,800
It's hard to get a job on The Mentalist,

1560
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:44,040
and it's not not really what I'm trying to do.

1561
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:46,120
I'm thrilled.

1562
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:49,280
I'm thrilled to be on a thing that is canceled immediately.

1563
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:51,600
Like, I'm thrilled to be on one episode.

1564
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:56,440
We're all fighting to be on the people to be on canceled platforms.

1565
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:59,840
Mom and dad, people listen to this podcast.

1566
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:02,560
We do a podcast that there are some people that listen to it.

1567
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:04,560
That is actually a thing.

1568
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:07,960
Or my argument, people listen to podcasts at all

1569
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,120
because it doesn't come in on your flip phone.

1570
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:13,520
Doesn't mean it's not a viable medium.

1571
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:15,800
You saw it. People showed up at a live show.

1572
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:18,320
That doesn't just happen.

1573
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:20,000
Not just like off the street.

1574
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,840
We didn't pay anybody to come in.

1575
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:25,240
I guess, as with Batman and the Joker and the Penguin,

1576
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:29,160
our battles with our nemeses,

1577
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:33,760
our arch nemeses will go on and on till the end of time.

1578
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:35,640
We're dying.

1579
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:38,360
It's like Joker says we're destined to do this forever.

1580
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:44,520
You and I are destined to do this forever.

1581
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:48,480
Big breakthroughs here in hour and 15 into the Batman rides.

1582
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:51,840
Do you do you want to know how we got these scars?

1583
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:53,160
We were not.

1584
01:20:56,240 --> 01:21:02,160
We were denied napkin blankets and and missile launchers.

1585
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:05,080
It's way missile launchers.

1586
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:08,360
I this is the first I've been tempted to

1587
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:12,600
walk out of the room and take a break during.

1588
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:13,360
Yeah, sure.

1589
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,200
Where to go from there.

1590
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:17,520
Now we just got to start saying names of rides again.

1591
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:20,880
Yeah, well, I'm panicked.

1592
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:22,960
Find one of my links here.

1593
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:28,840
I mean, did any I think Batman the ride was my my kind of favorite

1594
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:31,400
that I call that I called before we started recording.

1595
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:33,600
Like we got to make sure to talk about this.

1596
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,080
Well, you know, start with it.

1597
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:39,080
I don't know if you guys have other notable like good or bad

1598
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:42,320
like ones where you're like, I feel like I got to talk about this one.

1599
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:43,240
Well, how about this?

1600
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:46,600
I don't have a time to say about it, but there, you know, we said

1601
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:50,680
it's pretty rare that any of these attractions have actors from the films.

1602
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:53,040
As I say, usually the Batman films are populated

1603
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:55,360
with the greatest, biggest actors of all time.

1604
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:58,320
But there is one there's one that I could think of

1605
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:02,240
that actually has a pre show with somebody from the movie.

1606
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:07,560
And that is the Dark Knight Coaster, which is at three of the Six Flags.

1607
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:09,760
Great America, Great Adventure, Six Flags, Mexico.

1608
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:14,960
And that has an appearance from Harvey Dent as played by Aaron Eckhart.

1609
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:19,440
Yeah. Did you know that there was there is a pre show with Aaron

1610
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:20,920
Eckhart doing a part from that?

1611
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:25,520
That's like the most legitimate thing from the movie world, I feel like in

1612
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:27,960
in any of these.

1613
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:30,000
And it's cool. It's good.

1614
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
It's kind of like

1615
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,360
the writing in it is like Nolan Light.

1616
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:37,080
It's all that like philosophy kind of.

1617
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:40,880
He sort of like reiterates the the kinds of things that the

1618
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:44,000
the Nolan Batman characters would say.

1619
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,880
And he does a he's doing a press conference.

1620
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:50,000
But then the Joker hijacks the feed.

1621
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:55,520
So it starts like cutting it up and sort of like almost in like a right wing

1622
01:22:55,520 --> 01:23:01,600
media Twitter way, like using his words against him, using the power of editing.

1623
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:06,200
And then the feed gets hijacked entirely and Harvey Dent gets ushered away.

1624
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:08,720
And then the room goes dark and it comes back on.

1625
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:13,120
Well, depending on which one you're at in at least one of them, then

1626
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:15,040
like the room goes dark.

1627
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:16,480
And then what comes back up, the lighting is different.

1628
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:20,880
It says ha ha ha everywhere in like day glow lighting.

1629
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:24,960
And, you know, that's cool.

1630
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:29,520
Like then then what follows is essentially like a wild mouse coaster indoors.

1631
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:32,080
But that pre show, I'm like this here we go.

1632
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:35,480
This feels a little bit like Disney and Universal.

1633
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:37,880
It's one actor from the movie.

1634
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:39,680
They like created a panic.

1635
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:42,600
It's like, oh, what if we were in a place that the Heath Ledger

1636
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:46,880
Joker was creating havoc in and we're trapped?

1637
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:47,640
There's nowhere to go now.

1638
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:49,960
Now we got to go on the scary machine.

1639
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:51,880
So I actually think they did a good job with this.

1640
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:53,880
I this is kind of cool.

1641
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:54,840
Yeah, that's cool.

1642
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:59,080
I I would say like for your question, and I kind of felt like I was putting it down

1643
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:02,280
a little too much, the WB world, the night flight, the practical stuff

1644
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:04,720
in some of the screens, it's close.

1645
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:08,160
I don't want to sound like I'm so talking so much shit on it,

1646
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:12,160
but it is close, like even like poison ivy coming toward the screen.

1647
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:14,800
It's not bad. It's pretty I got that.

1648
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:20,560
I like that. That feels closer to being right and closer to an experience.

1649
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:23,080
Well, we should explain this one from the ground up, maybe this.

1650
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:27,400
Yeah, this is in Warner Brothers, Warner Brothers World Abu Dhabi.

1651
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:32,640
It's a pretty recently opened park that is indoors

1652
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:36,280
and they have a whole indoor Gotham City area.

1653
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:41,160
And this ride is sort of a culmination of it, which is very,

1654
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:43,000
I believe Harry Potter.

1655
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,320
I think this is a kooka arm

1656
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:50,240
whipping you around between screens and some like transitional practical sets.

1657
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:52,880
And there's a little bit of real animatronics in it.

1658
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:58,040
It's yeah, it's hard to find.

1659
01:24:58,040 --> 01:25:01,240
As with a lot of these, it's hard to find like a really good ride through of it

1660
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:04,280
because it is 3D.

1661
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:06,720
So the videos are a little confusing to watch.

1662
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:11,720
But it's yeah, this is this one's maybe the closest to me

1663
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:15,480
for being like a modern current e-ticket.

1664
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:20,480
You know, I like I bet it's fun to be on in ways that we can't even tell.

1665
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:24,080
There's probably like 4D kind of elements that we aren't aware of.

1666
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:28,160
Right. So I do think it gets from just watching it.

1667
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:33,240
I think it gets close and like they it has a cool cue

1668
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:36,320
and there's some interesting details and fun stuff.

1669
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:39,440
And then, of course, everything, as you were saying, like everything video wise,

1670
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:40,520
it's hard to tell.

1671
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:43,040
There's like I found videos of just the cue.

1672
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:46,400
I don't know. I didn't find a great comprehensive video that might be there.

1673
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:50,840
I just didn't see it of you going through like a very Nolan Wayne tech building.

1674
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:54,680
And like the premises, you're you're all tech experts.

1675
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:57,920
Well, you're you're yeah, that's really strange.

1676
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:01,760
You're I think going to take a minute

1677
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:05,200
to take a meeting at Wayne Tech.

1678
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:09,360
You're and you get in an elevator that's going to take you up to the 53rd floor

1679
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:11,120
to have a meeting up there.

1680
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:13,960
You're having a general with Bruce Wayne, I guess.

1681
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:18,440
And but then there's a little glitch in the feed.

1682
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:21,280
And then Batman appears on a screen that you couldn't see before

1683
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:25,680
and tells you that he's been watching you and he knows that you're all tech experts.

1684
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:28,000
So actually, he needs you somewhere different.

1685
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:31,400
And then change, of course, you end up in the Batcave.

1686
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:34,360
Yes. And there's a the video I was watching.

1687
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:37,440
It's like tired dad, a couple of kids.

1688
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:40,160
And Batman goes, I can tell you're all tech experts.

1689
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:43,240
And then there are no no no emotion on anyone's face.

1690
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:45,760
Like, like, oh, wow, it's so cool or whatever.

1691
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:49,240
It's like, uh, like no one's even paying attention to what Batman is telling them.

1692
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:51,080
Very funny. Yeah, it doesn't.

1693
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:55,360
I feel like a lot of those videos you're seeing these things played empty rooms.

1694
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:59,000
I can't tell if these that what we keep hearing is that Warner Brothers World

1695
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:00,880
Abu Dhabi is pretty cool.

1696
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:04,800
Like it's like it is like it is kind of next level

1697
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:08,880
and like a a pretty good use of all these IP like Warner Brothers

1698
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:12,200
or like Looney Tunes rather, where you complain that there's not great rides

1699
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:15,560
about them or of these properties in the Six Flags parks.

1700
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:18,120
I don't know. All the videos are cool.

1701
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:22,880
But then we're never going to go like is anyone going?

1702
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:26,640
That I there's a lot holding you back.

1703
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:28,440
I feel like, yeah, it's these things.

1704
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:30,600
I can't tell. I mean, yeah, there's you were saying the indoor,

1705
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:33,800
like it's an indoor park and there's a Gotham City area.

1706
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:35,360
There's like a metropolis area.

1707
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:39,360
And that's pretty impressive as far as like from the scale

1708
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:40,800
you can see in a YouTube video.

1709
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:43,120
It's like, yeah, that feels right. It's dark all the time.

1710
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:47,400
It's like you see the Wayne Tech building and it looks impressive

1711
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:48,880
for an indoor thing.

1712
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:50,920
But then you get inside the queue and you're like, this should be the

1713
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:53,600
this should be packed. This should be your 90 minute wait.

1714
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:56,600
And there's like no one in line ever on any of the videos.

1715
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:59,360
And you're like, how's this doing?

1716
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:01,120
This was pre all the stuff.

1717
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:02,840
This was a great pandemic.

1718
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:05,040
So who knows? I don't know.

1719
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:07,560
But they're like they're getting closer.

1720
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:09,840
And that's part of what I said at the beginning about.

1721
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:13,000
All right. There are good Batman, rather.

1722
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:16,560
Where we used to be, I think a cool one, as I said, in Germany, Australia.

1723
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:19,280
There seems to be some good stuff happening in Abu Dhabi.

1724
01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:23,200
But America, we're just really suffering from these

1725
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:25,720
these and I mean suffer.

1726
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:28,040
We're really suffering by not having Batman rights.

1727
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:31,320
But we're like we are the victims, essentially, of these

1728
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:33,480
this six flags licensing deal

1729
01:28:34,160 --> 01:28:38,760
that doesn't get us the universal level caliber of of Batman attractions.

1730
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:42,360
Right. And I mean, there's been, you know, Warner Brothers had

1731
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:44,800
that fully owned six flags at a certain point.

1732
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:48,440
I forget if it was fully majority owned or a lot of it.

1733
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:51,040
Yeah, I think I forgot that the Time Warner bought

1734
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:54,000
at least the controlling share in around 92.

1735
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,600
But then they don't own it now.

1736
01:28:56,840 --> 01:28:58,840
We've talked about this at length, I'm sure.

1737
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:01,480
But like it's just always been stuck.

1738
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:04,920
It was almost of course, we didn't we're not even we haven't even talked about

1739
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:07,520
how it was almost an island of adventure.

1740
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:11,360
And there was going to be a Batman penguin coaster competing there.

1741
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:13,560
Yeah. Well, we know we got we got time to.

1742
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:14,480
Sure. No, we can't.

1743
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:18,360
I'm saying like it's like it's been it's been it's with all this stuff.

1744
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:21,760
And we've said it before, like it's right place, right time

1745
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:26,200
for certain properties to make a certain level of right.

1746
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:28,360
So it's like it's been in the wrong spot.

1747
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:31,800
They couldn't get out of negotiations for Islands of Adventure.

1748
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:33,720
So that fell apart.

1749
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:36,040
It's never been right now.

1750
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:39,520
I think we're the closest to it maybe being possible.

1751
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:41,800
But six because six is trying.

1752
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:44,560
Justice League was trying to do more of this.

1753
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,880
They still didn't quite get there.

1754
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:48,840
Yeah. And well, we may.

1755
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:50,920
Yeah. Justice League, I guess, is its own.

1756
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,800
I mean, I got to go on that ride.

1757
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:53,680
Oh, yeah. I'll go.

1758
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:56,160
I'll go to measure round and only go on that and then leave.

1759
01:29:56,280 --> 01:29:57,480
Probably. Sure.

1760
01:29:57,480 --> 01:30:00,600
Well, you want to go to you'll go to the lounge and stuff like you'll go

1761
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:04,240
to all those places that we're going to go to Johnny Rockets. Yeah.

1762
01:30:04,280 --> 01:30:05,760
It's a job.

1763
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:09,720
And then and then we'll trick you to go on Twisted Colossus.

1764
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:11,800
Oh, yeah.

1765
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,320
Maybe I do Batman the Ride.

1766
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:16,040
Maybe it's I don't know.

1767
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:18,720
I think you could handle Riddler's Revenge easy to Riddler's Revenge.

1768
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:19,840
Not a big problem.

1769
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:21,200
OK, it's fun.

1770
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:23,080
And is that the stand up one?

1771
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:24,600
Yeah. Yeah.

1772
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:26,560
But it's not. I'm not good on that one.

1773
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:28,000
Too little.

1774
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:32,760
No, I mean, the bicycle seat destroys my that one is the one that destroys

1775
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:36,400
my genitals. Twisted Colossus destroyed your genitals.

1776
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:40,400
Well, they both they both weren't like the easiest on my genitals.

1777
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:44,840
The twisted Colossus was more aggressive to my genitals at that point.

1778
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:48,400
But neither of you are going to be Chris O'Donnell level

1779
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:50,960
the more you go on these things.

1780
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:53,000
Yeah, no, it's it's not going to happen.

1781
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,640
But, Jason, you're comfortable on Tatsu.

1782
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:56,120
Yes. Where you're flying like Superman.

1783
01:30:56,120 --> 01:30:57,680
Oh, I love Tatsu. Yeah.

1784
01:30:57,680 --> 01:31:01,160
That's wild. That feels so scary to go on where I'm at.

1785
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,920
And arms are just like floating.

1786
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:05,600
That's wild.

1787
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:09,280
I think it was just the novelty of it kind of carried it.

1788
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:10,400
The uniqueness. Sure.

1789
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:12,200
I was just delighted by.

1790
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:15,040
Well, we'll see. Look, we went on Hangtime together.

1791
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:17,880
That's not me. I watched it.

1792
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:19,640
I'm checked out of the whole thing.

1793
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:22,720
That's coaster hang time, which, by the way, is only the only scary part

1794
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:23,760
is just the start of it.

1795
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:26,320
The rest is a perfectly fun coaster.

1796
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:28,840
Yeah, I have no problem on past a certain point. Yeah.

1797
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:33,360
But the first part is pants shittingly scary.

1798
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:37,200
Sounds like it. Yep.

1799
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:39,760
Well, so yeah, so the whole

1800
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:42,880
I feel like it really unlocks

1801
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:45,640
the mystery, it solves the riddle, if you will.

1802
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:49,280
When you as you're going, like, why are there not better

1803
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:51,840
Batman attractions, especially in America?

1804
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:55,760
Oh, my God, because they were trying to do it

1805
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:59,880
at what became Islands of Adventure Universal was trying to do this

1806
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:02,320
in the late 80s, early 90s.

1807
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:05,000
They negotiated it.

1808
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,160
They could not make a breakthrough on it.

1809
01:32:07,160 --> 01:32:10,800
The Universal and Warner were fighting bitterly and

1810
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:13,800
didn't come up with a breakthrough.

1811
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:16,200
And thus, we don't have these.

1812
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:18,000
And they they went off to Six Flags.

1813
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:21,200
Yeah. But so like finding out that there was

1814
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:25,280
it really in a way, I think the premise of the park changed.

1815
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:28,840
Maybe it was never going to be Islands of Adventure with a Gotham city.

1816
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:31,440
But in a way, I don't like

1817
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:34,880
I guess the whole thing is that there was the initial premise

1818
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:37,000
of the park was cartoon world.

1819
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:40,280
It was all going to be animated properties.

1820
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:42,640
Seuss was part of it always.

1821
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:47,760
Seuss and Popeyes and, oh, man, we got to do a whole cartoon world thing.

1822
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:50,640
The the unbuilt Popeye stuff is insane.

1823
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:52,840
Like a whole Sweet Haven village.

1824
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:56,000
What? In addition to the Malta one?

1825
01:32:56,840 --> 01:32:59,480
Oh, an indoor boat ride.

1826
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:01,960
Build rap barges was always happening.

1827
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:04,360
Of course, the original Dudley do right plans.

1828
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:10,360
That was always still is a dual shoot, a dual log flume.

1829
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:12,680
But I think we talked about the buzzsaw.

1830
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:14,400
It was going to cut your log in half.

1831
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:16,280
The logs in half. So cool. Yeah.

1832
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:18,560
The Looney Tunes stuff looked awesome, too.

1833
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:22,800
That was the big the thing that had to change is they couldn't do Looney

1834
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:27,200
Tunes and they couldn't do DC Super Heroes, which it was going to be like half

1835
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:32,480
Superman, half Batman, which is fitting because I forget who says this.

1836
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:37,200
But there's a thinking that Metropolis Superman City,

1837
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:39,320
it represents New York City during the day.

1838
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:42,080
And Gotham is supposed to be New York City at night.

1839
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:48,960
And so splitting that park with these two iconic characters,

1840
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:50,840
it's like a given.

1841
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:55,360
And so much of the ideas seem to be good.

1842
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:59,760
Like the Superman ride, so much of the Superman ride ended up in the Spider-Man ride.

1843
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:03,680
Right. And it seems like Batman still wouldn't have had the ride

1844
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:05,760
we're looking for completely.

1845
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:07,040
No, I don't know.

1846
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:09,840
I think some of these could have if they really did.

1847
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:11,800
Well, I think could have been cool as hell.

1848
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:14,600
Would have been certainly better than the majority of stuff.

1849
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:18,120
It's just like I think the Superman ride would have been more

1850
01:34:18,120 --> 01:34:21,080
the Spider-Man ride with like that would have been the full experience.

1851
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:24,120
Like Batman, they were saying they were going to do a penguin.

1852
01:34:24,120 --> 01:34:26,840
I have it written down. They were going to do a Batman penguin coaster.

1853
01:34:28,360 --> 01:34:28,720
Where is it?

1854
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:30,880
Different cues like you would.

1855
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:34,520
Yeah, you would load in either the Batcave or in the penguins layer,

1856
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:35,880
depending on what you pick.

1857
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:37,880
So that stuff all seems like it would be awesome.

1858
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:39,400
And then it was just sort of a roller coaster.

1859
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:41,040
I'm sure it would have other elements as well.

1860
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:45,600
Well, no, I think this was a like from the various videos and descriptions,

1861
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:48,280
it was like three show buildings.

1862
01:34:48,280 --> 01:34:49,960
You keep going in and out of sets.

1863
01:34:49,960 --> 01:34:52,240
You see different stuff on the two tracks.

1864
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:57,360
And I believe Spielberg's suggestion guns.

1865
01:34:57,360 --> 01:34:59,640
Why not throw guns on there, too?

1866
01:34:59,640 --> 01:35:03,000
So it was like in hypothetically, this was a or is this suggestion

1867
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:06,200
that you keep score some that you get a score at the end of it?

1868
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:10,960
So it's supposed to be a shooting coaster, which sound I mean,

1869
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:14,960
I don't like to me, everything I saw from this and just from the look of what

1870
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:19,480
these these little cool boxy bat wings and with that, they were going to go more

1871
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:21,120
penguin forward on it.

1872
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:23,920
Penguins, I believe, was the terminology.

1873
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:27,560
Which I think this is the one I'm this thing seems pretty fucking cool to me.

1874
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:30,720
Well, the video I watched that made it didn't make it seem as cool,

1875
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:34,800
but it still looked better than most of the stuff as far as theming and cues

1876
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:38,640
and stuff. But yeah, you're just I mean, yeah, it would have just depended, I guess,

1877
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:43,720
how how how fast it went, like how much show, how many show elements

1878
01:35:43,720 --> 01:35:46,960
you could put in it that you could actually see while you were actually competing

1879
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:50,320
against another car. So in a fast situation. Right. Right.

1880
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:55,440
There was also a great of a Batman and Robin stunt show in the lagoon.

1881
01:35:56,320 --> 01:36:00,360
Yeah. There there was going to be some sort of body of water.

1882
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:02,480
That that was always the case.

1883
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:05,680
So there'd be a stunt show in the water.

1884
01:36:06,040 --> 01:36:11,120
And then Joker's Madhouse, which was an indoor coaster on a wildcat

1885
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:14,320
wild mouse, wild mouse, excuse me. Yeah.

1886
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:18,600
On a wild mouse track with a false ending,

1887
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:23,600
with a like ride broken kind of ending, which eventually worked its way

1888
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:27,440
into the mummy ride. Right. Yeah. Right. Right.

1889
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:31,200
Yeah. There was so there was supposed to be a track out at some point,

1890
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:35,560
but which deceives the path to what where it becomes.

1891
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:37,360
I think a drop is what they were trying to do.

1892
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:39,880
They were like maybe similar to Hagrid's.

1893
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:43,120
It was just going to go straight down at a point instead of, you know,

1894
01:36:43,120 --> 01:36:45,640
veering off track. Right.

1895
01:36:45,640 --> 01:36:48,600
This this sounds really cool.

1896
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:52,680
There's also like then there's I think Theme Park University

1897
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:56,200
is one of the sites that has found all this stuff and a number of good videos

1898
01:36:56,200 --> 01:36:58,320
on YouTube if you're curious.

1899
01:36:58,320 --> 01:37:01,400
But like there's a lot of concept art floating around for this stuff

1900
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:02,240
and what things would have been.

1901
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:07,400
They even fleshed out what the the shops and restaurants would have been.

1902
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:11,400
We're going to have Joker's Diner, where you got your food served to you

1903
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:13,720
in a Jack in the Box box.

1904
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,280
Penguin Pizza.

1905
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:21,120
I have no further information about it, but the name is great.

1906
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:23,600
I'd love to try some Penguin Pizza.

1907
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:26,440
Not a fish sandwich or a fish place.

1908
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:28,240
But maybe you're getting anchovies there.

1909
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:32,960
I don't know. Yeah, maybe until again, until per usual.

1910
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:35,800
They realize the theme park audiences, at least in the 90s,

1911
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:39,120
don't want anything. Just cheese and pepperoni. That's it. Yep.

1912
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:41,680
That's what we sell at Penguin's Pizza.

1913
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:44,320
Those are Penguin's favorite flavors.

1914
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:46,720
But there is also

1915
01:37:46,720 --> 01:37:48,200
we just pull this up.

1916
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:49,960
So we're all looking at the same screen.

1917
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:53,200
I don't know where all this text comes from, these these plans.

1918
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:56,520
But one thing to point out, the Bat Cave,

1919
01:37:56,760 --> 01:37:58,440
which is described as a video.

1920
01:37:58,440 --> 01:37:59,520
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1921
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:02,120
Club. Wow. My God. Yeah.

1922
01:38:02,120 --> 01:38:04,360
Yeah. Which would have had, I think, a fake out.

1923
01:38:04,360 --> 01:38:07,880
And like you're going into Wayne Manor, similar to the ride that ended up there.

1924
01:38:07,880 --> 01:38:10,800
You're going to Wayne Manor, but then you end up in the Bat Cave instead.

1925
01:38:11,640 --> 01:38:14,640
I think we're going to be like for sure there was going to be a big visible

1926
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:17,880
bat signal as part of all this perennially in the sky.

1927
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:22,400
But yeah, fog and themed rock tables.

1928
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:25,760
This is a fake rock environment nightclub.

1929
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:30,320
I mean, this this seems amazing.

1930
01:38:30,520 --> 01:38:35,880
This is yeah, this is this is where I wish a whole scene had sort of developed.

1931
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:39,800
They had made this and like as if it was Pleasure Island, a whole like,

1932
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:44,880
you know, generation defining scene had happened at the bat cave

1933
01:38:45,320 --> 01:38:47,720
at Universal Islands of Adventure.

1934
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:50,040
We talked about it in our Pleasure Island episode a while ago.

1935
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:54,160
The Facebook is a Facebook group of people that partied at Pleasure Island

1936
01:38:54,160 --> 01:38:58,960
a lot for years, and they still are very active on this Facebook page.

1937
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:00,400
This looms large.

1938
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:03,440
I wish the Bat Cave was the same deal

1939
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:06,080
where people would be like, man, remember the Bat Cave?

1940
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:10,040
Those were the days you'd put on your black leather with the nipples

1941
01:39:10,040 --> 01:39:12,200
and you'd go party at the Bat Cave.

1942
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:16,240
You take your special lady to Catwoman's Lair.

1943
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:19,200
Get her a cigarette case and a faux fur.

1944
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:22,400
This was that was the other thing I was pulling up for.

1945
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:25,360
Yeah, that there was like a high end

1946
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:29,520
Catwoman store where you bought like

1947
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:33,520
late 80s chic women's style.

1948
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:39,560
Yeah, high fashion hats, exotic lighters, fans, day planners.

1949
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:43,840
I love this sort of like

1950
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:47,720
woman on the go, like Wall Street era.

1951
01:39:48,200 --> 01:39:51,760
This this sounds and say I would love if this was there in a velvet walls.

1952
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:56,040
And you could buy fake furs and stoles and capes.

1953
01:39:56,320 --> 01:40:00,800
You buy like a big 80s lady cape in a theme park.

1954
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:02,680
Really wish this was there.

1955
01:40:02,680 --> 01:40:04,480
Yeah, your mom wants to go to Island's Adventure

1956
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:06,960
because she needs to get a new mink fake mink stole.

1957
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:08,760
Like what?

1958
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:10,640
I guess maybe.

1959
01:40:10,640 --> 01:40:13,440
I mean, if the market we didn't know if no one's doing it right now.

1960
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:15,560
So we don't know if it would have been failure.

1961
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:17,640
No one's tried this in a theme park.

1962
01:40:17,640 --> 01:40:20,600
Mom needs a new very wide hat

1963
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:25,920
in a fine and a faux fur cigarette case.

1964
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:28,320
And it did.

1965
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:31,480
I feel like I heard a story once where it's like, well, you know,

1966
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:36,400
whatever the big thing everyone has to have is often stolen.

1967
01:40:36,440 --> 01:40:39,400
Now it's smartphones before that cell phones and beepers.

1968
01:40:39,640 --> 01:40:43,760
But I feel like I heard someone talk about like, oh, yes, stores used to get

1969
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:47,600
day planner stolen all the time or like a little black books.

1970
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:49,880
Because everyone needed to have something like that.

1971
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:51,440
Sure. You know?

1972
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:56,560
Yeah, I wonder when that whenever the phones,

1973
01:40:56,560 --> 01:41:00,880
smartphones started and day planners thefts went dramatically down.

1974
01:41:01,200 --> 01:41:05,440
But you know, villain themed day planner store and you're asking for that.

1975
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:08,520
Yeah, because everyone feels so much more villainous

1976
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:10,360
when they're shopping in these stores.

1977
01:41:10,360 --> 01:41:12,560
My inner cat woman is coming out.

1978
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:15,040
I'm surprised that they didn't,

1979
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:18,560
because this seems like a little bit more adult as far as what they ended up

1980
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:20,400
putting there with Marvel Superhero Island.

1981
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:23,400
I'm wondering why they didn't then just take these ideas

1982
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:25,520
and put them just use a marvel.

1983
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:30,120
Like, why didn't they use like mojo or arcade?

1984
01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:33,440
These X-Men villains, why didn't they have a club with their like

1985
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:39,000
their characters on the front door or the Hellfire Club?

1986
01:41:39,680 --> 01:41:44,000
Well, which is Scott, just to quickly educate you on what the Hellfire Club was.

1987
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:48,680
It was a club where like mutants would dress up as,

1988
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:51,360
what would you say, colonial era?

1989
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:56,680
Well, when it was like a rich and famous private like high end club,

1990
01:41:56,680 --> 01:41:58,240
there's still some fancy clubs.

1991
01:41:58,240 --> 01:42:01,960
But then the inner circle of the club, the bad guys would dress.

1992
01:42:01,960 --> 01:42:04,560
Yeah. In like regal Victorian wear.

1993
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:07,000
Powder wigs. Yeah.

1994
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:10,680
It's where Emma Frost comes from and the character

1995
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:13,080
Kevin Bacon plays in X-Men First Class.

1996
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:16,480
It's also lost. Sorry.

1997
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:19,280
He mad. I know he was in it.

1998
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:22,160
It's based on some downtown sex clubs that

1999
01:42:22,160 --> 01:42:25,680
certainly based on a real would go to in the 70s.

2000
01:42:25,680 --> 01:42:28,440
Based on a real fetish sex club.

2001
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:30,920
And then Jason and I was like 10 year olds who were like,

2002
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:32,640
oh, the Hellfire Club.

2003
01:42:32,640 --> 01:42:35,520
OK, cool. Like the fancy villains.

2004
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,440
I got it. Yeah.

2005
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:40,160
They like history. Right.

2006
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,920
So why wasn't there a real Hellfire Club is what I'm saying

2007
01:42:44,240 --> 01:42:46,200
in Marvel Superhero Islands.

2008
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:47,360
I think that one's fine.

2009
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:50,440
I think maybe you got to skip the Hellfire Club from the sound of it.

2010
01:42:50,920 --> 01:42:51,560
I don't know.

2011
01:42:51,560 --> 01:42:55,000
I mean, it didn't have to be as intense as it might have been in real life.

2012
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,160
I'm just saying there were ways to do it.

2013
01:42:57,160 --> 01:42:59,800
I mean, who would in the Marvel universe have a fancy hat?

2014
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:03,160
I mean, there's the there's the ripoff catwoman Black Cat,

2015
01:43:03,960 --> 01:43:06,920
character in Spider-Man called Black Cat, who was a thief as well.

2016
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:09,680
We'll be getting movies of all these soon.

2017
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:11,840
Oh, I think Black Cat is on the way, right?

2018
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:14,040
I think that's coming. Yeah.

2019
01:43:14,040 --> 01:43:15,760
Mary Jane is a model sometimes.

2020
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:17,720
Sometimes she is a big cat.

2021
01:43:17,720 --> 01:43:20,080
Oh, yeah. Mary Jane's boutique. That would be great.

2022
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:22,160
I just don't know why they went with like,

2023
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:25,160
yeah, throw a comic store in Fantastic Four cafeteria.

2024
01:43:25,320 --> 01:43:27,960
Like, they got lazy is what I'm saying.

2025
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:32,360
Yeah. But in a big science is pow where it's a comic world.

2026
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:34,240
They're done.

2027
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:37,920
They were going to they were going for a high end thing with this Batman land.

2028
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:39,880
And then they obviously switched, switched

2029
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:42,000
what they wanted to do with it.

2030
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:46,760
Well, 90s Gotham was so fancy like they they remade the

2031
01:43:46,760 --> 01:43:49,600
they redesigned the Sony lot around this time to build.

2032
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:52,280
This needs to feel like Gotham City and Batman.

2033
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:55,160
Like this was like it's like

2034
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:59,360
hearkening back to the 40s in the fanciest way.

2035
01:43:59,680 --> 01:44:04,160
Everything should feel like, you know, where the waynes walk out of.

2036
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:07,680
And you should be able to buy pearls that break away.

2037
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:09,560
Collapse easily.

2038
01:44:09,560 --> 01:44:10,840
Your parents. Yeah.

2039
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:14,480
A simulation of your parents getting blown away in crime alley.

2040
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:20,840
And you get everyone had that opportunity to like, all right.

2041
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:23,840
You like we're pulling your mom and dad from the crowd.

2042
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:27,120
And there's what it would be like if the Joker killed them.

2043
01:44:27,400 --> 01:44:30,280
Coming soon to Disney's Avengers campus.

2044
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:36,080
Pay an upcharge and get trapped in an iceberg like Captain America for decades.

2045
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:40,000
So everyone you know and love is very old when you come out.

2046
01:44:40,720 --> 01:44:44,680
I really yeah, they should really do this with tragic superhero origins.

2047
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:48,080
We should be able to experience those in the theme parks.

2048
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:50,400
We want a next level experience.

2049
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:53,400
So it has to be Uncle Ben dying in Spider-Man.

2050
01:44:53,400 --> 01:44:54,120
You want that?

2051
01:44:54,120 --> 01:44:56,600
And you didn't you watched as the guy ran by.

2052
01:44:56,600 --> 01:44:58,640
He didn't do anything and you could have.

2053
01:44:58,640 --> 01:45:00,240
We want that experience.

2054
01:45:00,240 --> 01:45:04,000
Experience Wanda's trauma on a new e-ticket attraction.

2055
01:45:04,120 --> 01:45:05,120
That's right.

2056
01:45:06,840 --> 01:45:08,160
We need these experience.

2057
01:45:08,160 --> 01:45:09,640
We need next level theme park.

2058
01:45:09,640 --> 01:45:12,680
And we're not just saying that because we're complaining about our parents earlier.

2059
01:45:12,680 --> 01:45:14,640
We don't actually want the Joker to kill them.

2060
01:45:14,640 --> 01:45:15,720
We just want a fun thing.

2061
01:45:15,720 --> 01:45:17,400
We watch some pearls fall.

2062
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:19,040
We want pearls to fall. Right.

2063
01:45:19,040 --> 01:45:22,600
Simulated. You know, it's these are the simulated experiences.

2064
01:45:23,080 --> 01:45:26,280
Can I quickly play this thing from Dubai world?

2065
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:28,360
Speaking of get your parents involved.

2066
01:45:28,360 --> 01:45:29,960
Oh, yeah. Yeah, please. Oh, yes.

2067
01:45:29,960 --> 01:45:33,240
So there's not just rides in the Dubai Warner Brothers thing.

2068
01:45:33,240 --> 01:45:34,720
There's a little show.

2069
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:38,480
So a lot of people have played the Joker and.

2070
01:45:39,680 --> 01:45:41,200
I love this.

2071
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:42,520
I don't know this gentleman's name.

2072
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:44,040
He seems to be their Joker.

2073
01:45:44,040 --> 01:45:48,400
He plays this Joker as if he's Jerry Lewis in our six of a telethon.

2074
01:45:50,120 --> 01:45:51,240
And I love it.

2075
01:45:51,240 --> 01:45:52,080
I think it's great.

2076
01:45:52,080 --> 01:45:54,920
I think it's a great take on the character, because why would you want to rip off?

2077
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:55,920
Anyway, here I'll play this thing.

2078
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:57,280
It's in the right spot.

2079
01:45:57,280 --> 01:45:59,080
Like this one.

2080
01:45:59,080 --> 01:46:01,280
And it's Harley Quinn.

2081
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:07,360
With you. Yeah.

2082
01:46:08,600 --> 01:46:10,640
I was going to use this, but I'm already scared his hair away.

2083
01:46:13,240 --> 01:46:15,520
I like them, so you're going to stay up here.

2084
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:17,520
Well done, my dear. Let's take the guest.

2085
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:19,080
Let's prepare him for the grand finale.

2086
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:20,880
But kids, this is an ugly shirt.

2087
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:22,040
It's hurting my face.

2088
01:46:22,040 --> 01:46:25,880
After the show, you buy him a Joker shirt so I can pay rent on that funhouse.

2089
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:28,400
Go, go, go. Ugly shirt. Go, go, go.

2090
01:46:29,120 --> 01:46:32,760
Let me take this opportunity to thank you all for coming.

2091
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:36,560
The real question now is

2092
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:38,760
how many of you will leave?

2093
01:46:41,440 --> 01:46:45,600
I mean, I just like I want to say thank you so much, everybody, for coming.

2094
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:48,760
Thank you. Thank you to Dean and Sammy for showing up tonight.

2095
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:54,080
The work the work we do here, the work we do in the madhouse.

2096
01:46:54,240 --> 01:46:57,760
So it drives people crazy all over the world, and it's important work.

2097
01:46:57,760 --> 01:46:59,600
And that's why we do it.

2098
01:47:00,360 --> 01:47:01,600
I mean, isn't that that's a fan.

2099
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:02,480
I love that take.

2100
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:05,000
He's so tired. He doesn't want to be there.

2101
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,720
You're you seem like a nice fella, but the shirt is ugly.

2102
01:47:07,720 --> 01:47:09,000
That's all I'm going to say.

2103
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,360
Get yourself a new one.

2104
01:47:10,360 --> 01:47:12,800
Don't make me squirt my flower onto it.

2105
01:47:14,160 --> 01:47:19,080
St. Charisse, we know you broke your famous leg and we wish you the best.

2106
01:47:19,080 --> 01:47:20,280
We know you're in the hospital.

2107
01:47:20,280 --> 01:47:22,880
We saw you couldn't be here tonight.

2108
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:25,240
I'll braise it with you, Sid.

2109
01:47:25,240 --> 01:47:26,920
I want to thank Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy.

2110
01:47:26,920 --> 01:47:28,280
The jokes didn't land.

2111
01:47:28,280 --> 01:47:31,360
We know female super villains are not funny

2112
01:47:31,360 --> 01:47:35,040
and not good at what they do, but thank you regardless.

2113
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:38,640
Thank you for trying regardless.

2114
01:47:38,640 --> 01:47:41,880
Yeah, it's I think this guy deserves an Oscar for Joker as well.

2115
01:47:42,280 --> 01:47:45,120
I'd like to get an Oscar for everybody.

2116
01:47:45,120 --> 01:47:46,400
I like this guy. Yeah.

2117
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:49,720
Thanks, Mr. Dubai. The yeah.

2118
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:55,760
So really quick, what ended up at why isn't any of this in Universal?

2119
01:47:55,760 --> 01:47:57,600
Why isn't there a big committed Batman land?

2120
01:47:57,600 --> 01:48:00,640
Because they were negotiating, as Jason said, not just for the DC characters,

2121
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:01,840
but for the Looney Tunes.

2122
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:02,760
That's a lot.

2123
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:06,480
Those are the the crown jewels in the Warner Empire.

2124
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:09,000
And it came down to royalties.

2125
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:13,240
MCA wanted to pay them six percent for royalties for their characters.

2126
01:48:13,240 --> 01:48:14,560
Warner Brothers wanted 10.

2127
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:15,880
They eventually came down to eight.

2128
01:48:15,880 --> 01:48:17,360
They got stuck at eight.

2129
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:21,560
That all and this all led up to Sid Sheinberg from Universal saying to Terry

2130
01:48:21,560 --> 01:48:25,440
Semel from Warner Brothers, we don't need your fucking characters.

2131
01:48:25,680 --> 01:48:28,440
And that was the end of that.

2132
01:48:28,520 --> 01:48:30,840
Yeah, a genuine quote, apparently.

2133
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:35,680
And yeah, and then thus those walls are up forever because you

2134
01:48:36,160 --> 01:48:39,600
mean, maybe not forever, but you would have to think like it seems.

2135
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:42,760
Weird, especially with Marvel now, like you're never going to see

2136
01:48:42,760 --> 01:48:45,400
Disney pair with DC. That's not going to happen.

2137
01:48:45,400 --> 01:48:52,400
Universal is the other catch all that grabs entities from other mega corporations.

2138
01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:56,000
Like, so shouldn't they end up with and especially now that they can't do any

2139
01:48:56,200 --> 01:48:57,960
new Marvel, I don't know.

2140
01:48:57,960 --> 01:48:59,600
Will they ever make amends?

2141
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:04,120
Are we ever going to see anything really next level with Batman in the states?

2142
01:49:04,600 --> 01:49:06,520
Well, the timing made sense at the time.

2143
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:11,960
Disney, MGM Studios, Universal, Warner Brothers teaming up to take them on.

2144
01:49:12,680 --> 01:49:15,320
But it would have been competing with Six Flags.

2145
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:20,160
Yeah, it's it's crazy because like we've talked about, Warner Brothers

2146
01:49:20,160 --> 01:49:22,880
has flirted with doing stuff.

2147
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:27,320
They know now as far as Harry Potter, like they should have had their own

2148
01:49:27,320 --> 01:49:31,640
theme park that they could have plugged a crazy Harry Potter land into.

2149
01:49:31,640 --> 01:49:33,440
And then they would have gotten all the money for it.

2150
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:33,920
Yeah.

2151
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:39,280
But it's still like, everything's a mess, you know, as far as like all the

2152
01:49:39,280 --> 01:49:45,800
merger stuff happening and their TV and movies, everyone's mad HBO Max movie.

2153
01:49:45,800 --> 01:49:47,640
Like it seems like it's just a disaster.

2154
01:49:47,640 --> 01:49:51,320
Like it seems like it's going to be years before they really get to

2155
01:49:51,360 --> 01:49:56,320
figure out what's going on and either either like buy more interest in Six

2156
01:49:56,320 --> 01:50:00,320
Flags and pump that stuff up or decide to just do their own thing, which would

2157
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:03,200
maybe be a better thing, maybe be a better idea.

2158
01:50:04,160 --> 01:50:04,920
But I don't know.

2159
01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:06,160
It seems hopeless.

2160
01:50:06,160 --> 01:50:11,960
It truly seems like we, we need a hero right now and we don't have one.

2161
01:50:12,280 --> 01:50:16,720
And our, and the, as we said at the beginning, our heroes are billionaires

2162
01:50:16,720 --> 01:50:18,600
and billionaires run these companies.

2163
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:22,760
So we need a hero billionaire looking out for the kids on the ground here.

2164
01:50:22,760 --> 01:50:22,960
Right.

2165
01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:25,200
Really want a really good Batman ride.

2166
01:50:25,560 --> 01:50:28,720
And the right merger needs to happen to make it possible.

2167
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:29,360
Yeah.

2168
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:31,040
We want more companies to merge.

2169
01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:32,960
Yes, we love mergers.

2170
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:34,560
It's okay.

2171
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:39,000
It's, it might not be the hero we deserve, but you know, maybe it's the one we need.

2172
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:40,200
You know, right.

2173
01:50:40,200 --> 01:50:41,000
All the, okay.

2174
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:41,320
Yes.

2175
01:50:41,320 --> 01:50:46,760
Let's come by Disney should buy Warner Brothers and sick all the Six Flags.

2176
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:47,400
Yeah.

2177
01:50:47,400 --> 01:50:49,040
Disney Six Flags.

2178
01:50:49,160 --> 01:50:50,120
Oh my gosh.

2179
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:52,120
Buy all of it.

2180
01:50:52,280 --> 01:50:57,280
There should be two companies, Universal and Disney, the two theme park companies.

2181
01:50:58,040 --> 01:50:59,000
And then that'll be it.

2182
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,120
And then Superman can be in WandaVision.

2183
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:03,920
And then, yeah, yeah.

2184
01:51:04,040 --> 01:51:09,240
And then the other one, uh, I mean, I guess the HBO side is what, what?

2185
01:51:09,240 --> 01:51:10,800
No, Universal is one.

2186
01:51:11,240 --> 01:51:13,960
Um, that's all going to be, I think like Rogan.

2187
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:18,400
Um, that's all going to be, I think like Rogan, Joe Rogan's could just going to be the

2188
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:21,640
other company and hopefully he starts theme parks.

2189
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:24,120
That's where it's all.

2190
01:51:24,120 --> 01:51:25,280
Rogan's Spotify.

2191
01:51:26,840 --> 01:51:27,160
Yes.

2192
01:51:27,160 --> 01:51:32,320
When he, when he ends up in the name, when it becomes Joe Rogan's Spotify.

2193
01:51:32,600 --> 01:51:33,040
Right.

2194
01:51:33,800 --> 01:51:38,200
Um, so yeah, it's no, it's, it's feels like the future is bleak.

2195
01:51:38,600 --> 01:51:43,920
Maybe we'll get another like slightly better justice league thing, but maybe not.

2196
01:51:43,960 --> 01:51:47,200
Not probably in the future, especially because, you know, I'm sure six

2197
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:48,680
flags needs some money right now.

2198
01:51:49,080 --> 01:51:49,440
Yeah.

2199
01:51:49,440 --> 01:51:53,600
So, well, this is a can of worms and we're winding down, but I feel like we have to

2200
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:58,480
give a little, we have to attempt to talk about like, okay, so what if this all does

2201
01:51:58,480 --> 01:52:03,880
get solved, Joe Rogan purchases the Batman and makes a good ride out of it.

2202
01:52:04,280 --> 01:52:07,080
Um, what, uh, what do we want?

2203
01:52:07,080 --> 01:52:08,160
What's the Batman ride?

2204
01:52:08,160 --> 01:52:10,520
What is the great Batman ride?

2205
01:52:11,200 --> 01:52:16,240
Well, the toughest question, cause there's so many eras, so many, I, I, you know,

2206
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:20,640
there's like five or six things about things like a Batman stories that I love

2207
01:52:20,680 --> 01:52:23,000
equally, uh, Jason, what are you going to say?

2208
01:52:23,640 --> 01:52:26,840
Well, I was going to say, the only thing I'd be concerned about is, uh, I feel

2209
01:52:26,840 --> 01:52:32,400
like his type isn't really fond of regulations, so may he may end up making a

2210
01:52:32,400 --> 01:52:37,360
Batman ride that leads to the creation of Batman asks super villains because

2211
01:52:37,600 --> 01:52:42,280
something actually goes horribly wrong at a chemical plant or something.

2212
01:52:42,440 --> 01:52:47,200
So like he's got, so Joe Rogan has Ben Shapiro on an episode of his podcast and

2213
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:52,520
then Ben Shapiro gets like into a chemical plant and there's an accident.

2214
01:52:52,520 --> 01:52:54,520
He turns into like a super villain.

2215
01:52:54,680 --> 01:52:59,480
Well, even if he takes him on this new Batman ride, but he gives him DMT and

2216
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:04,440
then he gets, you know, falls into the bat of, of hydraulic fluid and you know,

2217
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:09,360
all these people do seem like super villains waiting to happen.

2218
01:53:09,360 --> 01:53:11,400
Like, like there are one mutation away.

2219
01:53:11,400 --> 01:53:12,240
Wait, sorry. What were you saying?

2220
01:53:12,240 --> 01:53:16,040
Mike? Oh, I was just saying Alex Jones is on the podcast podcast a lot.

2221
01:53:16,040 --> 01:53:21,000
Like there are all these different guys that are, yeah, what you're saying is one

2222
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:24,680
like chemical accident away from being a Batman villain.

2223
01:53:24,680 --> 01:53:26,160
Yeah. And we're aware of all of them.

2224
01:53:26,160 --> 01:53:28,160
Like we're seeing where we know who all of them are.

2225
01:53:28,160 --> 01:53:32,040
There are all these weird celebrities and they are, they're all merging like

2226
01:53:32,080 --> 01:53:34,720
the villains in like, wait, wait a minute.

2227
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:38,320
Now there's a pair up between Gina Carano and Ben Shapiro.

2228
01:53:38,440 --> 01:53:40,760
Like she's joined up in a cat woman.

2229
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:42,120
Wait, them now?

2230
01:53:43,200 --> 01:53:46,840
Yeah. And then just it all it takes is one spill and then, yeah.

2231
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,040
And then they all can like jump really high.

2232
01:53:50,280 --> 01:53:52,760
Well, that's damn it.

2233
01:53:52,760 --> 01:53:56,920
No, they all just got, yeah, they all just like are like have the power of a

2234
01:53:56,920 --> 01:53:57,840
grasshopper for some reason.

2235
01:53:57,840 --> 01:53:59,840
Oh, they all got frog man powers.

2236
01:54:00,360 --> 01:54:03,000
Now I'm going to fight over who gets the frog man outfit.

2237
01:54:03,320 --> 01:54:07,640
Shapiro is already like, what's his fuck the who's the scarecrow?

2238
01:54:07,640 --> 01:54:09,920
It's the Sillian Murphy.

2239
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:11,880
Killian, John and Jonathan, Dr.

2240
01:54:11,880 --> 01:54:15,680
Jonathan Crane. Yeah, yeah, he's he's kind of like him already.

2241
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:19,800
He's like kind of the you know, he's a little more like the on the show,

2242
01:54:19,800 --> 01:54:22,680
Gotham, their Edward Nigma, I feel like.

2243
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:24,680
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2244
01:54:24,680 --> 01:54:26,920
Who's sniveling more like that?

2245
01:54:27,880 --> 01:54:34,240
Well, the OK to not give these guys too much of our time,

2246
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:37,360
the because I was trying to think like, OK, there are there's obviously

2247
01:54:37,360 --> 01:54:40,480
so you would of course you would want like a full land that all right,

2248
01:54:40,480 --> 01:54:42,960
here's Batman forever world, here's 66 world.

2249
01:54:43,240 --> 01:54:47,640
But in lieu of that and maybe YB in lieu of that, let's do that.

2250
01:54:47,800 --> 01:54:50,360
But I was trying to think like what genuinely is OK,

2251
01:54:50,640 --> 01:54:52,680
because I think the closest ride,

2252
01:54:52,680 --> 01:54:55,680
I think my favorite of the ones we've talked about is that Star

2253
01:54:55,680 --> 01:54:59,000
Tour Z analog Batman Returns era attraction.

2254
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:00,560
But you're still missing some stuff.

2255
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:01,920
You're like, where are we?

2256
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:05,480
We're in like a we're in a moving box theater where we are not.

2257
01:55:05,480 --> 01:55:08,960
Is the Batmobile and you talk about intimacy,

2258
01:55:09,120 --> 01:55:11,920
you talk about places you want to be, you want to be in the cockpit

2259
01:55:11,920 --> 01:55:13,440
of the of the Batmobile.

2260
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:15,480
And maybe it doesn't make sense to be with Batman,

2261
01:55:15,480 --> 01:55:19,280
although being with an animatronic in sort of a rise of the resistance way

2262
01:55:19,280 --> 01:55:20,560
seems pretty cool.

2263
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:24,480
But I was like, earnestly, I was thinking about how we've certainly complained

2264
01:55:24,480 --> 01:55:27,320
about Millennium Falcon Smuggler's run.

2265
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:30,320
And I think the complaints are more about like what happens and like

2266
01:55:30,320 --> 01:55:32,640
this the video game aspect of it really.

2267
01:55:33,200 --> 01:55:34,880
Is there enough payoff for it?

2268
01:55:34,880 --> 01:55:38,800
I think that that type of ride system where there's a bunch of little pods

2269
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:40,680
that you get in.

2270
01:55:40,680 --> 01:55:42,280
I mean, now with COVID, that's tougher.

2271
01:55:42,280 --> 01:55:45,800
But forget that the idea that like there's a turntable

2272
01:55:45,800 --> 01:55:48,720
and you can actually be in a little space instead of like

2273
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:51,560
Doc built a big DeLorean for you.

2274
01:55:51,720 --> 01:55:54,040
Like you want to be in the actual thing.

2275
01:55:54,280 --> 01:55:57,080
So if there was a Millennium Falcon,

2276
01:55:57,800 --> 01:56:02,120
like a similar setup to that, that let a lot of people be in kind of

2277
01:56:02,120 --> 01:56:07,360
a private Batmobile and then you take a real like a gritty trip

2278
01:56:07,360 --> 01:56:12,440
in the Batmobile and maybe Batman's piloting remotely, sort of like Doc.

2279
01:56:12,440 --> 01:56:12,920
Sure.

2280
01:56:12,920 --> 01:56:15,200
But in the future, I think that happens in one of the movies.

2281
01:56:15,400 --> 01:56:17,200
You could see villains, you could not see villains.

2282
01:56:17,200 --> 01:56:20,480
Maybe it's more about going to places than encountering characters.

2283
01:56:20,720 --> 01:56:25,320
I think a really a very good Batmobile ride is really the key thing,

2284
01:56:25,320 --> 01:56:28,720
and that might be able to transcend what era it's in,

2285
01:56:28,720 --> 01:56:31,520
because the Batmobile never changes that much, I feel like.

2286
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:33,240
Yeah. Yeah.

2287
01:56:33,240 --> 01:56:35,080
I think you could play with

2288
01:56:36,840 --> 01:56:39,840
like, yeah, the Batmobile, if you were getting in the Batmobile

2289
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:43,800
and you're going to Batman, a lot of these rides don't really utilize the like.

2290
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:49,400
Not seeing Batman, like Batman being like stalking in the night.

2291
01:56:49,720 --> 01:56:53,680
So what if like he didn't show up until like halfway through the ride,

2292
01:56:53,680 --> 01:57:00,000
like at a big moment, someone's about to get you and then he shows up and helps.

2293
01:57:00,920 --> 01:57:04,160
Yeah. The other thing that these rides never do.

2294
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:08,160
Sorry, Mike, but is no doing the other perspective

2295
01:57:08,160 --> 01:57:11,440
where you are a bad guy being pursued by Batman

2296
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:15,640
and it becomes like a haunted house, like it becomes a horror ride.

2297
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:17,160
Sure. Yeah.

2298
01:57:17,160 --> 01:57:19,880
I mean, that's I assume that's always like a problem.

2299
01:57:19,880 --> 01:57:22,640
They're like, we can't make the guests be bad, be bad people.

2300
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:26,560
Yeah. The villains are so exciting in Batman where like you want to team up

2301
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:28,200
with them, certainly.

2302
01:57:28,200 --> 01:57:31,240
Yeah. It's all about the villains for me.

2303
01:57:31,240 --> 01:57:36,480
So I think I think if if I'm if I'm thinking of what the ultimate

2304
01:57:36,480 --> 01:57:39,600
just single Batman ride is, I obviously want.

2305
01:57:40,720 --> 01:57:43,920
Separate rides for all the villains, for all the side characters,

2306
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:48,520
for Nightwing, for Damien, Robin, Batman's 10 year old killer assassin son.

2307
01:57:48,720 --> 01:57:49,880
I want separate stuff for all of it.

2308
01:57:49,880 --> 01:57:54,280
But if I'm thinking of the thing that's going to scratch most of the itches,

2309
01:57:54,280 --> 01:57:58,240
I think it's an Arkham Asylum ride of some kind.

2310
01:57:58,240 --> 01:58:04,000
Yeah. Where the bad guy, it's like sort of the premise of the first PlayStation game.

2311
01:58:04,240 --> 01:58:06,360
It's like the bad guys have taken control of Arkham.

2312
01:58:06,560 --> 01:58:11,560
Maybe you're on sort of an Omnimover, like Rise of the Resistance type vehicle

2313
01:58:12,160 --> 01:58:15,760
that like, oh, you're going through, you know, this is a you'll say you're

2314
01:58:16,120 --> 01:58:18,320
you're all scientists or you're all psychologists.

2315
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:21,240
You're taking a tour and then the villains have taken over.

2316
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:25,920
And I don't I would say, you know, you do a ride vehicle like Rise of the Resistance,

2317
01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:29,760
but it's somehow figure out a way to get that force feedback,

2318
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:34,360
that Indiana Jones movement this just to make it feel a little more chaotic.

2319
01:58:34,680 --> 01:58:37,560
And then I don't even think it needs anything super

2320
01:58:38,280 --> 01:58:42,360
thrilling other than just you go into a room.

2321
01:58:42,680 --> 01:58:45,920
There's a really great poison ivy animatronic.

2322
01:58:46,120 --> 01:58:50,840
There's leaves, there's, you know, plants coming through the room

2323
01:58:50,840 --> 01:58:54,160
somehow with robot stuff could be accentuated with screens.

2324
01:58:54,520 --> 01:59:00,560
And you get like a 30 second, 45 second show scene with all your favorite villains.

2325
01:59:00,920 --> 01:59:02,840
Batman is with Jason's idea.

2326
01:59:02,840 --> 01:59:04,800
Batman comes in maybe halfway through.

2327
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:06,680
Nightwing comes in, whoever.

2328
01:59:06,680 --> 01:59:09,040
And it's like and then there's a big finale.

2329
01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:11,240
And I don't know, it could be a drop like at the end of Rise of the Resistance.

2330
01:59:11,240 --> 01:59:12,160
It could be anything.

2331
01:59:12,160 --> 01:59:15,920
I don't think that stuff is as important, though, as just

2332
01:59:16,520 --> 01:59:19,760
really feeling like you've you've been in the most immersive

2333
01:59:20,120 --> 01:59:22,040
Batman experience as possible.

2334
01:59:22,040 --> 01:59:24,320
And I feel like you need.

2335
01:59:24,320 --> 01:59:28,200
You need those rooms with like practical things in them.

2336
01:59:28,240 --> 01:59:30,600
It could be accentuated by screens and part of it could be screens,

2337
01:59:30,600 --> 01:59:32,200
but I think that would be awesome.

2338
01:59:32,200 --> 01:59:35,480
And especially if it was tight, tight rooms,

2339
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:37,600
because I think that's even cooler.

2340
01:59:37,600 --> 01:59:42,080
Like aspects of Rise of the Resistance where you feel like you're in a really small space.

2341
01:59:42,440 --> 01:59:44,840
Feels really cool. That's really great. Yeah. Yeah.

2342
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:46,600
Yeah. Arkham is a great idea.

2343
01:59:46,600 --> 01:59:50,640
And Arkham isn't like so there's not like the cinematic depiction of it

2344
01:59:50,840 --> 01:59:54,680
they were tied to that you couldn't reinvent to some extent.

2345
01:59:55,080 --> 01:59:57,640
Right. And you can have a scene where like somebody blows up the floor

2346
01:59:57,640 --> 02:00:01,200
and you fall into the next show scene below you and then you zoom somewhere else.

2347
02:00:01,200 --> 02:00:04,960
Like there's a lot of different ways you could have exciting stuff that doesn't

2348
02:00:05,560 --> 02:00:09,320
necessarily need you to actually have a thrill element or go on a roller coaster.

2349
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:11,560
But yeah, you can make you can make the layout whatever you want.

2350
02:00:11,560 --> 02:00:15,520
It doesn't there's the video game, but that's probably the most definitive

2351
02:00:15,880 --> 02:00:17,920
version of Arkham, honestly, that there is.

2352
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:22,000
Yeah, man's I think like an animatronic that's mainly in the suit.

2353
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:26,360
So you you could sort of get away with the Indiana Jones effect if it's not Harrison.

2354
02:00:26,360 --> 02:00:30,600
Like if you're if he's mostly in shadow and he just kind of is reminiscent

2355
02:00:30,600 --> 02:00:34,240
of all of them in a way, I think that works.

2356
02:00:34,600 --> 02:00:38,800
And yeah, and you could go like there's there's more iconic art styles.

2357
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:43,200
I mean, you could go full those Arkham games, the style of Batman and the villains,

2358
02:00:43,200 --> 02:00:45,400
I think, loom pretty large now.

2359
02:00:45,400 --> 02:00:47,000
You could go with that type of style.

2360
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:52,800
You could also just pick an artist, you know, Jim Lee or any other current.

2361
02:00:52,800 --> 02:00:56,360
I'm trying to think who else has been drawing Batman.

2362
02:00:56,360 --> 02:00:58,960
Greg Capolo has been drawing Batman.

2363
02:00:58,960 --> 02:01:02,280
You go with any of these like styles and see what works for robots.

2364
02:01:02,280 --> 02:01:05,120
And as long as I think as long as it feels like it as a take,

2365
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:09,720
I think it's OK versus having like a particularly iconic take.

2366
02:01:09,720 --> 02:01:14,320
Now, would I also like getting the likeness rights to all the villains

2367
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:16,680
from the movies and putting them in this right?

2368
02:01:16,680 --> 02:01:21,440
Of course I would get Arnold, get Uma, get them all and make the animatronics

2369
02:01:21,440 --> 02:01:22,720
look like them. That'd be awesome.

2370
02:01:22,720 --> 02:01:26,400
Oh, get you get all get Hathaway, get Eckhart.

2371
02:01:26,960 --> 02:01:28,960
Sure. Get Billy D.

2372
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:32,240
Get Billy D. We get two two faces, you know, just right.

2373
02:01:32,920 --> 02:01:34,440
Billy D. was supposed to be Harvey.

2374
02:01:34,440 --> 02:01:36,320
He was Harvey Dent in the original movie.

2375
02:01:36,320 --> 02:01:40,800
Yeah, supposed to be two faced, but they and Damon Waynes, right?

2376
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:41,880
Was supposed to Robin.

2377
02:01:41,880 --> 02:01:46,560
I have the they famously made the action figure and then painted it white

2378
02:01:46,560 --> 02:01:51,840
and just put out a generic Robin action figure for Batman Returns.

2379
02:01:51,840 --> 02:01:56,320
But they were getting ready to like make the Damon Waynes like action figure.

2380
02:01:56,600 --> 02:01:58,800
Weird. Yeah, so bizarre.

2381
02:01:58,960 --> 02:02:02,760
I think the other stuff you I would like to Wayne Manor,

2382
02:02:02,760 --> 02:02:06,680
something in Wayne Manor, the Batcave, the roof with the Bat Signal

2383
02:02:06,680 --> 02:02:10,520
and Commissioner Gordon like, oh, yeah, you're going to go there. Yeah.

2384
02:02:10,680 --> 02:02:12,840
Yeah, those I think you can.

2385
02:02:13,480 --> 02:02:18,560
I think people have a general idea, but I don't think there's, you know,

2386
02:02:19,760 --> 02:02:21,280
the big computer.

2387
02:02:21,280 --> 02:02:24,840
I think there's a lot of different versions of those things,

2388
02:02:24,840 --> 02:02:27,880
but I think people would recognize most versions of those things.

2389
02:02:28,400 --> 02:02:33,080
And I think maybe, you know, for people like us, I think having

2390
02:02:34,120 --> 02:02:38,560
a walkthrough or an experience where we got to get a psychological evaluation

2391
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:43,640
from Dr. Chase Meridian would really be a nice capper for the trip,

2392
02:02:43,640 --> 02:02:45,840
for your day at the park where you get to explain, Chase,

2393
02:02:45,840 --> 02:02:47,800
what's going on with your life and your childhood.

2394
02:02:48,080 --> 02:02:52,040
And this isn't like a high capacity attraction.

2395
02:02:52,040 --> 02:02:55,520
Like you'd be this would be you wouldn't like want to be sending so many people

2396
02:02:55,520 --> 02:02:58,200
through. You would want this to be intimate.

2397
02:02:58,200 --> 02:03:01,360
You want to make sure that you're locked in and you have a good long moment

2398
02:03:01,360 --> 02:03:02,840
with Dr. Chase Meridian.

2399
02:03:02,840 --> 02:03:06,080
Well, it would be like it would be like meeting Mickey in Disney World,

2400
02:03:06,080 --> 02:03:10,240
where there's multiple chase rooms and you don't get to see that those exist.

2401
02:03:10,240 --> 02:03:13,000
Like you're saying with the Millennium Falcon, you know, you would just like

2402
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,800
go down and you would never know that there were multiple chases.

2403
02:03:16,240 --> 02:03:17,680
So you could get a couple.

2404
02:03:17,680 --> 02:03:19,320
She's all yours.

2405
02:03:19,320 --> 02:03:23,520
Well, yes, I think you would need to rotate every other hour.

2406
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:27,920
Would have to be meet and greet with Sugar and Spice played by Drew Barrymore

2407
02:03:27,920 --> 02:03:29,160
and Debbie Pazard.

2408
02:03:29,160 --> 02:03:31,720
Well, that's Jason. That's a different I think that's a different area

2409
02:03:31,720 --> 02:03:34,320
of this of this hypothetical part. OK.

2410
02:03:35,160 --> 02:03:36,800
Well, they're all in there.

2411
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:41,400
Yeah, you have you have your opportunity to meet all the Batman forever base.

2412
02:03:41,400 --> 02:03:45,160
Yeah. And then a different area where you just go up to the tube

2413
02:03:45,160 --> 02:03:47,880
where Nora is being frozen and you get to say Nora

2414
02:03:48,600 --> 02:03:50,880
as you're holding your hand against the tube.

2415
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:53,160
That's a different thing. That's a different part.

2416
02:03:53,160 --> 02:03:55,720
Insert a diamond that saves her,

2417
02:03:56,280 --> 02:04:00,000
that like turns into a cure, like, all right, you put it in

2418
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:03,080
and then like a bunch of tubes go by and then trip, trip, trip.

2419
02:04:03,080 --> 02:04:04,320
She's cured.

2420
02:04:05,560 --> 02:04:07,920
Yeah, so that's all these are all great ideas.

2421
02:04:08,120 --> 02:04:10,400
Yeah. The cure Nora experience.

2422
02:04:10,960 --> 02:04:12,160
People are dying for it.

2423
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:16,920
Let's merge as many companies as we need to in order to make this happen.

2424
02:04:18,600 --> 02:04:19,440
Sounds good to me.

2425
02:04:19,440 --> 02:04:22,800
I guess we all survive podcast the ride Batman.

2426
02:04:22,800 --> 02:04:24,960
The rides edition.

2427
02:04:26,400 --> 02:04:27,840
Boy, hey, that was pretty tidy.

2428
02:04:27,840 --> 02:04:29,560
That could have been a lot crazier.

2429
02:04:29,560 --> 02:04:32,800
We still got to explore everything and we got to, you know, hey,

2430
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:36,160
we got some stuff off our chest about our parents that I think Dr.

2431
02:04:36,160 --> 02:04:39,760
Chase Meridian would be quite interested.

2432
02:04:40,160 --> 02:04:43,800
They did not get into the water stunt shows and we'll have to get to those

2433
02:04:43,800 --> 02:04:44,800
at another time.

2434
02:04:44,800 --> 02:04:48,440
Obviously, everyone's going to tell us we missed a big part of Batman theme park

2435
02:04:48,680 --> 02:04:50,640
and you will tell us online.

2436
02:04:50,640 --> 02:04:52,840
Do not tell us in the gripes.

2437
02:04:52,840 --> 02:04:55,120
We don't care about those anymore. Tell us on Twitter.

2438
02:04:55,760 --> 02:04:58,120
Turn that show yourself.

2439
02:04:58,120 --> 02:05:01,880
Gripes is condemned like the like Arkham.

2440
02:05:02,280 --> 02:05:04,000
I heard locking it up.

2441
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:05,360
Yeah. So you know what?

2442
02:05:05,360 --> 02:05:07,840
Let us know if we if we missed something

2443
02:05:08,360 --> 02:05:10,560

02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:14,080

02:05:30,040 --> 02:05:33,360
And yeah, which one are you?

2450
02:05:33,800 --> 02:05:35,240
We're all going to watch one tonight.

2451
02:05:35,240 --> 02:05:36,600
Now, what's it going to be?

2452
02:05:36,600 --> 02:05:38,360
Is it an episode of the show?

2453
02:05:38,360 --> 02:05:41,560
Is it just are we going to hang out with sugar and spice again?

2454
02:05:42,720 --> 02:05:44,120
I have been really wanting to do.

2455
02:05:44,120 --> 02:05:48,120
I have I feel like I've been really wanting to watch the 66

2456
02:05:48,120 --> 02:05:50,920
Batman movie again and watched in a year or two.

2457
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:53,960
So that might be the next Batman thing I watch.

2458
02:05:54,160 --> 02:05:57,800
I could watch a Batman movie every day, I think, and that gets sick of it.

2459
02:05:57,840 --> 02:05:59,800
I think I said this earlier in the pandemic

2460
02:05:59,800 --> 02:06:03,120
that I was watching Batman forever a lot.

2461
02:06:03,120 --> 02:06:04,680
It's in the longer it goes.

2462
02:06:04,680 --> 02:06:06,640
All right, we're back around to that one.

2463
02:06:06,640 --> 02:06:08,880
It's Batman forever time again. Yeah.

2464
02:06:09,560 --> 02:06:13,160
I think I'll watch the weird, you know, the weird like wrestling promo or something.

2465
02:06:13,160 --> 02:06:16,360
I forget what it is where Adam West like post the series.

2466
02:06:16,760 --> 02:06:18,920
I mean, am I crazy that it culminates in him?

2467
02:06:19,400 --> 02:06:21,920
Some wrestler or somebody says something weird him.

2468
02:06:22,160 --> 02:06:24,800
And then he's all over. Oh, it's Jerry Lawler. Wow.

2469
02:06:25,880 --> 02:06:27,440
There's some reason why

2470
02:06:27,440 --> 02:06:30,960
Adam West in costume is to say, I've heard of your box.

2471
02:06:32,240 --> 02:06:34,080
I don't know why or what it is.

2472
02:06:34,080 --> 02:06:36,400
I don't know what leads to that, but I think that's what I'm going to watch.

2473
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:38,320
Yeah, Jason, have you seen that clip?

2474
02:06:38,320 --> 02:06:40,320
No, I haven't. You said that to me.

2475
02:06:40,320 --> 02:06:42,440
All right. Well, do you want to just play it right now? Yeah.

2476
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,640
Let's go out on that box part.

2477
02:06:45,920 --> 02:06:46,960
I think it's this.

2478
02:06:46,960 --> 02:06:48,640
I'll have to edit it if it goes this.

2479
02:06:48,640 --> 02:06:51,680
Well, just find the BIA, find the best part, but we'll just watch all together.

2480
02:06:51,680 --> 02:06:53,600
Thanks for listening.

2481
02:06:53,600 --> 02:06:56,280
Take it away, Adam and Jerry.

2482
02:06:56,720 --> 02:06:59,960
Well, you know, I've heard he's had his troubles with the Joker

2483
02:06:59,960 --> 02:07:00,960
and the Penguin and Mr.

2484
02:07:00,960 --> 02:07:03,080
Freeze, but he hadn't handled the king yet.

2485
02:07:03,080 --> 02:07:05,400
And I got somebody in a box that I'm going to bring out here.

2486
02:07:05,400 --> 02:07:08,080
Usually allies, not adversaries.

2487
02:07:08,080 --> 02:07:09,400
Joker look like Mickey Mouse.

2488
02:07:09,400 --> 02:07:12,160
I can tell you that I've heard about your box.

2489
02:07:13,080 --> 02:07:16,800
But I want to say that that costume that you're wearing,

2490
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:19,800
if you are indeed the evil king of Memphis,

2491
02:07:20,720 --> 02:07:23,680
has been stolen from a friend of mine, soup.

2492
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:28,000
Superman, I call him soup.

2493
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:32,160
And I think that Spider-Man, Spidey Baby would probably object to.

2494
02:07:32,160 --> 02:07:36,320
Excuse me. By the way, looking at you, I don't think it's too late for you.

2495
02:07:37,400 --> 02:07:39,520
I think it's possibly.

2496
02:07:39,840 --> 02:07:43,920
If you change some of your habits, some of your methods of wrestling,

2497
02:07:43,920 --> 02:07:46,680
if you used your left and right turn indicator in your car.

2498
02:07:50,080 --> 02:07:52,160
Did other things that.

2499
02:07:53,440 --> 02:07:57,240
People normally do when they're polite and courteous,

2500
02:07:57,240 --> 02:08:01,840
and you weren't such a naughty, mean person, it wouldn't be too late for you.

2501
02:08:02,160 --> 02:08:04,760
I think maybe we we better settle this elsewhere.

2502
02:08:04,760 --> 02:08:07,840
And again, both of you are going to be at the Frank in here anyway.

2503
02:08:07,880 --> 02:08:09,960
Both of you are going to be down at the Cook Convention Center

2504
02:08:09,960 --> 02:08:13,560
at the car show all this weekend, and maybe you can settle it there.

2505
02:08:13,760 --> 02:08:16,160
Batman Prisic coming by and thank you very much.

2506
02:08:16,160 --> 02:08:18,480
He's not a nice man. No, he is not.

2507
02:08:22,080 --> 02:08:24,240
