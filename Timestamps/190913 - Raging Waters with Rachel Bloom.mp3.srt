1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:12,600
Warning, the following podcast may contain vodka consumption in a dark hole, teen recklessness

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:19,160
that's both dangerous and nerdy, and a child being crushed by Norbit's wife.

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:24,440
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend star Rachel Bloom takes us to the only theme park with rides guaranteed

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,560
to make you wet your pants.

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,000
It's Raging Waters on podcast The Ride.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,560
Welcome to podcast The Ride, a show about theme parks hosted by three guys who shower

9
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:59,000
in pure chlorine so they always smell waterpark fresh.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,200
I'm Scott Gertner joined by Mike Carlson.

11
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,840
Yup, I'm here and I do that.

12
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,400
Yeah, true premise, not a joke.

13
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,360
Jason Sheridan is here as well.

14
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,160
Yeah, I love it.

15
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,240
The smell of chlorine or just like-

16
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,240
I do like it, yeah.

17
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,680
But if it's too strong I get a headache.

18
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,000
I was thinking though the smell of Splash Mountain is my favorite theme park smell I

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
think.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Oh really?

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,960
I guess I was saying we should do like a whole bracket for theme park smells and maybe I

22
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,360
just reveal it already.

23
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,360
Oh, you're gonna matter.

24
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,440
Well, but now we know what you're coming into the bracket with.

25
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,040
It doesn't mean we're all gonna agree.

26
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,040
Are we announcing that casually?

27
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,040
I guess I just made an announcement.

28
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:40,600
If this is your first podcast The Ride there may be an exciting episode determining what

29
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,640
is the best fake theme park smell.

30
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,320
But stay tuned for that.

31
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,480
Let's ask our guests.

32
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,480
First things first.

33
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,480
Let's bring our guest in.

34
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,560
Yeah, you know her from Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, her monthly show at Largo.

35
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,560
She's got a tour.

36
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,160
This is Rachel Bloom everybody.

37
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,160
Hi.

38
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,160
She's here on podcast.

39
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,160
Hi.

40
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,160
It's my pleasure.

41
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,160
I have so many things to say already.

42
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,160
Yes, please.

43
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,680
Haven't they started, hasn't Disney started releasing candles that smell like the rides?

44
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,280
Disney is not officially releasing those.

45
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,080
Those are third party offshoot companies trying to approximate the smells.

46
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,000
They have not actually released official Disney smells.

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,480
But it's surprising Disney has not jumped on that.

48
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:24,720
Yeah, because everything else they've turned into such meta product whores of themselves.

49
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,520
Everything in the park now is like stuffed versions of their snacks.

50
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:36,680
You can get dresses and fanny packs now that pay homage to other merchandise.

51
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,680
Yes, like churros.

52
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,680
A magnet that looks like a churro.

53
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,560
They're very subtly aware of what their brand is.

54
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,240
They really have found a way to cater to the pass holders who are going there every single

55
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,040
day who are in the biker gangs, which I'm sure you've heard about.

56
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,040
What do they call the?

57
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,040
The social clubs.

58
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,040
The social clubs.

59
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,040
The social clubs.

60
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:03,240
Yeah, which are basically like, I guess, pacifist gangs that go to Disneyland.

61
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,600
They kind of died out in the last few years.

62
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,120
They peaked a little.

63
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,120
You don't see them as a lot.

64
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,680
You see the cuts every now and then.

65
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,600
But how has Disney not played into that?

66
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,560
How have they not started to sell the vests themselves?

67
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,560
I think it's hard to.

68
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,560
Oh, oh, right.

69
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,960
Well, they don't want to encourage like gang stuff, I think.

70
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,960
But if you think about it, the Mickey Mouse Club was kind of a gang to begin with.

71
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,800
Everybody they were there representing its colors.

72
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,120
They have their names on it, patches.

73
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,160
So really, they they're responsible for all this.

74
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,440
They would kill in his name?

75
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,440
I think so.

76
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,160
Yeah, they would rough up the little rascals.

77
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,160
Cubby was bloodthirsty.

78
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,840
I want to get one of those candles, though.

79
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,400
I mean, yeah, man, the Disney smells are.

80
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,400
Yeah, it's hard.

81
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,120
I have a few of them.

82
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,960
They're not perfect because like a lot of the smells that we like are chemicals or some

83
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,960
sort of compound.

84
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,960
Bromine.

85
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,080
One of them is bromine.

86
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,400
It's like stuff you can actually put into a candle and make you hoof because you're

87
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,280
not supposed to.

88
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,280
So I don't.

89
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,520
It's hard to approximate because some of the smells are just old building.

90
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,960
Some of the smells are like weird thing you add to water to make sure it's not poison

91
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,080
if it gets into kids mouth.

92
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,760
So like, wait, what smells?

93
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,760
What smell is that?

94
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:24,240
I think it's industrial grade bromine is like one of the smells that you associate with

95
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,240
theme parks.

96
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,040
Like that's like stronger than like in Pirates of the Caribbean's water.

97
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,040
Yeah.

98
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,040
And stuff like could be totally wrong.

99
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,000
That's what's in like the water instead of chlorine.

100
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,840
I think it's got chlorine too.

101
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,960
We talked about this a while back and I forget what episode it was on.

102
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,320
But like that is what your brain is smelling that you are associating positively to.

103
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,480
But in terms of extracting it to put into a candle scent, it's kind of impossible.

104
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,480
It's probably illegal.

105
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,480
Although I don't know.

106
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,480
Is there a jewel?

107
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,840
Is there like a, is there a jewel pod of Splash Mountain scent?

108
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,840
Oh my gosh.

109
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,760
If you want it to market to kids any better than jewel already has.

110
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,760
Right?

111
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,760
That's so smart.

112
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,680
That is, I would start vaping instantly.

113
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,560
Oh, that's a billion dollar idea.

114
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,560
Yeah.

115
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,560
Yeah.

116
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,520
If I could breathe in ET pine as a jewel flavor.

117
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,520
Yep.

118
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,520
I'm addicted right away.

119
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,720
There was a time when we were at Disney when they used, they still, they had the, that

120
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,400
projection of Davy Jones on Pirates.

121
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,400
It's gone now again.

122
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,400
Really?

123
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,400
Yeah.

124
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,400
They got rid of it like a year ago.

125
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,400
But what are they doing?

126
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,040
What are they doing in that tunnel now?

127
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,000
It's like it used to be, there's no back there.

128
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,480
They add a little like kind of, it's not an animatronic, but they added like a little

129
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:42,040
character that when you go by him, he turns from a skeleton into a man, which is very

130
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,040
cool.

131
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,480
It transitions you for like now, now the story makes sense.

132
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,840
I was just there and I swear I saw Davy.

133
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:57,120
Well, he, so, so a guy when that was still there, a guy was, had his jewel out and he,

134
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:05,760
into the air and he like blew a big plume of like strawberry vape at Davy Jones.

135
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,760
He's fighting him.

136
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,760
That guy's cool.

137
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,440
Yeah, actually, I don't usually think that stuff's cool, but in that instance.

138
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,440
So you liked that.

139
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,440
I kind of think that's neat.

140
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,440
Were you with us?

141
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,440
No, I don't think I was.

142
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,440
Jason, you were with me, right?

143
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,440
I can't remember.

144
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,440
I think you were.

145
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,440
We talked about it once.

146
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,440
Yeah.

147
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,240
He's fighting steam with steam.

148
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,720
But we got a full blast of strawberry vape in our face because of that.

149
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,400
If I were like 17 years old, I'd fuck that guy.

150
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,440
That's like, that would be like the sexiest thing I ever saw.

151
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,360
So I should begin by saying like, I'm obsessed with amusement parks.

152
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,400
I grew up in Southern California.

153
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,920
I'm an only child.

154
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,560
So I grew up with, it was like me and my parents and I was like, they're kind of like being

155
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,160
an only child, especially when you have like whimsical parents, it feels like you're just

156
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,200
like their idiot sidekick.

157
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,920
And so my parents were also like obsessed with amusement parks.

158
00:06:53,920 --> 00:07:00,000
And so we got a year long pass to Disneyland when I was six and I would go on like school

159
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
nights.

160
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I mean, I really, Disneyland is like where I grew up.

161
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,240
I would go to Knott's constantly, Six Flags a little less and then Raging Waters, which

162
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,120
I'm here to really talk about.

163
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,240
But like that was my first and I got to say like, I think my only water park, I think

164
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,160
I've only ever just been to Raging Waters.

165
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,640
This stuff is incredibly like, it's incredibly like near and dear to my heart.

166
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:31,000
I mean, I really, being an Imagineer was like a close second career and then I realized

167
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,160
I was terrible at physics.

168
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,800
Yeah, that's the bummer about it.

169
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,000
It does involve, you know, science and math and numbers and stuff that I can only assume

170
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,200
none of us are very good at.

171
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,520
Yeah, that's fair, I guess.

172
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,120
But we throw a lot of ideas out on the podcast that we think are very good.

173
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,400
So somebody else could work out the physics of it.

174
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,720
I think they need more of that and they have people to, every ride has a writer because

175
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,920
my husband and his writing partner wrote The Secret Life of Pets Ride for Universal Studios

176
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,920
Florida.

177
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,920
We've heard this through the rumors.

178
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,920
Oh, interesting.

179
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,920
Yeah.

180
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,880
And I don't know if there's an, I mean, whatever, it's fine.

181
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,680
But I don't know when the ride's opening or if it's...

182
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,680
Next summer.

183
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,680
Next summer.

184
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,680
So it's here.

185
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,680
It's down the street.

186
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,680
Okay.

187
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:21,520
So about five years ago, they got hired to write this ride and they partially took it

188
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,800
because my husband knew how much I'd like geek out over this.

189
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,200
And we went to Disney World so that they could kind of go on rides.

190
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:35,540
And then we went around Universal Studios with some of the people who create the rides

191
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,540
at Universal Studios.

192
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:41,400
We went to Harry Potter World with some of the creators and I don't know what the term,

193
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,040
it's not imaginary universal, but with some of the people who created the things at Harry

194
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,040
Potter World.

195
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,880
And it was, I mean, it was unbelievable.

196
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,000
And my husband's not, he likes amusement park because he's not an amusement park guy.

197
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,680
My husband's writing partner is actively kind of scared of roller coasters.

198
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:02,080
So he got over some of those fears, some of those fears on that trip.

199
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,620
But every ride has a writer.

200
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,200
And now that I'm thinking about it, I don't have a job right now.

201
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,500
I could easily like...

202
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,500
You can take a meeting.

203
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,600
You can get to the ride.

204
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
You can go over there.

205
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,600
Oh man, that's all I want to do actually.

206
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,600
Wait, what the fuck am I doing here?

207
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
Goodbye.

208
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,940
Make some calls, come back if you want, but we understand.

209
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:23,780
We can tell you the fastest way to get to the Flower Street campus.

210
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,780
You have a picture of your own campus.

211
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,780
Oh, you're right there, right?

212
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,780
We're very close.

213
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,780
We're really close.

214
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,780
Wild.

215
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,780
But I love it.

216
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:39,380
Oh, if you want to see the worst written ride, the Six Flags has a...

217
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,460
Justice League?

218
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,460
Yes.

219
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,460
We haven't done it yet.

220
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,460
Oh, holy fucking shit.

221
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:50,260
The writing on the Justice League ride, it's the worst writing you've ever seen, right?

222
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,260
It's a lot.

223
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,260
It's a lot.

224
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,260
So it's full on two person audition scenes.

225
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,260
That last...

226
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:01,780
So the opening movie to let you know what the Justice League ride is about, it's a scene

227
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:09,740
between Joker and Harley Quinn with bad, terrible CGI.

228
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:16,660
And it's them just talking, it's them just shooting the shit for, I want to say, 10 minutes.

229
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:21,020
And it feels like people in a scene study class doing a bad audition scene.

230
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,300
And it's not the last one.

231
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,300
There's a few of those scenes.

232
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,300
No, it's filled with those scenes.

233
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,460
Oh, I'm doing it in a week.

234
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,460
I'm going in a week.

235
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,460
Oh, yeah.

236
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,460
I'm very excited.

237
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,100
It's some of the weirdest fucking writing.

238
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:42,180
It's for a bunch of people there who are like, I mean, anywhere from like 6 to 36.

239
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,820
No one cares about the writing of the Justice League ride.

240
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,660
It's terrible.

241
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:53,620
It was made by a company called the Sally Corporation, who we've talked about on the

242
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,620
show before.

243
00:10:54,780 --> 00:11:00,700
They made a very short lived ride for a hard rock themed theme park in Myrtle Beach based

244
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,060
on the moody blues song Knights and White Satin.

245
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:09,580
So trying to turn that and it's very, there's a full video ride through of it online on

246
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:13,700
their official YouTube channel, on the Sally Corporation channel.

247
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:19,220
And it's a trip, but it's like they definitely went very ethereal with it.

248
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,220
It's not a literal story.

249
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,220
Not a lot of story.

250
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,980
Because it's, I mean, it's kind of a nonsense song anyway.

251
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,380
They're better at doing rides based on songs.

252
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,180
They still have moody blues songs.

253
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,180
Based on DC Universe characters.

254
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,180
Where there were, there's inherent context.

255
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:38,460
And well, I guess they're better doing poetic rides rather than like with a coherent narrative.

256
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,980
I mean, it's hard to get into a ride.

257
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:46,420
It just dawned on me as we were talking about this, that finding an excuse for why the ride

258
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:51,220
exists is very similar to like finding an excuse for why sex exists in porn.

259
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,220
It's the same type of like-

260
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,220
Oh, right, right, right.

261
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:58,700
It's the same type of like, you have to find the antidote, but you have to suck his dick.

262
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,700
Or you have to find the antidote, so get in this mine car.

263
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:06,700
You know, it's the same kind of like stretch of the imagination.

264
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:12,020
Why do people need 16 strangers to perform a task in mass?

265
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,300
You have to come up with very contrived reasons.

266
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,900
Or something goes wrong.

267
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:20,380
Like this is not at all how this tutoring session was supposed to go.

268
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,540
Yeah.

269
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,540
Yes, and it's immediate.

270
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,540
But it's a thrilling experience now.

271
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,540
Yes.

272
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,540
So you're telling me that they're taking tourists.

273
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,060
It's the 1920s.

274
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,100
They're taking tourists into this temple.

275
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:39,900
They've invented a Jeep system and all you have to do is close your eyes and you'll be

276
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,460
rewarded with riches.

277
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,420
And like scientists aren't studying this.

278
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,820
They're just allowing tourists to go in.

279
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:50,140
But the tourists are in to find Indiana Jones as well.

280
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,900
Oh, Indiana Jones has disappeared, right.

281
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:57,300
They were already charging tourists to go in to make up the money that they were not

282
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:01,540
making because they had run over on their expedition or whatever it's called.

283
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:08,700
But the wisdom of crowds, if you give them one thing to do, that is one thing too many.

284
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,700
Keep your eyes closed.

285
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,020
Everyone's immediately opening their eyes.

286
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:15,340
I think there should be a version of Indiana Jones where if everyone closes their eyes,

287
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,580
you get a completely different ride.

288
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,180
And it's like a pleasant, beautiful temple ride.

289
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,580
And at the end of it, you get a bunch of free snacks.

290
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,140
Yeah, that would be great.

291
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:28,780
I think you'd have to get like 16 of those annual pass holders though to do it.

292
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:32,220
Like you'd have to really formulate like 16 of us are going or whatever.

293
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,220
No, 12.

294
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,220
12 of us are going.

295
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,220
What do you think is going to happen?

296
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,220
No, I'm just saying it's not going to happen.

297
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,860
I'm not saying I believe it to happen.

298
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,860
I'm just saying.

299
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,220
There's always going to be that one fucking kid who's going to open their eyes and.

300
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,860
Yeah, our grandma is going to look.

301
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,860
Come on, grandma.

302
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:50,060
I would love the giant Mara head to say like, thank you for listening to me,

303
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,460
respecting our culture.

304
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,180
I know whatever does this.

305
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:54,940
Yeah. Yeah.

306
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,900
Every ride, I guess, has the version where it's fine.

307
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:02,660
Star tours, you just fly to Endor and Rex lets you out and says, so.

308
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,100
Right. Watch your head on the way out.

309
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,420
And thanks for flying with us.

310
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,820
I wish that if you didn't put your hands up on the Guardians ride, he'd go, what?

311
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,140
What are you doing?

312
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,660
Yeah, that's the one thing I said.

313
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,460
You gotta put your hands in the air.

314
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,660
And it's like, what are you doing?

315
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,540
Just like it's a standoff until it happens.

316
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,540
They're going to kill Star Lord.

317
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,540
You know, he's dead.

318
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,260
It's on your hands now.

319
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,740
God damn it.

320
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,020
These leaves. Yeah.

321
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,980
Yeah, it's yeah, there there.

322
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:34,420
There's only so many real setups they can do, I think, really, too,

323
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,660
with it, with the ride like now, especially if it's like kind of an actiony ride.

324
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,780
But it used to be that rides would just start and there isn't like,

325
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,420
we don't know why we're in Snow White's forest or

326
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,020
you know, that's going to pleasure.

327
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,740
Because there is a narrative inherent in that.

328
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,580
I mean, I think I have a certain respect for things like Matterhorn or Big Thunder

329
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,980
or Space Mountain, where it's like, you know what?

330
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,220
You're on a ride.

331
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,180
Enjoy the ride.

332
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,260
There's no like there's no like

333
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,500
mountain explorers.

334
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,540
You need to find the abominable snowman.

335
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,500
Yes. So we've invented a track made of ice.

336
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:10,420
But but but where if you don't collect the urine sample by the end of the track,

337
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:14,060
you will be in a wet splashdown zone.

338
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,140
You know, this open house is going terribly wrong.

339
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:21,140
There is a good chance it involves an open house that goes wrong.

340
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,740
Yeah. There's space.

341
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:26,260
Space Mountain is the best one because the name Space Mountain doesn't make any sense.

342
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,460
And they never explain it.

343
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,820
There's speculation of it.

344
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,860
But like it just doesn't.

345
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,140
They're just yeah, you're in a rocket.

346
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,900
It doesn't matter. Yeah. Space Mountain.

347
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,860
It's fine. You're in space.

348
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,700
Doesn't matter. Yeah.

349
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:39,180
I care. No one and like only we are paying attention to any of this.

350
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,220
Most people.

351
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,340
No, no, most people don't give a shit.

352
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,660
I mean, the thing that always bothered me about Tower of Terror

353
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,660
was that Tower of Terror was an unfinished story.

354
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,900
So you're telling me, OK, I'm going to go on a freight elevator just for funsies.

355
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,780
I'm going to get struck by lightning and I'm going to disappear

356
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,420
along with the people who disappeared in the 30s.

357
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:01,460
So when I exit the ride, for all intents and purposes, I should be dead.

358
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:05,020
There is no explanation of why I'm suddenly alive again.

359
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,100
That always bothered me about Tower of Terror.

360
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,340
That's a good point. Yeah.

361
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,060
They should explain like, oh, you just missed it.

362
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,580
You just missed dying.

363
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:15,020
Like, oh, good for you. Oh, it's in Thursday? Never mind.

364
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,820
Hey, good luck. Good work.

365
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:20,900
Yours was weaker lightning than what hit the old man and the little girl.

366
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,780
Yeah. So you left out. It should just be you.

367
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,660
It should just be you.

368
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,460
Like, oh, yeah.

369
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,900
Like that thing is like the ride should end and you just come on.

370
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,460
You go, oh, never mind.

371
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,420
Oh, just me. I just explained every. Yeah.

372
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,020
Oh, hey, what's up?

373
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:35,340
Hey, just to let you know, real quick, you got weak lightning.

374
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,900
Thank God. Anyway, merch is available.

375
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,420
Step this way.

376
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,220
Man, he's lucked out for the man.

377
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,620
Everything worked out. That famous Rod Serling phrase.

378
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,300
Oh, hey, man. Hey, just to let you know, real quick.

379
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,860
Oh, what's up?

380
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,940
Welcome back from the 30s. So anyway.

381
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,220
Right. Rock on, man.

382
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:58,180
It just ends like Haunted Mansion has a says like a ghost is going to follow you home

383
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:02,340
and then for the rest of your life, you're then haunted by the Hat Box Ghost.

384
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,380
That I can deal with. Yeah.

385
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,860
And the fact that they don't need proof that he can be invisible.

386
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,780
The Hat Box Ghost. Is that the right reference?

387
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,580
Well, that's the answer.

388
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,700
Clear which ghost he's not.

389
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:18,420
He's not in one of the ones that I can go.

390
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,260
So the one confusingly there is one of them has a big top hat.

391
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:26,580
So he's Hat Box Ghost. That's why I think it's like Gus is one of them.

392
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,660
I forget the other two.

393
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,860
Gus is a name of one of their names is Gus.

394
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,300
One of their names is Gus.

395
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,620
Yeah. So that's a fact.

396
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,140
But that's fine. I can live with that.

397
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,460
So I've gone on the Haunted Mansion ride.

398
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,900
So a ghost is now always following me.

399
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,540
Right. Yes. That is a great narrative. Easy.

400
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,060
Great for me to take home.

401
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:48,740
Yeah. Is the I guess this tower the most incomplete narrative of all the rides?

402
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,700
It does feel like it off the top of my head.

403
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,980
Well, Little Mermaid skips the entire end of the movie.

404
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,420
Yes, right. I mean, but it ends with them happy ever after.

405
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,420
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Well, just in the background or so is drowning.

406
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,580
It's a very it's like they ran.

407
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,100
I think they just ran out of they wanted to do all the big musical set pieces.

408
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,900
I mean, that's the problem with most especially Disney musicals is you have

409
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:13,620
once you get to like the plot of Act three, you can't have musical numbers anymore

410
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,540
because musical numbers inherently are a stop in the plot.

411
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:21,340
And so that's why the kind of third act of any Disney movie is

412
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,140
arguably the most forgettable.

413
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

414
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,060
Because you're a little like, let's just get let's let's just get

415
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,140
let's just get to the end.

416
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:33,860
Like unless you have like a reprise like in Aladdin with the Prince Ali or you have

417
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,940
King Prince Ali, Pocahontas does it very well, actually.

418
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:40,500
Pocahontas has like the moment where they're going into

419
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,100
savages, savages.

420
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,940
That's like the kind of one finale that's going into kind of the

421
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,580
the darker plot of your parts.

422
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:52,500
But anyway, Little Mermaid is a testament to they put the musical numbers in.

423
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,140
And once you're done with all the musical numbers, you just want to skip to the end.

424
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:58,100
Well, yeah, because it's just like, yeah, it's fighting for a while.

425
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,860
You don't want to just be in two fighting scenes in a row in a ride.

426
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,460
You know, kind of does it is

427
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,340
kill the beast a little bit in Beauty and the Beast.

428
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,660
It's like not exactly.

429
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:12,020
But maybe that's a that's like a section that can work is the like

430
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,500
building to the to the big fight.

431
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,540
And then once you get into the fight, it's more of the battle is in itself kind of a

432
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:23,980
a musical number, like the way that battle is in Beauty and the Beast is very it's scored.

433
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,580
It's very like fun.

434
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,860
It's the it's another fun in game set piece.

435
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,820
Right. Because the furniture is like a drawer hits a guy in the face.

436
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,980
That's why I like that.

437
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,380
It doesn't be our guest.

438
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,980
Get reprised in that instrumentally, isn't it?

439
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,140
Yes, it is. Yeah, I think so.

440
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,060
Is there not a Beauty and the Beast ride anywhere?

441
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,300
They're building one in Japan.

442
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:50,220
And there have been some videos showing the Bell robots and the horse and it looks.

443
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,300
I'm surprised they're not building in Paris.

444
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,460
Yeah. Yeah. Well, Paris is weird and cheap.

445
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,740
I got to go to Euro Disney.

446
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,700
Have you been to Euro Disney?

447
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,220
I went. I've had a lot of like grapes.

448
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,340
I feel like. Really? How was your?

449
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,100
Well, I went.

450
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:08,180
I was champagne tasting and then we were champagne tasting and champagne.

451
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,700
I was there with my friend, Brendan, because I was there for a press thing.

452
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,140
And I went, wait, it was like four p.m.

453
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,580
I was like, Brendan, you realize what we're close to?

454
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,620
I was like Euro Disney.

455
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,180
And I was like, let's fucking go.

456
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,500
He's like, it closes in two and a half hours.

457
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,460
And I was like, I don't care.

458
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:26,540
So we did all we managed to do every major attraction in Euro

459
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,860
Disney in like an hour and a half. Wow. Wow.

460
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:33,020
So I remember I loved Crush's coaster.

461
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,340
I didn't get I didn't get to do I wasn't going to wait.

462
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,300
That was fucking awesome.

463
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,340
I want to say it's a rotating.

464
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,980
Yeah. You're spinning.

465
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,180
You're surfing with Crush, but it's like a roller coaster as well.

466
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,020
The Ratatouille ride was great. Yeah, that's really good.

467
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,380
Yeah. I clearly couldn't do both, I think, in the morning I had there.

468
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:54,020
Yeah, I think because we went in February when no one

469
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,100
when no one was there towards the end of the day. Sure.

470
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:57,820
We got on things.

471
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,500
But what were your gripes with Disneyland?

472
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:03,260
Why was there in December where it is so bitterly cold?

473
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:07,180
And you can tell that this used to be like a brittle farmland.

474
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,220
Yeah, essentially.

475
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:13,060
And they it was like because the weather was bad, they like closed half

476
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,900
the restaurants and it was just weird and understaffed.

477
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,340
And we scanned our own tickets on the way in.

478
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,980
It was just yeah, that was the weirdest.

479
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,580
We just have like crumpled pieces of paper and we scan them ourselves

480
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,300
in the mall outside.

481
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,780
And I don't know if you wandered around there.

482
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,220
That's like a nightmare. This wasn't a dream.

483
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,300
Yeah, yeah.

484
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,860
This does actually I do have like stressed dreams where Disneyland is bad

485
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:37,100
in some way, really something something bad happened to it.

486
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,820
Where you scan yourself in like I've had dreams, Disney, about Disney

487
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,540
all the time where the ride breaks down and I get to walk on the land.

488
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:46,260
Like I suddenly snow and I get to walk among the dolls of It's a Small World.

489
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,180
Like sure, this trippy.

490
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,020
Like we are.

491
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:54,420
Disneyland is a perfect place for like the things to serially rearrange themselves.

492
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,940
Yeah. Yeah.

493
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,900
Well, like if you have you ever seen the videos of Nara Dreamland?

494
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:03,580
It's like a Tokyo and I know it's in Japan, but it's a ripoff Disney park

495
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,220
that's closed now and it's abandoned.

496
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:05,740
Oh, that's that.

497
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:09,020
But it has like a ripoff Sleeping Beauty Castle on a main street.

498
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:13,140
So there's like urban explorers go through it and it's like overgrown

499
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,180
shrub hedges, grass, and it's the creepiest nightmare

500
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,980
because it's a surreal Disneyland.

501
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,740
Oh, no. I really want to.

502
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,380
I'm going to look. I'm going to Nara.

503
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,580
Nara Dreamland.

504
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,780
Yeah. Yeah. Very creepy.

505
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:28,700
Don't. Yeah. Don't get killed or have a wild animal.

506
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,380
Don't explore.

507
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,420
You do. Yeah.

508
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,620
Seems like a dangerous place, potentially.

509
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,740
There's an abandoned amusement park in it's Florida, right?

510
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,340
That's it's Disney's River Country.

511
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,100
That's what it is. Yeah.

512
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,020
But did they take it? Did they rip it up already?

513
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,420
They're building a hotel over.

514
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,540
Yeah, they finally ripped it up. Yeah.

515
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:50,300
Yeah, because Discovery Island is still abandoned.

516
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,060
Oh, yeah.

517
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:54,780
Island in the middle of the body of water by Magic Kingdom,

518
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:58,620
where you used to be able to go and see exotic animals and stuff.

519
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,660
And they eventually shut that down.

520
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:03,300
It's just it's just a it's in the middle of a body of water.

521
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:08,380
Now and then someone inflates an inflatable raft close by and rows out to it.

522
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:12,580
And there's just like sheds, sheds still with like stuff in them.

523
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:16,660
The animals are all gone, except the wild animals that have taken the island.

524
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,900
And the creepy detail, I always say that there's a shed

525
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,140
that's just full of vultures that have never been outside.

526
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:27,780
There's just dozens and dozens of indoor vultures who are malformed.

527
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,180
And I believe so. I think so.

528
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,860
No way. Yeah. Yeah.

529
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:35,780
It might not be as scary as what I'm describing, but preserved animals.

530
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:39,140
Like, you know, when they preserve like something and have it in a jar.

531
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:44,820
Jelly or James? No, like like an embryo, like an animal embryo and stuff.

532
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,940
There's still some some of that. That's horrifying.

533
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,820
Yeah. Well, like it's like Jurassic Park abandoned.

534
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,260
Basically. Yeah, kind of.

535
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,180
This is a great opening to a horror movie.

536
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:56,580
This is the cold open of a movie called Discover.

537
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:00,380
And we're recording the podcast and then the title, the title,

538
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,180
you know, like the title comes on and goes like, discover.

539
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,940
And then you cut to people who are like with backpacks on

540
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,940
with a handheld camera being like, OK, we're going to go see

541
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,980
Discovery Fun Time should be fun.

542
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,660
Yeah. They all die. And they all die.

543
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,580
That podcast said it was a good idea.

544
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:19,100
We haven't mentioned this on the show, but some listeners brought us

545
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,900
a gift from the abandoned Hard Rock Park. Oh, right.

546
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,460
Which is still there.

547
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,820
And they brought us what looks like brand new merchandise

548
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:30,980
from Hard Rock Park because it's just sitting somewhere in a warehouse.

549
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,100
It's a room, just a bunch of loose shit in the ground.

550
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,140
In Myrtle Beach.

551
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,980
Inland, inland from the ocean. OK, I'll feel it.

552
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:42,860
So it was poorly promoted and it was far from like the main drag.

553
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,700
So they went in it.

554
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:50,900
So it's just you can just what it's it's what fenced it like it's boarded up.

555
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,180
I don't think it's even a little or boarded.

556
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,780
They showed me a picture of just a giant warehouse

557
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,900
with merch strewn on the floor.

558
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:03,300
And it's like, and if you see it, it looks new.

559
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,940
It doesn't look like dirty or anything.

560
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:09,180
Also, all of that was supposed to be destroyed per the bankruptcy agreement.

561
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,500
And it clearly wasn't. But now.

562
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,060
But now it's there.

563
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:17,300
But literally, as I was getting out of the car, I saw a headline on my phone

564
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:21,580
or my phone that said mysterious fire at Old Theme Park. Like.

565
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:25,100
Yeah, I saw there was a fire down there.

566
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,740
So who knows if that merchandise is still there?

567
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,540
We have some of the last merch.

568
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,860
What was it again? What did we get?

569
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,780
I forget. It's like a water bottle.

570
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,180
It's like a big water bottle in the shape of a guitar, I think.

571
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,700
It's a bag. It's a plastic bag.

572
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,380
All of it looks brand new.

573
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,460
What is the fascination with hard?

574
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:45,940
Because there are people who have to go to hard rocks in every city.

575
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,460
Have you talked about this on the podcast?

576
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:51,100
Yeah, a little bit. Yeah, this year sort of this has been my take a little bit.

577
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,180
What is I don't even know.

578
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,180
It's a cafe that celebrates rock and roll.

579
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,780
What what? Well, love all.

580
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:59,740
Surf all that is no food definition whatsoever.

581
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:03,220
I don't know what kind of terrible, terrible food, really bad food.

582
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:07,500
So what? But it's like you can order like Joe Perry macaroni.

583
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,220
I know. I know the story behind.

584
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:12,580
So I believe the initial

585
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,780
impetus of it was like the founders couldn't find a good burger in London.

586
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:21,620
So they and they had some rock and roll connection.

587
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,780
So they're like, hey, can we get some guitars?

588
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,060
We're going to open this restaurant that does burgers and stuff.

589
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:29,340
And then at some point, they were also like, we can do barbecue

590
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,580
because they have like a decent like a.

591
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:37,420
And they bought like they bought 300 guitars from Scott Weiland

592
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,020
Chris Cornell. And that's it.

593
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:43,260
And that's all just only velvet revolver will be shown in this.

594
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:48,780
So what's the thing that people have to go to the hard rock

595
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:52,180
in every major city like and get the merchandise?

596
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:57,340
My friend's mom loves merchandise from every hard rock.

597
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,900
Wow. And she's not the only one.

598
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,980
Yeah, I mean, they're very popular because they're still around.

599
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:05,700
They've been around for years. And it's like, I mean, I used to do it

600
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,100
from when I was a kid with Planet Hollywood.

601
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,620
If there was a planet Hollywood somewhere, we went on vacation

602
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,780
because I loved the movies.

603
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:15,140
But like just movies.

604
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,300
Were they different in each location?

605
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,980
Were they all they all had different props?

606
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,900
Oh, OK. And still there's still two or three hanging on.

607
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:25,100
But like, yeah, you go to the one.

608
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,340
First of all, I've never had a good meal at the one universal.

609
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,780
I've been there like maybe three times in 10 years.

610
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,860
It's horrible. And it's horrible. Yeah.

611
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:35,180
And it's like, what is even the identity of the hard hard?

612
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,260
What does hard rock mean to them?

613
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,860
Well, does it mean Gwen Stefani, because that's in there?

614
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,300
The rest of us. And that doesn't mean Lenny Kravitz.

615
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:47,380
The restaurant is different than the hotel spokesman for Hard Rock today.

616
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:50,780
But it's all owned by the Seminole tribe now. Right.

617
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,380
Who? Like, that's another development.

618
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,780
Yes. Mm hmm.

619
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:57,540
They they own the Hard Rock Company now.

620
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,140
That's great. Yeah.

621
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,900
That makes me want to support them. Yeah.

622
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,220
All right. Just a little mom and pop.

623
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,500
Is rock and roller coaster Hard Rock?

624
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:08,100
No, no, no. That's I mean, it rocks.

625
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,700
It certainly is.

626
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:13,860
Yeah, it's still the best tribute to Hard Rock out there.

627
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,180
It's ending in Paris, though. It just closed.

628
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,420
Oh, you know, the one in Paris, I went on it was very bumpy.

629
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:22,180
OK. Well, they aren't changing the trick.

630
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:25,380
They're just saying is the fireman now.

631
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,180
So yeah, so same. Yeah, same shit.

632
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,380
Oh, they're just closing it to make it more relevant. OK.

633
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,300
I think so. Yeah.

634
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,580
That actually brings up a good

635
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:38,660
you as a music person favorite music in the park, favorite music related attraction.

636
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,500
I mean, I assume it's Aerosmith.

637
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,540
I assume Aerosmith's number one for everybody. Yeah, of course.

638
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:48,060
I love any time a roller coaster has music associated with it.

639
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,380
So I love the old California Screamin track.

640
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,260
I think I ride. That was great.

641
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,980
Are you mad that it would change?

642
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,580
No, no. I think in credit coasters also very good, actually.

643
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,700
And I I have a problem.

644
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:04,500
I have a very I have very mixed feelings about and this is everything now

645
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,460
about rides that center around movie properties because you inherently

646
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:12,260
have to know the movie to appreciate the ride and the ride promotes the movie.

647
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:17,700
I'm a big fan of rides that contain their own narrative, that tell their own story.

648
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:22,060
I mean, which is what Pirates of the Caribbean used to be, which is what

649
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,460
Haunted Mansion, you know, kind of still is.

650
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,820
And then they made that terrible movie, but no one really talks about it.

651
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,820
Yeah. So I like if you gave me a billion dollars,

652
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,740
I would start an amusement park

653
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:36,660
where the rides didn't feed into any sort of book or movie.

654
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,580
The rides told their own story.

655
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,980
So that's just a little bit of a problem.

656
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:44,900
It's a it's a problem that I have with Disneyland that that now

657
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,460
everything is just feeding into a Disney property.

658
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,100
There's no unique story anymore. Sure.

659
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,940
And it is and it is what it is.

660
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,100
And I'm not saying California Screamin was a story.

661
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:58,820
It was just the theme was the theme.

662
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:02,140
I mean, because I remember when it first opened, the theme was just

663
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:05,100
celebrating California. And yeah, it was a little boring.

664
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,620
My dad actually wrote an angry letter to Disney saying how boring it was.

665
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,020
I don't think he was the only one.

666
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,300
I know. Yeah, yeah, no.

667
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,580
So he was really we were really bored.

668
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:16,460
But but looking back on it, there was something really noble about that

669
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,900
where it was like, you know what?

670
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,700
We're just going to fucking celebrate California and we're going to have this

671
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:24,820
old fashioned boardwalk and you can go and make tortillas

672
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,260
at the Mission Tortilla Factory.

673
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:30,820
And and then they just were like, fuck it, it's cars.

674
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,060
I've never seen cars. I love the cars ride.

675
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,340
I don't really understand why the cars are talking.

676
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,860
I mean, I get it. The cars are talking.

677
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,220
All I have to do is see cars once.

678
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:45,860
But it it always just it's it's it bothers me.

679
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:49,340
It bothers me that everything now has to feed into a property

680
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:52,420
that you have to have seen to fully appreciate the ride. Sure.

681
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:55,860
And you know, you talk about we talk about like ride stories.

682
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:59,340
I think they're almost the most likely to be confusing

683
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:02,060
if you need to have seen the film.

684
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:05,900
Well, that's what I'm more lost than I mean, I guess Indiana Jones is one.

685
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:08,140
You have you done Avatar in Florida?

686
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:08,940
Have you been to Orlando?

687
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,140
No, I haven't been.

688
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,940
I haven't been recently enough to do Avatar.

689
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,620
It's that's the most confusing thing.

690
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,580
It shouldn't be. You're just on the back of a monster.

691
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:20,420
The mighty Akron, of course, we remember. Yeah.

692
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,260
From the movie. The thing that he tames.

693
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,620
Yeah, the Banshee.

694
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:26,060
But then like all it is is just flying and you enjoy it.

695
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,380
That's really what they should say.

696
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,500
Hey, get on the back of that thing and enjoy it.

697
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,780
But it's not it's like three different rooms of explaining

698
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:35,900
how you're going to be downloaded into an avnavi.

699
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,220
And then you're getting on here.

700
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,100
And now we have to scan your heat signature.

701
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:42,260
Also scanning like guardians is getting scanned everywhere.

702
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:45,620
Both roadie, both roadie attraction, Joe roadie attraction scans.

703
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:49,220
I just saw a Joe roadie lecture and he did cover this.

704
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,820
He talked about really, OK?

705
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:54,380
He did talk about this because and this was very funny

706
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:59,340
because a friend had written the roundup of like, here's

707
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,940
I'm like you wrote the article for the L.A.

708
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:06,180
Times about like, I'm concerned IP coming out of D23

709
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,660
is so much intellectual property based attractions.

710
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,540
Is this kind of killing the theme parks?

711
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:15,660
And the curator, when interviewing Joe roadie, brought up this article.

712
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:19,540
And this guy was like white knuckling like, oh, my God, like Joe roadie.

713
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,020
He was there. Oh.

714
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:25,660
And so roadie's theory is that like there every every piece,

715
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:30,180
you know, if you think about like the film school or art school,

716
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,420
you're given a prompt for a project.

717
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:36,140
So as imagineers, they're given a prompt for an attraction

718
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,780
or they're giving a topic or something.

719
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:42,020
And then they have to go back to zero anyway, because they have to

720
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:46,980
try to then make it work for ages eight to 80.

721
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:50,860
And every person, people from all over the world coming to see it.

722
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:56,940
And I think his theory is that when done at the highest level,

723
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:59,580
done on the best attractions, that does work.

724
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:03,060
Like, it doesn't matter if you don't know the property will give from

725
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,380
when you come into the queue to when you'll leave,

726
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,620
you will understand this whole experience.

727
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,940
Do they always accomplish that?

728
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:12,300
It's clearly up for debate.

729
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,340
How is that? That lecture sounds like a blast.

730
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,460
You get wasted. Yeah, got hammered.

731
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,100
Got hammered and fell down the hill at the getty.

732
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:24,580
Rody. But that makes a lot of sense because I I want to say

733
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:28,300
I rode Star Tours before I ever saw Star Wars and Star Tours makes sense.

734
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,140
Like, yeah, it's a it's a coherent narrative.

735
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,820
Indiana Jones makes sense.

736
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:35,020
Yeah, you're in a temple and they and they also have that great introductory

737
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:38,660
video before and cars doesn't have to necessarily make sense.

738
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:42,460
Guardians does not make sense.

739
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:45,180
Like Guardians is tougher. It's a tougher one.

740
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:49,900
But it's so fun. I mean, it's it's it's really fun.

741
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:54,860
I think are we just all worried about the is this a slippery slope situation?

742
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,260
Are we worried? This is what I'm worried about Marvel.

743
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:59,500
I'm worried that I need to have seen all that.

744
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,820
Well, there's going to be as Marvel is going to they have a cinematic

745
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:05,860
universe, of course, but they're going to have a theme park universe,

746
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:08,980
which is a different continuity than the movie.

747
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:12,380
And the movie was different than the comic books one parks.

748
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:15,100
But maybe he's spoiler alert dead in the movies.

749
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:18,180
So like that's going to be a whole nother thing that you'll have to learn.

750
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,740
Well, that's what Harry Potter does it.

751
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:22,020
I mean, yes, I love Harry Potter world.

752
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,820
Well, I like Harry Potter world.

753
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:26,300
I like Harry Potter world and Harry Potter world specifically.

754
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:29,420
It takes place in the start of Book Three.

755
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,900
Right. Because you have this wanted serious black posters around.

756
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:35,420
Right. And the kid and they're like kids forever.

757
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,260
They're kids forever.

758
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:40,020
I mean, the thing that bothers me about Harry Potter land is I

759
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,180
there's no escaping this because it's made by Warner Brothers.

760
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,620
It's meant to promote the movies.

761
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,740
Everything is strictly looks like the movies.

762
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:49,900
Yeah. Yeah. Which when I read the books,

763
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:53,500
I don't picture people wearing like muggle clothing with a robe.

764
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,780
I picture just robes.

765
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:57,380
So like the Quidditch stuff in the movies is kind of this,

766
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,700
you know, it's it's like athletic.

767
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,060
It's like athletic like armor

768
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,820
with a robe that's just kind of like attached to it.

769
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,740
But the way it's described in the book is just robes.

770
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:11,220
There are all these little things where where I just I'm like,

771
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,060
oh, when I'm in Harry Potter land, I'm not completely immersing myself

772
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,220
in the fantasy of the books because it's the movies. Right.

773
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:20,260
And there are certain things that differ in the movies from the books.

774
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:23,260
And then also Daniel Radcliffe is not how I picture Harry Potter.

775
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:24,620
Oh, no.

776
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,700
And it's not how I picture Hermione. Right. Right.

777
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,180
I mean, I don't I don't picture the way I picture Harry

778
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:32,060
Ron and Hermione are different than the actors who play them. Sure.

779
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,580
And it does feel like well, because like what I want, I have not read the books.

780
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:38,140
I've seen all the movies, but I've been told by people read the books.

781
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:41,660
The books are like way better than movies are fine. Yeah, they're fun.

782
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:44,260
But obviously, that's the one that's the thing people associate more.

783
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:47,620
So they want people just to recognize, oh, that's Harry. I know him.

784
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:52,580
I would much rather the the rides be based on like the illustrations

785
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:55,900
of Mary Grandprey, who did all the books than the movies,

786
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,180
because it takes me out of it a little.

787
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,860
But that's also me being like

788
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:06,340
a dork who who wants to go to an amusement park and really fully imagine

789
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,300
that I'm in this experience.

790
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:10,180
And I'm never going to fully imagine that I'm in Harry Potter world

791
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:14,140
when I see the actors playing Harry Ron and Hermione

792
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,300
that I know aren't really Harry Ron and Hermione. Right.

793
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,580
Because it would actually be it would be more immersive

794
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:22,940
if you didn't recognize the people in a weird way of like, well, that's actually them.

795
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,740
That's not the movie versions.

796
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,180
Those are the these are people. I don't.

797
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,500
These are the guys. Yeah, I guess that's what I'm saying.

798
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,500
Like, you'd be like, well, those are the real ones.

799
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,900
They're on the ride, but they're not the actors. Yeah.

800
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,940
Yeah. Yeah, that's kind of what I'm like.

801
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,900
They cast different actors for the land.

802
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,900
Then those would actually be the real ones.

803
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,060
You know what? That's a great idea.

804
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:46,220
And I completely agree with that. Yes, totally.

805
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:51,420
And I know that that's completely not how capitalism works. Right.

806
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,420
And and that's exactly the opposite of what they want.

807
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,820
They want to be promoting the movies.

808
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:58,140
But yeah, that's kind of what I'm craving.

809
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:02,780
I'm just kind of craving it being an being an immersive being an immersive land.

810
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:05,380
I mean, I like Harry Potter, The Forbidden Journey, but also

811
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:10,180
I just kind of would love to immerse myself in the world

812
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:12,300
and not necessarily see the characters from the books.

813
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,260
Yeah, that makes sense.

814
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,940
I mean, you're living in the world, you're not seeing

815
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,420
you're not helping Harry, Ron and Hermione.

816
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,420
You're just kind of like living your life as a wizard.

817
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,260
There is something different between like when you go on a ride

818
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:25,180
that's like IP ride versus Haunted Mansion, where it's like it's like recco.

819
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:29,020
Like, oh, I recall that this looks like the thing I watched on TV versus like

820
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,340
I'm wandering into an experience.

821
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:34,580
I'm wandering into something that is totally different.

822
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,060
I can't get it at home.

823
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:39,580
I can't I can't get any version of it in a book or at home.

824
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,620
And it's truly special in this place.

825
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,940
And that's it. And maybe Florida and Tokyo.

826
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:47,300
Does Indiana Jones, like almost accidentally hit this the best

827
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,420
because Harrison Ford isn't involved.

828
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:53,660
So you get like glimpses of indie, but it's not like there's not a monitor

829
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:57,660
in front on your Jeep where Harrison Ford is giving you instructions.

830
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,260
And maybe it's all happening to you.

831
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,420
And it's a new story.

832
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,220
Mm hmm. Yeah. Yeah.

833
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,140
And the fact that's and also like Star Tours

834
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:07,980
isn't C3VN or TDD tour in it, but it's not like, well, you know,

835
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:11,180
well, new Star Tours, now the new characters appear in the window

836
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,620
as opposed to this is sort of its own thing.

837
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:17,300
And I don't know who that pilot is who shows up and Rex is only

838
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:21,340
only in that and no original Star Tours was that whole that new character.

839
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:26,380
The pilot who keeps fucking up and my favorite character in fiction, Rex.

840
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:27,820
Right. Right.

841
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,900
Our show. It's your first ride.

842
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,220
It's my first time to.

843
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:34,100
And he's DJing now and he's gotten to go.

844
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,460
Have you gotten to see him, DJ?

845
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,820
No, I haven't. What is he in the cantina? Yeah.

846
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,220
Yeah. So I couldn't get in.

847
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,500
I couldn't get in. Oh, yeah.

848
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,660
I couldn't get into the cantina because by the time I went,

849
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:46,660
I went to one of the preview days, but tickets were already sold out. Yeah.

850
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,180
Yeah, because it was a mad dash to get there.

851
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:54,580
Like, it would be like I saw a person get trampled running to get to the cantina.

852
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,700
And then like most people didn't help.

853
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:00,220
Like I was way behind, so I didn't even have a chance to help them.

854
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:02,300
But, you know, they were.

855
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,100
You would have loved to.

856
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,500
There were like at least five.

857
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,580
You tell the judge. Yeah, of course.

858
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:10,540
There are five to seven people who just ran over the person.

859
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:11,660
That's so fantastic.

860
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,780
Oh, my God.

861
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,900
And now you can just make a reservation on the app.

862
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,500
You can. Yeah.

863
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,460
Oh, yeah.

864
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,300
They should have done that from the beginning.

865
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,340
You would think. You would think that would make sense.

866
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:24,460
So can I say I hated the blue and green milk?

867
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,980
Oh, yeah. Sure.

868
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,580
Well, that's not that didn't taste like milk.

869
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:28,780
It was a fruit smoothie.

870
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:31,340
It was like a shitty vegan fruit smoothie.

871
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,940
And I understand like you don't want to make people sick.

872
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,740
But like when I picture blue milk, I don't picture like a fruit smoothie.

873
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:41,340
If you don't want people to get sick from all the dairy, do like a sweetened

874
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,300
almond milk or a sweetened cashew milk.

875
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,340
But instead, it's like fruity.

876
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,300
No, that's bullshit.

877
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,380
That fight. So they played the color and not not the word milk.

878
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,500
It's called blue milk.

879
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,220
So milk is sort of if they call it something different, maybe.

880
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,780
Yeah, but it's but the whole thing is you drink blue milk.

881
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:59,420
Mm hmm. Do they call it blue milk in the movie? Yeah.

882
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:03,100
They like say Uncle Owen, I want my blue milk or something.

883
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,860
I'm not. My milk cup is empty.

884
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:09,100
And bro is like, finish your blue milk.

885
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,740
I am 85 percent sure they do.

886
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,660
I can't remember what they do.

887
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,820
Why would we all do? It's not milk.

888
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,100
It's not the consistency of milk.

889
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,100
It's like it's like a fruit smoothie.

890
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,140
And I got to say, like kind of a shitty smoothie.

891
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:25,740
I think my take on it has because I was expecting to not like it at all.

892
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,460
And then I liked it.

893
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,900
I tried both and I liked both for like four sips.

894
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:32,340
And then it started to become how am I not?

895
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:36,300
This is a pretty crazy flavor to be drinking a lot of and not getting drunk.

896
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:42,260
Like this that I'm not getting the reward of a little buzz.

897
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,620
And I'm just sucking down so much sugar and weird artificial.

898
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:47,700
Maybe in Florida, you can get a shot.

899
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,220
Yes, that's the point.

900
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,780
So that would improve the entire thing. Yeah, I think so.

901
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,620
But when you think about butter beer at Harry Potter World,

902
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,220
like butterbeer is amazing. Yeah.

903
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,900
Like butterbeer really lives up to like, you know what?

904
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:00,900
Especially when you get it hot, like, yeah, that's exactly how I pictured

905
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,300
butterbeer tasting and more.

906
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,500
And especially when you get it with some some whiskey in it.

907
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:07,260
Yeah. I mean, I forgot about that.

908
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:11,500
I was at Universal the other day and like when I am up there,

909
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,620
I can just like passively consume butter.

910
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:16,540
Like I'll just like get it without even thinking and drink it.

911
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,820
Like it's it's just like a coma.

912
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,500
No, like I will.

913
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,820
I will not even hesitate to get it in the way of like,

914
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,900
do I really feel like this blue milk today?

915
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,340
Getting water out of the fridge.

916
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,900
You're not even like, OK, basically.

917
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:35,940
But I also I the other day I was it was so hot and I had a sore throat.

918
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,460
And I was like, oh, wait, there's frozen butter beer.

919
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:41,460
And it felt great. Like I felt so much better.

920
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:44,660
It was so soothing frozen for a sore throat, not a worm.

921
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:49,420
Well, it was like 98 degrees up on top of that hill.

922
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:52,780
So I think I wanted to cool down and also soothe my throat.

923
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,380
The frozen butter beer is it's delicious.

924
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,140
Would you recommend it for a sore throat, though?

925
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:00,060
Anything anything cold for a sore throat is really.

926
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,580
I guess I always go warm for a cold, not in the long run,

927
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:04,180
because it's so much dairy and sugar.

928
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:06,300
It's going to probably fuck your immune system.

929
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,300
But to soothe your throat. Yeah.

930
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,460
Yeah. Not daily butter beer.

931
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,860
I'm always warm for sore throat.

932
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:12,860
But maybe I'm doing it wrong.

933
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,700
We did like a supersize me with just butter beer.

934
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,900
You drank butter beer for 30 days.

935
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,660
I feel like you had magic powers.

936
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,620
That lives up to like the hype of life.

937
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:24,700
Yeah, it's we've we've talked a little bit about this on the show, too.

938
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:27,260
It's like that one also, from the way I've heard it described

939
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:30,140
in the book in the way kids like they talk about it in the movie.

940
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,340
It's like, wow, this magical great drink.

941
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:35,700
And I never except for Jason, who was the first person I ever heard

942
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:39,340
say he watched Star Wars and was like, got to try that blue milk.

943
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:42,740
Like I was like, oh, that's some gross thing they're pouring in.

944
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:45,700
Like it's also not the name Blue Milk.

945
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:49,220
It's also not the name Blue Milk does not sound good.

946
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:50,900
It's like there's nothing magical.

947
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,300
It's not like Lucas, like, wow, I get to get back to tattooing

948
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,380
to drink my delicious blue milk.

949
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:58,180
No, but it's all the idea of like immersion and fantasy and feeling.

950
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:01,020
I mean, the most I went with, I went to Harry Potter World

951
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:04,940
a couple of months ago with a bunch of my friends who like love Harry Potter.

952
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:09,820
And our favorite thing was just drinking butter beer in the three broomsticks.

953
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:13,340
And then we like talked in British accents and pretended we were wizards.

954
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,660
Like that was my favorite part.

955
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:16,540
And you didn't have to.

956
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:19,740
I didn't have to look at like CGI Dan Radcliffe,

957
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:21,500
because I could just pretend I was in the books.

958
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,180
Mm hmm. Yes. OK.

959
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:27,380
You're not there to meet the characters, especially the actors in the film.

960
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:29,660
Yeah. No, I don't. You want it to you're there.

961
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:33,420
I want it that I'm I want it completely immersive that I'm that I'm there.

962
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:37,020
I mean, they've been rumoring Harry Potter Hotel for so long,

963
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:40,860
but that feels like if they had a little like that feels like what you're saying.

964
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:43,380
The ultimate version of it is like you're just living in it.

965
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:45,620
It's not so much of seeing the actors.

966
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:48,420
It's just like maybe they make a little restaurant bar

967
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:50,860
and you just get to hang out and pretend you're in Hogwarts.

968
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:53,100
That's what I want, because when I was there on a Harry Potter night,

969
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:56,020
they also you can pose with like Bo Baton's and Durmstrang students.

970
00:43:56,020 --> 00:44:01,500
But but I in the real world, Bo Baton's students and Durmstrang students

971
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,220
would just be like around to pose with.

972
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,740
They'd be students.

973
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,340
They wouldn't they wouldn't just be waiting.

974
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:08,420
That doesn't that doesn't how Harry Potter works.

975
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:11,900
Yeah, I think I took I want I went to Harry Potter land

976
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:15,660
with future guest Aaron Whitehead, and she liked it, but was very

977
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:19,820
was like, what did all these humans walk like she was really kind of almost upset

978
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:22,780
by like she is a big yes, she is.

979
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:25,820
She almost want you want there to be a dress code.

980
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:29,060
You want everyone to have to be in a robe. You want.

981
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:34,580
You want to de-mentor terrorist attack to be happening suddenly.

982
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:38,460
I think that is because that happens on the ride.

983
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:40,740
First off, you're in the middle of a Quidditch match.

984
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:45,180
Yeah. If you were on like a jet pack and just landed in a major league

985
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:50,060
baseball game, but then also like an attack starts happening

986
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:52,220
to a major league baseball game.

987
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:55,180
It's like, wait, I just got over the jet pack guy.

988
00:44:55,860 --> 00:45:01,540
Why are there why are there SWAT people in the Yankee Stadium?

989
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:03,700
Didn't we get stuck in front of one of them?

990
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,580
Oh, in the front of the de-mentor.

991
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:08,260
Yeah, I've gotten stuck in front of the giant spider.

992
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:10,340
I've gotten stuck in the room full of de-mentors.

993
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:12,260
It's not a great place to just hang out.

994
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:14,100
Oh, I mean, the ride breaking down.

995
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:18,260
Yeah. Oh, the ride broke down when I was on and we just got the screen went out.

996
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:20,340
So then but the ride kept moving.

997
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:24,220
So it was just going through and we're like, oh, yeah, if this goes on for 10

998
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:25,500
minutes, we're going to throw up.

999
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,700
This is the most nauseous thing you got stuck in the loop of.

1000
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:31,260
We got stuck in the loop of moving, but the screens went out.

1001
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:32,780
Oh, that's so.

1002
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,260
So it was really weird.

1003
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:38,220
Wow. All the all your mind is getting that is like jerking movement.

1004
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:41,180
It's not even fooling you with the visuals that you're going through.

1005
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,500
Yeah, you're just getting jerked around.

1006
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,540
You're just getting jerked around.

1007
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:45,420
I think it was the whopping.

1008
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:47,220
I think it was in front of the one.

1009
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:48,700
Yeah, we got stuck.

1010
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:50,220
I remember the music went out.

1011
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:51,820
We were stuck. We were static.

1012
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:52,980
Yeah, but we could.

1013
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:56,180
There was still the music tracks or the audio tracks of Harry.

1014
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,380
So you just hear like, get away from them.

1015
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:00,660
And there were no music.

1016
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:01,420
There was no nothing.

1017
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:04,780
You just hear, hey, like just no, stop.

1018
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:06,620
And then like every minute.

1019
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:09,340
And then we were just like upside, not upside down, but like staring at the

1020
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:10,980
ceiling, waiting for it to start.

1021
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:13,940
When I wrote it the other day, I actually got all the way through it.

1022
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:16,860
But one of the times they had accidentally left at the very end,

1023
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:18,740
the I saw the maintenance bay.

1024
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:19,940
They left the lights on.

1025
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:21,860
I was like, oh, that's where the maintenance bay is.

1026
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:25,460
But for people like us, I'm like, oh, yes, now I know where the maintenance bay is.

1027
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:26,380
Nice, nice.

1028
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:27,420
That happened on pirates.

1029
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:30,140
If you go by the pirate ship, sometimes you see the door

1030
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:33,500
where they send boats and the door will be open straight away.

1031
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,300
And like light was coming out of it once.

1032
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:35,940
Oh, yeah.

1033
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:37,580
And I was like, yeah.

1034
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:39,660
And then I was like, come on, can we go

1035
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:41,340
like send us into the maintenance bay?

1036
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,660
I love Googling pictures of Space Mountain with the lights on.

1037
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:44,620
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1038
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:45,740
We got sent off.

1039
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:48,140
We got sent off to the left recently.

1040
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:49,900
We will tell that story at a different time.

1041
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:50,780
But we got sent.

1042
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:53,940
We were going to Space Mountain and you go to the right and you go up the hill.

1043
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,100
We were going, going, going.

1044
00:46:56,100 --> 00:47:00,060
Also, we took a left and we went, what the hell is another way?

1045
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:02,020
What the fuck was the left?

1046
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:06,100
Well, we are with a person that will be a guest and we'll see if he wants to tell

1047
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:08,980
the story, honestly, I'll tell you off after.

1048
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:10,140
It's just a little secret.

1049
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:11,900
This is you can't tell this.

1050
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,140
Well, I feel like your spoilers.

1051
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:15,700
No, no, this is big news.

1052
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,020
This is big news.

1053
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:18,700
Yeah, this is a big this is going to tease.

1054
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:22,700
This is people going to be like, oh, have you guys seen Club 33?

1055
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:24,060
Yes, we did.

1056
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:25,380
We all get together.

1057
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:29,060
After the you were you went to the That's From Disneyland gallery.

1058
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:30,820
We did. We did a show there.

1059
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:33,780
And you were on Paul's show and we got to go to Club 33 with those

1060
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:36,020
foot with the the craft who did the.

1061
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,620
Actually, yeah.

1062
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:38,900
How was it? How was your.

1063
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:41,100
Oh, wait. Well, OK. Yeah. Club 33, first of all. Yeah.

1064
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,980
Yeah. I mean, you've talked about on the podcast.

1065
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:44,660
I was going to say, what do I know that?

1066
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:47,100
Well, I'll tell you what I what I've done

1067
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:51,700
a numerous times now that is is the is the VIP tour, which anyone can do.

1068
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:53,300
Anyone can pay for it.

1069
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:57,700
But I because I'm like on TV,

1070
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:01,540
I get it like so when you pay the when you do the VIP tour,

1071
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:04,660
what you normally do is you just get like in the in the fast pass lines

1072
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:06,620
on every ride, I think.

1073
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:10,180
But because I'm on TV, I get in the exits again, the exits.

1074
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:14,300
And so I get to see the kind of behind the scenes of every ride.

1075
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:16,140
And they're like, please don't take pictures.

1076
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:18,500
It's very cool. Oh, man.

1077
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,420
Have you seen anything weird that we would know?

1078
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:23,780
It's mostly you know, it's it just reminds me of like when I worked at a restaurant,

1079
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:27,460
like you see like ship schedules and you see lockers.

1080
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:30,980
And it's pretty it's pretty what you would expect.

1081
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:32,780
So strange that it's just a play.

1082
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:35,820
And really, it doesn't you think that might ruin the magic.

1083
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:38,540
But I find that no, I think that's true.

1084
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:41,140
I find it cooler. I like seeing the back because I because I

1085
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,300
we come from the theater. Sure.

1086
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,820
You know, there's a backstage and then there's when you're on stage.

1087
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:50,420
And so if you view the whole thing as a theatrical experience, no, it's fine.

1088
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:53,260
Maybe makes you appreciate more that like, but it isn't magic.

1089
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:56,060
There's human beings putting this together just like any job.

1090
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:58,580
I use the star tours bathroom.

1091
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:02,340
Dan, when I because I did I went with a person who's on TV.

1092
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:03,580
So we got to do that.

1093
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:05,340
The stars are spoilers.

1094
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:07,380
Yeah, we talked about that.

1095
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:10,060
It's Jeff Garland. I'm Jeff Garland.

1096
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:13,860
He took. But yeah, there's a we went in like a little side door.

1097
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:16,020
And the guy was like, do you want to use the bathroom?

1098
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:19,260
And I went, oh, my God, of course, there's a secret little bathroom.

1099
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:21,660
It's not for regular guests, just for employees.

1100
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:23,740
And they let me use it. And I was thrilled.

1101
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:25,540
What was it like? All over it.

1102
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:26,740
You got it so messy.

1103
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:28,940
Yeah, I marked it. I marked my territory.

1104
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:31,060
Never be able to last to use the star tours.

1105
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:34,060
It was unexciting.

1106
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:35,420
It's like a standard bathroom.

1107
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:38,100
Yeah, it was not like there was wrecks in there like cheering me on.

1108
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:40,780
It wasn't blue milk in the toilet.

1109
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:42,380
No, there was no blue milk.

1110
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:45,740
It was not spending the money on like the they're not spending

1111
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:47,740
the money to like entertain the employees.

1112
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:52,260
No, no. In fact, they want the opposite. Yeah. Sure. Sure.

1113
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:55,980
But Rachel, did you bid on anything?

1114
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:57,580
It's a That's from Disneyland exhibit.

1115
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:01,740
Yeah, I I bid and I and I got

1116
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:05,380
us the a poster from when Splash Mountain opened.

1117
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:08,220
I want to say it's a poster from 1989.

1118
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:10,620
I got some.

1119
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:16,340
I mean, they're very cool, but like they're they're these kind of souvenir

1120
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:18,740
souvenir, like I want to say 30th anniversary

1121
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:22,020
commemorative haunted mansion like brick bookends.

1122
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:25,980
Oh, great. Which was it was I guess it was it was a Disney item

1123
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:27,660
that they were selling at the time.

1124
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:30,660
And I bid like looking back on it, like way too much money on those.

1125
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:34,980
But that thing like I got to do an auction a couple of years prior

1126
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:37,500
and it was not nearly as bad that that's from Disneyland

1127
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:42,060
when everything spiked insanely, like three times what the one I went to.

1128
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:46,740
So when I went to the original auction, it said the sky bucket was going.

1129
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:48,780
The starting price was six thousand dollars.

1130
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:51,220
That's what it said.

1131
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:55,580
So I really thought and I was like and everything was like kind of personal.

1132
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:58,780
I really thought I could get this sky bucket.

1133
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:01,180
And I was like, all right, it's not going to be six thousand dollars.

1134
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:02,740
Maybe it'll go up to fifteen thousand dollars.

1135
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:06,500
And I was I was willing to spend like a chunk of change

1136
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:10,220
for that Disneyland sky bucket because I rode the sky buckets as a kid.

1137
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:14,060
I mean, I have I not only have a video of sky buckets, I have a video that my mom

1138
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:15,820
because my mom grew up in Southern California.

1139
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:19,060
There's a video of her and her parents at Disneyland in the in the 60s

1140
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:20,060
in a sky bucket.

1141
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:22,420
So like that is a that is a huge.

1142
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:24,900
Oh, my God. To have a sky bucket in my backyard, like that would have been

1143
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:27,420
the budget for like my backyard decoration. Yeah.

1144
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:30,580
Just never. You don't spend that every. No, no, no, no.

1145
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:33,340
So I was I was prepared to buy a sky bucket.

1146
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:37,220
And then when they the fact that they had online voting.

1147
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:41,620
So the starting the starting bid for the sky bucket was one hundred thousand.

1148
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:44,460
As soon as it began.

1149
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:45,940
And you're there in person.

1150
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:47,420
I'm there in person.

1151
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:49,660
I specifically wanted the sky bucket.

1152
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:53,300
I think I went both days, but I was waiting for the fucking sky bucket.

1153
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:55,900
And when the starting bid came on at a hundred thousand.

1154
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:58,980
A bid from Brunei has come in.

1155
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:00,980
It was it was devastating.

1156
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:04,820
It was absolutely devastating because I was fucking there.

1157
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:06,660
I was there. I was there in the room.

1158
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:09,460
And then Drew Carey was a couple of rows in front of me.

1159
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:14,580
He tried to bid on a Dumbo car and he was in the mix.

1160
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:17,060
And the host of prices, right?

1161
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:19,260
Is bidding in front of you.

1162
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:20,580
And he was in the mix.

1163
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:21,740
And then it went up.

1164
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:25,180
He was in the mix up until it was like maybe three hundred fifty thousand dollars.

1165
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:28,140
Whoa. And then like it hit like half a million.

1166
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:29,860
And he's like, I'm out.

1167
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:31,740
Drew Carey's tapping out.

1168
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:34,020
Drew Carey tapped out. And someone got it online.

1169
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:37,460
And and I think he cried.

1170
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:43,220
Oh, man. It was it was it was absolutely it was devastating.

1171
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,740
You look at the sky bucket.

1172
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:48,180
If I was like, I get this for six thousand dollars.

1173
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,700
It sounds great. Yeah.

1174
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:50,780
Yeah. Oh, my God. Yeah.

1175
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:51,980
Not insane at all.

1176
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:55,540
Yeah. You'd spend more than that on, like, you know, like redoing a counter or something.

1177
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:58,300
I was shocked. And then there was a rocket rods car.

1178
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,900
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we saw that.

1179
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:02,340
Which the guy told us I got to do record.

1180
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:04,100
Yeah, it was a garbage ride.

1181
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:09,340
Nicky Craft, part of the auction, said that he would like part his like first car in high school.

1182
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:12,700
He'd get out of the garage and like, guys, watch the rocket rod.

1183
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:16,060
He'd have to like, it was parked in there, not ding it up with his car.

1184
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:18,780
Growing up with a rocket rod in your garage.

1185
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:20,420
What a really. That's very cool.

1186
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:21,900
Did you do you did record? Yeah. Yeah.

1187
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:24,860
I mean, I wasn't nostalgic enough to like want to buy a rocket rod car.

1188
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:30,260
Now, and that thing seemed like it would require a real a team to move it to get it anywhere.

1189
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:33,140
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, no one's really like missing rocket rods.

1190
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:34,260
There's a reason the ride.

1191
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:37,180
So for those of you don't know, rocket rods was a short lived

1192
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:40,620
roller coaster that was built over the people mover track.

1193
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:44,020
The people mover, which is a ride that still exists in Florida, doesn't exist here.

1194
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,020
And so it was a flat roller coaster.

1195
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:48,860
Yeah. Where they did not have the budget to bank the turns.

1196
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:52,300
Right. So you slowed down at the turn and it wrecked the track

1197
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:54,940
so that the people mover could never come back. Right.

1198
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:58,100
And the and it just made it so being in Tomorrowland for those two years

1199
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:02,580
it was open was just like, like the most unpleasant grinding.

1200
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:05,660
Yeah. Every 10 seconds. Yeah. Remember that? Yeah.

1201
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:09,460
The sound of tomorrow.

1202
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:12,500
And it's like really, if you think about it, has like ruined

1203
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:15,340
Tomorrowland for the last 20 years.

1204
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:17,540
Yeah. Because there's no movement in it.

1205
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:19,860
Those tracks are just sitting there unused.

1206
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:21,900
Yeah. Like the whole thing. They're still there, right?

1207
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,580
The track is. Yeah.

1208
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:26,740
Also, the law has changed where like

1209
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:29,940
if the people mover just kept going, it would have been fine

1210
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:31,820
because it would have been grandfathered in.

1211
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:36,740
But there's portions of that ride where you can you can reach out and touch the walls.

1212
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:39,060
And now there has to be a certain

1213
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:43,020
you're not supposed to be able to touch the walls anymore from like an attraction.

1214
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:46,140
It is funny, though, because if it was just existing, they'd be like, yeah, that's fine.

1215
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:47,900
Which is doesn't make any sense.

1216
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:48,740
Well, it's a classic.

1217
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:52,260
It's a it's at that point would have been a classic Disney ride.

1218
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:56,020
I mean, it but it was like a 20 minute long ride.

1219
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:57,420
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1220
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:59,140
You didn't really bliss out there.

1221
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:02,140
Yeah. It was a way, as I've said before, is a way to like

1222
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:04,180
because it goes into Space Mountain.

1223
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:07,060
So it like got me accustomed to the feel of Space Mountain

1224
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:09,180
when I was too scared to go on the ride. Yeah.

1225
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,900
I missed the old line of Space Mountain.

1226
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:12,860
I miss all those parody commercials.

1227
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:14,060
Oh, you liked all that stuff.

1228
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:16,460
I did. I was like a child.

1229
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:21,020
But like it was a it was a way to take up to take up the time. Yeah.

1230
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:23,900
Well, now you're just now you just don't go in the building at all.

1231
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:27,940
So there's not even like you're barely you have as little time in that tunnel as possible.

1232
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:30,140
Yeah. So there wouldn't be time to watch the videos.

1233
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:31,300
And you'd see the ride.

1234
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:32,860
I remember you'd be watching the videos.

1235
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:35,020
And there was a big window where you could watch people on the ride.

1236
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:36,900
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1237
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:37,860
That's the fall. Yeah.

1238
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:41,100
They still you can kind of see that in the people move in Florida still.

1239
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:43,900
Well, the last time I went, it felt like there was less of that.

1240
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:45,580
But I could be wrong. Yeah.

1241
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:47,180
There were funny people, I feel like.

1242
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:49,500
And I don't quite remember who is in those Space Mountain videos.

1243
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:53,500
But I think somebody I think I believe the actress Kelly Caulfield from In Living Color

1244
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:55,220
was in it and funny in it.

1245
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:57,580
And I'm from blanking somebody.

1246
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:58,820
Somebody famous is in those.

1247
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:00,140
And I'm sure they're all on YouTube.

1248
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:01,540
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think so.

1249
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:03,460
Yeah. Yeah. We'll we'll get to that at some point.

1250
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:05,500
You guys wanted me to talk about Raging Waters.

1251
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:09,260
We do. I'm not rushing you through Disney stuff because there's so much.

1252
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:10,460
There's so much to talk about.

1253
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:13,660
But but yeah, that is the when you when you sent us a couple of ideas,

1254
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:17,300
it felt like this has to be the thing because we know about the history

1255
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:18,820
of Crazy Ex-Girlfriend and Raging Waters.

1256
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:21,780
It seems like it was like a little like, you know, runner slash

1257
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:23,940
slash obsession within the show.

1258
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:27,980
And which seems like so that comes from your upbringing.

1259
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:30,820
Like you grew up near you're like in San Gabriel Valley somewhere.

1260
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:32,020
No, no, I grew up Manhattan Beach.

1261
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:35,100
But the reason the show takes place in San Gabriel Valley was because

1262
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:38,340
a guy that I was in love with lived in the San Gabriel Valley.

1263
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:42,620
And so like I I always tried to find excuses to go to the San Gabriel Valley,

1264
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:46,580
which is never a place that you try to find an excuse to go to.

1265
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:50,180
And so once it was set in the San Gabriel Valley, then they were like,

1266
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:51,180
OK, what's there?

1267
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:52,700
And I remember talking to someone.

1268
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:54,460
I was like, all right, so if you're living in West Covina,

1269
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:55,420
what are the cool jobs?

1270
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:56,980
And they're like in and out of Raging Waters.

1271
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:59,260
Those are the two places you want to work. OK.

1272
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:02,460
And in Raging Waters was and still is like the only water park

1273
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,380
I've ever really been to.

1274
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:06,060
It was the first water park I'd been to, definitely.

1275
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:08,860
And that's where you went for special birthday parties when I was in middle school.

1276
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:13,300
And so I I became I was like, oh, my God, we're doing and I'm obsessed

1277
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:17,260
with amusement parks. So I was like, guys, we're we're doing a show

1278
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:20,540
set right next to like a major water park.

1279
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:23,500
We have to talk about it. We have to do that.

1280
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:28,300
So it's so it's just Raging Waters is such a SoCal specific.

1281
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:31,940
And so like, yeah, because the show always wanted to do a plot there,

1282
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:35,100
it became Rebecca's like kind of

1283
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:38,060
it became her Paris.

1284
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:40,380
It became like her dream to go to Raging Waters.

1285
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:43,460
And so when we finally got to shoot there, it was I mean,

1286
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:47,820
it was a whole thing where we contacted them to shoot at Raging Waters.

1287
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:49,500
They hadn't been getting back to us.

1288
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,100
So then I was like, fuck it.

1289
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:54,180
And I tweeted, I want to shoot at Raging Waters.

1290
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:56,700
They're not getting back to us.

1291
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:57,660
Who can help me?

1292
00:57:57,660 --> 00:57:59,900
This guy, Gary, who I know at Warner Brothers,

1293
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:03,700
knew the head of PR for Raging Waters, put me in touch

1294
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:06,300
with the head of Raging Waters, and we made it work.

1295
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:08,100
And what they did was they opened up.

1296
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:14,300
We did just it just shut down for the season in,

1297
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:17,060
I want to say September.

1298
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:18,500
And we wanted to shoot in November.

1299
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:22,980
So there was still water, like stagnant water in a couple of the rides.

1300
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:25,380
They were about to drain the rides when we called.

1301
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:28,580
So they they left.

1302
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:30,660
So they we managed.

1303
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:34,740
We always wanted to set set a scene on this ride, Dark Hole,

1304
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:37,140
which is an actual the actual name of the ride.

1305
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:40,220
And that that happened to have water in it.

1306
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:43,220
So what they did was they showed you wanted Dark Hole specifically.

1307
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:44,980
We wanted. Wow. And it's not the Dark Hole.

1308
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:46,660
It is just Dark Hole.

1309
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:48,220
Dark Hole. It's just Dark Hole.

1310
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:49,820
So they so they

1311
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:54,860
they had that running and then they had Neptune's Revenge running

1312
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:56,300
just as kind of background for us.

1313
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:57,420
So they got the rides moving.

1314
00:58:57,420 --> 00:59:01,500
But there was no there's no way to heat the water at Raging Waters,

1315
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:05,180
because when it's when it's hot out, it's hot out or the or the

1316
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:08,940
maybe they have a heater normally, but the park wasn't fully in service.

1317
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:11,420
So they put water there. Right. But it wasn't heated.

1318
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:17,700
So Skyler Aston, I we when we rode Dark Hole

1319
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:22,900
and I had a GoPro in one of the show, basically rode it about five times.

1320
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:24,820
And the water was like 50 degree water.

1321
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:26,940
And so we were so they had

1322
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:31,940
the heaters every time we came off the ride, they had heaters for us.

1323
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:35,700
And they had like immediately would wrap us in warm towels.

1324
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:37,860
And it was the one time that I have

1325
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:42,340
I have imbibed in alcohol on set, just literally to keep myself

1326
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:45,100
just to warm as if you were freezing to death.

1327
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:46,220
I couldn't have done it.

1328
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:47,820
I couldn't have done it.

1329
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:48,940
I couldn't have done it sober.

1330
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:51,020
It was it was really little.

1331
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:54,300
So we needed volunteers to go down the other slide

1332
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:58,420
just for like B roll in the background and little kids volunteered to do it

1333
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:01,300
because kids are crazy.

1334
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:05,020
But yes, Skyler and I riding Dark Hole over and over and over again.

1335
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:08,260
And it's a it's a it's an indoor, you know, it's an indoor dark ride.

1336
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:10,660
Even colder than probably.

1337
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:13,700
It was so cold. It was it was so so.

1338
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:17,580
I think there's a I don't know if we use it, but there's

1339
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:20,540
there's a scene where I'm getting into the raft

1340
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:22,460
and I went to trick my brain.

1341
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:24,460
I went, oh, my God, the water feels so good.

1342
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:26,220
Oh, it's so warm.

1343
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:27,220
The water is so warm.

1344
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:29,580
I just kept saying this water feels so good.

1345
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:33,340
Method method. It was so cold.

1346
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:36,180
It was it was so cold.

1347
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:40,020
That sounds like something like you would see on like a mission impossible

1348
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:41,460
after they're explaining how to make it.

1349
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:43,580
And it's like I had to go in 50 degree water.

1350
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:45,100
It was the coldest water I ever realized.

1351
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:46,780
Tom, obviously. Yeah, yeah.

1352
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:49,060
We hear that the making of like Titanic. Right.

1353
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:50,940
It's like what we were in really cold. Right.

1354
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:53,460
Because that sounds like you got blankets on.

1355
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:55,020
It sounds. Yeah. Yeah.

1356
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:58,980
Every time it was very it was very, very, very cold.

1357
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:01,980
And so there is a so I had a GoPro.

1358
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:03,860
I wish I could find this footage somewhere.

1359
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:07,860
So I had a GoPro for a couple of the times I went down the water slide.

1360
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:13,820
And I was holding the GoPro when I got back when we because they took a tram.

1361
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:15,980
They would take us in a tram back up to the entrance of the ride.

1362
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:19,100
And at that point, I was I was like drunk.

1363
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:20,100
I was drunk and freezing.

1364
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:21,380
I was like, what did you drink?

1365
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:24,220
What was the I had some I had some vodka.

1366
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:25,020
Sweet. Good.

1367
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:26,100
I kept it very simple.

1368
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:29,580
I mean, this is actually literally goes against everything.

1369
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:32,740
I mean, this is very unprofessional for me to admit.

1370
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:35,860
Hopefully I don't get sued by CBS, but like I need you are drinking ever clear.

1371
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:36,820
You're not doing 90 proof.

1372
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:38,660
I needed vodka like inside.

1373
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:41,860
Literally to warm me from the inside.

1374
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:48,900
Like a snow dog, like a rescue dog coming to get you for like the barrel.

1375
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:52,540
Yeah, it made it made doing that seem like bearable.

1376
01:01:52,540 --> 01:02:00,020
And and but I have the GoPro and I'm like, who's shivering in a in a car

1377
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:02,740
in the tram going back up to the entrance of raising raging waters.

1378
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:03,740
But I'm also kind of drunk.

1379
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:06,140
So I'm just like, it's so it's so cold.

1380
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:07,700
How are you doing, Skylar?

1381
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:10,420
Are you getting I could do this like six more times.

1382
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:11,620
It's really cool.

1383
01:02:11,620 --> 01:02:12,820
Oh, I'm so cold. I don't know.

1384
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:15,180
I'm just from the Netherlands.

1385
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:16,140
How's Skylar?

1386
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:20,540
I mean, that's what I felt really terrible about is he was this new.

1387
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:22,940
He was the new guy who joined the cast.

1388
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:27,660
It was I mean, it was I guess it was three or four episodes into him

1389
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:31,820
being on the show and I was this poor guy out of everyone on the show

1390
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:35,140
has to ride the 15 degree water slide with me.

1391
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:38,940
And he says, I've muscled it into existence like this almost didn't happen.

1392
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:40,420
And I insisted it happened.

1393
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:41,220
You will get it.

1394
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:42,780
Yeah, it was your mission.

1395
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:45,780
There are so many times that it didn't have to have happened.

1396
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:48,220
And the fact that I willed it into existence

1397
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:50,900
and then like was like, come on, Skylar, you're right.

1398
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:54,340
But also for a satisfying story arc,

1399
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:58,740
you guys had built up Raging Waters as a reference point for so long.

1400
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:00,940
Oh, it was it was wonderful.

1401
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:03,620
And had had there been a world where the whole park could have been open

1402
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:06,300
if we shot it like during the summer there, I mean,

1403
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:08,740
I'd wanted to do a Raging Waters opera episode.

1404
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:10,780
Like there was a lot I wanted to do.

1405
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:15,460
But we worked around, OK, we can open up to we can open up like really two rides.

1406
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:16,700
What can we do with that?

1407
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:17,300
So it's interesting.

1408
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:19,980
And you knew that by the like,

1409
01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:23,700
was it during the writing process or was it like a later production thing or

1410
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:25,420
it was interesting logistics of.

1411
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:27,140
Yeah, it was a mix.

1412
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:30,980
We started breaking the episode months before we

1413
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:34,260
we knew for a fact we could film there.

1414
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:36,940
But but when we started the season, I gave the line producer heads up.

1415
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:39,500
I was like, let's already be in contact with Raging Waters.

1416
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:43,460
I know I want to do something in Raging Waters.

1417
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:47,500
And then they weren't because they were like shutting down for the summer.

1418
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:50,420
Then they weren't getting back to us, because by the time I told the line

1419
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:53,220
producer that it was like July, so they were in the thick of the summer.

1420
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:55,700
And then you're dealing with kids dying of heat stroke,

1421
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:57,540
dealing with the dead kids. Exactly.

1422
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:02,180
So I think we had the script written.

1423
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:04,740
And then once we knew this is what we could get at Raging Waters,

1424
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:08,260
I went on a location scout with the director of the episode, Jack,

1425
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:11,620
and with the writer of the episode, I think it was Alana.

1426
01:04:11,740 --> 01:04:13,220
Yeah, it was Alana Alana Pena.

1427
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:18,580
And so we rewrote parts of the episode to fit that location scout.

1428
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:20,500
Oh, OK. OK, OK.

1429
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:23,220
Is that what inspired the specifically the choice of the

1430
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:24,980
the snack area?

1431
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:27,660
Sharky's is the setting of the musical number.

1432
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:30,540
So we knew we wanted to do I hate everything but you a musical

1433
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:31,380
number in Raging Waters.

1434
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:35,580
And then the fact that like we could have we could somehow get the rights

1435
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:39,740
to have sharkies and have that whole area at our disposal was like

1436
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:43,140
we have to use this not affiliated with the Tex-Mex brand.

1437
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:45,700
No, we're separate, separate sharkies, not affiliated.

1438
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:48,300
But like we get all the cred for having sharkies there

1439
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:52,700
because that was just an area that so right behind where sharky was

1440
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:56,460
was is the main part of the park, all of which was completely dry

1441
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:57,620
and completely shut down.

1442
01:04:57,620 --> 01:04:59,740
Oh, it's like wave pool kind of stuff is just barren.

1443
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:02,500
So I walked I walked past the I'll show you pictures.

1444
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:06,220
I have pictures like next to the barren wave pool, the barren vortex,

1445
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:09,340
the barren like children's player. It's all dry. Creepy.

1446
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:12,700
It was very borderline creepy, but like eerily beautiful.

1447
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:14,540
Oh, yeah. When getting to this is like weird nightmare

1448
01:05:14,540 --> 01:05:17,580
feel like that you're in in a bit like not abandoned, but a closed down.

1449
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,900
So most of the park was was shut down.

1450
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:23,180
And so we couldn't like, you know, in an ideal world,

1451
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:25,940
we would have been in that kind of open area.

1452
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:30,740
And it would have been more of a montage of going of us going on different rides.

1453
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:33,740
It would have maybe you would have set parts of I hate everything,

1454
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:35,260
but you on different rides.

1455
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:37,620
But because we only had two rides at our disposal and originally

1456
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:40,860
we wanted to do the lazy river, but to fill up a lazy river.

1457
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:44,220
I mean, so we couldn't do that.

1458
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:48,980
But luckily, the whole sharkies refreshment area was directly across

1459
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:51,260
from all the dry water rides.

1460
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:54,740
So we all you had to do was just shoot in that one direction

1461
01:05:54,740 --> 01:05:59,260
or shoot in the kind of, I guess, like 180 degrees direction

1462
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:01,340
and just not show the stuff directly behind it.

1463
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:03,340
The saddest water park.

1464
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:06,580
Like background holding and stuff was all in the like dry part of the water park.

1465
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:09,300
Just in this barren pit.

1466
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:12,140
I thought we should have just said we should have just set

1467
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:14,620
have the background kids in the in the dry wave pool.

1468
01:06:15,660 --> 01:06:16,900
It was very surreal.

1469
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:19,540
It was very bizarre and very surreal.

1470
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:25,060
And I want to say, I think we tried to sneak some shots of like the dry rides,

1471
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:27,980
but it's it's hard to fake water.

1472
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:30,740
Yeah, I would imagine. Sure. CGI.

1473
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:33,900
The worst looking floppy water.

1474
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:35,700
Yeah. Were you just so relieved?

1475
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:39,100
Like, OK, we got we did this chunk of the episode here.

1476
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:43,660
Or do you still feel like you have some sort of a raging waters project in you?

1477
01:06:43,820 --> 01:06:45,100
Oh, no, I feel pretty good.

1478
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:46,780
I feel like that's good.

1479
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:54,340
I think that I got I really, I think, blew my wad on the thrill,

1480
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:58,860
because I grew up in Southern California, as you know, which is a very sunny

1481
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:03,380
but very like almost like bland chain based place.

1482
01:07:03,380 --> 01:07:07,980
And I was a very kind of big fan of musicals, big fan of like, you know,

1483
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:10,260
when you think about all the classic musicals, movie musicals,

1484
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:12,620
it takes place in like New York City, these very kind of

1485
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:18,060
lush, East Coasty, old fashioned looking places

1486
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:20,420
and where every little bookstore is magical.

1487
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:22,300
Yes, exactly. It feels like whimsical.

1488
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:25,340
So the idea that we got to do numerous musical numbers

1489
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:30,980
in these like strip mall chain places is is exactly what like

1490
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:33,740
I and what I only wanted the show to be.

1491
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:37,940
So I'm I'm good now on like I'm boring.

1492
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:41,860
Weird. Yeah, I mean, I still would love to.

1493
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:44,980
I'm going to do some stuff that's Amusement Park based

1494
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:47,300
because I haven't even begun to really touch, like,

1495
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:49,940
dip my toe into like my love of amusement parks.

1496
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:52,420
And I thought of doing

1497
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:56,060
when I when I have like the time, I thought of doing like a mini album

1498
01:07:56,060 --> 01:07:58,700
to listen to specifically when just when you're at Disneyland,

1499
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:02,060
where it's like, here's the song to play in your earbuds

1500
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:03,980
as you're like entering this line.

1501
01:08:05,060 --> 01:08:06,060
But that's cool.

1502
01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:10,700
But I mean, I did a I did a Hanukkah album

1503
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:15,060
like six years ago called Suck It Christmas, which like to this day

1504
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:17,580
still has not made back its money.

1505
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:21,580
So I am I am a very big fan of doing like niche ideas

1506
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:23,620
that only 100 people will enjoy.

1507
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:27,220
So I don't know if I'll get around to that, but I am.

1508
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:30,460
So a lot of it requires time and a willingness to

1509
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:33,420
be had not get to see any financial return.

1510
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:34,340
Yeah, exactly.

1511
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:36,540
So I have to I would self release it or whatever.

1512
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:41,220
I would also have to probably avoid the calling at Disneyland.

1513
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:42,260
I don't know. I don't know.

1514
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:45,460
I would even. Yeah, well, in that weird, it's akin to the like,

1515
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:50,020
you know, timing up, you know, Dark Side of the Moon to play with Wizard of Oz.

1516
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:52,540
That's what it really is. You can't like say that it's.

1517
01:08:53,380 --> 01:08:56,220
There's a scene in Almost Famous, I think, where now it's on the DVD.

1518
01:08:56,220 --> 01:08:59,060
But you like, OK, so put on, you know, that one.

1519
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:02,780
So they somehow obliquely allude to Stairway to Heaven

1520
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:06,140
since they couldn't get the rights to just like if you play Stairway

1521
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:09,500
to Heaven at home and then watch the scene and time it up correctly.

1522
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:10,100
Oh, is that true?

1523
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:11,500
I think, yeah, there's something like that.

1524
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:13,700
I forget. But like, they can't say it legally.

1525
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:15,980
They have to imply in other media like.

1526
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:19,420
Yeah, I have to ask my lawyer what exactly I could do because I couldn't have any

1527
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:22,740
of the audio from any of the amusement parks. Sure. Sure.

1528
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:26,500
Yeah. But could I legally sync up a song

1529
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:31,300
to like exactly match like the line to Peter Pan?

1530
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:35,740
Mm hmm. You could probably say like sync,

1531
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:38,740
sync up this one to the pirate one.

1532
01:09:38,780 --> 01:09:40,780
You know what I mean?

1533
01:09:41,940 --> 01:09:43,620
Yeah. The ghost place.

1534
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:46,100
But also, are they really going to sue me?

1535
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:48,580
Well, because like YouTube, you can have a ride through video

1536
01:09:48,580 --> 01:09:50,500
with the songs playing. Yeah.

1537
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:54,180
So like Peter Pan songs are on the Peter Pan ride through.

1538
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:57,220
So it does feel like there's a kind of a gray area there.

1539
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:59,660
They also something really cool, really quickly,

1540
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:03,100
because a bunch of people that I grew up with also had yearlong passes to Disneyland.

1541
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:09,020
There was this guy, Zan, I knew, who had a Jeep who he'd been borrowing.

1542
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:13,580
He had like his cousin's Jeep for the summer and the school parking lot,

1543
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:15,180
like his high school parking lot.

1544
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:16,940
It was like the high school near mine.

1545
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:18,740
The high school parking lot was like all inside.

1546
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:20,940
And he basically had been on Indiana Jones so much.

1547
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:25,340
He memorized every twist and turn of the Indiana Jones ride to sync up with.

1548
01:10:25,340 --> 01:10:26,860
And he had the soundtrack of the ride.

1549
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:31,860
So one day he took us all in his Jeep and he sped through this parking lot.

1550
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:35,980
It was a Saturday and did every exact twist and turn

1551
01:10:36,420 --> 01:10:40,180
that you would do on the Indiana Jones ride in this parking lot, in a real Jeep,

1552
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:43,580
including like really tight turns to the point where I was like,

1553
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:45,900
oh, this is how teens die.

1554
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:48,100
This is exactly how teens die all the time.

1555
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:51,780
And it was one of the most like thrilling two and a half minutes of my life.

1556
01:10:53,060 --> 01:10:54,860
Damn. Wow.

1557
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:57,780
Knowing, I mean, speeding in a car, whatever,

1558
01:10:57,780 --> 01:11:01,660
but speeding to the exact left and right turn ratio.

1559
01:11:01,660 --> 01:11:04,420
It was just what an exhilarating time.

1560
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:06,620
Wow. I'm going to put the thing.

1561
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:10,300
I'm not going to do that, but I do kind of want to like listen to it now

1562
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:12,460
to see if I know what what's what.

1563
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:15,140
Like, oh, now we're on the bridge by listening to this song.

1564
01:11:15,140 --> 01:11:17,340
Yeah, like when I when I get to that,

1565
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:21,380
that that bump up, like I know that we're on some sort of precipice

1566
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:23,940
and there's a dip there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1567
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:28,460
Yeah, I got certain music cues sort of time up to little sensations.

1568
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:30,060
Right. That's cool.

1569
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:32,940
That's yeah. That's scary. How old were you? Sixteen.

1570
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:36,660
OK, so yeah, that is the most brazen time.

1571
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:37,780
The height of recklessness.

1572
01:11:37,780 --> 01:11:41,860
I was going to say it's such a it's the dorkiest recklessness I've ever heard.

1573
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:44,940
Yeah, it's so great because it's both at once.

1574
01:11:44,940 --> 01:11:47,900
If that had been how I died, I mean,

1575
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:49,340
well, that says it all.

1576
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:51,380
Geez. I mean, yeah.

1577
01:11:51,380 --> 01:11:52,540
You want to know the person.

1578
01:11:52,540 --> 01:11:55,300
I kind of still think that's how I that's what happened,

1579
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:58,340
is that I died and this is all just like after after life.

1580
01:11:58,340 --> 01:12:00,980
And you're surreal, like having a show and everything is like. Yeah.

1581
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:04,540
The having the musical show that gets to take place in Southern California

1582
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:08,780
that also like talks about mental illness feels very like when I grew up,

1583
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:10,660
I want to be like an astronaut ballerina.

1584
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:13,380
Like it's very it's very on the nose.

1585
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:16,060
To the point where I still don't trust it. Yeah.

1586
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:18,460
Sure. I would imagine.

1587
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:21,980
Yeah, that's how I feel every time I have a glass of wine in front of Rex.

1588
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:26,420
A ultimate dream fantasy come true that you've died.

1589
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:28,700
This is too good. You're dead.

1590
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:33,100
But I paid 16 bucks for a glass of wine and I'm drinking it next to a wine

1591
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:34,140
that Padme had.

1592
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:36,460
I thought you just meant a wine in front of Rex here.

1593
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:39,780
Oh, sure. I thought you meant just like that's all you want.

1594
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:41,020
I have one at home, too.

1595
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:44,340
And I definitely definitely a lot of one just the one.

1596
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:46,900
This is your place, right?

1597
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:48,980
No, it's my place. Yeah.

1598
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:50,820
So he greeted you, but I was here calling the dog.

1599
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:51,980
That was your dog. That makes sense.

1600
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:55,940
And you know, it's when you leave, we'll make you shake hands with Mike Rex.

1601
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:57,260
Fantastic. Yeah.

1602
01:12:57,260 --> 01:12:59,500
Mine's at home, so you can skip that.

1603
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:04,540
I OK with the with with your raging waters thing.

1604
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:09,060
I was realizing how you are part of a very proud tradition of things

1605
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:11,260
that have filmed at Raging Waters.

1606
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:15,660
I feel like probably like I think Hurricane Harbor, probably closer to

1607
01:13:15,660 --> 01:13:20,540
Hollywood, more in the TMZ, the 30 mile zone at this point.

1608
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:23,060
But it wasn't open to the to the late 90s.

1609
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:25,660
Yes. So a lot of stuff in the 80s.

1610
01:13:25,820 --> 01:13:27,980
I think Raging Waters opened in 83, I believe.

1611
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:34,020
And so it was like the closest Hollywood back lot water park, essentially.

1612
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:37,180
And the list is just that you get the list that you have joined.

1613
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:38,620
I find so delightful.

1614
01:13:38,620 --> 01:13:40,340
I want to say there's been other various things

1615
01:13:40,340 --> 01:13:41,980
and probably like music videos and commercials.

1616
01:13:41,980 --> 01:13:45,180
But I think Craziest Girlfriend was the first narrative

1617
01:13:45,180 --> 01:13:48,380
projects to film in Raging Waters since Norbit.

1618
01:13:48,380 --> 01:13:49,540
I think you are.

1619
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:53,220
No, always sunny did an episode there before you really.

1620
01:13:53,260 --> 01:13:56,660
Yes. Oh, I always said it did an episode because they said they were

1621
01:13:56,780 --> 01:13:58,780
because when you when you film at a place, you have to send them

1622
01:13:58,780 --> 01:14:01,860
the script beforehand so they can make sure you're presenting it in a good light.

1623
01:14:02,180 --> 01:14:05,900
Always sunny shot at Raging Waters posing for another water park.

1624
01:14:06,980 --> 01:14:10,980
But I think when they did it, they didn't reveal that part of the script

1625
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:14,260
was that like the water was filled with piss and shit or whatever.

1626
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:18,260
Like it ended up being like a pretty negative episode about water parks

1627
01:14:18,260 --> 01:14:21,260
and raging and it kind of took Raging Waters by surprise.

1628
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:25,900
OK, so we weren't saying it was Raging Waters like you did or like Norbit.

1629
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:27,300
No, they weren't.

1630
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:28,820
Norbit Norbit didn't say it was Raging Waters.

1631
01:14:28,820 --> 01:14:30,460
Norbit is it is Raging Waters.

1632
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:31,860
They're wearing the shirts.

1633
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:33,540
So, yeah, so like you can.

1634
01:14:33,540 --> 01:14:38,180
So but we were very careful not to like disparage like Raging Waters,

1635
01:14:38,180 --> 01:14:42,460
like like in the episode, Greg hates fun and he hates the sun

1636
01:14:42,620 --> 01:14:47,700
and he hates general fun, like we couldn't say water parks are fucking disgusting.

1637
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:50,460
They're filled with piss like kids are peeing in the water

1638
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:51,660
and people are dying of heat stroke.

1639
01:14:51,660 --> 01:14:53,020
Like we couldn't say that.

1640
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:55,460
Sharkies gives me diarrhea.

1641
01:14:55,460 --> 01:14:56,740
Sharkies gives me diarrhea.

1642
01:14:56,740 --> 01:14:57,620
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1643
01:14:57,620 --> 01:14:59,860
Like we couldn't we couldn't.

1644
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:03,780
It was all like, you know, implied like Rebecca like love the chili cheese dog.

1645
01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:07,300
So he was like, I I'm I'm not going to partake in that.

1646
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:08,820
So you didn't even have it to me.

1647
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:10,780
OK, yeah. Weird little rules.

1648
01:15:10,780 --> 01:15:12,020
Oh, interesting.

1649
01:15:12,020 --> 01:15:14,460
Well, they did approve the character

1650
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:18,740
Rasputia going down a big, tall slide after saying,

1651
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:21,460
I must show you how a bitch go down a slide.

1652
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:27,020
Of course, that famous scene where she where she causes a wave to drown

1653
01:15:27,020 --> 01:15:28,660
a bunch of children. Yeah, yeah.

1654
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:31,340
I think there were trailers that were only that scene.

1655
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:33,020
Yeah, that's all I know about Norbit.

1656
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:34,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1657
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:38,140
I guess I watched I was like laughing and clapping and watching it.

1658
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:41,460
I got to say, I don't maybe I'm underrated.

1659
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:43,460
That's your reaction every time you watch Norbit.

1660
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:46,140
Yeah, yeah. The hundreds of doings.

1661
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:50,900
OK, elsewhere in this list, Justin Bieber's Beauty in the Beat music video

1662
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:55,140
films there, which including an in Raging Waters appearance

1663
01:15:55,140 --> 01:15:57,380
by the now retired Nicki Minaj.

1664
01:15:58,180 --> 01:15:59,620
Oh, God. Yeah.

1665
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:02,420
She fitted in before her sure to last retirement.

1666
01:16:02,420 --> 01:16:05,940
You can have a family and still still rap anyway.

1667
01:16:06,060 --> 01:16:07,220
You would say yes.

1668
01:16:07,220 --> 01:16:09,340
That's also like a PR stunt, right?

1669
01:16:09,740 --> 01:16:12,020
That's like fun to say you retired and you come back.

1670
01:16:12,020 --> 01:16:14,500
It's like when Barbra Streisand said it was her last concert.

1671
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:17,940
Yeah, it's like a Sony Disney Spider-Man stuff.

1672
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:19,740
It's all a play. It's all a game.

1673
01:16:19,740 --> 01:16:21,700
I don't know if it's that.

1674
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:23,180
It's just working to earn more money.

1675
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:25,220
This will be resolved by the end of the year.

1676
01:16:25,940 --> 01:16:28,300
Nicki Minaj will be in the Spider-Man.

1677
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:30,540
Yeah, she's being as they're trading her.

1678
01:16:30,540 --> 01:16:32,500
Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure filmed there.

1679
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:34,580
It's Waterloo in that we're in a place.

1680
01:16:34,580 --> 01:16:36,980
Oh, yeah. Napoleon and he ends up at Waterloo.

1681
01:16:37,660 --> 01:16:41,940
They watch my recent obsession, a really great episode of Raging Waters.

1682
01:16:42,020 --> 01:16:45,300
Where there's there's a water slide sabotage going on.

1683
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:47,580
Somebody's going around loosening bolts.

1684
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:48,740
Oh, yeah.

1685
01:16:48,740 --> 01:16:51,060
And they think it's a creepy guy who's been walking around,

1686
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:56,060
who's like yelling at all the lifeguards about his son's recent suicide

1687
01:16:56,060 --> 01:16:57,620
at Raging Waters.

1688
01:16:57,620 --> 01:16:59,700
And so they kind of unfairly blame him.

1689
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:01,740
I don't want to give away the ending.

1690
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:05,420
Obviously, of course, also they would need to hire

1691
01:17:05,780 --> 01:17:08,780
the Baywatch lifeguards who work on the coast to

1692
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:12,180
like temporarily be at Raging Waters.

1693
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:13,860
It's one of those.

1694
01:17:13,860 --> 01:17:16,380
That's a like porn forced plot scenario.

1695
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:17,620
Like why? Why are they?

1696
01:17:17,620 --> 01:17:18,860
So you're binging Baywatch?

1697
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:20,740
I've been real deep into Baywatch.

1698
01:17:20,740 --> 01:17:23,060
It's everything I can do to not talk about it on every episode.

1699
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:27,580
But Baywatch has been recently remastered and it's on Amazon and Hulu.

1700
01:17:27,660 --> 01:17:30,820
And it looks legitimately great because it was 35 millimeter film.

1701
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:33,460
So there's shots where I'm like, this is a great looking.

1702
01:17:33,460 --> 01:17:34,580
It's just a good restoration.

1703
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:38,340
I feel like I'm appreciating and appreciating in a Tarantino kind of way.

1704
01:17:38,740 --> 01:17:40,100
It looks really great.

1705
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:42,220
And then it's the dumbest shit you've ever seen.

1706
01:17:42,820 --> 01:17:44,620
And they couldn't.

1707
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:48,020
My favorite thing about it, they couldn't get the rights to all the music

1708
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:49,500
that it originally aired with.

1709
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:53,020
So it's all new sound like music made this year.

1710
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:56,500
So that's all this bizarre like one note off.

1711
01:17:57,860 --> 01:18:00,700
That's like I look the I've looked ones up like, OK,

1712
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:02,940
so that was spice up your life.

1713
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:06,460
But now it's some generic song like, hey, hey, let's go.

1714
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:09,500
Oh, that's like the state DVDs.

1715
01:18:09,580 --> 01:18:13,620
Oh, do they have a lot of like a lot of like a lot of like Nirvana sound alike?

1716
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:16,020
I guess everything on MTV back in the day.

1717
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:16,740
Yeah. Yeah.

1718
01:18:16,740 --> 01:18:19,780
So like you they how can you not have the rights to that music?

1719
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:20,820
I'm confused.

1720
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:22,660
I don't know. Like they didn't get a license.

1721
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:24,700
They paid for like 20 years into the future.

1722
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:25,580
Yeah. Yeah.

1723
01:18:25,580 --> 01:18:27,260
There's a lot of I think TV shows.

1724
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:29,940
I think Daria had that problem, too, when they were reissuing.

1725
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:33,260
Because I think like MTV, MTV had some anything.

1726
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:35,940
Right. They had some general licensing agreement with them.

1727
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:39,180
I don't know what they watch this problem was, but I don't know.

1728
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:43,140
But I love the and honestly, I've gone back and watched clips with the real music.

1729
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:45,540
Like there's a good vibrations one.

1730
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:47,220
Oh, that's the best I just found.

1731
01:18:47,220 --> 01:18:50,300
I found out the original episode had good vibrations and in the new

1732
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:53,740
the one that's on Amazon now, it's a made up Beach Boys song with the lyric.

1733
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:57,260
She reminds me of ice cream.

1734
01:18:59,540 --> 01:19:01,780
It is ever at every corner.

1735
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:03,140
Wow. Like that.

1736
01:19:03,140 --> 01:19:04,220
She reminds me of ice cream.

1737
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:05,780
Vastly better than good vibrations.

1738
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:09,740
So these Baywatch, the Baywatch special editions, as I'm going to call them.

1739
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:11,460
Yeah, those are the Baywatch remastered.

1740
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:13,420
I think they call it that in the ads.

1741
01:19:13,420 --> 01:19:15,380
Yeah. Those are the superior cuts, you would say.

1742
01:19:15,380 --> 01:19:18,860
I think so. I think they ended up finding new humor.

1743
01:19:19,180 --> 01:19:22,180
I think it sounds like you do a podcast based just all about Baywatch.

1744
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:25,420
I think we're all nearing the point of like without doing our own spin off

1745
01:19:25,420 --> 01:19:27,460
podcasts where we're just each other's guests.

1746
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:29,180
And I would very happily.

1747
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:31,380
I came up with my watch remastered the podcast.

1748
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:33,020
Yeah, we should do it. Yeah.

1749
01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:34,500
I sure. Yeah. Why not? Yeah.

1750
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:37,260
Let's say confirm if you're interested audience, but it doesn't matter

1751
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:39,700
because we're doing it anyway.

1752
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:40,580
I recommend it.

1753
01:19:40,580 --> 01:19:44,180
But then my favorite thing that's filmed at Raging Waters and that I have

1754
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:47,220
such strong memories of wild and crazy kids.

1755
01:19:47,220 --> 01:19:49,620
Oh, right. Nickelodeon.

1756
01:19:49,620 --> 01:19:51,500
Nickelodeon game show.

1757
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:52,300
Just to be honest.

1758
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:56,420
Yeah, I think they filmed at a park near my house one time.

1759
01:19:57,060 --> 01:19:59,700
And and I saw it after the fact.

1760
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:01,660
And I was I was livid.

1761
01:20:01,660 --> 01:20:04,380
I was livid that they were that somehow they

1762
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:06,060
filmed at Polylog Park and I didn't know about.

1763
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:07,940
Oh, man. Oh, bummer.

1764
01:20:07,940 --> 01:20:09,540
That is heartbreaking.

1765
01:20:09,540 --> 01:20:12,060
Oh, when they go on the rollercoasters and they have to you to try to eat

1766
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:14,660
a burger and fries like wall on a rollercoaster.

1767
01:20:14,660 --> 01:20:16,820
Yeah, they did magic mountain stuff.

1768
01:20:16,820 --> 01:20:18,380
I think. Yeah. Yeah.

1769
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:20,700
OK, they did a thing exactly like that.

1770
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:22,780
That was one of the competitions in Raging Waters.

1771
01:20:22,780 --> 01:20:24,860
It was parents versus kids.

1772
01:20:24,860 --> 01:20:28,420
And they had to do things like unpeeled bananas

1773
01:20:28,420 --> 01:20:32,540
and keep ice cream cones from melting and dropping into the water while on water

1774
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:35,300
slides. And it's a kids versus adults thing.

1775
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:39,100
So there's this great stuff where it is phrased probably not the best.

1776
01:20:39,380 --> 01:20:43,060
Like Donnie Jeff Coates or one of those is like.

1777
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:45,340
So what do you think? Do you think you can beat your son?

1778
01:20:48,020 --> 01:20:51,460
And then later on, similarly, a dad answering a question.

1779
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:55,100
All right. Well, the pressure's on, but we're going to beat those kids.

1780
01:20:56,620 --> 01:20:57,900
So that's a delight.

1781
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:00,940
Look up those episodes on Daily Motion, where they're available

1782
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:02,700
with very poor VHS quality.

1783
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:06,900
I'm the west of Internet video streaming for Daily Motion.

1784
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:09,220
I know. I miss like that.

1785
01:21:09,220 --> 01:21:12,300
I mean, because because I I'm sure like you guys,

1786
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:14,860
like I grew up in like the heyday of like Nickelodeon.

1787
01:21:14,860 --> 01:21:17,060
We're gross. We're going to play with slime and GAC.

1788
01:21:17,060 --> 01:21:20,260
And like, you know, I've gone to a couple general meetings at Nickelodeon

1789
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:23,860
like years ago where I was like, hey, what happened to kids being gross?

1790
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:25,820
What happened to like loving?

1791
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:27,740
How they all have brands now?

1792
01:21:27,740 --> 01:21:28,460
They all have brands.

1793
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:30,860
Brands and something like hydro flasks.

1794
01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:35,140
And it's all but it's all like very clean and neat and aspirational.

1795
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:40,220
Like what happened to kids just like fucking being like Booger Town?

1796
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:42,300
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

1797
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:46,420
And there was also there was a grotesque aspect to Nickelodeon, too, with shows

1798
01:21:46,620 --> 01:21:48,860
like Wienerville is just so bizarre.

1799
01:21:48,860 --> 01:21:49,940
You remember that show?

1800
01:21:49,940 --> 01:21:51,660
That's any weird in your good.

1801
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:53,540
That's like a bad maybe a bad example.

1802
01:21:53,540 --> 01:21:56,380
But yeah, no, Ren Stimpy is fucking weird and gross.

1803
01:21:56,420 --> 01:21:57,260
Weird and gross.

1804
01:21:57,260 --> 01:21:59,380
Don't whiz on the electric fence.

1805
01:21:59,380 --> 01:22:00,980
This is like Ren.

1806
01:22:00,980 --> 01:22:02,500
Is that from Ren and Stimpy?

1807
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:04,620
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, my God.

1808
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:08,260
I literally just realized that because a guy in high school would play that on

1809
01:22:08,260 --> 01:22:10,020
guitar and I thought he made it up.

1810
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:11,060
Oh, man.

1811
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:14,500
Oh, he was getting like cred for being like a random comedy guy.

1812
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:16,300
I never knew Don't Whiz on the Electric Fence.

1813
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:18,340
So that's such a dirty song.

1814
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:19,180
Yeah. Yeah.

1815
01:22:19,180 --> 01:22:20,260
In the kids' show. Yeah.

1816
01:22:20,260 --> 01:22:23,460
My friend had said, because if you whiz on the electric fence,

1817
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:26,980
bolts of electricity will go up your penis and you'll die. Yeah.

1818
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:28,940
I imagine that's not that.

1819
01:22:28,940 --> 01:22:30,100
Yeah, that was a no.

1820
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:33,700
The song was just don't whiz on the electric fence.

1821
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:36,580
But Ren like unzips off.

1822
01:22:36,580 --> 01:22:41,300
He suddenly has a fly in his skin and he like unzips himself.

1823
01:22:41,300 --> 01:22:42,500
Yeah, it's really unnerving.

1824
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:45,260
He on something Stimpy likes.

1825
01:22:46,220 --> 01:22:48,180
I'm going to as revenge.

1826
01:22:48,180 --> 01:22:49,180
It's so crazy.

1827
01:22:49,180 --> 01:22:52,180
One of the first body horror things I ever saw was that episode where they're in

1828
01:22:52,180 --> 01:22:56,460
jail with that guy who's like losing his mind and his ears just

1829
01:22:56,780 --> 01:23:00,020
just close up on his ear, which slides off of his head.

1830
01:23:00,460 --> 01:23:04,820
And I remember being like a child being like, oh, my God, what the hell?

1831
01:23:05,060 --> 01:23:07,100
Like it was so like scarring.

1832
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:08,540
I liked it, but it was scarring.

1833
01:23:08,540 --> 01:23:11,780
You know, I remember I remember an episode where Stimpy got really skinny

1834
01:23:11,780 --> 01:23:12,820
and he needed to gain weight.

1835
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:16,140
And so they took liposuction fat and they made it into milkshakes for him.

1836
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:16,940
And he had to drink it.

1837
01:23:16,940 --> 01:23:18,940
You drink a bunch of fat.

1838
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:21,660
Like I remember even as like a kid being like, this is too much.

1839
01:23:22,060 --> 01:23:23,500
This gratuitous. Sure. Yeah.

1840
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:24,500
Oddly, they were not.

1841
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:28,220
Now I feel like every every kids show has to be vetted by like

1842
01:23:28,460 --> 01:23:30,540
30 groups of psychologists.

1843
01:23:30,540 --> 01:23:32,340
That one should have been vetted.

1844
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:34,180
Everyone came out about the co-creator.

1845
01:23:34,180 --> 01:23:35,940
That one should have been vetted.

1846
01:23:35,940 --> 01:23:37,900
Yeah. Yeah.

1847
01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:40,900
That's why it's like, why did the one creator leave the show

1848
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:42,900
so early in the run 20 years later?

1849
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:44,980
Oh, OK. We have. All right.

1850
01:23:44,980 --> 01:23:46,780
Why did he? Oh, it's a bit.

1851
01:23:46,780 --> 01:23:49,340
It's one of the grimest issues you've ever.

1852
01:23:49,460 --> 01:23:52,420
Well, let's just say it's a grooming situation. Oh, no.

1853
01:23:52,420 --> 01:23:54,180
Yeah, it's real bad. Yeah.

1854
01:23:54,180 --> 01:23:55,020
But I know when nobody.

1855
01:23:55,020 --> 01:23:55,820
He's the only creator.

1856
01:23:55,820 --> 01:23:58,420
You know the way creators of shows just leave one season in.

1857
01:23:58,420 --> 01:23:59,900
I thought there was only John.

1858
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:02,860
There's another guy who did a lot of like little girl children's TV.

1859
01:24:02,860 --> 01:24:04,620
I want to say it was like Lizzie McGuire.

1860
01:24:04,620 --> 01:24:06,420
Oh, well, the creator.

1861
01:24:06,420 --> 01:24:07,380
That's a whole other thing.

1862
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:09,380
Yeah. The creator of all those kids shows.

1863
01:24:10,580 --> 01:24:13,500
So the Nickelodeon shows, not the Disney shows.

1864
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:17,460
So there was another rumor that like that creepy guy got like

1865
01:24:18,380 --> 01:24:20,340
this is a this is a rumor.

1866
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:21,940
Yeah, sweet names out.

1867
01:24:21,940 --> 01:24:23,620
Allegedly. I'm remembering this from hearing it like 10 years ago

1868
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:26,340
that like he got like Jamie Lynn Spears pregnant.

1869
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:27,460
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1870
01:24:27,460 --> 01:24:28,820
You know, we're talking about.

1871
01:24:28,820 --> 01:24:32,100
Yeah. Who else are just like we Nickelodeon says goodbye

1872
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:35,060
after a great career to thanks for the memories and you know what?

1873
01:24:35,060 --> 01:24:36,660
Why just suddenly?

1874
01:24:36,660 --> 01:24:38,100
That's not suspicious at all.

1875
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:40,380
Yep. Just see you later.

1876
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:42,460
People just leave lucrative.

1877
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:45,180
Please do not Google the phrase open secret.

1878
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:46,940
Please do not.

1879
01:24:46,940 --> 01:24:48,700
Yeah. Yeah.

1880
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:51,100
So, yeah, you guys can look into that if you know.

1881
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:53,060
If I was her wise.

1882
01:24:53,060 --> 01:24:54,540
Yeah, good.

1883
01:24:54,540 --> 01:25:01,100
Let me I was going to link to boot back to body horror with the, you know,

1884
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:04,420
and I don't want to I don't want to go around, you know, saying negative things

1885
01:25:04,420 --> 01:25:07,660
about Raging Waters and Ivan Bin and you know, they were they were great to you

1886
01:25:07,660 --> 01:25:08,380
and your show.

1887
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:11,780
There's there's Yelp reviews that are not thrilled with things

1888
01:25:11,780 --> 01:25:14,340
that have that have happened there.

1889
01:25:14,340 --> 01:25:16,860
One, I just really liked this this review.

1890
01:25:16,860 --> 01:25:19,540
I liked this assertion.

1891
01:25:19,540 --> 01:25:22,660
You never know what these Yelp people, they're exaggerating or the but

1892
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:23,660
I don't know.

1893
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:27,340
There was feces and vomit and sanitary napkins on the floors of the bathroom,

1894
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:29,260
which also had no TP or paper towels.

1895
01:25:29,260 --> 01:25:33,060
Trash was overflowing onto the floors and there was an enormous amount of bees.

1896
01:25:35,700 --> 01:25:38,220
On top of it, bees, bees,

1897
01:25:39,060 --> 01:25:39,860
so that's great.

1898
01:25:39,860 --> 01:25:43,420
But then also there is this other review.

1899
01:25:43,420 --> 01:25:46,100
And I thought of this with body horror because the

1900
01:25:48,340 --> 01:25:51,820
it's a review by his and his Yelp name is Kenny G.

1901
01:25:51,820 --> 01:25:54,540
I can't imagine he is the smooth sex man.

1902
01:25:54,540 --> 01:25:56,940
But but could be.

1903
01:25:56,940 --> 01:26:00,180
But it is this review is such a novel.

1904
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:01,820
I mean, I couldn't possibly read the whole thing.

1905
01:26:01,820 --> 01:26:04,220
It takes up like you got to keep scrolling and scrolling.

1906
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:06,980
It's, you know, half of that page.

1907
01:26:06,980 --> 01:26:10,140
And it's it is so bonkers.

1908
01:26:10,260 --> 01:26:14,140
There's like scenes between characters in his review.

1909
01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:18,620
There's hashtags like a hashtag doesn't link to anything

1910
01:26:18,620 --> 01:26:20,140
in the middle of a Yelp review.

1911
01:26:20,140 --> 01:26:21,700
That's not how it works.

1912
01:26:22,020 --> 01:26:25,380
But there's also the assertion that he says he has a lot of complaints,

1913
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:28,220
but then says, like, I don't really like to go in the water at these places

1914
01:26:28,220 --> 01:26:32,260
because you might, you know, come out of the water with 14 toes and two penises.

1915
01:26:33,020 --> 01:26:34,060
You know what?

1916
01:26:34,060 --> 01:26:36,940
That's a pretty that's a pretty major assertion.

1917
01:26:36,940 --> 01:26:38,060
I'm not sure is correct.

1918
01:26:38,060 --> 01:26:39,860
But the main yes, I was sorry.

1919
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:43,380
The main thing about this art, this review is it has a motif.

1920
01:26:43,580 --> 01:26:47,620
And he starts the motif at the beginning by saying, don't go chase in waterfalls.

1921
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:49,980
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.

1922
01:26:50,140 --> 01:26:52,580
I know that you're going to have it all another and all that you're moving too fast.

1923
01:26:53,420 --> 01:26:57,140
I'm starting to think that TLC might have been light years ahead of their time.

1924
01:26:57,460 --> 01:27:01,900
And then the entire review keeps quoting TLC.

1925
01:27:01,980 --> 01:27:03,820
It's a motif throughout it.

1926
01:27:03,820 --> 01:27:06,500
And he finds crazy ways just like when you come out of the water,

1927
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:07,940
you might look gross. You're not going to be too.

1928
01:27:07,940 --> 01:27:10,500
You're going to look very unpretty.

1929
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:13,380
He works the name fan mail in the name of their album. Right.

1930
01:27:13,420 --> 01:27:17,780
He says, you know, try and stetizing yourself from an unexplainable rash

1931
01:27:17,820 --> 01:27:20,220
that no scrub can get rid of.

1932
01:27:20,980 --> 01:27:22,700
This is a to applaud that one.

1933
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:25,100
I can't really manage to fit in those scrubs.

1934
01:27:25,140 --> 01:27:30,100
This is a college entrance essay that the teachers like, OK, nice first effort.

1935
01:27:30,140 --> 01:27:32,060
We're not going to send this one in.

1936
01:27:32,060 --> 01:27:34,060
But let's go back to the original idea.

1937
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:34,740
It's going to get an hour.

1938
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:35,860
Something we can salvage.

1939
01:27:35,860 --> 01:27:38,420
He does. This person needs like a creative outlet.

1940
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:40,460
And Yelp is the place for it.

1941
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:41,660
I mean, I applaud it.

1942
01:27:41,660 --> 01:27:43,060
It is one of the most creative.

1943
01:27:43,060 --> 01:27:45,940
And I don't know why TLC needed to be a part of it.

1944
01:27:46,260 --> 01:27:49,100
But I haven't seen a bunch of band references jammed into Yelp

1945
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:50,420
review before this good work.

1946
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:54,860
Was the San Dimas raging waters not the San Jose or Sacramento location?

1947
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:56,340
No, yes. Specifically San Dimas.

1948
01:27:56,340 --> 01:27:58,100
That's pretty much what we've been covering.

1949
01:27:58,100 --> 01:28:00,020
Right. We should say there are other ones.

1950
01:28:00,020 --> 01:28:01,180
But there are two others.

1951
01:28:01,180 --> 01:28:04,380
Well, and and there is a they sold this one.

1952
01:28:04,420 --> 01:28:08,140
There's a raging waters in Wildwood, New Jersey, unaffiliated.

1953
01:28:08,540 --> 01:28:11,860
Has the same name owned by the Maury's company.

1954
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:16,100
Maury's Pier runs most of the entertainment in Wildwood, New Jersey.

1955
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:21,260
At this point, the parent company, Palace Entertainment, owns Kennywood,

1956
01:28:21,980 --> 01:28:26,860
Dutch Wonderland and the new Cartoon Network Hotel across from Dutch Wonderland.

1957
01:28:26,900 --> 01:28:32,180
Both in all in Pennsylvania and the Noah's Ark Water Park in the Wisconsin Dells.

1958
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:32,860
Now that's my.

1959
01:28:32,860 --> 01:28:33,620
Given thumbs up.

1960
01:28:33,620 --> 01:28:34,820
That was your favorite.

1961
01:28:34,820 --> 01:28:36,500
No, no. Yeah.

1962
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:37,660
A couple of times. Is it good?

1963
01:28:37,660 --> 01:28:39,620
How religious is it?

1964
01:28:39,620 --> 01:28:43,140
It's not I haven't been in like a deck over a decade.

1965
01:28:43,140 --> 01:28:45,980
So I wasn't I didn't notice it being very religious.

1966
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:48,940
It was like a fun cartoon version of the religious story.

1967
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:52,620
But I don't I would like to when we go, we should go.

1968
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:55,060
I think we're going to go with you guys.

1969
01:28:55,060 --> 01:28:58,580
Haven't done like a gotten a van and done a road trip to all the major

1970
01:28:58,580 --> 01:29:01,060
like amusement parks. Yeah, that might be the next.

1971
01:29:01,460 --> 01:29:02,460
Because we want to go to Dali.

1972
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:03,580
We got to go to Daliwood.

1973
01:29:03,580 --> 01:29:04,940
We got to do a lot of this.

1974
01:29:04,940 --> 01:29:09,540
So, yeah, there's some money who scolded us into doing this podcast.

1975
01:29:09,940 --> 01:29:13,620
In the beginning also said, why have you got into a van and gone to all the places?

1976
01:29:13,780 --> 01:29:16,700
Have you joined the have you joined the roller coaster enthusiasts?

1977
01:29:16,980 --> 01:29:19,020
Not yet. We haven't done that either.

1978
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:21,860
I've looked into I've looked I've looked into doing that.

1979
01:29:22,260 --> 01:29:25,220
But then you just need to take a lot of your time out of the year

1980
01:29:25,220 --> 01:29:26,900
to travel and go on different roller coasters.

1981
01:29:26,900 --> 01:29:27,740
You can do roller coasters.

1982
01:29:27,740 --> 01:29:29,660
Wait, is like a quota you have to fill?

1983
01:29:29,660 --> 01:29:32,740
Is it a commitment of some kind? What is your commitment of some kind?

1984
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:35,980
I think there's dues. Right.

1985
01:29:36,260 --> 01:29:37,580
And then they have special events.

1986
01:29:37,580 --> 01:29:39,860
You just have to I mean, in order to take advantage of it,

1987
01:29:39,860 --> 01:29:42,420
you have to be willing to travel to roller coasters

1988
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:44,580
because there are events at different amusement parks. Right.

1989
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:47,740
You should have on David Hall, who was on my show,

1990
01:29:48,020 --> 01:29:50,580
was a performer at Kings Island. Oh, boy.

1991
01:29:50,580 --> 01:29:55,460
And he did all the shows there, but also rode all the rides and is a continuing.

1992
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:57,740
He continues to be a huge roller coaster enthusiast.

1993
01:29:57,860 --> 01:29:59,420
Wow. Sure. Yeah, that sounds great.

1994
01:29:59,420 --> 01:30:01,860
In the organization, he's in the club.

1995
01:30:01,900 --> 01:30:03,500
No, no, no. OK. Casually.

1996
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:06,180
Oh, sorry. I was eating crackers and got down my bra.

1997
01:30:07,060 --> 01:30:08,660
It happens. Hey, everything's fine.

1998
01:30:08,660 --> 01:30:11,420
I'll just find random crumbs. Sure.

1999
01:30:12,860 --> 01:30:14,020
Save for later.

2000
01:30:14,020 --> 01:30:16,580
We were talking about I don't want to be so negative either,

2001
01:30:16,580 --> 01:30:18,900
but we were talking about the Sacramento location.

2002
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:20,500
I don't know. Do we find you found this?

2003
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:22,100
I don't know. I don't know where you're going with this.

2004
01:30:22,100 --> 01:30:22,940
I'm very excited.

2005
01:30:22,940 --> 01:30:25,180
I was going to read the KCRA

2006
01:30:25,780 --> 01:30:28,300
NBC Channel three headline on the website.

2007
01:30:28,700 --> 01:30:32,820
40 person brawl at Raging Waters started over beach towel.

2008
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:36,780
Man remains hospitalized after being attacked.

2009
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:40,740
This is August 26th, 2019. Yeah, I actually saw this headline.

2010
01:30:40,740 --> 01:30:43,580
I mean, I think what we're learning is water parks would be great

2011
01:30:43,580 --> 01:30:45,700
if it weren't for the people attending them.

2012
01:30:45,700 --> 01:30:48,660
Oh, yeah. All you need is all you need is like a water park.

2013
01:30:48,820 --> 01:30:50,940
And just if it was to yourself, it would be perfect.

2014
01:30:50,940 --> 01:30:54,220
Which you sort of got to have and some vodka. And it was great.

2015
01:30:54,260 --> 01:30:57,700
Mm hmm. Yes. Besides almost dying of hypothermia.

2016
01:30:57,940 --> 01:31:00,380
Yeah, but you know, you'll know the memories.

2017
01:31:00,380 --> 01:31:01,660
The memories were so special.

2018
01:31:01,660 --> 01:31:05,740
What's the disorientation increased by what appears to be Raging Waters

2019
01:31:05,740 --> 01:31:10,980
is one of their big innovations is multiple the water slides in the darkness.

2020
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:14,220
Yeah. Which they're very obsessed with that.

2021
01:31:14,220 --> 01:31:17,220
There's Dark Hole, there's Neptune's Revenge, there's the vortex.

2022
01:31:19,700 --> 01:31:23,860
You know, there's there's just only so much you can do with a water slide.

2023
01:31:23,860 --> 01:31:26,980
And especially I can't imagine that Raging Waters has.

2024
01:31:27,820 --> 01:31:31,260
I don't think they have the budget of like, certainly not like a Disney.

2025
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:32,580
Oh, absolutely. Yeah.

2026
01:31:32,580 --> 01:31:35,380
But I don't even think of like a Six Flags Hurricane Harbor.

2027
01:31:35,380 --> 01:31:39,180
And so like, there's just not your resources are limited.

2028
01:31:39,180 --> 01:31:43,340
And the one thing you can do is make a water slide that is nearly in the dark.

2029
01:31:43,780 --> 01:31:47,140
That is the like cheapest theme for sure.

2030
01:31:47,140 --> 01:31:49,260
Yeah. And it is just it is very disorienting.

2031
01:31:49,260 --> 01:31:51,140
Dark Hole is very disorienting.

2032
01:31:51,140 --> 01:31:54,500
And yet they did manage to get some major theming

2033
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:59,020
and even some characters into the genre of dark water slide.

2034
01:31:59,020 --> 01:32:02,140
And I know you know about this with the slide Dr.

2035
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:03,900
Von Darke's Tunnel of You know what?

2036
01:32:03,900 --> 01:32:07,060
That actually I think I'm that was the one that was open for us.

2037
01:32:07,060 --> 01:32:08,060
It wasn't Neptune's Revenge.

2038
01:32:08,060 --> 01:32:10,580
It was Dr. Von Darke's Tunnel. Oh, OK. OK.

2039
01:32:10,780 --> 01:32:15,220
So that was this is referenced in a song in the show elsewhere. Yes.

2040
01:32:16,420 --> 01:32:19,900
I am this seems like for Raging Water, because I'm looking at the slides.

2041
01:32:19,900 --> 01:32:22,420
They're all whatever one is called High Extreme.

2042
01:32:22,420 --> 01:32:23,420
That's not anything.

2043
01:32:23,420 --> 01:32:27,660
There's not a lot of like red meat in terms of what the and we're about themes

2044
01:32:27,660 --> 01:32:31,860
or theme theme park play like we like characters exclusive to the parks.

2045
01:32:31,860 --> 01:32:32,980
Yeah. We talk about that all the time.

2046
01:32:32,980 --> 01:32:35,700
No, Dr. Von Darke is a different is a different beast.

2047
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:38,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm pretty impressed by it.

2048
01:32:38,420 --> 01:32:42,780
And while it seems to me like, OK, Dr.

2049
01:32:42,780 --> 01:32:45,980
Von Darke's Tunnel of Terror is not it's at multiple water parks

2050
01:32:45,980 --> 01:32:48,100
and they aren't even all raging waters.

2051
01:32:48,100 --> 01:32:50,900
And I am actually forgetting offhand the name one of the other places

2052
01:32:50,900 --> 01:32:54,500
where I think water country, which is in like New Hampshire, I believe.

2053
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:58,180
So I don't think the I don't think you maybe you could tell me

2054
01:32:58,260 --> 01:33:00,460
if there's any evidence of the character.

2055
01:33:00,460 --> 01:33:02,740
Is there any physical representation of Dr.

2056
01:33:02,740 --> 01:33:05,580
Von Darke? I have I have some pictures of our location scout.

2057
01:33:05,660 --> 01:33:07,300
OK, yes, please do. OK, great.

2058
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:08,060
So there is so.

2059
01:33:08,060 --> 01:33:09,900
So I have pictures from our location scout.

2060
01:33:09,900 --> 01:33:11,580
And as you'll see, I'll pass this around.

2061
01:33:11,580 --> 01:33:13,420
There is a character named Dr.

2062
01:33:13,420 --> 01:33:16,700
Von Darke, and it says there's a sign that says School of Darkology.

2063
01:33:17,060 --> 01:33:19,100
It's not about turning off the lights.

2064
01:33:19,100 --> 01:33:21,060
It's about turning on the darkness.

2065
01:33:21,820 --> 01:33:23,140
And here's a picture.

2066
01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:24,780
He's got a joker phrase.

2067
01:33:24,780 --> 01:33:26,140
My friend Jack in front of that sign.

2068
01:33:26,140 --> 01:33:27,740
If you zoom in, you can see what Dr.

2069
01:33:27,740 --> 01:33:30,980
Von Darke looks like the motto of the School of Darkology.

2070
01:33:31,340 --> 01:33:35,740
By the way, the School of Darkology is bright yellow with purple trim.

2071
01:33:36,100 --> 01:33:37,980
It looks like a Barbie dream house. Yeah.

2072
01:33:38,420 --> 01:33:40,700
And yet it is the School of Darkology.

2073
01:33:41,020 --> 01:33:43,260
Hell, yeah, that's fantastic.

2074
01:33:43,260 --> 01:33:45,300
And there's a depiction of Dr. Von Darke.

2075
01:33:45,540 --> 01:33:49,420
I love this. Is this the only I mean, there's I think there's characters

2076
01:33:49,420 --> 01:33:52,260
now in Disney water parks, but this might be the only like

2077
01:33:52,620 --> 01:33:55,780
non-brand water park with a character, which I love.

2078
01:33:55,780 --> 01:33:58,140
And I think well, I think because the problem is they had Dark Hole

2079
01:33:58,260 --> 01:34:00,860
and they're like, fuck, we have another route.

2080
01:34:00,860 --> 01:34:02,180
The word dark in it.

2081
01:34:02,180 --> 01:34:04,180
We got to differentiate this.

2082
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:06,820
OK, there's going to be a whole character.

2083
01:34:06,820 --> 01:34:08,500
There's going to be

2084
01:34:09,660 --> 01:34:11,740
we got to make it a premise to differentiate it from Dark Hole.

2085
01:34:11,780 --> 01:34:13,540
Yeah, I have pictures of the school.

2086
01:34:13,540 --> 01:34:14,340
You scroll through this.

2087
01:34:14,340 --> 01:34:16,780
You can see pictures of the of the empty wave pool.

2088
01:34:16,900 --> 01:34:18,580
Oh, boy. Oh, wonderful.

2089
01:34:18,580 --> 01:34:19,660
OK, you're good.

2090
01:34:19,660 --> 01:34:20,700
Oh, man. Sorry.

2091
01:34:20,700 --> 01:34:21,740
Barren water park.

2092
01:34:21,740 --> 01:34:24,020
I know everyone loves if you like, you can see.

2093
01:34:24,020 --> 01:34:25,820
Imagine the saddest water park.

2094
01:34:25,820 --> 01:34:29,020
Imagine the words high extreme with no one around.

2095
01:34:29,020 --> 01:34:30,900
Dry as a bone.

2096
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:35,220
Not nearly as brought to life as it is in that Bieber video at night, even

2097
01:34:36,140 --> 01:34:37,060
a lot more active.

2098
01:34:37,060 --> 01:34:40,340
So that phrase that you just said, his motto

2099
01:34:41,980 --> 01:34:45,340
very delightfully, I this morning discovered

2100
01:34:45,740 --> 01:34:49,180
OK, this is from the YouTube channel of my I already can't remember

2101
01:34:49,180 --> 01:34:50,700
the name of the place.

2102
01:34:50,700 --> 01:34:53,100
So water country, I believe.

2103
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:57,780
And this is a little ad where they're announcing new water slides for 2012.

2104
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:02,500
And there is a host who's probably a real employee of the park.

2105
01:35:02,700 --> 01:35:04,900
And then and there's a bunch of construction workers.

2106
01:35:04,900 --> 01:35:06,100
They're working on the next slide.

2107
01:35:06,100 --> 01:35:08,620
But then something unpredictable happens.

2108
01:35:09,420 --> 01:35:13,740
With that said, we're proud to announce that we're adding a new attract.

2109
01:35:14,140 --> 01:35:17,460
Hey, who turned out the lights?

2110
01:35:18,580 --> 01:35:20,780
There is a certain amount of money.

2111
01:35:22,300 --> 01:35:24,860
It's about turning on the darkness.

2112
01:35:25,660 --> 01:35:27,780
And he's German. Yeah.

2113
01:35:27,780 --> 01:35:31,460
Dr. Von Darks, total of terror, just one ride.

2114
01:35:31,540 --> 01:35:34,020
And you'll be begging your mommy for a nightlight.

2115
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:40,380
Yeah, there is a living actor playing Dr.

2116
01:35:40,380 --> 01:35:42,660
Von Dark so fint.

2117
01:35:42,660 --> 01:35:44,660
And then here's another quick hit from another.

2118
01:35:44,660 --> 01:35:47,060
It's all voiceover in the thing.

2119
01:35:47,060 --> 01:35:48,060
It's like it's voiceover.

2120
01:35:48,060 --> 01:35:51,100
He's not actually moving his mouth that he's just like looking at you.

2121
01:35:51,220 --> 01:35:53,220
He might be a pantomime actor. Yeah.

2122
01:35:53,220 --> 01:35:56,940
I think he well, he might be here's another money as you hire a voiceover actor.

2123
01:35:57,140 --> 01:35:58,100
Sure. One day.

2124
01:35:58,100 --> 01:35:59,380
And then you just get like a back.

2125
01:35:59,380 --> 01:36:02,100
You get like guy being paid extra rates another day.

2126
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:03,500
Oh, different. Yeah.

2127
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:06,060
Well, Baywatch, my beloved Baywatch is full of that a lot of.

2128
01:36:06,060 --> 01:36:08,860
Hey, watch out. You're running too fast.

2129
01:36:08,860 --> 01:36:10,780
Or somebody they didn't pay.

2130
01:36:10,780 --> 01:36:11,700
So here's another Dr.

2131
01:36:11,700 --> 01:36:12,340
Von Dark.

2132
01:36:12,340 --> 01:36:14,340
You're not as a dog.

2133
01:36:14,340 --> 01:36:15,340
Are you?

2134
01:36:15,340 --> 01:36:17,100
Well, three introduces.

2135
01:36:17,100 --> 01:36:18,740
And then it's kind of the same from there.

2136
01:36:18,740 --> 01:36:19,780
OK, that was a close up.

2137
01:36:19,780 --> 01:36:22,460
So they did. Yes, he may have earned like two under.

2138
01:36:22,780 --> 01:36:24,820
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

2139
01:36:24,820 --> 01:36:26,900
So this fucking rules.

2140
01:36:26,900 --> 01:36:30,260
But I do. It does seem to me, first of all, I think we can all agree.

2141
01:36:30,260 --> 01:36:31,020
It fucking rules.

2142
01:36:31,020 --> 01:36:34,580
And then but it does seem to me like what is actually going on

2143
01:36:34,580 --> 01:36:39,260
at the school of darkology because you see him flip a switch and then it gets dark.

2144
01:36:39,580 --> 01:36:44,340
So his evil technology seems to be turning off a light.

2145
01:36:44,380 --> 01:36:46,740
Right. But he calls it turning on the dark.

2146
01:36:46,740 --> 01:36:48,420
Turning which is different.

2147
01:36:48,420 --> 01:36:51,580
Spider-Man and turning off the dark.

2148
01:36:51,820 --> 01:36:53,020
Whoa. Wow.

2149
01:36:53,020 --> 01:36:55,820
I'm clear also whether or not you're a test subject

2150
01:36:56,180 --> 01:36:58,380
or a student or Dr.

2151
01:36:58,380 --> 01:37:00,540
Von Darks wife or Dr.

2152
01:37:00,540 --> 01:37:02,260
Von Dark himself.

2153
01:37:02,260 --> 01:37:05,060
When you're writing it, when you're writing it, it's not clear what.

2154
01:37:06,580 --> 01:37:08,340
It's not clear what what the premise is.

2155
01:37:08,340 --> 01:37:11,100
It's just you're generally in the school of darkology.

2156
01:37:11,660 --> 01:37:13,540
They should hand you a little diploma when you get out.

2157
01:37:13,540 --> 01:37:16,700
Yeah, absolutely. A waterproof one like a laminated.

2158
01:37:17,900 --> 01:37:21,540
I like your premise that you are him and that you're like

2159
01:37:21,540 --> 01:37:24,260
you're paying for your sins against the light.

2160
01:37:24,260 --> 01:37:27,540
Oh, yeah. The school of darkology has gone haywire.

2161
01:37:27,540 --> 01:37:29,620
I like the idea that you're his wife. Yeah.

2162
01:37:29,620 --> 01:37:31,500
Yeah, I just like Mrs.

2163
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:33,220
Von Dark, Mrs. Von Dark.

2164
01:37:33,220 --> 01:37:36,340
There's just occasional video where it's just like, come

2165
01:37:36,380 --> 01:37:39,060
on, our our sons graduations today.

2166
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:40,420
Can you make it?

2167
01:37:41,140 --> 01:37:43,420
I have too many dark experiments.

2168
01:37:43,420 --> 01:37:44,700
My birthday.

2169
01:37:44,700 --> 01:37:47,580
Sometimes it feels like you love dark more than you love me.

2170
01:37:48,100 --> 01:37:49,860
Me, me, me.

2171
01:37:50,900 --> 01:37:53,500
I've lost all my friends to the darkness.

2172
01:37:53,740 --> 01:37:56,820
Like how NASA is expanding the whole Calico mythology.

2173
01:37:56,820 --> 01:37:59,340
Maybe it's time for Raging Waters to expand.

2174
01:37:59,340 --> 01:38:02,220
Not just expanding the Calico, the ghost.

2175
01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:06,300
Yeah, the ghost town and like they're all the rides kind of connect now.

2176
01:38:06,340 --> 01:38:10,220
Apparently, Calico Rapids connects to the mine train, connects to the.

2177
01:38:10,220 --> 01:38:12,460
And there's mazes now, the haunted mazes.

2178
01:38:12,460 --> 01:38:15,540
A couple of them are all connected to the story as well this year.

2179
01:38:15,980 --> 01:38:18,820
So I think maybe it's time to expand Dr.

2180
01:38:18,820 --> 01:38:21,500
Von Darks presence in Raging Waters.

2181
01:38:21,620 --> 01:38:22,140
And Dr.

2182
01:38:22,140 --> 01:38:24,380
Von DeWell for Halloween, if they kept it open, Dr.

2183
01:38:24,380 --> 01:38:26,460
Von Dark could completely take over Raging Waters.

2184
01:38:27,300 --> 01:38:28,140
I mean, it'd be crazy.

2185
01:38:28,140 --> 01:38:29,580
It's all his experiments.

2186
01:38:29,580 --> 01:38:30,940
Yeah. Oh, man.

2187
01:38:30,940 --> 01:38:33,580
And you could get actually hurt because it's night.

2188
01:38:33,580 --> 01:38:35,860
Yeah. And you slip and fall.

2189
01:38:35,900 --> 01:38:38,140
We'll run a few slides without the water.

2190
01:38:38,140 --> 01:38:39,860
Yeah. Yeah.

2191
01:38:39,860 --> 01:38:41,340
Oh, my God.

2192
01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:42,940
Danger.

2193
01:38:42,940 --> 01:38:46,300
I would like them to incorporate because I looked up a map of San Dimas

2194
01:38:46,300 --> 01:38:47,260
because I didn't really know it.

2195
01:38:47,260 --> 01:38:50,900
This park is next to the pudding stone reservoir.

2196
01:38:50,980 --> 01:38:51,780
It's beautiful.

2197
01:38:51,780 --> 01:38:54,500
Oh, this park is actually in the middle of like a Griffith Park

2198
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:56,620
like area, San Dimas. It's gorgeous.

2199
01:38:56,620 --> 01:39:00,340
Oh, wow. Oh, but no actual pudding, I'm assuming.

2200
01:39:01,020 --> 01:39:03,220
Like I got excited by that name.

2201
01:39:03,620 --> 01:39:05,500
It did look nice from the satellite photos.

2202
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:09,500
You know, after we location scouted, because it is right next to this reservoir,

2203
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:12,860
I had a dream that I was on a waterslide

2204
01:39:13,420 --> 01:39:17,100
and that it like shot off, you know, and then you were 100 feet in the air

2205
01:39:17,100 --> 01:39:21,100
and you landed in a reservoir and you had to like swim.

2206
01:39:21,300 --> 01:39:23,980
And then you got caught onto like another track

2207
01:39:24,140 --> 01:39:26,060
while you were like still underwater.

2208
01:39:26,060 --> 01:39:28,460
Like I had a really cool ride idea dream.

2209
01:39:28,900 --> 01:39:30,220
Wow. Yeah, that sounds great.

2210
01:39:30,220 --> 01:39:34,940
Wow. The kind of concoction only Von Dark could be crafty enough.

2211
01:39:34,940 --> 01:39:36,780
Von Darkian concoction.

2212
01:39:36,780 --> 01:39:38,780
Very von Darkian of you.

2213
01:39:38,780 --> 01:39:42,020
Did you have like a favorite one favorite slide of all these?

2214
01:39:43,180 --> 01:39:46,700
High extreme, I remember getting the courage to go on.

2215
01:39:46,700 --> 01:39:51,020
And it is very fun because you're very high up and it is a super extreme.

2216
01:39:53,020 --> 01:39:55,980
And I never I never I've never

2217
01:39:56,100 --> 01:39:59,740
I never went on like the tall slide, the thing that where it's like it's just super.

2218
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:03,700
You know, it's like, I don't know, a 75 foot like straight down drop.

2219
01:40:03,700 --> 01:40:05,300
I've never done that.

2220
01:40:05,300 --> 01:40:06,980
And then I never did the wedge.

2221
01:40:06,980 --> 01:40:08,140
There was this thing at Raging Waters.

2222
01:40:08,140 --> 01:40:10,900
I don't know if it's still there, but it's like basically you you.

2223
01:40:11,100 --> 01:40:13,700
It's you're almost like it's like you're on a skateboarding ramp

2224
01:40:13,700 --> 01:40:16,420
where you just your body,

2225
01:40:16,420 --> 01:40:20,300
your body goes to until you literally there's like a funnel

2226
01:40:20,300 --> 01:40:22,420
and you go down the funnel into like a pool.

2227
01:40:22,420 --> 01:40:24,420
I never did that. OK.

2228
01:40:24,420 --> 01:40:27,540
Yeah, I've never done one of those like a little curlicue, whatever.

2229
01:40:27,700 --> 01:40:32,060
I feel like I haven't done a lot of I feel like I've recently conquered haunts.

2230
01:40:32,060 --> 01:40:35,500
I'm ready to conquer drop slide type things and like more extreme slides.

2231
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:37,900
What you're talking about, because as a child, I was very scared of everything.

2232
01:40:37,900 --> 01:40:40,100
My mom also we've talked about many times.

2233
01:40:40,100 --> 01:40:43,980
My mom wouldn't let me go to certain water parks just that for a birthday.

2234
01:40:43,980 --> 01:40:45,940
She was afraid I would die. Boy.

2235
01:40:45,980 --> 01:40:46,780
Which is fair.

2236
01:40:46,780 --> 01:40:51,460
I mean, that's the scary thing about water parks is that you have way more control

2237
01:40:51,460 --> 01:40:55,260
over your own experience at a water park than you would on a given ride. Right.

2238
01:40:55,620 --> 01:40:57,900
You you in order to go on those high slides,

2239
01:40:57,900 --> 01:41:01,460
you really do have to like sit with your hands across your chest or like,

2240
01:41:01,660 --> 01:41:04,260
you know, behind your head. You can't flail around.

2241
01:41:04,260 --> 01:41:09,100
It actually is really dangerous if if you flail around like you,

2242
01:41:09,260 --> 01:41:11,020
you know, if someone pisses in the water.

2243
01:41:11,020 --> 01:41:12,660
I mean, that's why they have chlorine, I guess.

2244
01:41:12,660 --> 01:41:16,300
But like you really can ruin a slide in a way that you you can't.

2245
01:41:17,020 --> 01:41:18,500
I trust rides.

2246
01:41:18,500 --> 01:41:21,940
I don't trust myself nearly as much as I trust the people who make the rides.

2247
01:41:22,780 --> 01:41:25,300
So I think that's why I don't know if I trust my body

2248
01:41:25,900 --> 01:41:28,100
to know what to do on like a high slide,

2249
01:41:28,100 --> 01:41:30,780
but I completely trust the roller coaster on like a big drop.

2250
01:41:31,180 --> 01:41:32,620
Right. Yes, that makes sense.

2251
01:41:32,620 --> 01:41:35,540
Yeah, because you feel like it really does feel like when you're on some of the slides

2252
01:41:35,540 --> 01:41:36,980
that you could just slip out.

2253
01:41:36,980 --> 01:41:39,940
Like it does. Like you don't I don't feel safe as much.

2254
01:41:40,700 --> 01:41:42,020
You know, it does.

2255
01:41:42,020 --> 01:41:45,580
I mean, obviously there's some sort of physics, but like the type of slides

2256
01:41:45,580 --> 01:41:48,740
where you're in a giant inner tube and you go right up against the edge

2257
01:41:48,740 --> 01:41:51,820
and you come down, doesn't that feel like one of these times

2258
01:41:51,820 --> 01:41:56,260
that thing's just going to fly and go sailing out of the gates of the theme park?

2259
01:41:56,300 --> 01:41:59,780
Yeah, it feels very imprecise in a way that that is a lot.

2260
01:42:00,100 --> 01:42:02,020
That is a lot scarier to me. Yeah.

2261
01:42:02,020 --> 01:42:04,180
But they they know what they're doing.

2262
01:42:04,180 --> 01:42:08,140
Theoretically, I think there are stories I've heard of people

2263
01:42:08,140 --> 01:42:10,380
falling off those big slides because they're doing something stupid.

2264
01:42:10,380 --> 01:42:12,100
Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Yeah.

2265
01:42:12,100 --> 01:42:16,060
But I feel like I'd be the one who didn't cross my arms like, no, not like that.

2266
01:42:16,100 --> 01:42:18,380
What do you mean? I don't even know how I did it wrong.

2267
01:42:18,380 --> 01:42:21,300
And you crossed them over your stomach and not over here somehow.

2268
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:23,220
And that leads to instant decapitation.

2269
01:42:23,220 --> 01:42:26,580
Yeah, it's very vulnerable to be on a water slide because it's just you.

2270
01:42:26,580 --> 01:42:30,140
Your ride suddenly becomes your body becomes your ride car.

2271
01:42:30,500 --> 01:42:33,380
Yeah. And you also feel like the ridges of the slide sometimes.

2272
01:42:33,380 --> 01:42:35,420
Yeah. You feel like the slumps on the slide.

2273
01:42:35,420 --> 01:42:37,020
Oh, the little like connector piece.

2274
01:42:37,020 --> 01:42:39,620
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.

2275
01:42:39,620 --> 01:42:41,780
I like that shouldn't be going over my back. Yeah.

2276
01:42:41,780 --> 01:42:43,940
Do you guys like big, big roller coasters?

2277
01:42:44,540 --> 01:42:45,420
Well, that's it.

2278
01:42:45,420 --> 01:42:49,620
I haven't done a lot of the Six Flags coasters,

2279
01:42:49,620 --> 01:42:52,140
but again, that's another thing I'm working on. Yeah.

2280
01:42:52,180 --> 01:42:53,380
But I just I just went.

2281
01:42:53,540 --> 01:42:54,580
I mean, those are there.

2282
01:42:54,580 --> 01:42:57,700
They're. I've been to Six Flags.

2283
01:42:57,740 --> 01:42:59,620
Sorry, you were answering a question. I completely interrupted.

2284
01:42:59,620 --> 01:43:03,300
Oh, no, I was just going to say, like, I my I don't like the dangling legs.

2285
01:43:03,340 --> 01:43:07,060
That's what I don't like. Oh, I feel vulnerable with my legs dangling.

2286
01:43:07,620 --> 01:43:09,260
But everything else I feel OK about.

2287
01:43:09,260 --> 01:43:11,460
But like there's ones that are really crazy.

2288
01:43:12,260 --> 01:43:14,900
There's like Green Lantern, one that apparently hurts.

2289
01:43:15,860 --> 01:43:17,500
That is shut down. Oh, yeah.

2290
01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:19,660
The Green Lantern one is shut down because that's been a ride

2291
01:43:19,660 --> 01:43:21,380
that they've been trying to do at Six Flags.

2292
01:43:21,380 --> 01:43:22,940
They call it a 4D coaster.

2293
01:43:22,940 --> 01:43:25,100
That's been a ride they've been trying to do for a while, but it

2294
01:43:26,700 --> 01:43:29,340
they're they're shutting it down because it fucks people up somehow.

2295
01:43:29,340 --> 01:43:32,060
Like the helmet, like where you're watching a simulator movie.

2296
01:43:32,100 --> 01:43:32,860
No, that's different.

2297
01:43:32,860 --> 01:43:34,300
No, that's something else.

2298
01:43:34,300 --> 01:43:37,140
You're almost like on the side of like a like

2299
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:39,260
it's like you're on the side of the coaster.

2300
01:43:39,260 --> 01:43:42,660
And then also you drop and then like spinning and like, I don't know.

2301
01:43:42,660 --> 01:43:44,180
I don't know how to describe it. Yeah.

2302
01:43:44,180 --> 01:43:46,300
People hurt. It hurts. Yeah, it's a weird.

2303
01:43:46,300 --> 01:43:49,300
I mean, the because I've been going to Six Flags since I was

2304
01:43:49,860 --> 01:43:53,220
I've been going on upside down roller coasters since I was like 13.

2305
01:43:53,580 --> 01:43:57,700
And there is something to the taller you get and the older you get.

2306
01:43:57,700 --> 01:43:59,540
It just stresses your body out more.

2307
01:43:59,540 --> 01:44:00,700
And I can handle roller coasters.

2308
01:44:00,700 --> 01:44:01,540
I love roller coasters.

2309
01:44:01,540 --> 01:44:05,380
But I was just a Six Flags and like, I mean, you the

2310
01:44:05,700 --> 01:44:09,220
the thing you need before big roller coasters is you actually need food

2311
01:44:09,220 --> 01:44:10,700
in your stomach. Yeah.

2312
01:44:10,700 --> 01:44:12,860
It's a misconception to do an empty stomach.

2313
01:44:12,860 --> 01:44:16,860
You actually you need like a hearty meal and you need like a healthy meal.

2314
01:44:17,420 --> 01:44:19,780
And so you have to prep really well for it.

2315
01:44:19,780 --> 01:44:22,860
And then there are just some coasters there, man, that like

2316
01:44:23,420 --> 01:44:24,940
it is borderline unpleasant.

2317
01:44:24,940 --> 01:44:26,860
Some of them are aging very poorly.

2318
01:44:26,860 --> 01:44:28,660
Like I'll do pretty much anything.

2319
01:44:28,660 --> 01:44:31,660
I don't like the standing up ones because they never really

2320
01:44:32,420 --> 01:44:37,500
for five foot one, man, it's not pleasant to have that like bicycle seat.

2321
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:40,820
Like like I'm like half standing, half sitting.

2322
01:44:40,820 --> 01:44:42,420
It's not good.

2323
01:44:42,420 --> 01:44:45,420
And also like some shoulder restraints, if it

2324
01:44:45,900 --> 01:44:50,100
because I am so sure I will just my head will bonk around in between them.

2325
01:44:50,100 --> 01:44:52,180
And that's really bad on the older ones.

2326
01:44:52,180 --> 01:44:54,340
But the newer ones tend to be pretty smooth.

2327
01:44:54,740 --> 01:44:57,100
I'll tell you what really fucked me up

2328
01:44:57,740 --> 01:45:01,700
last time that I'd been on a couple of years ago was fine is X2 is not aging well.

2329
01:45:01,940 --> 01:45:06,060
Oh, no. And because it was so incredibly bumpy

2330
01:45:06,940 --> 01:45:11,060
that I felt like, oh, I actually need to hold my head steady on this.

2331
01:45:11,060 --> 01:45:13,260
Otherwise, I'm going to seriously fuck up my body.

2332
01:45:13,260 --> 01:45:16,500
So X2 is the one where you're

2333
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:18,780
you're you're like to the side of the roller coaster.

2334
01:45:18,780 --> 01:45:20,740
You're basically it's double upside down.

2335
01:45:20,740 --> 01:45:22,500
You're as you're on the ride.

2336
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:24,620
You're on an axis that turns you.

2337
01:45:24,620 --> 01:45:26,980
And the first time I went on it, this is like five years ago.

2338
01:45:26,980 --> 01:45:30,060
I was like, this is the greatest ride I've ever been on because it was very smooth.

2339
01:45:30,300 --> 01:45:33,140
Because when you have the hat on a hatness of you're going upside down

2340
01:45:33,140 --> 01:45:35,660
while you're going upside down, you don't also need bumpiness.

2341
01:45:36,060 --> 01:45:38,620
I mean, you never really need bumpiness on a steel roller coaster.

2342
01:45:38,620 --> 01:45:41,540
I don't know. That's never that's never relevant to the situation.

2343
01:45:42,180 --> 01:45:46,500
But X2 has gotten like really bumpy now and it it really fucked with my head.

2344
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:49,740
But I'll tell you what I loved that I didn't think I would love their new ride

2345
01:45:49,740 --> 01:45:51,900
Crazanity, which is the worst name.

2346
01:45:52,940 --> 01:45:54,980
It's I forget what they call it, but basically you're

2347
01:45:54,980 --> 01:45:57,900
it's one of those like vomit, vomit inducing rides you'd think.

2348
01:45:57,900 --> 01:46:01,100
But like you're on basically a giant wheel that spins

2349
01:46:01,460 --> 01:46:05,020
while you're doing like the Dragon Boat up and down thing.

2350
01:46:05,340 --> 01:46:08,020
It's one of the most like intense rides I've ever been on,

2351
01:46:08,020 --> 01:46:10,780
but like shockingly enjoyable. Wow.

2352
01:46:10,780 --> 01:46:14,140
I've seen there's a version of that in the Warner Brothers Dubai Park, I think.

2353
01:46:14,140 --> 01:46:16,540
It's a big like this kind of thing. Yes, yes.

2354
01:46:16,580 --> 01:46:17,660
That sounds fun, honestly.

2355
01:46:17,660 --> 01:46:19,340
That sounds like a thing I would have gone on as a kid.

2356
01:46:19,340 --> 01:46:21,340
So I'll try that when I go.

2357
01:46:21,340 --> 01:46:23,500
Yeah, I'm going soon. You're building up bravery.

2358
01:46:24,180 --> 01:46:25,980
The Twisted Colossus is amazing.

2359
01:46:25,980 --> 01:46:27,300
OK, that's the best one. Oh, really?

2360
01:46:27,300 --> 01:46:28,620
I like it aesthetically.

2361
01:46:28,620 --> 01:46:30,860
Like, have you been on it? No, I've been to it.

2362
01:46:30,860 --> 01:46:35,340
It's fantastic because what they did was somehow they kept

2363
01:46:35,340 --> 01:46:37,660
so Colossus was this classic wooden roller coaster at Six Flags.

2364
01:46:38,340 --> 01:46:40,140
We really should have just been talking about Six Flags this whole time.

2365
01:46:41,100 --> 01:46:41,860
New podcast. OK.

2366
01:46:41,860 --> 01:46:46,540
But they but they they they put a steel track like on top of on top of like

2367
01:46:46,540 --> 01:46:49,780
the wooden structure and they kept the cars very similar.

2368
01:46:49,780 --> 01:46:51,020
So there's no shoulder restraint.

2369
01:46:51,020 --> 01:46:55,100
And somehow the the upside down is so subtle.

2370
01:46:55,100 --> 01:46:59,180
You don't like it doesn't register you're going up that you're going upside down.

2371
01:46:59,180 --> 01:47:01,340
And this one, it's not a zero gravity turn.

2372
01:47:01,340 --> 01:47:05,260
They call it a there's a term that they use for the like specific

2373
01:47:05,260 --> 01:47:08,700
like upside down loop on Twisted Colossus that like

2374
01:47:10,180 --> 01:47:11,980
you can't believe you're upside down.

2375
01:47:11,980 --> 01:47:14,380
Like it feels it's so cool.

2376
01:47:14,380 --> 01:47:18,740
It's so many roller coasters that we're not we're we all like roller coasters.

2377
01:47:18,740 --> 01:47:22,900
But like there's a certain subsect of people who really like roller coasters.

2378
01:47:22,900 --> 01:47:25,620
And I was up there for a media thing and I was like, oh, there's roller

2379
01:47:25,620 --> 01:47:28,980
coaster people here today. Like we've been at theme park events.

2380
01:47:28,980 --> 01:47:32,580
This is like a mix of theme park people and roller coaster people.

2381
01:47:32,580 --> 01:47:38,260
And yeah, I am one of those I'm I am I've always been a huge roller coaster.

2382
01:47:38,260 --> 01:47:43,700
I'm a I'm a both but like I love I love those roller coaster people.

2383
01:47:43,700 --> 01:47:47,020
It's it's a there's a certain hearty heartiness.

2384
01:47:47,020 --> 01:47:48,940
I mean, especially the older you get.

2385
01:47:48,940 --> 01:47:51,380
It's a certain type of person who can still ride these coasters

2386
01:47:51,380 --> 01:47:53,860
when they're in their 60s. Right. Sure.

2387
01:47:53,860 --> 01:47:56,940
Yeah, it's like it's it's athleticism a little bit.

2388
01:47:57,020 --> 01:48:00,540
Yeah, you're putting your body through trauma. Yeah. Yeah.

2389
01:48:00,820 --> 01:48:05,460
And as a kid, like I was so scared of going upside down for some reason.

2390
01:48:05,620 --> 01:48:10,140
I would just do the wooden ones, which were so bumpy and so rickety,

2391
01:48:10,900 --> 01:48:12,980
probably worse in the long run.

2392
01:48:12,980 --> 01:48:16,060
But like that I can always pretty much do.

2393
01:48:16,060 --> 01:48:19,420
But like revolution, it's like this is the very first inverted

2394
01:48:19,420 --> 01:48:21,340
like major theme park roller coaster.

2395
01:48:21,340 --> 01:48:24,260
I was like, yeah, I can tell that it's 40 years old.

2396
01:48:24,340 --> 01:48:26,980
I can feel it in my brain. Yeah. Yeah.

2397
01:48:27,180 --> 01:48:30,900
And yet as scary as a lot of these rides are, just to bring it back to Raging Waters,

2398
01:48:31,740 --> 01:48:37,820
Raging Waters is was still bold enough to and probably incorrects

2399
01:48:37,820 --> 01:48:42,060
to make this assertion that they are the only theme park with rides

2400
01:48:42,060 --> 01:48:44,220
guaranteed to make you wet your pants.

2401
01:48:45,140 --> 01:48:46,900
Official ad that I'm holding up.

2402
01:48:46,900 --> 01:48:50,300
That's something they actually got to watch at the company Christmas party

2403
01:48:50,300 --> 01:48:51,980
for that. That's really good.

2404
01:48:51,980 --> 01:48:54,620
I got it. Is that 90s? Is that the 90s?

2405
01:48:55,260 --> 01:48:57,020
I think it's when it opened. I think this is 83.

2406
01:48:57,020 --> 01:48:59,260
OK, in the 90s, everything was gross.

2407
01:48:59,260 --> 01:49:02,300
They were. Yeah. We were fine being gross.

2408
01:49:02,580 --> 01:49:04,700
Yeah. Yeah. I wonder what happened.

2409
01:49:04,700 --> 01:49:06,940
I'm going to bring gross back. Yeah. Sure.

2410
01:49:07,020 --> 01:49:12,700
Yeah. I'm going to create a show called Blooms Booger Fart Shit Party.

2411
01:49:13,020 --> 01:49:15,340
Yeah. That kids show, though.

2412
01:49:15,460 --> 01:49:17,500
Yeah. Did you say shit party?

2413
01:49:17,740 --> 01:49:19,620
OK, Booger Fart Poop Party.

2414
01:49:19,620 --> 01:49:21,220
Great. Hey, great. Hey, great.

2415
01:49:21,220 --> 01:49:23,700
It's not even better. I was a fan for a second.

2416
01:49:23,700 --> 01:49:28,220
The sillier. And it's just it's a competition to see how gross kids

2417
01:49:28,380 --> 01:49:30,340
who to find the grossest kid in America.

2418
01:49:30,340 --> 01:49:33,340
Gross America's grossest kid.

2419
01:49:34,940 --> 01:49:37,980
Oh, no, I'm on this entire.

2420
01:49:38,340 --> 01:49:40,260
I take this entire from his back.

2421
01:49:40,260 --> 01:49:42,940
Wait a minute. You're imagining a bunch of gross children.

2422
01:49:44,500 --> 01:49:46,060
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2423
01:49:46,060 --> 01:49:49,500
Well, yeah. Hey, on on that note, Rachel Bloom, you survived podcast.

2424
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:51,860
The ride. Thank you so much for being here. Oh, my God.

2425
01:49:51,860 --> 01:49:54,300
Did you take my picture at some point in it and I didn't notice?

2426
01:49:54,740 --> 01:49:57,740
I've thought how what we should do is something like

2427
01:49:57,740 --> 01:50:01,500
like we do if we had a little photo booth set up that was like the end of ride

2428
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:04,460
thing, we need to rig something up. Yeah, we really should do that.

2429
01:50:04,460 --> 01:50:05,460
It's hard to put that together.

2430
01:50:05,460 --> 01:50:07,700
Next time you're in a room. Thanks for giving it to us.

2431
01:50:08,260 --> 01:50:09,860
But hey, let's exit through the gift shop.

2432
01:50:09,860 --> 01:50:11,740
Anything you would like to plug?

2433
01:50:11,740 --> 01:50:14,220
Oh, yeah, I'm on a casual tour.

2434
01:50:14,380 --> 01:50:16,700
Check my website for details.

2435
01:50:16,700 --> 01:50:18,180
Just a casual. Sounds chill.

2436
01:50:18,180 --> 01:50:19,060
It's a very chill tour.

2437
01:50:19,060 --> 01:50:22,580
I'm doing domestic away dates every month and a half.

2438
01:50:22,580 --> 01:50:25,260
And then I have a monthly show at Largo in L.A., which is

2439
01:50:26,020 --> 01:50:28,820
which will be when this podcast release is coming up in three days.

2440
01:50:28,820 --> 01:50:31,820
And hopefully I'll have a better idea of what I'm doing at it than I do now,

2441
01:50:31,820 --> 01:50:33,580
which is I have no idea what I do.

2442
01:50:33,580 --> 01:50:35,580
Well, hopefully it adds to the excitement.

2443
01:50:35,580 --> 01:50:37,020
That's to the thrill.

2444
01:50:37,020 --> 01:50:38,300
Text us if you don't.

2445
01:50:38,300 --> 01:50:41,300
If you say to be like, edit out the I'm going to I'm going to bail.

2446
01:50:41,300 --> 01:50:42,340
I'm going to leave the night off.

2447
01:50:42,340 --> 01:50:43,380
Just have you guys come.

2448
01:50:43,380 --> 01:50:45,660
I mean, there's a it's anything I want to do at Largo.

2449
01:50:45,660 --> 01:50:47,940
So I could always just have other people come and perform.

2450
01:50:47,940 --> 01:50:48,820
And I just want to.

2451
01:50:48,820 --> 01:50:53,020
Well, as you learn, we can do two hours as long as it's about water slides.

2452
01:50:53,620 --> 01:50:55,660
You need a lot of time filled.

2453
01:50:55,660 --> 01:50:57,980
What a bait and switch, if that was what it was.

2454
01:50:58,100 --> 01:51:00,300
So I'm going to come and see some musical comedy.

2455
01:51:00,300 --> 01:51:02,540
