1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Dog.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Warning, the following podcast may contain shadow play

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and songs that have not aged well.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It may be low capacity, but it's high adventure.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
From Wreck-It Ralph 2, Danny Fernandez helps the Good Boys become Lost Boys.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's Peter Pan's flight on podcast.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The Ride.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the theme park podcast hosted by three boys who would not

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
make good members of Peter Pan's gang because they're deathly afraid of getting lost.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
My name is Mike Carlson, joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yeah, I like to usually know my whereabouts.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I told you once that I usually know where the ocean and the mountain is, wherever I am.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Is that really a thing?

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Well, that's how I learned how to navigate LA, of like, the mountains are that way.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Okay, ocean is that way, downtown is that way.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Do you have a sense, like, if I placed you anywhere in Los Angeles, you just have a sense of where it is?

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Or do you always just check your phone?

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yeah, I kind of have a sense.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Do you?

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
That's Scott Gertner.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Hi.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Do you like, there's places though where you can't see an ocean or a mountain, many places.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:40,000
No, I can't, just more of a general set, not like, like special forces, I think you're supposed to like know when you're in a room, you're supposed to have an internal compass to know which way is stuff.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
As do you if you're trying a new donut place and you're not sure where it is on a map.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's helpful to get, yeah, be able to get back there by sense memory.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Well, let's bring our guest in to see if she knows where a nearby mountain or ocean is.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
She's an actress, she's a writer, a podcaster, you know her from her podcast Nerdificent.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Ladies and gentlemen, it's Dani Fernandez.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yay.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I actually don't have great sense, but I feel like I would know where I am in this town.

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yeah.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Like if you drop me off at like Sunset in Gower, I would be like, oh, this is Sunset in Gower.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You're in Gower Gulch, which amazingly has not come up on this show despite being a themed environment.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yeah. So we talk a lot about like malls and themed stuff and that's like one of the prime themed malls.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Oh yeah, it's a little old west town is what it is.

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yeah, there's a Denny's in the parking lot.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yes. Oh my gosh.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's not the best Denny's I've ever been to.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
No, not the best toros.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But always Hoppin.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yes, Hoppin I will give it.

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Yeah.

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yeah.

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Do y'all talk about the Burbank Mall then?

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The Burbank Town Center.

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's certainly come up.

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's come up.

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Do you have particular thoughts and observations?

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Well, I think that there's like a top floor that's nothing now.

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I find that so fascinating.

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yeah.

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I don't think anyone goes up there.

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You mean the entire top floor?

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yeah.

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yeah.

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Well, there's the movie theater.

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
That must be why.

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The Burbank area has three AMCs and there's two of them are AMC 6 and AMC 8.

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It is impossible to remember which one is where.

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I think it's eight.

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Oddly, the bigger one is in the mall.

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Eight.

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Well, there's eight, six.

65
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Six and 16.

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And I'm not kidding you, listener.

67
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
They're all within walking distance.

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
They are all within walking distance.

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And the emptiness I think comes from the fact that the food court moved from the third floor to the first floor.

70
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
A phenomenon I've never seen at any other shopping mall.

71
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
We have not done a ton of deep dive Burbank mall yet.

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
We will get there.

73
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
OK.

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
But Burbank mall, it's going away a little bit, but Burbank mall has some of the best fake stores I've ever seen.

75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Like a store that just sells fake plants and like a big glass tiger.

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And you're like, and there's a couple of those at a certain point, a couple of different stores that you could buy a fake plant and a big glass tiger.

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'll see some of those on Wilshire.

78
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm like, how do you have this prime real estate and like you're closed most of the time?

79
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yes.

80
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And like when you open, you're just selling like three chandeliers.

81
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Like I don't want to understand.

82
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yeah, I that is one of the things if I was a ball, if I was like a Larry David type, I would wander in and go, how do you make money?

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Explain it to me.

84
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Can I see a business plan?

85
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Can I see how much a day you make?

86
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Like there's a video game store in the Burbank mall.

87
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's not GameStop.

88
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It looks like a fake.

89
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
No, it's true.

90
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's a knockoff GameStop.

91
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yeah. And it looks all like the logo looks cheap inside.

92
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
They have very little stock of anything.

93
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And it's kind of dark in there.

94
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's very dark in there.

95
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's a front.

96
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's a front.

97
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
That's what I'm getting at.

98
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
There's a lot.

99
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:49,000
There's it's a real mystery place because like there's a store that has like a lot of imported stuff, a lot of Pocky and stuff like Totoro's.

100
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And then there is a second store that has Pocky and Totoro's.

101
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's like, well, now, wait a minute.

102
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Hold on.

103
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
This mall isn't that big that there are two of these.

104
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's a fascinating mall.

105
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's one of the most interesting malls, this Burbank mall specifically.

106
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I don't just.

107
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Well, I think another reason why it's so ghostly and same with because I went to high school in Dallas and like some of our malls are shutting down there and like is because of Amazon.

108
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I hope.

109
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I think or Highland.

110
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
OK.

111
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
North Park's the super fancy one.

112
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I spent a lot of time there on a Dallas trip.

113
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I loved it.

114
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm so sorry to alert you of this.

115
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
One of those is shutting down.

116
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But I think it's because of Amazon.

117
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Because everyone's like online shopping and stuff, which it's funny to me whenever something that started online actually becomes a store, though.

118
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Like so in the Burbank mall, they have Fashion Nova and Fashion Nova was like huge because Cardi B's always wearing it and stuff.

119
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And they actually got so big that they opened an actual store.

120
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So it's one of the few like physical locations.

121
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I have seen that.

122
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What's a fashion?

123
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
What is a fashion?

124
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
What is a fashion?

125
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's like Forever 21, but like slightly sluttier and more just like you clearly want to look like you're in a music video.

126
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I shop there a lot.

127
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Sure.

128
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Not kidding.

129
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I haven't.

130
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Do they have men's clothes at Fashion Nova?

131
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
No, they have a little bit.

132
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
OK, because I recently started shopping at Forever 21.

133
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yeah, really?

134
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Because they have.

135
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yeah, they have a lot of it's not it's nothing crazy.

136
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's you know, I don't think I knew they had male clothing.

137
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yeah.

138
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I mean, I have a sweatshirt with roses on it.

139
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I got from there.

140
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So I'm you know, I'm doing it now.

141
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Believe me when I say I'm not trying to segue and get us back to the topic.

142
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
But Forever 21 is a perfect.

143
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yeah, it is.

144
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yeah.

145
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
For never growing up.

146
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yeah, you're right.

147
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Forever 12.

148
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Forever 12.

149
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
That's where the Lost Boys would show.

150
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
That's where you buy like raccoon suits.

151
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That has to be Peter Pan.

152
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
In my mind, he hasn't hit puberty yet.

153
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Right?

154
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Yeah, that's a good question.

155
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I feel like he's starting it because maybe a little late comer.

156
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I think he's like a he's tall.

157
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
He's at the growth spurt, but not the rest of the puberty.

158
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Maybe he's at like Wendy because like Wendy's right on the line.

159
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Uh huh.

160
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
They're both.

161
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
They both are.

162
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yeah.

163
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So it's so changes are happening, but all of the changes aren't happening.

164
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Maybe.

165
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Well, they were happening and now I think they're frozen for him.

166
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yeah.

167
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Can you believe that you're just in puberty forever?

168
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Yeah, I really hadn't thought about the nightmare that that is for Peter, but he's like an eighth

169
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,000
grader with an army of fifth graders all in like, yeah, fast fashion animal skins where

170
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
it's like fashion Nova style.

171
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Fashion Nova.

172
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

173
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It didn't cost that many Neverland bucks.

174
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
If this gets messed up in one of the endless pirate fights you have to that is your life.

175
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's okay.

176
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And we all know how when you graduate school, if you go to middle school and then go back

177
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
to your elementary school or your or your you get to college and go back to high school,

178
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
everyone worships you and follows you around.

179
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's not like people think that's weird and you should get out of the school as soon as

180
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
you've arrived.

181
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
For sure.

182
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Peter would have an army of little ones at his disposal.

183
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yeah, it's a all of these things really take the fun out of Peter Pan.

184
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
This is really like thinking about it at all.

185
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Yeah, analyzing it for a second.

186
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Like that's a real bummer, isn't it?

187
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Well, you know, I mean, what takes the fun out of Peter Pan is watching it.

188
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Like, I think we all have to hold on to memories of what it is and not actually view the film

189
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
because I did.

190
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I know Jason did and I did and prepare you inspire me to do it today as well.

191
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And I think it is a film best unwatched.

192
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's problematic.

193
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Yeah.

194
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yeah.

195
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
The ride is the perfect amount of Peter Pan.

196
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Like there is a reason this ride is like incredibly popular, like shot lines like our pushing

197
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
our weight line sometimes.

198
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It doesn't have a fast.

199
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's like the one of the ones that doesn't have a fast pass, right?

200
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Right.

201
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So it's like you have to if you love this ride, you have to stick it out.

202
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And like it's wild because in fantasy land, which is largely for, you know, I think of like the kiddie ride,

203
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
the rides that kids can actually go on because like my niece and nephew can't go on Space Mountain yet.

204
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's insane that it's an hour wait always.

205
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I haven't said this a lot on the show, but like if you're getting to one of the Magic Kingdom style parks

206
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,000
at opening or staying until closing, this is, I think, the ride more so than like a Space Mountain.

207
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Oh, totally.

208
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Like a Space Mountain, like you can give it a couple hours and it'll still kind of have a manageable wait.

209
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
But this the wait gets so quick, so fast.

210
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And it's a line that gives you almost nothing.

211
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You are just back and forth and back and forth.

212
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
That is very old school line.

213
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I know in Florida, there's more.

214
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,000
There's a room that you go in and there's, you know, you do a little interactive displays with shadows.

215
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Florida's queue watching the video of the current queue in Florida is shocking because it's like a full nursery with like shadows and pixie dust.

216
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And like it seems fun.

217
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Yeah. But this one, this is, you know, obviously this is an opening day of Traxxas in 1955 and it's a very 1955 style line.

218
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It is they had not come up with any ideas of how to make a line.

219
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's the Matterhorn line.

220
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
They're the same.

221
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Yeah, that is also very boring.

222
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
There is not much going on there.

223
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's just open.

224
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
There's nothing to do.

225
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You go one way and you go the other way and you hear a type of music that isn't, it's not specifically annoying, but I would never choose to put on Swiss Alp music.

226
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Which serious will I put on today?

227
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Sounds of the Alps.

228
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Is there any like updated Swiss Alps music like a Diplo produced Swiss Alps?

229
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
There's got to be.

230
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Is there a Grammy category that I'm not aware of?

231
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Right.

232
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
There's a thriving scene.

233
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Because you look like real dumb if there is now.

234
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Like I would never listen to Swiss Alps music, but then the kids will be like, you know, there's a, I was going to say dead mouse, which just made me look dumb.

235
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Wow.

236
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
There's a newer, there's got to be a newer DJ.

237
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
If you're trying to stay forever 21, you got to update the references.

238
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I blew this whole fell apart for me.

239
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Have you guys heard that rave?

240
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
The Haunted Mansion one, but it's like rave style.

241
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
No.

242
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Oh my gosh.

243
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I have it.

244
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I want to.

245
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
What is the artist of this?

246
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'll have to find it, but it would be great if they did all of the, all of the Disney rides as opposed to just.

247
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
We've talked about this album called Deconstructed.

248
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yes.

249
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
That is all kind of electro remixes of Disney songs.

250
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
What else is on there?

251
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Winnie the Pooh.

252
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Like Winnie the Pooh.

253
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Oh, that sounds like fun.

254
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Yeah.

255
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
There's a net Funicello song, Pineapple Princess.

256
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's an old Sherman Brothers song and they've like remixed the hell out of it.

257
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And it's so unpleasant.

258
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
The original was like a fun, a fun ukulele song.

259
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And now it's just this unlistening club club mix.

260
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Strange.

261
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And I don't think I'm being old man about it.

262
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It really is unpleasant.

263
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'll just find it while we're talking.

264
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I think they had to change the name.

265
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It can't be like Haunted Mansion.

266
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So I don't even know what it is in my Spotify.

267
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's probably like Spooky House.

268
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Right.

269
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
We didn't get sued.

270
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Cobweb place.

271
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I mean, this, this movie has some recognizable song.

272
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Oh yeah, for sure.

273
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And then there is a song when I was watching it, I went like, you know, like the one I think you can least sketch.

274
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Like this can't be what this is.

275
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
And then it was, it was a long song called What Does That Have To Do with I Think You Should Leave?

276
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I was just watching like this song start and I went, this can't be what this is.

277
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's just a, it's a, I guess you probably shouldn't even say the name of the song at this point.

278
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I wouldn't mind not saying.

279
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Yeah, it's a, it's you forget all of the weird portrayals of Native Americans.

280
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Essentially is what you're saying.

281
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
For Native Neverland.

282
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Even though.

283
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
No, wait, is that the song that's in there?

284
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
That is not in the ride.

285
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's not in the ride.

286
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Oh, you mean in the movie.

287
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Rewatching the movie, going to Disney Plus and watching this.

288
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And I don't know, maybe there was like one of those like a product of its time warnings.

289
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And I was looking away, but I was shocked by this one.

290
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
There is a, there is a warning that comes up when you press play.

291
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:43,000
But the warning, they do not do the bizarre phrase they've done contains outdated cultural depictions,

292
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
which is on a lot of movies.

293
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
There is only contains tobacco depictions.

294
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Oh, really?

295
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Not the other?

296
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And they don't, but these things are happening in the same scene.

297
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So it's almost like they got distracted.

298
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Like, okay, this is a tobacco scene.

299
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And they just, and they forgot.

300
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I was going to say, did somebody forget?

301
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It's not like there's much of an effort to add a couple words.

302
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Also, do they have that in The Great Mouse Detective?

303
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Because like he's smoking a pipe and stuff, right?

304
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Like, is there, you're not supposed to be smoking at all?

305
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Yeah, probably.

306
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
That's interesting.

307
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Yeah, I would assume that would be a warning.

308
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You guys, I'm here for the deep dives.

309
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Yeah, sure.

310
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Bed knobs and broomsticks, actually.

311
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
They're smoking constantly in bed knobs and broomsticks.

312
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Those knobs are bongs.

313
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
The children are ripping bong heads in bed knobs and broomsticks.

314
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Are you a big Disney head in that case?

315
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Yes, grew up just like obsessed with Disney.

316
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
In fact, my brothers actually hid the Lion King VHS from me because I played it too much.

317
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
They like hid it under the couch.

318
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You were going to like destroy it?

319
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Was that the fear?

320
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Like you were going to, like it was going to turn to dust?

321
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
They were annoyed.

322
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Oh, they didn't want to see it anymore.

323
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Oh, okay.

324
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I played it way too much.

325
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
We were one of those, I don't know if you all did this, but like with our VHSs, if we like something,

326
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
we just played it again and again and again.

327
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
That's how I know the mask, like word for word.

328
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Jim Carrey's the mask.

329
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You know, and it was like whatever my parents gave us.

330
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
So it's like, that's kind of what you latch onto.

331
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It doesn't even matter if it's good, although I think that movie is.

332
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Sure.

333
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:23,000
The repetition and that these kids, the kids now don't have to wait for the tape to be rewound.

334
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Yeah.

335
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
They can just scroll immediately back.

336
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
The hassle that it was to rewatch a favorite scene.

337
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You had to wait our entire, what, two and a half minutes.

338
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Yeah.

339
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Boy, our childhoods were rough.

340
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Yeah.

341
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Was Lion King your favorite of all of them?

342
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Yeah, but then I don't know, it's kind of like changed.

343
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
So I really, really, well, I'm always a big fan of a goofy movie.

344
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Like that was so, and now it's kind of had a resurgence, but for the longest time people would be like, what?

345
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Is it like an extremely goofy movie?

346
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'm like, no, it's not the same.

347
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Listen, there's like, you have to listen to the power line songs.

348
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And I was just like such a big fan of a goofy movie.

349
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And now like Target realized that and like capitalize on the nostalgia.

350
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And now you can get like power line there, which is chill.

351
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
What happened there?

352
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Why does, why was that like the cult Disney movie?

353
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
And then they figured it out.

354
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Why was there this syndrome?

355
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
And how, like, because it very much felt like no one else was watching it.

356
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
But there was only one person in every school who was watching it.

357
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And now everybody found each other in LA.

358
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Well, they've all gone into the arts.

359
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Every single one of them is.

360
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Well, I think that's also because it's not like traditional Disney movies have like a princess or a, you know what I mean?

361
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It's like some type of magical fantasy.

362
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And this was like just a teen kid that hated his dad.

363
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,000
If you look back at it, when I watch it, you're like, oh my God, you're such an ass to your dad.

364
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Like he just wants to spend time with you.

365
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Yes, I still love Max.

366
00:16:50,000 --> 00:17:00,000
But yeah, and I think Goofy is kind of like as much as he's iconic, he's kind of like one of the side people as opposed to like Mickey and Minnie and Duck.

367
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Like, yeah, I think of Goofy as like no one's fave.

368
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I don't know. I'm sorry.

369
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It's definitely someone's fave.

370
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It's a kid. He was my fave for sure.

371
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
But he's also like a sort of a side character in that movie.

372
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Oh, totally.

373
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I was just calling Goofy like literally, but he's just like a dopey like dad.

374
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
He's just trying. He's there to embarrass his son.

375
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
The movie is really I think it also hit for a lot of us at the same time when Max was we're talking about puberty.

376
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It's like a puberty movie, too.

377
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Yeah.

378
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It's like that's also I think a lot of us saw it during that point and was like relatable.

379
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And a reverse of that dynamic that starts off Peter Pan because Mr. Darling hates his fucking kids.

380
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
That was another thing watching this where I was like, wow, this guy really hates his kids.

381
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Like between this and Mary Poppins, like British fiction, like British young people's fiction is just filled with like, you know, OK, so first off, your dad hates you, obviously.

382
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Yeah, I think that was around.

383
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:11,000
But really normal to back then to kind of like just the dad is like allowed to be like that because he makes all the money and just like shoving the kids off.

384
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Right. Yeah.

385
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Yeah. Dads liking their children was new past the 30s and in America.

386
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
British dads, I think, didn't start liking their kids still maybe this century.

387
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It was like 2003 or so.

388
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
There was an awakening.

389
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Yeah. Yeah. Among all British.

390
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I wanted to say I found the thing.

391
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

392
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Yeah, that's it.

393
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Isn't that dope?

394
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
That is good.

395
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
That's fun.

396
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It like really breaks down though.

397
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It gets. Oh yeah.

398
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
The bells come in.

399
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Yeah, that's good.

400
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Does it like have a dubstep middle maybe?

401
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Oh yeah.

402
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Just wait.

403
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It's about to kick into stuff, man.

404
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Oh man.

405
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I'm ready to go.

406
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'm ready to party.

407
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
One, two, three, one.

408
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It like gears up even more.

409
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
OK.

410
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
So anyways.

411
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Who's the artist there?

412
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
OK, so it is Haunted Mansion.

413
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I don't know why it didn't come up for me.

414
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's Spooky Scary Skeletons.

415
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Spooky Scary Skeletons.

416
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
OK.

417
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
So artists to spooky scary skeletons?

418
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Well, I'm sorry.

419
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
That's what comes up on Spotify.

420
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
No, I love it.

421
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I want to know if they have more music.

422
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
It might be the album, but that's what's coming up on there.

423
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Do spooky scary skeletons have just like regular love ballads and other types of music?

424
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Like fun, bouncy, just songs about driving?

425
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Yeah, like Beach Boy style songs.

426
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

427
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Yeah, they do Beach and Cards songs.

428
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
But you could do the Peter Pan one.

429
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Like think of a happy.

430
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Yeah, I should look up to see if they have.

431
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I don't think they have that on the deconstructed.

432
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
But yeah, it's music wise.

433
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I don't I always forget other than that little first flourish when you're leaving the bedroom.

434
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I don't I don't think of it as a songs movie in general.

435
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
But it is.

436
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Follow the Leader was a lot of stuff.

437
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
That was a big like sing along songs.

438
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Yeah, the croc.

439
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
But they're like the B side that they're clearly the second and third single.

440
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
You would know exactly what it was when you heard it, though.

441
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Yes.

442
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Yes. Yeah.

443
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It is interesting.

444
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Am I wrong in thinking those songs don't have the like, oh, like you don't think of them as much as in the Disney like the top.

445
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Would you think of them in top 10 Disney songs?

446
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
No, no, no.

447
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You can fly.

448
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Maybe.

449
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Maybe that one gets the closest.

450
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
But almost almost all of the movies really only have one big hit.

451
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I accept Hercules.

452
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I was going to say that was the other thing.

453
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Hercules is so good.

454
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I was big Hercules kit.

455
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It's like go the distance.

456
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Meg song.

457
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
What is her song?

458
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Oh, yeah.

459
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I hadn't thought about that one.

460
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I want to know that she hates men, which I love.

461
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Zero to hero.

462
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
A star is born.

463
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Yeah, I mean, I could.

464
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Oh, they're so good.

465
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Yeah.

466
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Yeah, actually.

467
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Yeah, those are all pretty like tied.

468
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Do we like.

469
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I'm sorry.

470
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Also, Mulan.

471
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I actually all of them.

472
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Mulan has make a man out of you and bring honor to us all reflections and shoot.

473
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
What's the one?

474
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
The other one.

475
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I can't think.

476
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
A girl worth fighting for.

477
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I just can't get like you list the other ones, but I'm just stuck in to defeat the Huns.

478
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:30,000
The most clear, like the whitest guy, obviously, Donny Osmond guy done survive.

479
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Is that Donny Osmond?

480
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Donny Osmond is the singing voice.

481
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I don't think I ever knew that.

482
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Yeah.

483
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Yeah.

484
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
He could not be more pronounced.

485
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I've ever met.

486
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
He really hits every consonant.

487
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And he's doing it in the live action one, too.

488
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
He'll be back.

489
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Yeah.

490
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It cuts to a 65 year old Donny Osmond.

491
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Like a Matt Damon sort of thing.

492
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,000
What I find so fascinating is that Danny Elfman did the singing voice of Jack for Nightmare

493
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
for Christmas.

494
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Why didn't you just do the regular voice, too?

495
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Who did the regular voice?

496
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I don't have it at my disposal.

497
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Yeah.

498
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Who is that?

499
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Why wouldn't he just also?

500
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
He sounds so much like the singing voice sounds just like him.

501
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
For sure.

502
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Yeah.

503
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
And the songs are a little like talk singy a lot.

504
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
So, you know.

505
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Jack!

506
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
You know, like that.

507
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Like he's just so into it.

508
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
He's listed as the voice.

509
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Oh, no, I thought he was just a singing voice.

510
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Oh, wait.

511
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
No, I'm so sorry.

512
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It's Chris Sarandon.

513
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Chris Sarandon.

514
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I read it wrong.

515
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Related to Susan Sarandon?

516
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I believe so.

517
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Why don't Chris Sarandon is Chris.

518
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
He's bringing up Percules again.

519
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
He's in the Tate Donovan category.

520
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,000
So some of these people are like not that well known outside of these voice, unless I'm forgetting.

521
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
What is the big Chris Sarandon?

522
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
What's the top Chris Sarandon?

523
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Oh, he was married to Susan Sarandon.

524
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
That's how she became a Sarandon.

525
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
That's why she's Sarandon.

526
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
However, she clearly took over that last name.

527
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
It is a lot more.

528
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Yes.

529
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
She really commandeered it.

530
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Good job, Susan.

531
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Can you imagine giving your last name to someone and then they like take it over and I assume they're divorced, right?

532
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Yeah, yeah.

533
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
So she like just took it and ran with it.

534
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
That is like kind of like a badass move, isn't it?

535
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Yeah.

536
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Who wins the divorce?

537
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Susan wins by vastly overshadowing him career wise.

538
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Now I don't know this, but were he a conservative man, he must be really furious.

539
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Sarandon is associated with these left wing values.

540
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
And she went on to play Betty Davidson.

541
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
He's much more of a Joan Crawford fellow.

542
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
That's the ultimate insult.

543
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,000
He's known for Fright Night, Dog Day Afternoon, The Princess Bride.

544
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Oh, yeah, that's right.

545
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
He's a prince and the princess bride.

546
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Oh, well, there you go.

547
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And Child's Play.

548
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:04,000
So sorry also to all of the Chris Sarandon heads who are screaming at us as they listen to this.

549
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I don't want to insult anyone.

550
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
No, not controversial.

551
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Tate Donovan to Goofy.

552
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Yeah.

553
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Sorry.

554
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
The great leading man out there.

555
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:19,000
My friend was Goofy in their college program that they have where you can like get college credit and go work at Disney World or whatever.

556
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Yeah, taller.

557
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Yeah, you had to be taller.

558
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
How'd that go for him?

559
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Did he like that?

560
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I think he did.

561
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I think he liked being goofy.

562
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I do find it fascinating that they can't really interact with like bad kids, you know, like they just have to put up with it.

563
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

564
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I like their rules.

565
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
That's why some of them also don't talk like they have.

566
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Isn't that like the Star Wars people don't actually talk, right?

567
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
They have the stormtroopers or do they?

568
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Well, yeah, people there's a debate.

569
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I feel like there's the same kind of lines they say.

570
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
So there's some mechanism by which they play a recorded.

571
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
That's what I figured.

572
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
That's what it seems like to me.

573
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Some people have disputed that, but that's my reading of it.

574
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
If you're a cast member, DM us.

575
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Yes.

576
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I am curious.

577
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Yeah, because they don't go like, hey, you in the blue shirt.

578
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
It's all it's pretty it's generic.

579
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Yeah, like they have stuff for kids.

580
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I think like you little Jedi, you won't defeat me.

581
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Like, but it's never like blonde haired little girl.

582
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
It's never that specific.

583
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Well, yeah, but the costume ones, they don't talk.

584
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Yeah, goofy and Minnie and Mickey and those they don't they just like hand gestures and crap.

585
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
There's a talking Mickey head that they have retired.

586
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
There was one.

587
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
So for now, at least it was malfunctioning too much.

588
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I don't know what it was doing, but we I saw it.

589
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
We it talked to us.

590
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I was so excited when we went to Florida when Lindsay and I went to Florida because it was like you.

591
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
They were like, you meet Mickey in the magic.

592
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
He's like dressing room before his magic show, which is bizarre.

593
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Now that I'm saying it out loud.

594
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Mickey's about to do a magic show.

595
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
You know, he's a magician.

596
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
He's a man who does a mouse who does a lot of different things.

597
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
And then you meet him in the dressing room before his show.

598
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
It's before the show.

599
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I think because you didn't see a show.

600
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
So why are you just going?

601
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Are you just going backstage to see him?

602
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I don't like to see anyone before a show.

603
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
It's bad.

604
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I do not like the audience to see me.

605
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Oh, yeah.

606
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I don't want to stress Mickey out.

607
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
He's going to blow all the tricks.

608
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
But then there were multiple rooms because it was just a meet and greet.

609
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And there would be only like one room with a working head.

610
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
So when Lindsay and I went to Florida, I was like, we got to go meet the Mickey with the talking head.

611
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
So we went in there and they bring us into the room, one of the rooms.

612
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
And you can see the other rooms.

613
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
They don't want you to know.

614
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Of course, there's multiple Mickey.

615
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
So we went into one of the rooms and he didn't talk.

616
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
And I was deflated and confused.

617
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
And then we went to City Hall so I could complain.

618
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:47,000
And they were like, well, Mickey isn't always feeling so talkative.

619
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
He's not always like because they wouldn't say process.

620
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I get it.

621
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
They wouldn't say it because they can't advertise that he talks.

622
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
But I knew it because I was looking at YouTube videos.

623
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
And then they're like, just go in and you can maybe ask if Mickey's feeling talkative today.

624
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,000
So I had to go and do like a weird secret secret like word like Mickey talking to them.

625
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And they're like, maybe you're a grown ass man.

626
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Like, it's so weird.

627
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
That's like something they would tell a child.

628
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Like, why wouldn't they just say like, oh, no, I think it's out today.

629
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Like, you know what I mean?

630
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
The jaw is not working.

631
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Why wouldn't it just be adult to adult?

632
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And so they gave you an answer that they would give a five year old.

633
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Well, it is an adult who made a trip to City Hall to complain about this issue.

634
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
You just breeze past that.

635
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Anyway, I'm sure this won't come back.

636
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I'm going to finish the story.

637
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:41,000
No, but he's a grown ass man who's paid his hard earned dollar to see Mickey say like, thanks for coming to my magic show.

638
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Speaking of rides and going to City Hall, my dad actually lost his keys on Indiana Jones.

639
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Closing. Oh, no. Oh, my God. Yeah.

640
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Yeah. And they found them.

641
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I have no idea how I think like because they had to turn on all the lights.

642
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
They actually found it like pretty quickly, but it was and we didn't realize until it was a mass exodus.

643
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Everybody was leaving and I was like 11 trying to find my dad and he was like, oh, crap.

644
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
And he like ran off towards Indiana Jones and had to run after him.

645
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
He's not the best dad.

646
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Oh, no.

647
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
But they like turned on all the lights and found it, which if y'all listeners know, Indiana Jones is like the boss.

648
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Indiana Jones is like the bumpiest ride, darkest.

649
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Like it's insane to even imagine losing something in it.

650
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Yeah, I would assume maybe, like, you know, if it was on the ride, the ride vehicle, obviously the easiest.

651
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
But if it like got lost in the snakes, that would be harder to find.

652
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I don't. Yeah.

653
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Especially if it was a snake patterned keychain.

654
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Yeah. Yeah.

655
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
So, yeah, I left. I left the recorder.

656
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Remember, I left an audio recorder the day the Star Wars opened.

657
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I left it on the ride.

658
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Which almost blew our big interview with Lentesta.

659
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Yeah, we had a big interview set up with theme park podcast or Lentesta that day and it would have been ruined if I had left this.

660
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
But they found it quickly.

661
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,000
So there must be I'm assuming that these people just know very fast because they also other rides they shut down.

662
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Other rides they shut down if stuff falls like immediately.

663
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Did you put it in the pouch? Is that where it was?

664
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I think it was in my pocket and I was worried because I had bought that Rex up there and I had it on the ride and I was too preoccupied with the Rex to make sure he didn't get hurt.

665
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
We both had giant Rex boxes on our laps on the bumpiest ride.

666
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Surely we have to go on this ride.

667
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Yeah.

668
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
There's no other way.

669
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I was like, well, they'll let us just hold it with at the exit.

670
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
And they were like, no, put it on the ride with you.

671
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
It'll be fine.

672
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
And I was so nervous.

673
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Do you have rides anyone that you were the most nervous about losing things on?

674
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Because I'll put on Space Mountain and I put things in the pouch.

675
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
But then I'll leave like keys or wallet.

676
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
And then still I find myself the whole ride then like shoving hands in for extra.

677
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
It still just feels precarious to me.

678
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Yeah, I that one I agree on.

679
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I'm trying to think the worst.

680
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I'm sure I said this already.

681
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:04,000
There's a ride at knots called Hang Time where you go up 90 degrees and you're supposed to take your stuff out of your pockets.

682
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
And I didn't like a fucking idiot.

683
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
And I had my phone in my back pocket.

684
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Because I thought it would be better, which is also the dumbest thing you could possibly do.

685
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
It's much better for what's here.

686
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
And I could just put my hand in my pocket to hold it.

687
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
It's like so I'm like trying to like put my weight.

688
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I'm distributing my weight as I'm 90 degrees.

689
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
And that's by far the most stressful.

690
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Like I hope I don't lose something.

691
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Well, we and you're talking about knots when we we did that wooden coaster ghost rider.

692
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I thought my glasses were going to fly off my head, which usually on wooden roller coasters, I can leave them on and it's fine.

693
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,000
But like it was the most bumpy maybe ride I've ever been on.

694
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:52,000
And I am like holding this holding them onto the sides of my head because I like yeah, just didn't want to lose them.

695
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Yeah, it's weird.

696
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Drive back to L.A.

697
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
It's weird that doesn't happen more.

698
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I guess it's just like like normal force.

699
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Just everything stays put for the most part.

700
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
But it does feel like how would that not happen once a ride?

701
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
You hit in the face with someone's keys.

702
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Yeah, I have been on Space Mountain a few times.

703
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Where someone has held up their giant ass Android phone to videotape it.

704
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:19,000
And they at least once someone is going, oh, it's really dark in there.

705
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
And it's like, yeah, no shit.

706
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I swear it got darker, though, because I think when I was younger, they had a little bit more.

707
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Do you all remember that?

708
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Wasn't there more lights or more stars or something?

709
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I think the star lights are they just completely turned everything out.

710
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Yeah, yeah, I think you might be right.

711
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Yeah, it does feel like the whole thing about Space Mountain is when you get up there, you're supposed to be like, oh, my goodness, the majesty of space.

712
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
And then you're like, oh, all the stars look pretty dim.

713
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Yeah, they are.

714
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Yeah, they're all barely see them.

715
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Yeah.

716
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
And then there's like a giant asteroid in there, but it's not lit up.

717
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
And if you look sort of your left when you're coming up, it's there, but it's not lit.

718
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
So I don't know if they were like they're like worried it's going to break the illusion that you're in space.

719
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
But they do that with the Star Wars overlay.

720
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
So I don't know.

721
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Also, somebody tell us that we know a gentleman who works around Space Mountain.

722
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
That's all I'll say.

723
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Yeah, he wants to tweet at us and let us know about the dimness, the dimness.

724
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
And if it's always been like that or that's just our memory, he knows who he is.

725
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Well, I also wanted to say I watched on the Imagineering.

726
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I don't know if you all watched any of that.

727
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Yeah, Episode five is where they talk about Peter Pan.

728
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
And for anyone that wants to learn more about the ride as well.

729
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:39,000
And I guess that they so when they put the water in, like a duck family found their way into there.

730
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
And they said like a mom and her ducklings and they like pooped everywhere.

731
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:53,000
And then I started to think like, oh, my God, like, does that happen in pirates or like I'm just really concerned for the animals that like you're not like there's just not random ducks that find their way into the water.

732
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Yeah. How do you how do you make sure that that doesn't happen?

733
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Yeah, it seems like with pirates, it's a little more tucked away, I guess.

734
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I guess it's not really I mean, I guess you could get a duck could easily fly into the Peter into pirates pretty much any ride.

735
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Yeah, that's interesting.

736
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I wonder I feel like I've never seen a real animal on pirates.

737
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
But I'm like deep.

738
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Yeah, definitely.

739
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
All the way in like deep into the ride.

740
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
That would be really weird.

741
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:27,000
But yeah, you would think does Disney have a system for like keeping a bird from flying into Space Mountain and making a nest?

742
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
No.

743
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Like Fabio in us in the dark.

744
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Have you seen that new story?

745
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Yes, where he killed a bird with his face.

746
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Yeah, his face was so beautiful.

747
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
It killed the bird.

748
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
It died before it hit him.

749
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
The bird had a heart attack from the beauty.

750
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
The glow.

751
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
We've also promised we're going to do a full episode on that incident.

752
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Oh, yeah, that's I was trying to remember what episode idea came out of the other roller coaster where a bird got demolished.

753
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
That's right.

754
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Fabio coming soon.

755
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Yeah.

756
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Yes, please.

757
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Let's do that.

758
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
So, yeah, that's a good question.

759
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I'm sure they have all these different things.

760
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
There's like a secret like ways that snipers take the animal out.

761
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Yeah, you're right.

762
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
That is that is a fun little snippet of the imaginary story.

763
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:24,000
And it shows you it kind of goes behind the scenes in the like the little redo's they've done the plus ups they've done into Peter Pan recently, which are very delightful.

764
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I think we can all agree.

765
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Yeah, so because they've done a couple different big updates of the ride since it's opened.

766
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
California.

767
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I was going to say when it opened in 1955, they had it.

768
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
You were you were Peter Pan.

769
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
You were supposed to be Peter Pan.

770
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
And then they didn't.

771
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,000
So but when people came out, they didn't understand why Peter Pan wasn't in the ride.

772
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Yes.

773
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
It was like, oh, because that's you.

774
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
OK, never mind.

775
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
We should just put him in the ride.

776
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Which it's the end.

777
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
And the same problem with Snow White and the same problem with Mr. Toad.

778
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,000
And it's weird that they had to like overcome this big like storytelling.

779
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
This is how new what they were doing was.

780
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
They didn't realize like, boy, we are like not connecting with our audience on this major issue.

781
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I get the idea in theory.

782
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Like, wouldn't it be cool that you're the character?

783
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
But it's not like they were like that person was working on the ride wasn't like, all right, now imagine you're Peter Pan.

784
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Go like you didn't get any sort of like hint that that was the case.

785
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
So you were seeing stuff from the movie and you were like, well, I'm in a pirate ship.

786
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I'm not flying.

787
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I don't have the hat on.

788
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
That's not what Peter did.

789
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
He didn't fly around a little pirate ship.

790
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Right. Exactly.

791
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
If they strapped you in with a harness and then they put the hat on you, I think people would have figured it out.

792
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Or even if these people looked at you and were like, Peter, help me.

793
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
You know, yes.

794
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Yeah, that's good.

795
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Yes. Peter.

796
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Well, Peter's because there's multiple people on the ride and also Peter and Peter.

797
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Peter.

798
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Everything.

799
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Just like Santa Claus.

800
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
You're Peter's helper.

801
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Yes.

802
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
That would be good, too.

803
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:05,000
They also hadn't figured out how to give you missions back then, because nowadays it'd be like Peter.

804
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Peter, Princess Tiger Lily has a mission for you.

805
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I don't like those rides.

806
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
They get me too stressed out.

807
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Like collaborative rides and things where you like people need you for things.

808
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I'm like, no, I just want to sit here and enjoy.

809
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Oh, too much.

810
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
What do you put in that category?

811
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Like the Millennium Falcon, whatever.

812
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Like any teamwork stuff?

813
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
No.

814
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Yeah.

815
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
It's not what I signed up for.

816
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
You would just like to be having a nice time in the cockpit.

817
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Yeah.

818
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
You don't want to have to push any buttons.

819
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I mean, these don't assign me anything.

820
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:41,000
But even the idea of it like Optimus Prime needs you to do stuff, you don't really have anything to do.

821
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Do you feel the stress even that he kind of...

822
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I don't have to push anything.

823
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
It's just a give work.

824
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
The only thing I can barely handle is astro blasters.

825
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,000
But even then, my person next to me is always looking at mine to make sure that they're better than me and they are.

826
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:02,000
And so I'm just like, this is not why I came to Disneyland to be reminded that I'm inadequate.

827
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
It's so rude.

828
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
To give your hands a rest.

829
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I think you just don't want to be a working machine.

830
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I just get stressed out when numbers are involved and like...

831
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Toy Story as well?

832
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Yeah, that's what I mean. Astro blasters.

833
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Well, there's the other Toy Story one too.

834
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
It's also, it's at California Adventure.

835
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
It's like you have to pull a pull string.

836
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I don't know if I've heard of that one.

837
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Well, then you would hate it.

838
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
It's like a 3D game.

839
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,000
You have to shoot rings at like a screen and your wrist just kills by the end of it.

840
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
You truly, it really hurts the hand.

841
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
So yeah, stay away.

842
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
There's no reason. You don't need that stress in your life.

843
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
We just came out hard against that right.

844
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
And you know what? And listeners, stay away.

845
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
And we're never going to do it on the show.

846
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I don't think it's nice.

847
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
No, no, no. We're not.

848
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
We're signing now.

849
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Toy Story made.

850
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
It's like an old fashioned carnival.

851
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
No, you're crazy.

852
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Yeah, you can do that episode alone, Jason.

853
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
All right.

854
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
He just sits too straight out.

855
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Carnivals are first.

856
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,000
The pull string as seen on many toys, including Woody himself.

857
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Peter Pan.

858
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
We're jumping all around here.

859
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Peter Pan, though, is the first Disney ride I go on as a little kid and like.

860
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I try Mr. Toad.

861
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I try Snow White.

862
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
They scare the shit out of me.

863
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Both of them.

864
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I'm probably like, I'm always forgetting when we went five.

865
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I'm probably like five or six.

866
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Won't open my eyes.

867
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I go on Peter Pan.

868
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
It took forever because it always has and it always will.

869
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
And I loved it.

870
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I thought it was the greatest thing and want to do it again.

871
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
And my mom was like, the line is too long.

872
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
It is.

873
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Cannot do it again.

874
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
We have other things to go do.

875
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
It's rough.

876
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
My favorite is flying over London.

877
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Like that to me is what makes the ride so special.

878
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I think the other elements I can like give or take, like, you know, whatever.

879
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,000
But like that and having the clock tower, Big Ben and have like all the all the little things.

880
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
That they have there.

881
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I thought was so cool.

882
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I think it's a really wonderful scene and it's the scene that has changed the least since the ride opened.

883
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:20,000
And I think with good reason because like because you get it's a certainly at that time, like probably the biggest kind of set piece scene that any had been ever done in any ride.

884
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I would think because you're in there for so long and you go in and then see it from a different way.

885
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:38,000
It's almost like a mini version of one of those like it's it's the precursor to the big Indiana Jones Mara room, the main temple or the at at room in Rise of the Resistance.

886
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Like the big reveal.

887
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Yeah.

888
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Yeah.

889
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
You're going to be in here for a little while and you can look around and see things from different perspectives.

890
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
It's so great.

891
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
But done differently in all of the international version.

892
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Like this this ride is duplicated in many parks.

893
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
All of them except Hong Kong.

894
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
All of them except Hong Kong.

895
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Poor Hong Kong got shafted.

896
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
But all a little different.

897
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Like the Florida London much longer but not necessarily more successful I think than Disneyland.

898
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Has a little bit longer of a lead up.

899
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
You see Nana.

900
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
You see like the alleyway.

901
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
You see like.

902
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Oh yeah.

903
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
It's just the scale is a lot bigger in Florida.

904
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
But I don't I wouldn't necessarily say it's a better ride.

905
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
It seems like Shanghai though which was built in 2016.

906
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Like they went all out on the Shanghai one.

907
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
It was really good.

908
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Yes.

909
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I did a ride there and it's a little hard to tell from those but it is long.

910
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Yeah.

911
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Very long which they've lengthened the Disney one the Disneyland one over the years.

912
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,000
That's a pretty like sizable experience which one of these is the longest do we think.

913
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
That's a question.

914
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Mr. Toad feels long.

915
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Alice feels long.

916
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Well Mr. Toad and well I guess they all kind of do.

917
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
They end so abruptly.

918
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Yeah.

919
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
It's like you turn a corner and you're like back in the sunlight.

920
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
As a person like telling you to get off.

921
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
It's insane.

922
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Yeah.

923
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
What's the one that is it's we did an episode about it and yet I don't remember offhand.

924
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:12,000
One of the Snow White iterations ends where the witch is struck by lightning and then you're just outside like happily ever after.

925
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Like there's barely time for a.

926
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
There's one here and they're changing it now.

927
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:26,000
It's down for refurb and it's not going to be just the weird one where like the dwarves are on the mountain and she's about to boulder them to death and she gets struck and dies and then you're outside.

928
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
And that's the end of the ride.

929
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:33,000
So in the wind in the willows did he just die and go to hell and that was it because that's the ride.

930
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I don't know.

931
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
He just goes to hell and then that's it and you come back out.

932
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Okay.

933
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
In the movie.

934
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
It doesn't end with him in hell.

935
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
That's the end of a film.

936
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
That's pretty nuts.

937
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Well I didn't even realize what happened until I was older and then I was like oh we were in hell and then you're just like back with the workers again like telling you to get off and I'm like what the heck.

938
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
There was no other scene after this.

939
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Yeah that's the weird that is that for no other reason I guess I love toad but but the idea that you're putting kids thousands of kids every day you're sending them through hell not even giving them some sort of a resolution like it's going to be okay.

940
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
You're in hell but it's fine or like you will get out of hell and go to heaven.

941
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
You're sending them through that.

942
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,000
That is one of the weirdest most insane things that is still happening on a daily basis.

943
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I think it's a PSA for drunk driving because that's what happens.

944
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:38,000
He goes and gets drunk at the bar and then he drives and he goes to court he like kills somebody or whatever he goes to court he gets sentenced he goes to hell and then you're back out and you you're getting off the ride.

945
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Two of the dark rides are like morality tales.

946
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Pinocchio is the same way.

947
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Yeah.

948
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Don't be an actor.

949
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Don't be an actor.

950
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
And also no drinking and no cigars.

951
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Right.

952
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Yeah.

953
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
You'll become a donkey.

954
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I didn't put the drunk part together.

955
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
That is true.

956
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,000
You go into the saloon literally old timey man spinning beers.

957
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Spinning.

958
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Presumably you grab one narratively.

959
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
You like crash your car you're driving all crazy.

960
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
How many people die on that train that you hit?

961
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:25,000
If the train derails that's like hundreds of people and if it's not a freight train if that's a passenger train that Mr. Toad might be in for that might be he daily when on that ride kills hundreds of people.

962
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,000
It's him it's Hitler it's like who else is all in hell together.

963
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Mr. Toad.

964
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Mr. Toad and all of the.

965
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Technically killed hundreds of thousands of people.

966
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Mr. Toad is genocidal you could say in a lot yeah in a lot of ways because of just the infinite nature of the ride.

967
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,000
A rich man who thinks the law does not apply to him.

968
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Oh this Toad hopefully they keep that forever.

969
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Yeah that's the last if they'd had their way if there was a little more room they would have built a final room of hell where you see a bunch of celebrity.

970
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Well.

971
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Hitler at the time in the 50s who would have been the most on the wall would have probably put in a bunch you know any like commies who died recently Trumbo.

972
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Trumbo.

973
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
And you'll go to a scene and see Trumbo in hell.

974
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
In his bathtub.

975
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
But it's filled with fire.

976
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Trumbo and a bathtub full of fire.

977
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Okay you love this ride very much because is the line a daunting.

978
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Do you still make a point of getting through the line to get on it if you're going to the park or is the line too daunting to consider it.

979
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Well so my it's one of my top favorite rides.

980
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:55,000
However like you were saying the ride that you would get to in the morning like first thing you go to for me even though it has a fast pass is actually Indiana Jones on just the sheer fact that it always breaks down.

981
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:05,000
So when I'm taking someone I'm always like you have to get on Indian Jones I swear by lunchtime it'll break down and then like by lunchtime it breaks down and then I'm like see aren't you glad we did it.

982
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:11,000
And I'm a pass holder so like I'm there you know so enough to know that that happens.

983
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
It's not just whenever I'm there.

984
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
But yeah the line can be super daunting that's why.

985
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Okay so I went last year on Valentine's Day and it was like raining and that was great I love going when it rains because then you know that's the best time to get on all these rides.

986
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,000
But yeah I think it's really sweet it's crazy to me that everyone else still loves it so much too.

987
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
It's one of their most popular rides ever.

988
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:52,000
It's weird that it's never gone and it's not like they had to do those plus ups and digital effects to pump some life into the thing like it was a mega line always and still is after and yeah yeah it's just it's pretty eternal.

989
00:45:52,000 --> 00:46:03,000
It is also low capacity when you talk about like riders like it gets through like very little it's hard to load and unload it's not as easy as some of the other rides.

990
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Did anyone see the there's a yesterworld video.

991
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I of course watched the yesterworld video explaining.

992
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:19,000
With a chart of what loads the does anyone want to guess if you didn't see it what is the low in Disneyland proper the worst the lowest capacity.

993
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Right.

994
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Right.

995
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
You have an offhand.

996
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Is it.

997
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Oh is it the Astro Orbiter.

998
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
No no amazingly.

999
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Is it.

1000
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
What is now guardians.

1001
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
No I don't think so.

1002
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Those are pretty big rooms.

1003
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
But those are only two elevator shafts right.

1004
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
There's three elevators for guardians.

1005
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Okay.

1006
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
I'm actually blanking now what it said I saw the list though.

1007
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
It's not you wouldn't necessarily know offhand but apparently.

1008
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Oh no nevermind.

1009
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I'm just gonna keep guessing.

1010
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Is it storybook.

1011
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
No.

1012
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Casey Jr.

1013
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Is number two because there's only the one train.

1014
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
And you just got to wait for it.

1015
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
That makes sense.

1016
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
The arrows are pretty big.

1017
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Oh oh.

1018
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Chippendales rescue.

1019
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
The gadgets go coaster.

1020
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:13,000
No that actually that feels like it could be I think there's like such the lines aren't that big ever.

1021
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
It only is one coaster though.

1022
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Yeah.

1023
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Yeah.

1024
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
I guess anything where that's the case is kind of.

1025
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Well reveal it.

1026
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Roger Rabbit's cartoon spin.

1027
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Apparently.

1028
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Wow.

1029
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Yeah.

1030
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Really.

1031
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Yeah.

1032
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Part of it.

1033
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
And I get that doesn't feel right.

1034
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
No.

1035
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Send a lot of cars through.

1036
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
But that line is always crazy.

1037
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I certainly complain about that line.

1038
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Very claustrophobic.

1039
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:43,000
I don't get claustrophobic easily but I'd say the the queue for Peter Pan in the queue.

1040
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Oh yeah.

1041
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
For Roger Rabbit.

1042
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Very claustrophobic and Roger Rabbit a lot more themed.

1043
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
I will give it that.

1044
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Still a better line.

1045
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Is this the worst line.

1046
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
I mean there's murals.

1047
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
There's murals inside.

1048
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
There are murals.

1049
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
But it is open air.

1050
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
But there's really nothing.

1051
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Yeah.

1052
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,000
I will give the advantage to Matterhorn because of the beautiful wood carving.

1053
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Yeah.

1054
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
OK.

1055
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
That's good.

1056
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:14,000
And then Snow White's queue has the like the like they were wishing well outside.

1057
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Or no they have the thing inside where people throw money which is weird.

1058
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
But like there's a little bit of theming there.

1059
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I think anything with landmarks it's the same way that like a long drive where there's that funny billboard that you know weird thing to look at on the side of the road that abandoned water park or whatever it is.

1060
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:38,000
But if it's a long drive that's just like flat land nothing for miles and miles.

1061
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
And that's kind of what this line is.

1062
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
So you're going to dock at points.

1063
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Maybe.

1064
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:48,000
I think maybe just yeah because like even you're like mentally in Snow White like a guy passed the Wells and I'm at this point.

1065
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
It is just Peter Pan is a grid.

1066
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
That's all it is.

1067
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Here's the one thing I'll say about it and maybe you shouldn't count it in its favor because it's sort of inadvertent.

1068
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,000
But it's one of the best places to see the evil Maleficent Queen.

1069
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
That little secret.

1070
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
When she kind of opens the curtains and looks.

1071
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:12,000
When you're in the Peter Pan line that's when you see her the most and you go look at the Queen is going to be there.

1072
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I love the castle.

1073
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I love going up there and seeing Aurora.

1074
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
That is very nice.

1075
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
We've talked very little about the Sleeping Beauty diorama.

1076
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
That is their diorama.

1077
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
It's a walk through.

1078
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
It's very nice.

1079
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Yeah I totally agree.

1080
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
What else we like on the on the ride though.

1081
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:36,000
So the opening rate or you go I was just going to say I probably we're going to say something similar.

1082
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:44,000
The opening scene so you go in the you go in your little pirate ship and you go through and you start in the bedroom of the kids like in the movie.

1083
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Initially it was just like a very tiny little section with no characters and it had like I don't even think it had the shadow to start out with.

1084
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Well yeah I think that was a later.

1085
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:04,000
It was a later edition and then they like slowly plus that up over the years like they added Nana and then they added a better Nana.

1086
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Well Nana was from the original.

1087
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
I think they kept her is what they were saying.

1088
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:17,000
I think maybe in the Imagineering it was like I don't know if they kept her from the original or the 83 re enhancement the 1983 because they re enhanced it then.

1089
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Yeah the yester world video was very confused about which when update was which as well.

1090
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
So I'm not sure I know there was three got a lot more animatronics.

1091
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Yeah yes and then the so I think in 83 they had the darling kids in bed and then in this one they have them actually flying right on the wall.

1092
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Oh that was the change.

1093
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Okay that was the big change.

1094
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Yeah the last time they did something.

1095
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:48,000
But this this it's so interesting with all this stuff because most people are not insane and don't go that often.

1096
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
So anytime you go on this ride you go oh it must have always been like this.

1097
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Right.

1098
00:50:53,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I would imagine most people just go on and go yeah that's the great Peter Pan I remember but once you go through all this you're like all these little changes they've made to it over the years are great.

1099
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,000
But like they never do something crazy where you go well that was not here before.

1100
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Well your memory like is deceptive to our memories are all bad.

1101
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
We're human beings with bad memories.

1102
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:22,000
There was something we went on in Florida I forget what it is and I was like well I remember this clearly and then I had remembered the mirror image of it in my mind like.

1103
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:32,000
You leave the station and you go left and whatever this was you went right and I was like oh my god I I remembered the details of this ride but I flipped it in my own memory.

1104
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
I mean that happens a lot.

1105
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I incepted myself.

1106
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I memory hold.

1107
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
It's your Peter Pan set pieces.

1108
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
It is tethered yeah you're tethered.

1109
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,000
You're tethered went in and you never came out.

1110
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
I thought this ride was right side up but it's upside down.

1111
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Nope.

1112
00:51:50,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Someone in planet this memory of Peter and the Native Americans doing a full musical sequence wearing questionable outfit changes.

1113
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
This can't be real.

1114
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
This can't be real.

1115
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
No.

1116
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Maybe it hasn't happened yet.

1117
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Oh no.

1118
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
I don't know what Tenet is about.

1119
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Do we know?

1120
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Well what?

1121
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
That's the new Christopher Nolan movie.

1122
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Oh yeah.

1123
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Oh I don't know.

1124
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
No.

1125
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
I don't know either.

1126
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
But like stuff we might not know after we've watched it.

1127
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I was like I was thinking like oh Tenet is what they say in the movie.

1128
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
They say no they say wait for the kick.

1129
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Tenet is the new movie you're saying.

1130
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Yeah Tenet is the new movie where they show like a 10 minute clip.

1131
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Didn't you see the 10 minute clip when we went to see a movie at IMAX.

1132
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Oh I did.

1133
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I just saw the trailer.

1134
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
It's with David Washington.

1135
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Kenza Washington's son.

1136
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Oh is that right.

1137
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Yeah.

1138
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
I didn't realize it was a son.

1139
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
From Black Plainsman.

1140
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Oh yes yes yes yes.

1141
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
And then Robert Pattinson picks him up in the car.

1142
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
But yeah.

1143
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
OK so that played before Birds of Prey.

1144
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Yes.

1145
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
What I saw last night or the night before.

1146
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
And I was literally looking I'm like where does Harley come in.

1147
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Like I had no idea because they just started it.

1148
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I really thought it was the movie.

1149
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
And I'm like OK this is very guy heavy but that's chill.

1150
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Like it was all men all SWAT men all and I'm like OK so they're going to break it.

1151
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
This is going to be a social commentary on something.

1152
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,000
And they played like yeah the first 10 minutes so you really think that this is the movie.

1153
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,000
And then it was and then it ended and it was like Tenet coming out blah blah blah.

1154
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
And I was like what the heck.

1155
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Wow.

1156
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Like why are there like major movie stars in this who I didn't know were in Birds of Prey.

1157
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Yeah.

1158
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
No true.

1159
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
I was like they didn't say Robert Pattinson but I know he's the new Batman.

1160
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
This is weird.

1161
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Anyways.

1162
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,000
That must honestly happen a lot because again they don't they do it without warning.

1163
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
They do not tell you.

1164
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Yeah.

1165
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
So like you're hearing like you're like the movie looked like a little more like a fun

1166
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
look like it maybe had like pop songs or something in it.

1167
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
And I'm just hearing a droning Hans Zimmer score.

1168
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:53,000
This is a weird droning Hans Zimmer Birds of Prey would I think make a very different

1169
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
movie.

1170
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Christopher Nolan Christopher Nolan's Birds of Prey Hans Zimmer doing the score.

1171
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:04,000
It's mostly dudes Harley Quinn's in it for like a couple scenes.

1172
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Yeah.

1173
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,000
So that first scene when you're in the in the bedroom has been so updated over which is

1174
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
just like thinking about it.

1175
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
You're like wow it's so it is really good now.

1176
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:18,000
But it used to just be like a little like three feet of room when people started out.

1177
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:24,000
And I don't think you started from London rooftops in the like right after the mural

1178
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
either.

1179
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Yeah.

1180
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
I think it was just mural and then you're in a empty bedroom and then you're flying

1181
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
and that's always been good.

1182
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:37,000
But the first year the launch essentially not like launch coasters but the the before

1183
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
the big scene.

1184
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Yeah it was kind of lame.

1185
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I think that.

1186
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Sorry.

1187
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
I'm done.

1188
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Oh OK.

1189
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
That was that ride mechanism.

1190
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:51,000
The ride you know you being above everything you're going over everything and hanging

1191
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
down.

1192
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
I think that is a big part of the appeal.

1193
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:01,000
I know my dad is one of his favorite rides and I'm sure like growing up with with Peter

1194
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Pan probably being re-released a million times because they always re-released their movies.

1195
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
You mean it doesn't stay in the vault.

1196
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
It doesn't stay in the.

1197
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Well it did and then they bring it down to the vault for a very short time and then they

1198
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
aired some of them.

1199
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
I want to say that I love Disney.

1200
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:21,000
They've always been really great to me and so I just I'm a lot I love them and they know

1201
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
that.

1202
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Oh yeah.

1203
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
You're just teasing like a family.

1204
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,000
We really should have brought up you're you have a you're in Wreck-It Ralph 2.

1205
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Is that correct.

1206
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Yes.

1207
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Yeah.

1208
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
I'm in a Walt Disney Animation.

1209
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,000
I got to go there to their Burbank Studios.

1210
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Yeah.

1211
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
It's pretty crazy.

1212
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
They animated me.

1213
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Wow.

1214
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
And it's you.

1215
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
I play myself.

1216
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
I play myself.

1217
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I say like hey it's Danny Fernandez.

1218
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Right.

1219
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
He's in the internet and I live in the internet clearly.

1220
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Why yourself?

1221
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Because I.

1222
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
He is going viral.

1223
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
They wanted someone.

1224
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Everyone's like how did you get that?

1225
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
I'm like well they want it.

1226
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
They have actually other people in it too.

1227
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Like they have big gamers like people that are big big in the online space and so all

1228
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
those years paid off for me.

1229
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Yeah.

1230
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
But yeah anyways they animated me.

1231
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:11,000
They watched way too many of my videos because they like the way that I talk with my hands

1232
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
and it's just too much.

1233
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Wait a minute.

1234
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
They.

1235
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
It's honestly aggressively like me.

1236
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Well yeah were you then because I'm like I'm like afraid of knowing what an impression

1237
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,000
of me is like let alone this let alone people studying my body language.

1238
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Did it like freak you out a little bit.

1239
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Well okay so when they sent it to me she wasn't finished.

1240
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Okay.

1241
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
So she just looked like a sim.

1242
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
So I was like thanks.

1243
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
You know I was just like she didn't even really look like me.

1244
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
She just kind of looked like whatever game character you get in the beginning before it's

1245
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
been like stylized.

1246
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
The creative player default.

1247
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Yeah yeah and that's just like their placeholder and so they didn't actually show.

1248
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,000
I was hosting the Ralph panel at New York Comic Con and that's when I saw her was with

1249
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
everyone else in the room.

1250
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Wow.

1251
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Because they were showing like the some of the scenes.

1252
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
So I was like oh my gosh she's so pretty.

1253
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,000
They gave me what I call Moana hair which is like when you watch Moana it's like the

1254
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,000
detail of her hair like each like strand moves.

1255
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Wow.

1256
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:13,000
And so they had they had that yeah all the Disney princesses were in it and then I hosted

1257
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
a panel with them also at New York Comic Con.

1258
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:22,000
It was like the original Pedro Herra who's Belle and Jodie Benton who's Ariel and.

1259
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Oh I didn't know this.

1260
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Anika Nani Rose.

1261
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
You had a panel with all of these people.

1262
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Yeah.

1263
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Wow.

1264
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
And then I was like I'm not going to cry.

1265
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
There was like a thousand people there.

1266
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
I'm like I'm not going to cry I'm not going to cry.

1267
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:38,000
But Anika cried because she was the first black Disney princess and then I started bawling

1268
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
and then yeah I don't even remember.

1269
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:46,000
How far back did this go who was like the oldest school.

1270
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Well okay so that would be Snow White right.

1271
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
But.

1272
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
It's not the original.

1273
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Yeah.

1274
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:56,000
And so but we did have the woman who took over for Cinderella who's actually been voicing

1275
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
her the last like 25 years.

1276
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Wow.

1277
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
You know some of those original ones.

1278
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:03,000
So I think the last person alive would be Jodie Benton who's Ariel.

1279
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Okay sure.

1280
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Yeah.

1281
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Most original.

1282
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Wow.

1283
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
What a lineup.

1284
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
That's crazy.

1285
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,000
All of that is crazy and it's also in the movie because there's a scene in Reggae Ralph

1286
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
too where they're all the princesses are hanging out.

1287
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:19,000
You're like part of continuity though now with the princess you know what I mean.

1288
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Like if it was a different movie where maybe sort of oh this is in a different like little

1289
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
pocket Disney universe but it feels like now you're you are canon.

1290
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Yeah you are.

1291
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Isn't that wild.

1292
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
It's very wild.

1293
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Yeah.

1294
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
But again it's you it's not a character.

1295
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
No.

1296
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
You are.

1297
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,000
That's what's even crazier is like there are people in it and but they're playing other

1298
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,000
people and I'm they literally I say like hey I'm Danny Fernandez.

1299
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Welcome to BuzzTube or whatever it is that they're making fun.

1300
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
It was like BuzzFeed and YouTube.

1301
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Right.

1302
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
But I went over to Hector Navarro.

1303
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
I don't know if you know Hector Navarro.

1304
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:55,000
I went over to his place and he when he was in Japan bought a Japanese version of Wreck-It Ralph.

1305
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:00,000
And so he put it in for me and it's my character speaking Spanish but she said I mean Spanish.

1306
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:05,000
There is that version my character speaking Japanese but she says Danny.

1307
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:10,000
And so I was like oh my gosh like this woman also played me Danny.

1308
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,000
So people play you yourself.

1309
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Yeah.

1310
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Localization.

1311
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
It's not a language localization version.

1312
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:24,000
It is crazy because like there's no like you know famous very famous actors have been characters but they haven't been themselves.

1313
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Yeah.

1314
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:30,000
It's never been like I don't know why I first saw Mel Gibson but that was the first name that popped into my head.

1315
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
But he was John Smith.

1316
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Uh huh.

1317
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
He was not Mel Gibson in the Pocahontas.

1318
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
I think he has.

1319
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Oh yeah.

1320
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
You think Mel Gibson has been in a cartoon himself.

1321
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
No hasn't he.

1322
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Was he on Family Guy.

1323
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
People have.

1324
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
The Simpsons.

1325
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Oh it is the Simpsons.

1326
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Oh yeah.

1327
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
But I'm saying in Disney.

1328
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Nobody's been in a fit yeah.

1329
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
There's be rare opportunity.

1330
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,000
There's not a lot of modern films set in modern times.

1331
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Right.

1332
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Yeah.

1333
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Right.

1334
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
It's almost one of the only movies you'd be able to do that.

1335
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:02,000
So I'm really lucky that I got to do that because I don't know another movie you know that would take place in the internet that you would get to be yourself.

1336
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
They also had you know like Grumpy Cat another.

1337
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Sure.

1338
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Grumpy Cat was also themselves.

1339
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Sure.

1340
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
They had the real Grumpy Cat.

1341
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Sure.

1342
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
They had a real meow.

1343
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
I don't know.

1344
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:18,000
But like if there's a Disney Plus show about Powerline and they're having like somebody interview Powerline.

1345
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:25,000
I'm just saying they could go back in the archives and be like well do we have a character in one of these movies that could interview or talk or it could be you.

1346
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Do we have any podcasters.

1347
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Yeah.

1348
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Yeah.

1349
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
That could go and do it.

1350
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Yes.

1351
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Is there any podcasting in a Disney movie yet.

1352
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Oh.

1353
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
I don't know.

1354
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
That would have been it.

1355
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Maybe an Onward.

1356
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Maybe there's podcasting.

1357
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
They have a long journey apparently.

1358
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
It seems like an Onward.

1359
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
It's like college guys right.

1360
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Yeah.

1361
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
They're Marin fans.

1362
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
They're Marin fans.

1363
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Sure Rogan.

1364
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Someone grew up with like Lion King and watching all those VHS's as they were like sketching you.

1365
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Did you.

1366
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Because I feel like all I would think about is like those pre-rolls on the VHS's where they're like coming the summer of 1993.

1367
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Where they show the animals drawing a real lion but it's just they're doing it to you.

1368
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
They're like sitting there.

1369
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:18,000
I think the thing that weird and I ended up you know becoming friends with the directors and the animators and like I know all the storyboard artists.

1370
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Josie Trinidad who's actually now directing a Walt Disney Animation movie.

1371
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,000
She was also lead storyboard artist on Zootopia.

1372
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,000
But yeah I mean I got to know these people and also like hosting panels with them.

1373
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:37,000
But the weird the thing that weirded me out was the idea that a group of animators were sitting there all together watching videos of me like that made me feel weird.

1374
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Yeah.

1375
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
You know it's just super self conscious.

1376
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Like a lion as if you were.

1377
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Yeah.

1378
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Yes a subject.

1379
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:49,000
And it's like the way that like my jaw moves and which is kind of like weird.

1380
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
I mean the same thing for Sarah Silverman though.

1381
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:56,000
She has like weird the way that she talks is very specific the way that she moves her mouth is really specific.

1382
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:02,000
And so both both she looked like her character and John C. Reilly looks like his character you know.

1383
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:07,000
So but it's still weird thinking that like someone sat and like which videos did they watch.

1384
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Yeah.

1385
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:16,000
And if someone was like me a nerdist or like were they ones where I wasn't funny or like had a bad take on something or whatever.

1386
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,000
You know what I mean.

1387
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Yeah.

1388
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Like if someone if two animators were arguing like someone's having a bad day that's going like she doesn't fucking do that.

1389
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Yeah.

1390
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Would you do like she doesn't do that.

1391
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Do your research.

1392
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Come on man.

1393
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
I need some air.

1394
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Well I am calling on anyone who's working on anything with Disney Plus to put your character of yourself in another Disney Plus thing.

1395
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Yeah.

1396
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Because that would make it a runner.

1397
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:47,000
I feel like well Alan Tudyk I forgot I think his first appearance was in the original.

1398
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
He played King Candy in the original Ralph.

1399
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,000
And then after that he's been in like every one.

1400
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
He was like the chicken in Moana.

1401
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
He was he was knows more in Wreck-It Ralph 2.

1402
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
You know now he's in the Star Wars.

1403
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:04,000
And so I'm like I want to be like him and just like get into one and then you get asked to be little side characters and all of them.

1404
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Now it's a run.

1405
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
You're a rat's burger.

1406
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
You're like perennially always in there.

1407
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Like haters kind of getting there.

1408
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Maybe he's in a lot of things.

1409
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:16,000
He was in Ralph the second Ralph.

1410
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Yeah.

1411
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
And he's in that's right.

1412
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Inside I was going to call it in and out which is the Kevin Kline movie.

1413
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Inside out.

1414
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
He's one of the main characters and I feel like he's somewhere else.

1415
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
But whatever.

1416
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Yeah.

1417
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
That's great.

1418
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Yeah.

1419
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Power OK.

1420
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Power line show specifically.

1421
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
You should be in that.

1422
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
I would love it.

1423
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Yeah.

1424
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
First the first pitch that there is a full power.

1425
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:39,000
You and I just we said that that eye to eye is the best Disney song of all time.

1426
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
We agreed on that.

1427
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
I don't know if we've specifically said that.

1428
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,000
I can't immediately think of anything to counter that.

1429
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
It's like part of your world and eye to eye.

1430
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
I feel like the two best.

1431
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Yeah.

1432
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
One and two.

1433
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
One and two.

1434
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
I don't know which order but yeah.

1435
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
The two best I think.

1436
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Yeah.

1437
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
I don't know.

1438
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
I got nothing to lose.

1439
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
I'll throw it in there.

1440
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
All right.

1441
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Yep.

1442
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
And then I said I and we will never cover Toy Story Mania.

1443
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
That's right.

1444
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
It's never Jason.

1445
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,000
I'm working on my one man office.

1446
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,000
You're taking your writing notes down already.

1447
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Yeah.

1448
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
So you get back.

1449
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
You get out of the bedroom.

1450
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,000
You go over to London which they've only made like cooler and brighter.

1451
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
I was watching a side by side.

1452
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,000
There's not great archival video of the old.

1453
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
No.

1454
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Peter Pan.

1455
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
The pre 83.

1456
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Yeah.

1457
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Like for the first 20 plus years.

1458
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:32,000
You do get those in Imagineering Story has this video of the tests of it.

1459
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,000
This feels like one of the first things where you could see footage that they mocked this

1460
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:41,000
up at the Disney studios and people are just like up on a wire in an unthemed room tutting

1461
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:47,000
around and that this feels like one of the first like like imagineering feats where you

1462
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
look at it and it looks bizarre.

1463
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
People aren't supposed to be able to do that.

1464
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
We had it happen.

1465
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
They're conquering something.

1466
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,000
They're like we figured some weird thing out that we haven't done before.

1467
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,000
It's the technology is basically what I win that yester world video.

1468
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:05,000
It says it's basically like factor like what factories would use to like make a

1469
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
cart stuff around.

1470
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:12,000
So like it almost feels like it's probably the same factory or same technology that like

1471
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:17,000
you would hang a big slab of meat on and like roll it through the factory like it's like

1472
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,000
some basic stuff that cleaners.

1473
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Yeah.

1474
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Kind of like that.

1475
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
It's basically that.

1476
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Yeah.

1477
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Which is crazy.

1478
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
So they just took another technology and used it for this.

1479
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:33,000
I will say this is the only thing that's still kind of weird to me is that on this ride I'm

1480
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:37,000
always a little worried that that thing is making too much noise that the mechanism is

1481
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
making too much noise when I'm on it.

1482
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:44,000
I'm like is that going to I know it's held for 60 years but I'm still a little scared.

1483
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Now this was a big thing thought that I had when reading about all this stuff as the

1484
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:53,000
technology improves and this is a ride that we've said they've plus up a lot.

1485
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
They've done a lot to the years.

1486
01:05:54,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Could they make it quieter because you hear that you hear that.

1487
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:07,000
But then my other question so like could they make that the gears would like it quieter

1488
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:15,000
but if they do that will people you know again memory sense memory would be if they did that

1489
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:20,000
if they made it quieter would people be thrown because they are so used to you're saying

1490
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
people complain that there's not a loud gear noise.

1491
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Well I got to complain about everything but I don't think they would complain about that.

1492
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:32,000
As I was watching the footage I like five different versions of this ride I was like

1493
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:39,000
oh yeah that sound is present in all of them but it's so charming the ride is so charming

1494
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:46,000
you like I've never gone like oh that sound I've just always been like white noise until

1495
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
now you did it now.

1496
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Well as I have a podcast to have these kinds of thoughts on the one in Tokyo is quieter.

1497
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
I felt of course that's all you did it.

1498
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Tokyo is like they're all all the rides are better taken care of the Indiana Jones ride

1499
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
is smooth as can be newer.

1500
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:09,000
They are newer but also it feels like maybe they like fixes something is that little extra

1501
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:14,000
really charming about Disneyland though and I try to explain it to my friends that you

1502
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:19,000
know on the East Coast they only go to Disney World and I'm like but you just there's something

1503
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:24,000
little bit magical like it was just made with more love more like literally made by

1504
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,000
hand over at Disneyland and then when my friends would go there they're like you're right it's

1505
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
just something a little different.

1506
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:37,000
I friend of the show Zack Ryder was texting me after he had been to Disneyland and he

1507
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:42,000
lives out in Orlando and he was saying he finally had to give it up he's like fuck Disneyland

1508
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:47,000
is better like he seemed upset to have to concede that point.

1509
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I also think because that so last time I didn't even mention this I ran the Disneyland

1510
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:57,000
marathon the Disney World marathon and the Disneyland Half marathon because I was crazy

1511
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,000
in college and I just was like I can do this.

1512
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:07,000
It was because I saw in a runners world magazine that you get this huge Walt Disney the Walt

1513
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Disney Mickey statue that's at the front the middle in front of the castle you get a medallion

1514
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
of it when you do both.

1515
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:19,000
And so I ran both but anyway so last time I was at Walt when I was at Disney World there's

1516
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:23,000
so many buses you have to take to get everywhere like that I was so irritated by.

1517
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:29,000
It drove me crazy when we just went yes I really liked the skyliner this gondola thing

1518
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:35,000
that takes you around and I got that I liked a ton so then having to step down to the buses

1519
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:40,000
so I had some buzz rides that were truly patience testing.

1520
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Yeah I mean whereas with ours it's like oh I just want to go over to I'll meet you at

1521
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Guardians and it takes like 10 minutes you know from get to one end of the park to the

1522
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
end of another park or whatever.

1523
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:58,000
The trick with the buses you just have to dedicate a number of hours to studying transportation

1524
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
infrastructure and maps.

1525
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
You love riding on a bus.

1526
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:07,000
He made a point of I'm going to see how the internal like how the transportation works.

1527
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Jason said he was going to test the limits of the infrastructure.

1528
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
I got it.

1529
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Cut out the last bus of the night out of Hollywood Studios which I took a boat to.

1530
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Wow.

1531
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
You do like a bus though right.

1532
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:26,000
I like a bus yeah I like a bus okay well especially in Florida because it's so hot and the buses

1533
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
are so strongly air conditioned.

1534
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
They are sometimes a relief.

1535
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:36,000
So if you're a fan of transfers then you're not going to find that at Disneyland.

1536
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Do you recommend running those marathons?

1537
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Well if you're going to do any marathon I don't recommend running marathons but if you are

1538
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:49,000
and you're like dead set on doing it it's the best one because there's a lot to see.

1539
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:55,000
So you get to run you run through the park before it opens and there's all the characters

1540
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:00,000
out there and people stop to take pictures but like there's a line I'm like I'm not messing

1541
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
up my time.

1542
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:05,000
But there's like a lot it's like really cool and especially if you're running at Disney

1543
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:09,000
World then you do have a lot to run through you're running through all the kingdoms.

1544
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,000
It still is 26.2 miles.

1545
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,000
I think when people hear that I ran they're like oh you ran at Disney World that must

1546
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:20,000
have been you know easy and I'm like no it's still your feet moving 26.2 miles.

1547
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Still regulation.

1548
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Yeah and also you can't go like if you are running you know too slow they'll come and

1549
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:31,000
cart you because they have to eventually like open the thing up and it's like you know what

1550
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:35,000
I mean like you can't it's not even that bad but like it will catch up to you if you haven't

1551
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
trained at all.

1552
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,000
I didn't train as much as I should have so I was in a lot of pain.

1553
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,000
How do they cart like do they just are like golf cart.

1554
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Wow they're literally a cart.

1555
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Well yeah I mean like you can't you can't take all day to run it right.

1556
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,000
They give you a time limit.

1557
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Right.

1558
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Wow Jason you should do that because then you'll get the experience of running and being

1559
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
in a golf cart.

1560
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:01,000
My thing with marathons or you're hearing the harsh I mean those you do have to like

1561
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
train a bit.

1562
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
You do have to train a bit yeah.

1563
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Or like your body start to shut down.

1564
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
It will shut down.

1565
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
If you try to jump into.

1566
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Right.

1567
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,000
But I'm well I'm just saying that maybe even if you don't train they'll just golf cart you

1568
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,000
pretty quick and you'll get to take a golf cart through everything.

1569
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,000
They just give up right away.

1570
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Well they're so the Disneyland one I don't even know if they do it anymore they have

1571
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,000
different themed ones like they used to have the Tower of Terror like 10k or something.

1572
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
I did the half marathon at Disneyland.

1573
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,000
You actually ran through Angel Stadium as well because like just Disneyland proper wasn't

1574
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,000
enough.

1575
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Cool.

1576
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:39,000
But that one was only 13 only 13 mile 13.2 miles or whatever 13.1.

1577
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:43,000
And back when I was running in college I'm like anyone could get to about 10 miles without

1578
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:48,000
training like if you had to if you like if you were running for your life.

1579
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,000
But now that I'm a little bit older I'm like there's I can barely run a mile.

1580
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
I don't know.

1581
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
I like don't run anymore.

1582
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:01,000
So but that was my like I didn't really train for the half one because I already done a

1583
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:05,000
full and I was like I have enough and I still was in so much pain.

1584
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:08,000
So anyways the medals though were pretty dope.

1585
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Well yeah.

1586
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
What's the medallion.

1587
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Wait explain describe this medallion.

1588
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Yeah I'll show it to you.

1589
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,000
So I got so you get one for each one for each.

1590
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:20,000
So the marathon I got a Mickey medallion.

1591
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Some years they do a castle.

1592
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,000
You get the castle which is really cool for the half marathon.

1593
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
I got Mickey running.

1594
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
It was a medallion.

1595
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:34,000
And if you do them both in the same year it's called the coast to coast marathon.

1596
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:38,000
You get the Walt and Mickey.

1597
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Wow.

1598
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Oh it's of that.

1599
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:44,000
I wonder are these like valuable too because I feel very few people probably do both or

1600
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
do you like.

1601
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
That's really cool.

1602
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,000
That's heavy duty.

1603
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Oh yeah.

1604
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Wow.

1605
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
That's big.

1606
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
It's them.

1607
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
It's a good material.

1608
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:57,000
So you technically get three right because you get the one from Disney World you get

1609
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
the one from Disneyland and then you get the medallion.

1610
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Wow.

1611
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
How do you get those displayed.

1612
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Well me right now just in like a jewelry box but other people you can look at you know

1613
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
they have these huge ways.

1614
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:17,000
The goofy one is if you do the if you do the half on Saturday and the full on Sunday.

1615
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:22,000
I think there is and there are some weekends where you can do a 5k on Friday the half on

1616
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Saturday and the full on Sunday.

1617
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Yeah like an Iron Man.

1618
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,000
It's like if you want to kill yourself there's different metal levels and stuff.

1619
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Yeah medically that is not recommended I believe unless you are like peak physical kid like

1620
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,000
you know you have pledged your allegiance to eating a lot of.

1621
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Oh I do need to say I'll probably get kicked out but I don't care though.

1622
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:46,000
So there's a run Disney Facebook group that has like thousands of people in it.

1623
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,000
And it has the most drama all the time.

1624
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
I'm like what in the world.

1625
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:54,000
But then you think of like people that run marathons and they're probably obnoxious and

1626
01:13:54,000 --> 01:14:01,000
like suburban like parents that like well we so I'm a kinesiology major.

1627
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:05,000
That's one of the reasons why I ran it is like I was just really athletic.

1628
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:09,000
And so they had us one of the things it's exercise science one of the things one of the classes

1629
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
you have to take a sports marketing.

1630
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:15,000
And so we learned like with marketing what they market at marathons like who can afford

1631
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
to run a marathon.

1632
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
You actually have you know what I mean.

1633
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Like if you if you dissect like you're paying for airfares travel stay you're paying like

1634
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
hundreds of dollars to run right.

1635
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,000
It's not for free.

1636
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
So it was just fascinating.

1637
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,000
So then you see all of that coming together in this run Disney group of like slightly

1638
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:39,000
entitled runners who were also Disney Disney people too.

1639
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:44,000
And there's a lot of I said our Facebook group is really wonderful and and super powerful

1640
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
and super positive.

1641
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:49,000
And I sometimes you see them say which is this is nice that this group is great because

1642
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,000
I've been in other Disney groups that are not great.

1643
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Yeah.

1644
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:56,000
The baby Yoda groups I'm in turn to hell.

1645
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,000
No I shared them on Twitter.

1646
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:04,000
I'm surprised because I'm like I'm a weasel like I will share what people are posting

1647
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,000
and I share it.

1648
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,000
There's thousands of people in there.

1649
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
You also forget like what other parts of America are like.

1650
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,000
They're very like homophobic and racist.

1651
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:16,000
And and so I think baby Yoda is probably gay.

1652
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
I don't like that.

1653
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:21,000
No but there was literally when they show there was a huge thing in the baby Yoda group

1654
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:25,000
whenever they showed and I'll send you guys my thread because it's just insane.

1655
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:29,000
I was like keeping track on Twitter of like all the awful things people were saying there.

1656
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:33,000
But when they showed Pedro Pascal's face which like how did you not know it was Pedro Pascal

1657
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:38,000
like we're all speaking of like when you call people real Star Wars fans how did you not

1658
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,000
know that that was Mando.

1659
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,000
And so when he took his helmet off we were like what.

1660
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:46,000
And then somebody was like he's just a little gay looking for me.

1661
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,000
I'm not into that.

1662
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
But I mean if you are and we're like this is really home.

1663
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,000
She was like I said if you are it's OK.

1664
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
I'm like OK but it was wild.

1665
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,000
The baby Yoda groups were like they went to hell.

1666
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:04,000
And multiple there were multiple groups that all had discord.

1667
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Pro vaccination wanted an anti-vaxxer.

1668
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,000
You laugh but I'm not.

1669
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Oh another fight that sorry I could talk about this.

1670
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,000
No keep going.

1671
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:16,000
I was going to say another fight that got started was when it was like I don't have kids.

1672
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
I'd rather have baby Yoda than kids.

1673
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
And like everyone started it's just a joke.

1674
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
You know people started it.

1675
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,000
But then people that have kids were like I love my child.

1676
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
So it was like this huge fight.

1677
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:30,000
So all I did was just screenshot it and share it.

1678
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,000
I would black out names unless they were like super racist.

1679
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
And then I was like you deserve it.

1680
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,000
But in the run Disney group it's the same thing.

1681
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
It's so petty.

1682
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:45,000
So like somebody was like hey I don't really like the border for the Tower of Terror which isn't a thing anymore.

1683
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
But like I don't really like the border.

1684
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Is there another border that we can get for when you're crossing the finish line.

1685
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:55,000
And someone did the SpongeBob mean it was like is there another border that we can get with this.

1686
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,000
And I'm like you guys are so awful.

1687
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Do you have nothing better to do with your lives than like attack each other on here.

1688
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,000
That's the suburbs.

1689
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Oh wow.

1690
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Oh my God.

1691
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:13,000
I also I'm in a lot of these Facebook groups and the more if it's a really big group generally you're going to see that type of thing.

1692
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
I won't say what.

1693
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Well one of the nicer ones I'm in is the Chuck E. Cheese fan page.

1694
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Are they OK.

1695
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
They're OK.

1696
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
They're more.

1697
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
It's a much more pure Chuck E. Love.

1698
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:29,000
But the other ones I'm in are very can get very toxic very fast including my hometown's Facebook group.

1699
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
And then the Facebook group.

1700
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:40,000
And then the Facebook group that's called like Schomburg uncensored because they felt they were being censored in the main Facebook group.

1701
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Wow.

1702
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
I have one like that too.

1703
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:47,000
So I'll have to tell you from for my high school I went to in Dallas.

1704
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,000
I'll have to tell you after.

1705
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Yeah.

1706
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Sure.

1707
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Some things.

1708
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
One of the ones there was on one of the Disney related ones.

1709
01:17:53,000 --> 01:18:00,000
There was a somebody asked like hey can anyone get me into Galaxy's Edge tomorrow which is back when they were doing reservations.

1710
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,000
And it's like that is a thing to not like who's going to do that.

1711
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Right.

1712
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,000
With a stranger.

1713
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,000
So it's kind of a weird ask.

1714
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:12,000
They the people roasted this poor woman hundred comments long of like oh yeah well how are you also.

1715
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Can you call blown you my car too.

1716
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
And it's like well wait a minute.

1717
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Someone's mom who doesn't know anything.

1718
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Yeah.

1719
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Like why do you even have to like why do you have to humiliate this person on Facebook.

1720
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:29,000
It was an extra ticket like the kind you get at Staples for Raffles where it's like you hold one I'll hold one.

1721
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Like oh if I'm not there make sure you listen for my number.

1722
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Just hundreds of people lighting this poor woman up.

1723
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,000
And it's like I was just asking.

1724
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
And of course like yeah.

1725
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
OK.

1726
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,000
I just have to read.

1727
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
This is the original start of my thread.

1728
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:48,000
I said I'm in some baby Yoda groups and this is the post that got me on to the fact that there's drama because I don't pay attention.

1729
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,000
I'm not really on Facebook.

1730
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,000
It says OK let me make this very clear.

1731
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,000
I joined this group for all things baby Yoda babies pets memes etc.

1732
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:00,000
I am leaving because of all the drama and fighting surrounding babies pets etc.

1733
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,000
If you don't like it don't comment in caps.

1734
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Admins need to take more care of this group.

1735
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Tired of the drama.

1736
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:11,000
So I saw that pop up on my feet and I'm like what is happening in this baby Yoda group.

1737
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Anyone who talks about drama too much.

1738
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
I am like you are suspect.

1739
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
You are not trustworthy.

1740
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Yes you perhaps are a participant in the drama.

1741
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Perhaps one of the primary participants in the drama.

1742
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
I'm sorry I just have one more and then I'm going to put this away.

1743
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
OK so this is in the baby Yoda group.

1744
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
It literally says baby Yoda posting.

1745
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:38,000
OK baby Yoda is cool but the level of obsession this group has with him is just cringe.

1746
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,000
It has 655 comments.

1747
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Oh my god.

1748
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,000
The group is dedicated to cringe.

1749
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,000
You can't call something cringe if the whole point is cringe.

1750
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,000
It's all cringe.

1751
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
It's all cringe.

1752
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
It makes me so excited.

1753
01:19:54,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Why would liking babies real babies and liking baby Yoda be mutually exclusive.

1754
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Why do you have to pick a side between baby Yoda and babies.

1755
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Yeah no that doesn't make any sense.

1756
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:15,000
All of these groups are pressure cookers for what's every like anything that's going on in people's brains.

1757
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
And it's like it can't help but come out.

1758
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:28,000
I mean the country is a little it's we're coming off like there was a news clip recently where someone's like I voted for Amy Klobuchar because I went Eenie Meanie Miney Moe and I'm like that's nuts.

1759
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:32,000
But a large portion of the electorate does that.

1760
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Oh I like their last name like oh no.

1761
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,000
That's what it drives me.

1762
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:45,000
It drives me that I hear people use Eenie Meanie Miney Moe to pick what they watched first on Disney Plus instead of taking the boogity challenge.

1763
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
It drives me out of my mind.

1764
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
I need to watch Mr. Boogity first.

1765
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:52,000
There's some weird movie we've watched.

1766
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
People are excited about it.

1767
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Boogity challenge worked out great.

1768
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:01,000
With educated Disney Plus viewers.

1769
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Yes.

1770
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
I wonder.

1771
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:12,000
I'll have to look into it later but I do wonder if there are like fan page Facebook for rides specifically because obviously there's plenty of Disney and Disneyland.

1772
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
This is good content for the future.

1773
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Yeah.

1774
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:21,000
For like Peter Pan 2 we'll see if we can find specific Facebook groups and see how much drama there is.

1775
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:26,000
If people like the update in 1983 better than they liked it in 2015 maybe.

1776
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:36,000
There was definitely because I'm on like Oh My Disney and like a bunch of those Disney things when the whole Pirates where they switched out the wenches.

1777
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,000
There was so much on Instagram no less.

1778
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
That's not even I mean I guess it's owned by Facebook.

1779
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Yeah.

1780
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:47,000
But all the fighting about it I saw on Insta with all the Disney peeps.

1781
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,000
It's crazy.

1782
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Yeah.

1783
01:21:50,000 --> 01:22:01,000
You talked about the Imagineering story early and it's funny how early episodes are like and then they figured out how to make a ghost that was alive and then later episodes and fan backlash and toxic Facebook.

1784
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:04,000
This has to be in the Imagineering.

1785
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Boo.

1786
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
The 2010s are terrible.

1787
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Yes.

1788
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
The 2010s are terrible.

1789
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,000
They're over.

1790
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,000
They're over and they were terrible.

1791
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,000
They were terrible.

1792
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,000
I was going to say.

1793
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
2020s will be great.

1794
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Yeah.

1795
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Everything's going to be fine from here on out but that 10 years.

1796
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:45,000
I mean in the 1980s there was a lot of controversy around like Peter Pan in the parks because when they redid Fantasyland I mean you hear Tony Baxter talk about like yeah we really it felt kind of like a gamble to just shut down all this stuff for a long time and then they took out the pirate ship and Skull Rock and like they were thinking maybe they'd move it but then the pirate ship had rotted.

1797
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,000
It pretty much just fell apart when they tried to pick it up.

1798
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:55,000
There's a yeah there's a lot more early Disney and a lot more Peter Pan presence with that ship and the rock and now it is down.

1799
01:22:55,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Now it is the it is this ride and it's we do we think that they took things from the ship and put them in the ride like lanterns and stuff or is that not true.

1800
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,000
They said the yes.

1801
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
According to yesterworld.

1802
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Yes.

1803
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:17,000
They're not sure about lanterns up with that hook there's like one hook like Captain Hook hook that you can see sort of right when the ride starts that they may they thinks was saved from the restaurant.

1804
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,000
I think some set dressing.

1805
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Yeah.

1806
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Okay.

1807
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Very mild.

1808
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,000
There's nothing like crazy.

1809
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,000
There's nothing chicken of the sea branded.

1810
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,000
That's what that ship was.

1811
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,000
It was a chicken of the sea restaurant.

1812
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Oh I didn't I didn't know that.

1813
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,000
So I believe so.

1814
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Yes.

1815
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Wow.

1816
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Yeah my mom was I think am I making that up.

1817
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,000
No you're right.

1818
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,000
You're on.

1819
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Trust me.

1820
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:46,000
I will assure you it was definitely chicken of the sea diet that I never lived to see the chicken of the sea to eat a chicken of the sea branded tuna sandwich.

1821
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Wow.

1822
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:52,000
And a cup of Folger's coffee and all the goods the good stuff.

1823
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Yeah.

1824
01:23:53,000 --> 01:24:00,000
And then yeah with a side of Fritos and the and Jemima syrup and all of odd brands in the early days.

1825
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Yeah I mean we did live through the 2000s where for a little while they're like well I guess people like wheat bread now and everything was served on like wheat buns like weird plasticky wheat buns.

1826
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,000
And then it has swung back.

1827
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:20,000
I mean this is one of the episodes we can't get off on a wheat tangent but I feel like wheat has swung back.

1828
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,000
We was like the classier healthier choice for a while.

1829
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:29,000
And now everyone's like well wheat is like Monsanto and that's all processed and we should why bother.

1830
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:43,000
I mean obviously bread is bad now in general but wheat is now I would I'll pick white bread over wheat bread now whereas I used to be like well I'm Mike used to give me such a hard time for buying white bread for buying sourdough bread and I'm an idiot because I don't know what's going on.

1831
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,000
I don't know anything about health.

1832
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,000
I like the vitamin water.

1833
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,000
I thought there was full of vitamins.

1834
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:59,000
I will say like Cheapy Brioche or like the New England style like buns that are like or like Hawaiian sweet rolls cut down the middle.

1835
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,000
It's like oh I'd always rather that than something like crappy wheat.

1836
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,000
Well you were right. I'm sorry.

1837
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
I'm sorry. I formally apologize.

1838
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Who knew the wheat bread controversy would be solved on Peter Pan.

1839
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,000
Yeah I didn't.

1840
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Incredible.

1841
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,000
I didn't know.

1842
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:14,000
You really never have to grow up in Neverland.

1843
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Peter Pan would be like I don't want to know about all this bread stuff.

1844
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
I want to be a little boy forever.

1845
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:24,000
They don't really address what the Lost Boys eat.

1846
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
I mean in Hook they do.

1847
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Of course.

1848
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,000
They eat candy and ice cream.

1849
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,000
They eat a bunch of gloop.

1850
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
They eat a bunch of colored clay.

1851
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Yeah.

1852
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
There's so many different Peter Pans.

1853
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Yeah a ton.

1854
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:39,000
There is a new Peter Pan movie every three years.

1855
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:45,000
I was thinking I was coming into this episode thinking I like the ride a lot.

1856
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:54,000
I'm not that fond of Peter Pan and I rewatched the movie to see like what is my problem with this because I think I'm a little creeped out by some things about it in general.

1857
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
And I was like but I like the ride.

1858
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,000
I like the world.

1859
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:07,000
I like being on a pirate ship and I like going to Skull Rock and I like Captain Hook and I realized what I don't like and it is Peter Pan himself.

1860
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Oh interesting.

1861
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,000
He is a selfish nuisance.

1862
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:16,000
In my memory he's nothing but horrible to Wendy.

1863
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:26,000
And then I watched it and confirmed this that one of their first interactions is that he shows up and he's like a celebrity to them because they're always telling stories about him.

1864
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:32,000
And then so she's kind of like verbal vomiting because like oh my god I'm talking to the real Peter Pan.

1865
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:36,000
She's going on and on while she's sewing his shadow back.

1866
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:42,000
She's doing work for him and he says wait wait I want to get it right.

1867
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Oh she's going on and on and then he's like girls talk too much.

1868
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Yeah that is really harsh.

1869
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Well get on with it girl.

1870
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:57,000
What is this all he's like women need shopping.

1871
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Shut up and sew.

1872
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,000
I'm a little boy with a lot of energy.

1873
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,000
I need that shadow on me ASAP.

1874
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Oh I was going to say his shadow the name of the guy who wrote the game but it's mystery.

1875
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:16,000
He's like Peter Pan read the game and he's negging Wendy.

1876
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Oh yes sure sure sure.

1877
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
I feel like he's not very nice to Tinkerbell either.

1878
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,000
No he's not.

1879
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:32,000
He pits them against each other and then she's she whispers or twinkles in his ear and Wendy's like what did what did she say and he says Tick says you're a bitch.

1880
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Tick says you're a big ugly girl.

1881
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,000
This is awful.

1882
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,000
This is why I don't care for I think the world is great.

1883
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:47,000
I think he's terrible he's a boy who never grows up who dresses like an ice dancer all the time.

1884
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:55,000
I don't I think he but I think this is never going to happen but I would like to can we just keep the world and replace the protagonist.

1885
01:27:55,000 --> 01:28:02,000
I don't want to see these weird British movies every three years with these creepy boys playing this terrible character.

1886
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
I'm a big Mr. Smee guy.

1887
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Yeah now there we go.

1888
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,000
He's a cool guy.

1889
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Good in the cartoon good as Bob Hoskins all good.

1890
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Oh Bob Hoskins is so great in that role.

1891
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:17,000
While I'm calling for Disney Plus series how about Jason Sheridan is Smee.

1892
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Smee?

1893
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Like just called Smee?

1894
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Young Mr. Smee.

1895
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Young Mr. Smee it's before he meets Captain Hook.

1896
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Oh my gosh.

1897
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Young Smee it's like Young Pope or whatever.

1898
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Yes.

1899
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Young Sheridan.

1900
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Young Sheridan.

1901
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Young Smee.

1902
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Young Sheridan.

1903
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Young Smee.

1904
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Young Pope.

1905
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Jason Sheridan is Young Smee.

1906
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
I would love that.

1907
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Smee is clearly the brains of the operation poor Captain Hook is clearly shell shocked by his insane life.

1908
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:48,000
You know there's a Smee character in The Princess and the Frog.

1909
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Do you remember that guy?

1910
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Do you remember that guy?

1911
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:54,000
He's like the prince's assistant essentially.

1912
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Right.

1913
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:02,000
But it is fascinating because it's like what would happen if Smee got to control because that guy sells out the prince.

1914
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,000
I can't remember his name right now.

1915
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Yeah I don't care.

1916
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
There's a lot of yeah it is a sort of.

1917
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Oh and I guess like sorry.

1918
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,000
That's okay.

1919
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
What's his name from Gaston?

1920
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,000
LeFou.

1921
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
I was going to say something about LeFou.

1922
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

1923
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Isn't there's kind of isn't there kind of a bumbling little mermaid isn't there sort of a.

1924
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Oh oh.

1925
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Somebody's helping Prince Eric right or is that no he's like an older.

1926
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
No but he's good though Prince Eric is good.

1927
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
The Sultan is kind of like Smee.

1928
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Cogsworth.

1929
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Cogsworth.

1930
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Cogsworth is type two.

1931
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Cogsworth.

1932
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Yes little stuffy.

1933
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Bumbling.

1934
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Low status guy.

1935
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Low status guy.

1936
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Who are very short.

1937
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Short.

1938
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
The Queen's what the King and Alice in Wonderland.

1939
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Like that like that.

1940
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Next to the handsome playmaker or whatever.

1941
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Yeah.

1942
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Is Captain Hook handsome?

1943
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,000
He no.

1944
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:50,000
I just it was a thought I had.

1945
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,000
I think Dustin Hoffman.

1946
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,000
In the movie in Hook he is.

1947
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,000
In Hook.

1948
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Yeah.

1949
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Isn't Jackman Hook in a movie?

1950
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Jackman I think is Hook.

1951
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Yeah.

1952
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,000
He's not Pan he's Hook.

1953
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,000
And Christopher Walken was in the musical the live musical.

1954
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,000
That was bong.

1955
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Who is the hottest Hook?

1956
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,000
It's Hoffman.

1957
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,000
It's Hoffman.

1958
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Yeah.

1959
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Are we forgetting some though?

1960
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,000
I'm sure.

1961
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Or is it live action?

1962
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,000
No in the other one.

1963
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Yeah.

1964
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Is it the animated one?

1965
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,000
Is the animated one to anyone hotter than Hoffman?

1966
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:23,000
I bet there are a lot of people who would say animated.

1967
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Yeah.

1968
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:28,000
If you consider height the issue like if you think he's tall.

1969
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:32,000
He is tall for everyone that's saying that they want tall in their bios or whatever.

1970
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:38,000
But I'm realizing now Jason I feel bad because you're a shorter man and they're all the shorter

1971
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:45,000
characters are all these bumbling snively often with like a like a much taller wife

1972
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,000
who's mean to them.

1973
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Scott well look I just want to work.

1974
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,000
That's fine.

1975
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:53,000
You can be the first empowered Smee.

1976
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
I don't want a partner who's mean to me.

1977
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
I don't mind if they're taller than me.

1978
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:00,000
That's usually been my dating experience.

1979
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,000
That's fine.

1980
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,000
Young Smee can.

1981
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,000
I'm secure about that.

1982
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Young Smee is a reimagining of the legend of Smee too.

1983
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,000
So he can be a different.

1984
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,000
We don't have to go down the path.

1985
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
This is going to be a Smee with agency.

1986
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Smee with agency.

1987
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Yeah I mean I've got to get jacked.

1988
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,000
I got to get jacked.

1989
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Young Smee.

1990
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:19,000
I got to get jacked to do some of these run Disney run universal events.

1991
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,000
That's how you train.

1992
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:24,000
And if I get jacked enough finally we can have a canon short Wolverine.

1993
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Wolverine in the comic books is five three.

1994
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,000
I'm five one and a half.

1995
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,000
So getting there.

1996
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Rod Serling.

1997
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:34,000
I'm five four and I always remind people Rod Serling is five four.

1998
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Really?

1999
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
I always thought he was a tall one.

2000
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Yeah.

2001
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:42,000
And also I was going to say there's a very Smee like character in everyone's favorite

2002
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:48,000
which is Time Enough At Last with Bridget Meredith where he steps on his glasses end

2003
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,000
of the world and his wife is awful to him.

2004
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,000
She is so mean.

2005
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Yeah and I'm like he didn't deserve what happened.

2006
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:58,000
I don't know if anyone realizes at the end when they're like oh my God and then he all

2007
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:03,000
he wants to do is read and when he finally gets to he steps on his glasses and it's like

2008
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:06,000
no but he was nice the entire time and they were all shitty to him.

2009
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:09,000
All he wanted to do was read and they made him feel like a dork.

2010
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,000
So it doesn't make sense.

2011
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:15,000
What Rod Serling is trying to say is life is unfair especially if you're a dork.

2012
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Jordan Peele I am available to do a remake of Time Enough At Last as well.

2013
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,000
But anyway that was a very Smee like character.

2014
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Yes.

2015
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:29,000
I'm curious I like that I want to know hottest hook but I also want to know hottest short

2016
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,000
king.

2017
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Of all of these guys of all of these little.

2018
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
It's uncouth to nominate yourself.

2019
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
Jason number one for casting.

2020
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Hot short king Jason Sheridan number one number two Wolverine.

2021
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
Can we put fictional character with.

2022
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
But actually it's huge how tall is Hugh Jackman.

2023
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Well but that's the thing Wolverine in the movie is very tall but it's Hugh Jackman not

2024
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,000
as tall.

2025
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
I think he's like 5'10 or 5'11 maybe taller.

2026
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
I think Tom Cruise is also 5'4.

2027
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
There's actually like a list it makes me feel good.

2028
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:00,000
I have like a list of all the celebrities that are also my height.

2029
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,000
Whoa I am curious below the list.

2030
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:09,000
I think it's bizarre that Jackman has been tall hook and small Wolverine.

2031
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Oh yeah good point.

2032
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
He's 6'2 by the way he's tall.

2033
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Oh he's tall.

2034
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Never mind.

2035
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
OK so Dustin Hoffman is my height he's 5'4.

2036
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,000
What?

2037
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Wow you're a hooks height.

2038
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,000
You're a hook.

2039
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
Well he really commanded that in a way.

2040
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
See it's all about your personality.

2041
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Personality the way they shoot it.

2042
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Tom Cruise, Jet Li, Ben Stiller and Charlie Chaplin.

2043
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,000
Stars.

2044
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Wow.

2045
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Ben Stiller is that?

2046
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,000
And Seth Green.

2047
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,000
Did I say that?

2048
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Yeah.

2049
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,000
Wow that's a good line up.

2050
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Yeah.

2051
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,000
That's pretty good.

2052
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:42,000
So we've come up with a couple different shows here today.

2053
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,000
I feel very productive on this one.

2054
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Yeah yeah yeah.

2055
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,000
A lot of show ideas.

2056
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Let's make sure we cover.

2057
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
We should start winding it down.

2058
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:51,000
So besides show ideas Hot Short Kings.

2059
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Yeah yeah.

2060
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Hot Short Kings.

2061
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
I think I'm the most curious to give some love to.

2062
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:58,000
I mean I don't want to discount Wolverine or Jason.

2063
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:05,000
But I want to give some love to one of these short kings who has a big tall wife who's mean to them.

2064
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Within those characters who's the hottest.

2065
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Let's make them feel better.

2066
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Oh OK.

2067
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,000
I see what you're saying.

2068
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:14,000
This is tough because some of these characters are like a foot tall.

2069
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,000
But I don't even have a front runner.

2070
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,000
I have to think about this.

2071
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Audience tell us.

2072
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Audience will tell us.

2073
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,000
How does Short King.

2074
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,000
And it can be Jason.

2075
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:26,000
I feel like I should mention we haven't really talked about the crocodile.

2076
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Great.

2077
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
I like the crocodile.

2078
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:34,000
I think I used to be scared of him as a kid because he's scary and a hook like he's mounted.

2079
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:37,000
But then he does eat Dustin Hoffman at the end.

2080
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:41,000
But like I think I was even a little nervous about him at the ride.

2081
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:48,000
But as I got a little older he's like oh no the enemy of our enemy is our friend like the crocodile is good.

2082
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Another thing that they use that design it looks like in Princess and the Frog with that.

2083
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Very similar.

2084
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Yes.

2085
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
That's a gator.

2086
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,000
But like yeah.

2087
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
Yeah they're in the same like family.

2088
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
They're big happy dudes.

2089
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Yes.

2090
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
They like clap and whatnot.

2091
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:09,000
He's very humanistic.

2092
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Hrugarius perhaps.

2093
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:25,000
In all of the in all of the Peter Pan's worldwide the scene of hook with his legs on either side of the the crocodiles jaws is wonderful.

2094
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Yeah I was going to say like all of these scenes at the end I like when they're on the pirate ship.

2095
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:38,000
I like it feels like I can I probably could touch all their faces if I wanted to like it's so close.

2096
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:50,000
And last time I was on it I was like this feels too close and I'm surprised it's not happened or somebody like knocks hook off of the crocodile or like puts his foot out and does it.

2097
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Banned forever.

2098
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Yes or like yeah had like an umbrella because you can bring an umbrella on the ride.

2099
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Easily smack people ideas.

2100
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,000
You're OK.

2101
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,000
I should probably edit this out.

2102
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Lose these because then I'll be it'll be traced back to me and then they'll be able to source.

2103
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,000
We know who planted the idea.

2104
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:13,000
There's a rash of umbrella hits to the face to Captain Hook and it's all because I just said that this was a Manchurian candidate situation.

2105
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:17,000
They were patsy's and I intended them with this episode.

2106
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,000
I accepted them.

2107
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
I tended them.

2108
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:27,000
I'd like to give credit to the the again all these some of these scenes you think have always been there.

2109
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:31,000
It came in much later and that the sword fight on the mass.

2110
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Yeah.

2111
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:37,000
Between Peter and Captain Hook was a Disney World invention and then added later.

2112
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Yes.

2113
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Disneyland.

2114
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
But that feels like it always should have been there and Disney World did it first.

2115
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,000
And it's very good.

2116
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:47,000
And the mermaid lagoon was Disney World first and then they added it to Disneyland later.

2117
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:51,000
That is speaking of mermaids unique to the Paris one.

2118
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:56,000
It seems like the Paris one ends in a seed, which is like full size sexy lady.

2119
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:00,000
So the French folks, the French.

2120
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:08,000
This was another problem I had with the film where Peter shows up and all of the mermaids just swooning over him.

2121
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:13,000
They just like it's their voices are like orgasmic like, oh, Peter.

2122
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:18,000
And he's like, hey, girls, want to hear about my sword fights?

2123
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
And like, why would they be?

2124
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:28,000
They're all like pushing each other away to like, no, me, I want to be, you know, women, you love a grown man.

2125
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:33,000
You love a man who's a little boy forever, who wears a little hat with a feather.

2126
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:38,000
Well, that's just how guys like back then it was like women were for you.

2127
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:41,000
Like the world is yours and women are specifically made for you.

2128
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:42,000
I mean, it's true.

2129
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,000
That's like, sure.

2130
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
And that's why it was such a big deal.

2131
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:49,000
I mean, I talked with Pedro Herra, who's Bell, like it was such a big deal.

2132
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Her character was totally different.

2133
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,000
She was like, get married me?

2134
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,000
No.

2135
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Like, you know, and she eventually fell for a prince who was ugly.

2136
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Apparently, I thought he was very cute.

2137
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:06,000
But like, you know, she really fell in love with her heart, not her eyes.

2138
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:09,000
But yeah, she read and that's what made her weird.

2139
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,000
And it was just a book.

2140
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,000
Yeah.

2141
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,000
These ideas.

2142
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:21,000
So Peter Pan is kind of like, you know, leftover from that world where it was like, this is, you know, a little what would a little boy going through puberty want?

2143
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Like half naked women and like sword fights and like a following of like little pudgy kids that like look up to him.

2144
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:39,000
You know, I know two women who I make fight over who gets me and then a different group of five women who also fight over me.

2145
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:42,000
OK, pretty much everybody's looking at me at all times.

2146
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,000
God is motion capture pan and a new Disney Peter Pan.

2147
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Oh, yeah.

2148
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:49,000
So you'll be a little boy, but you'll have the balls on your.

2149
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:50,000
No, no, no.

2150
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
I don't want to move like that.

2151
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,000
You have to.

2152
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,000
I don't want to have to be in a little hat.

2153
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,000
You have to be.

2154
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:56,000
No, I'm not.

2155
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
This this show idea is canceled.

2156
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,000
All right.

2157
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Jason will do it.

2158
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:13,000
I was going to say in several adaptations, they've had a girl play that part just because I end up looking, you know, mainly when boys get to that age, they are kind of transitioning so they don't sound exactly and look as like little twinkish as he is.

2159
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
He's very twinkie.

2160
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:18,000
And and I would honestly rather see that.

2161
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:23,000
I'd rather see a queer girl that's like, you know, oh, I have all these women that love me.

2162
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:27,000
You know, like that could get updated.

2163
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Well, on the stage traditionally.

2164
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Yeah.

2165
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Peter Pan.

2166
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,000
And Alison Williams was Peter Pan.

2167
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,000
Right.

2168
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,000
In the last NBC.

2169
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,000
Yeah.

2170
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:36,000
Yeah.

2171
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,000
All right.

2172
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,000
So fine.

2173
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Scott isn't going to do it.

2174
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,000
You're off the hook.

2175
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,000
All right.

2176
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,000
I do.

2177
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,000
More progressive if I don't.

2178
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Good excuse.

2179
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:54,000
If we're talking, you know, children, I do have a request from the listeners, a call for art in the queue for the for Peter Pan's flight in Florida.

2180
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
There's these darling little portraits.

2181
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:01,000
If someone could draw us in this style, that would really make my day.

2182
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:07,000
I'll post this on the Twitter, sending out a call for this to all of our talented artists.

2183
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:11,000
I think that take precedent over drawing you as young Smee.

2184
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
I mean, also do that.

2185
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
But maybe live hand in hand.

2186
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Seems like I haven't.

2187
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
I must have been drawn.

2188
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Little Michael there with the little hat.

2189
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Yeah, all of them are there Sunday best.

2190
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:27,000
They're in their Sunday best when you get you sit for a picture.

2191
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Yeah.

2192
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Well, draw me however you want.

2193
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:33,000
She's not in a feathered hat.

2194
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
But I'm causing it to happen.

2195
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Yeah, I know.

2196
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
There's going to be some horrible Peter Pan art that comes out.

2197
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Maybe don't hang on.

2198
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,000
I secretly.

2199
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
This is the Streisand effect.

2200
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,000
I just made it happen.

2201
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Send it to me.

2202
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Send it to me.

2203
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,000
No, no, no.

2204
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:52,000
I'll set up a secret email called Scott is pan at Gmail dot com.

2205
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Email that email address with your pictures of Scott as pan.

2206
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:00,000
I will raise Scott is pan.

2207
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:04,000
That's the podcast, the ride on sensor.

2208
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,000
Yeah, we can talk about all the forbidden pans.

2209
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:10,000
You know, I am mostly out of my notes.

2210
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:16,000
The last thing I'll say is that the volcano near in the Neverland scene, it's that's like the volcano.

2211
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,000
It's that's like bubbling.

2212
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:21,000
It's just tiny styrofoam balls and there's air blowing on it.

2213
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:22,000
That's how they get the effect.

2214
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Very cool.

2215
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Oh, oh, is that closing thoughts from you?

2216
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Don't do anything to the captain.

2217
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:36,000
Don't smell him with an umbrella.

2218
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:40,000
No, and just like I still am such a fan of the London town.

2219
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Yeah.

2220
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:45,000
Fly over and the kids landing on the clock tower hand.

2221
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Oh, that's very cool.

2222
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Oh, yeah.

2223
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Yeah.

2224
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,000
Yeah.

2225
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
And those little projection enhancements of all.

2226
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
There's a lot of projection going on in Shanghai.

2227
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:54,000
It's also nice.

2228
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:59,000
It's a lot of the sword fight happens like going screen to screen and then out of the

2229
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:04,000
math, the mast with projections and I don't know all the recent imagineers have done such

2230
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
great jobs with all these reds.

2231
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:10,000
It's such a perfect example of I mean, they kind of do it with other rides, but it seems

2232
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:16,000
like this one gets almost the most like incremental love out of every ride because you think like

2233
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:19,000
if we've talked about Haunted Mansion, like there's definitely things you could do to

2234
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:22,000
plus that up and make some effects cooler, but it feels like pan.

2235
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:25,000
They're all like everyone's obsessed with pan and like perfecting pan.

2236
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Yeah.

2237
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,000
You know, in a fun way.

2238
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,000
It's kind of everyone's favorite.

2239
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Although I have a theory that you're either a toad person or a pan.

2240
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:37,000
Well, you both said you both said and I said technically I think I like pan better, but

2241
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:38,000
I love toad.

2242
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:39,000
Yeah.

2243
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:42,000
I think toad people came to be because the line was too long.

2244
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:48,000
So then they were like, well, I just got to go on toad then and then you're just like keep riding that ride every time you come.

2245
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
It does make it more appealing.

2246
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:53,000
And I did in Japan get to because of rain.

2247
01:42:53,000 --> 01:43:00,000
I got to achieve the dream of a zero weight Peter Pan's flight, which was wonderful and transcendent.

2248
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:08,000
And yeah, try to go when it's raining like crazy and maybe you'll get on this ride in a reasonable amount of time.

2249
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:17,000
One of the best descriptions of pan, of course, and Tony Baxter always talks about this quote, surprisingly well preserved in a lot of places.

2250
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Ray Bradbury sent Walt Disney a note saying, I will be eternally grateful today.

2251
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:27,000
I flew out of a child's bedroom window in a pirate galleon on my way to the stars.

2252
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
It had nothing to do with the ride either.

2253
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:32,000
It was a bit of a character.

2254
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Geez.

2255
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:40,000
Well, that sounds a fun day for me as you survive podcasts, the ride.

2256
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:41,000
Thanks for being here.

2257
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
That was a blessed of a topic.

2258
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
Let's exit through the gift shop.

2259
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

2260
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Yeah, my podcast, Nerdificent, it's wherever you get your podcast.

2261
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
You can follow me at Ms. Danny Fernandez.

2262
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:58,000
It's M S D A N I F E R N A N D E Z.

2263
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
And oh, I have a book.

2264
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,000
I'm in a book on audible.

2265
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Well, you can also get it in paperback.

2266
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:04,000
It's called The Good Immigrant.

2267
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:07,000
It's a collection of essays from actors and writers of color.

2268
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:10,000
There's a UK edition and then we did an American edition.

2269
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:14,000
So it's 26 writers reflect on America.

2270
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:18,000
And you can listen to me read my essay on audible.

2271
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Cool. Great.

2272
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Check it out.

2273
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:26,000
And of course, sign up for any and all Baby Yoda groups.

2274

Just start clicking on them.

2275
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:33,000
If you have Ralph in other countries, please send me my character saying my name in different languages.

2276
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Geez, that's great.

2277
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Yes.

2278
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,000
You need a super cut of that.

2279
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Yeah, we have.

2280
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,000
I've looked at the things.

2281
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,000
There are people in other countries listening.

2282
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,000
So if you have that Blu-ray or something, yes, send a little clip.

2283
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,000
Yeah, that's fun.

2284
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:48,000
I think I technically could also just turn the language setting on my.

2285
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
This is more fun, though.

2286
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
This is more interactive.

2287
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,000
It's true.

2288
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
You need the pal.

2289
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
You need the pal copy.

2290
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Oh, yeah.

2291
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,000
You'll see specific.

2292
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:00,000
Yeah.

2293
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,000
True.

2294
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:02,000
So yeah.

2297
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:14,000
The ride full Fabio Goose incident.

2298
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:19,000
So to come and yeah, just remember that hashtag Scott is pants.

2299
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:20,000
God damn it.

2300
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Just remember how did I've gotten off easy lately?

2301
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
I think I'm going to have to make the email address.

2302
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:27,000
Got his pan at Gmail.

2303
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
As the darling children.

2304
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:36,000
If it's a separate email that I don't have to look at, then yeah, full send them to send them to Mike.

2305
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
You guys creep out with these horrible photos.

2306
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:42,000
I'll figure out a way when to spring it on you at the worst possible time.

2307
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:45,000
So, yeah, don't send it to be on stage.

2308
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:46,000
It'll be on a stage somewhere.

2309
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:47,000
Don't send it to Twitter.

2310
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:48,000
Don't even let him know.

2311
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
He'll forget about it after this record and then send it.

2312
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Yeah, email.

2313
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Side note, we've come to a decision that we are our live recording career is over.

2314
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:58,000
There will be no more live shows.

2315
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
I will no longer be sorting.

2316
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Sorry, I think you're cutting out.

2317
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
I think your mic is cutting out.

2318
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:07,000
That's the only just oh, yes, got your mic is broken.

2319
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:08,000
I wait.

2320
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,000
Yeah, you're not.

2321
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:10,000
I can't hear you.

2322
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:11,000
That's too bad.

2323
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:12,000
All right.

2324
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Well, anyway, Scott is pan at Gmail.

2325
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Jason, you have anything to say?

2326
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
No, draw.

2327
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Yeah, give us those short kings.

2328
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Draw some darling children.

2329
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Scott is pan.

2330
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
Most importantly, Scott is got his pan.

2331
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
