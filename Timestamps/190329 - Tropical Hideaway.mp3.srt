1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Warning. Today's episode includes everyone's least favorite Indiana Jones adventure.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Old oars with old men's names.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And the thrilling conclusion to a tale involving two pizzas.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Welcome to our Tropical Hideaway episode, you lucky people you.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It's Podcast The Ride.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, hosted by three grown men who can finally sleep at night, knowing

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,080
that Munch's Make Believe band is fully intact at several Chuck E. Cheese locations across

10
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,080
this great nation.

11
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,160
I'm Scott Garner, joined by Mike Carlson and Jason Sheridan.

12
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,160
I'm Mike Carlson.

13
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,160
I saw a couple people tweeted us this, letting us know of certain locations where you have

14
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:12,160
the full Chuck E. Cheese band is still playing and rocking out at the restaurant.

15
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,160
Because we were worried because they're supposedly getting rid of the band.

16
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,160
This is Jason Sheridan by the way.

17
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,160
It may still happen.

18
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,160
And it's been in the process of happening for a long time.

19
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:27,160
This is following up on something we talked about in our episode about fellow beloved

20
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,240
food centric animatronic Sunny Eclipse with Jenny Nicholson.

21
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,240
We were expressed our concern that the band was starting to disappear.

22
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:41,240
And for a long time, there's been this version that's a bunch of screens and only one Chuck E. Cheese

23
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:46,240
who I don't like, who just has a big boring t-shirt with a C on it and gym shorts.

24
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,240
I don't like that Chuck.

25
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:52,240
He's got to have the bowler hat and he's got to be a wise guy in a tuxedo.

26
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,320
To clarify though, there are no bowler hat Chuck E. Cheese bands or are there?

27
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,320
I think there are.

28
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,320
That I'm not sure.

29
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:07,320
I'm forgetting at the moment what if you're seeing a full Munch's Make Believe band, I forget what Chuck is wearing.

30
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,320
I saw the...

31
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:13,320
It's not so 2002 skater punk.

32
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,320
But it's in that vein.

33
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:20,320
I saw a picture, somebody tweeted us a picture of the full band and Chuck E. is not wearing, he's wearing more of the shirt and shorts.

34
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,400
Skateboard guy.

35
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,400
Because he's kind of gone through a couple different looks after the bowler hat.

36
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:33,400
He has the skateboard look, but then he also is like, the newer one is like the shrunken mouse, rock and roller mouse, I think.

37
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,400
Who has like a guitar and I think is voiced by the lead singer of Bowling for Soup.

38
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,400
The band we all talk about at all times, Bowling for Soup.

39
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,400
They tapped into the coolest music to revamp Chuck.

40
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:51,480
Yeah, that's the strangest thing about all the Chuck E. Cheese is that you're looking at...

41
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,480
You can have in your view five different Chucks at any get.

42
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,480
Like the one on the video is a puppet and then there's a walk around that looks different than the animatronic.

43
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,480
Right.

44
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,480
It's all a big mess and it's been a big mess for a long time.

45
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,480
And depending on what restaurant, maybe they have different Chucks.

46
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,480
I'm hoping somewhere there's a bowler hat Chuck.

47
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,480
I think there might be.

48
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,480
Somewhere.

49
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,560
Does the walk around one...

50
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,560
Can the walk around one be out and about while the show is going on?

51
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,560
I feel like they don't have the discipline to factor a bad show.

52
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,560
I agree with you.

53
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,560
I agree with what you're saying because my memory as a kid was that he would just be roaming around while the robot was on stage.

54
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,560
Yeah.

55
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,560
And I'm a weird...

56
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,560
I was a weird enough little kid where I would have been like, well, this is impossible.

57
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,560
Like this is cognitive dissonance.

58
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,640
I mean, I wouldn't have been a little kid talking about cognitive dissonance, but I would have known something was up.

59
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,640
I had a weird feeling.

60
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,640
Yeah.

61
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,640
I like to kind of think of it maybe as like a Chuck multiverse or Chuck E. Cheese multiverse where there's different versions.

62
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,640
Earth two Chuck E or three Chuck E.

63
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,640
That I would have been...

64
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,640
That justification would have been OK with me as a little kid.

65
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,640
Right.

66
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,640
Because it's a nerdy DC comics thing.

67
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,640
Yeah.

68
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,640
Into the Chuckiverse.

69
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,640
The Chuckieverse.

70
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,720
I mean, if we're not hired to write that, I don't know who should be.

71
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:21,720
Well, if it's anything, if it's anywhere near the ilk of Chuck E. Cheese's previous film, which I believe is called Chuck E. Cheese in the Galaxy 5000, I could be getting the number wrong.

72
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,720
I think that's where Chuck E. meets Power Man 5000.

73
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,720
They hit all the biggest bands.

74
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,720
Yeah.

75
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,720
They all want to be part of the Chuck family.

76
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:38,800
It's a weird movie where Chuck takes some real human children to space to participate in some kind of like...

77
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:45,800
I mean, honestly, our recent topic, Alita Battle Angel, it really seems like a predecessor to Motorball.

78
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,800
I think Alita ripped it off from Chuck E. Cheese in the Galaxy 5000.

79
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,800
I think that's right.

80
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,800
We'll talk about the Galaxy 5000 more.

81
00:04:52,880 --> 00:05:03,880
I'm not totally sure where it came out, but my thought and hope is that it was a tape that was almost a full length film, that was a prize that you got with tickets.

82
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,880
Oh, I have to imagine.

83
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,880
Which now is just on YouTube for free.

84
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,880
But anyway, I really love it.

85
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:21,880
But let me just say, let me call out the specific, because we put this out there, is the full Munch's Make Believe band there with Mr. Munch, Pasquale P. Pieplate, Helen Henney.

86
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,960
Jasper T. Giles.

87
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,960
Jasper T. Giles, great.

88
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,960
Are they still nodding and clicking around anywhere?

89
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,960
And all of the answers were from California, but they're spread across California.

90
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:41,960
Fernando Mendez wrote us that in Scripps Ranch in San Diego, there is a full band.

91
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:48,960
Josh Ship, or Shipy, or Ship, that's a person who comments on a lot of stuff and I know is a big fan of the show.

92
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,040
I'm sorry I don't know how to say your name, but thanks for listening.

93
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:57,040
But Josh told us that at least as of a year ago, they were still in Pasadena.

94
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:14,040
And Mike Olson tweeted at us that in Temecula, there is not only a full Munch's Make Believe band, but also a Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory with my beloved Truffles, the big sad teddy bear that lives at the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory,

95
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,120
who people have been sending photos of, which makes me very happy, makes my wife very happy.

96
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,120
So I want to institute that same policy with this.

97
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:34,120
If you are, if your hometown or somewhere you're visiting has a full Munch's Make Believe band, tweet at us with a photo and I'll propose the hashtag full Munch.

98
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,120
Hashtag full Munch.

99
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,120
And also, especially if Chucky is in his classic outfit.

100
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,120
That's the holy grail.

101
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,200
Please, I'll give my cell phone out now if you want to text that photo to me.

102
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,200
Because I need to see that right away.

103
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,200
You can't have the barricade of potentially that you don't have Twitter.

104
00:06:53,200 --> 00:07:03,200
Right, so at the end of the episode I'll give my phone number out and only in that instance that you see Chucky Cheese in his full classic red and yellow bowler hat outfit, please text me immediately.

105
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,200
A lot of power, don't abuse it.

106
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,200
Call, call, honestly, call. If it's the middle of the night I'll wake up and...

107
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:19,280
You know what's weird? I trust our fans. I think our fans would respect this because they seem proud of being good boys as well.

108
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:28,280
I mean, who knows? My fear is that the episode falls into the clutches of a non-fan and a non-good boy who does abuse the phone number privileges.

109
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:36,280
But hey, our phones are... are you guys just getting calls about discount leg braces all day like I am?

110
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,360
Like I get nothing but scam calls anyway.

111
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:46,360
The Subaru dealer nearby has been calling me. I don't know why. I haven't looked for a car in eight years.

112
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,360
You don't currently own a Subaru?

113
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,360
No, never owned a Subaru.

114
00:07:50,360 --> 00:08:04,360
I just get the cloned phone numbers close to my own and if you answer it just says if you'd like to be put on the do not call list or Hilton Vacations would be interested in you.

115
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,440
But as we... we're Westgate people, okay?

116
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,440
That's what I tell them. I'm a Westgate man.

117
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,440
Westgate for life.

118
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,440
Westgate for life. Great timeshifters, good people who run.

119
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:24,440
So numbers similar to your own number. That's interesting. What would your phone number be? What's a similar number to your phone number?

120
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,440
I have it.

121
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,440
No, that's okay. That's alright.

122
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:41,520
I have faith in our fans but I do not have faith of 2019, one of the main things people being into, being restraint.

123
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,520
I feel like that's not really invoked right now.

124
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,520
There's been many good years for restraint of course but 2019 a bad year for restraint.

125
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,520
2004 is a real restraining year.

126
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,520
The first half of 2015.

127
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:07,600
In fact in preparing for this episode, met one of our very nice listeners at Tropical Hideaway who immediately posted that we were doing an episode about this.

128
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,600
Robert.

129
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:16,600
Jason, I think the three of us doesn't like spoilers about our future episodes.

130
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:23,600
Look, I like the element of surprise. I like to have fun. That's my little fun. It's the surprise. It's seeing people surprised.

131
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:30,680
Right. Because you like to wake up every Friday morning, it's like Christmas morning for the listeners.

132
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:35,680
And you like to be like a benevolent Santa Claus and look on Twitter and say, ah yes, look what I've done.

133
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,680
Look what gift I've given the listeners today.

134
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,680
Yeah, I like to. It makes me feel like God, honestly.

135
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,680
Oh, okay.

136
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,680
More powerful than Santa.

137
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,680
More powerful. Santa is kind of a deity figure.

138
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

139
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,680
For sure.

140
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:57,760
You know what, I'm with you. I like that. You write the little teases before the episodes come out.

141
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,760
Oh, I like to have a little fun with those.

142
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:06,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I like when sometimes people know it right away and oh my God, it's this.

143
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,760
And sometimes it's a real hidden clue and you don't know.

144
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,760
And sometimes you say an old friend comes back and people always think it's Bugsy.

145
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,760
Yeah.

146
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,760
No matter who, it's never been him. Will it be him someday?

147
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,840
I would say never. He'll never be back.

148
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,840
Not on my watch.

149
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,840
That son of a bitch.

150
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,840
Certainly there will be no warning. Absolutely not.

151
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:33,840
Yeah. He could be around. Really, though we say we're not going to have him back on any podcast,

152
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,840
he could walk in the door at any minute. We won't know.

153
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,840
So listeners, beware.

154
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:44,840
Yeah, and if you're a listener and you see one of us out with an old time gangster who's a skeleton,

155
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,920
don't tell the other listeners that he's coming back.

156
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,920
Yeah.

157
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:56,920
If you're just, yeah, if you're sampling like the food at the Be Our Guest restaurant with Bugsy.

158
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,920
If there's a skeleton in a gangster hat with Jason.

159
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,920
You're Jason, right? From Podcasts Around. You're Bugsy, right?

160
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,920
The villain who haunts Podcasts Around and shoves jewels into their mouths.

161
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,920
Yeah. Good to meet you.

162
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
In all seriousness, it was very nice to meet Robert, who started our subreddit.

163
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Meet him down there. I met a nice young couple on Main Street, too.

164
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I did not catch their names.

165
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I love you shaking hands.

166
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
An older, but fatherless relative who had no idea who I was.

167
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
But yes, nice to see you all.

168
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Hey, fun. Hey, what a blast.

169
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Well, so yeah, because you went down there to sample the eats and treats at today's topic, the Tropical Hideaway.

170
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:44,080
Yes, from one animatronic based restaurant to another.

171
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:55,080
Another food, but there's probably some like little code word we could like, like animatronics that live close to food and talk about food.

172
00:11:55,080 --> 00:12:02,080
Like food centric. I think we could crack the little like, I'll have that in the back of my head for the episode.

173
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,080
But I'd like to officially coin the term there.

174
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,160
And if I were quicker, I'd do it right now.

175
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,160
But it's not coming to me.

176
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,160
But hey, we'll get a while thing.

177
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:27,160
Tropical Hideaway, if you are not, if you are a person who goes to the other parks, not Disneyland, Tropical Hideaway is the restaurant that recently opened that shares walls with the Enchanted Tiki Room.

178
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:32,160
It's right between the Enchanted Tiki Room and the Jungle Cruise right along the banks of the river.

179
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:38,240
And for a long time, this was a closed off dining area with even a big wall and a gate.

180
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,240
And now it's open concept and you can look into it as you finish your Jungle Cruise ride.

181
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,240
And I think it's been very well regarded and enjoyed by people.

182
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,240
But we haven't really talked about it here yet.

183
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,240
So let's do it.

184
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,240
Yeah.

185
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,240
Should we start a little history of the area, perhaps?

186
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,240
Like what was here before?

187
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,240
I'd love to.

188
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,320
I'd love to.

189
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,320
Yeah.

190
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,320
Do you guys, little T, let's not say it yet.

191
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,320
Do you guys know what was there around like 2008?

192
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,320
Did you find this?

193
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,320
I believe so because I think I saw it.

194
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,320
Oh, OK.

195
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,320
Wonderful.

196
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,320
Not you, Mike?

197
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,320
It's not coming to me.

198
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,320
It's really good.

199
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,320
We'll see.

200
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,320
So we'll get there.

201
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,320
It's a tease.

202
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,320
I wonder if this history was thin and not with what I found.

203
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:24,320
So anyway, yeah, I think when the Tiki Room opened in the early 60s, if not right away,

204
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:31,400
then fairly soon after they opened this facility, the Tahitian Terrace, which is like a Polynesian

205
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:36,400
themed restaurant where they did luau kind of shows, I think.

206
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,400
Yeah, yeah.

207
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,400
They were like hula girl.

208
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,400
That's probably a very base description of whatever it is.

209
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:49,400
But like women in grass skirts shaking their hips, men with fire coming and doing crazy

210
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,400
little fire dances and stuff.

211
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,480
Presumably some Kahlua pork, fruit juices.

212
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,480
I have a menu.

213
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,480
I have a menu of the Tahitian Terrace.

214
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,480
Sort of smaller scale.

215
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,480
What would become, you know, a lot of the dining and entertainment at the Polynesian

216
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,480
down the line.

217
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,480
Right.

218
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,480
Of course, it's taking me a second to find the menu.

219
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,480
Here it is.

220
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,480
Tahitian Terrace.

221
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,480
They had a Polynesian combination platter, which was barbecue ribs, crisp fried shrimp,

222
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,560
tempura, chicken, almond with Polynesian vegetables, Cantonese rice, a dollar eighty,

223
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,560
eighty five.

224
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,560
Yeah, everything's cheap as hell.

225
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:32,560
Surf rider, tropical idol, oil choice, chop beef steak with pineapple spear vegetable

226
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,560
and Cantonese rice.

227
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,560
A dollar sixty five.

228
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,560
They had pineapple ribs.

229
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,560
Monte Cristo sandwich.

230
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,560
A dollar fifty.

231
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,560
I know this really sounds like we're a bunch of old men now.

232
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,640
Can you believe it?

233
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:50,300
How cheap it was and how expensive it is now used to be able to get a ham sandwich fried

234
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:54,120
wrapped in flour and fried for only two bucks.

235
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,120
They would pay you to cart it away.

236
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,120
Here's Jason.

237
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,280
Here's you're going to be interested.

238
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:03,440
The desserts, rum and raisin ice cream wafer.

239
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,040
Nice 40 cents.

240
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,360
Tahitian rainbow ice cream and a wafer.

241
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,040
40 cents.

242
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,520
Pineapple ice cream covered with crushed fresh strawberries.

243
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,440
Sixty five cents.

244
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,160
And Polynesian rum cake.

245
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,720
40 cents.

246
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,840
Can you believe it?

247
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:28,240
They were playing it less safe back then than I feel like Tropical is playing now.

248
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,640
You mean that you mean these are bold choices?

249
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,800
Yeah, I post what they have on the menu.

250
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,800
Yeah.

251
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,800
Oh, that's true.

252
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,800
Yeah.

253
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,800
The desserts are pretty basic.

254
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,800
Yeah.

255
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,800
It's not a big old variety.

256
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,800
It's kind of like soft serve at the end of the day.

257
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,720
It's variety for typical theme park cuisine.

258
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,720
I'll say that.

259
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,720
I'll give them that.

260
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,720
Sure.

261
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,720
Yeah.

262
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,720
Yeah.

263
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,760
There's there's one really odd thing that I saw in there that I guess this wasn't even

264
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,760
in the dessert portion.

265
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,280
I don't know what you would call this exactly.

266
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,640
What genre of food is this?

267
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:06,400
The Wahi Mahana who who a Salada, a bouquet of tropical fruit with lime sherbet on shredded

268
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,400
lettuce.

269
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,400
What?

270
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,400
World.

271
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,800
Yeah, I feel like that's a real throwbacky kind of like before food was good.

272
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,800
Yeah.

273
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,840
I feel like I've read articles of like before the 1970s or even the 1980s, food tasted bad

274
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,840
for the most part.

275
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,600
That's what I meant.

276
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,120
Whenever I see old menus, I've looked at like what they would have at the contemporary.

277
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:35,440
And there's a lot of like gelatin that are sort of it's a very that's a very like or

278
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,360
like ambrosia salad.

279
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,080
You know, canned canned stuff and marshmallows.

280
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:45,960
People got hooked on certain foods during the wars and it took a while for those to

281
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,960
get out of circulation.

282
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,960
Yeah.

283
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,080
I mean, Walt loved canned chili and diet custard.

284
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:56,040
It's like you can see his shopping list and his pantry like recreation at the Disney Family

285
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,080
Museum and diet custard is the funniest thing.

286
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,600
Have you, Jason Sheridan, ever had a diet custard?

287
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,280
I probably have.

288
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,160
But truthfully, I don't really like any like artificial sweetener kind of like.

289
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,280
I don't think I've ever had custard.

290
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,360
I've had got it somewhere.

291
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,600
I mean, lots of things are considered custard.

292
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,600
Yeah.

293
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,600
I guess you're right.

294
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,680
Some soft serve ice creams are.

295
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,680
Yeah, I know.

296
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,920
Depending on the milk, fat or eggs.

297
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,320
That Culver's in the Chicago area.

298
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,160
Now that I think about it, I think they call that custard.

299
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,520
Yeah. So I've had custard.

300
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,240
I don't know if I've had diet custard, though, like what is it?

301
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,320
Well, yeah. Does that mean it's artificial?

302
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,600
It's like NutraSweet type ingredients.

303
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,000
That's what I'm assuming like diet custard or light custard

304
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,600
would would be considered.

305
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,160
And over a bed of shredded lettuce over delicious, nutritious lettuce.

306
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,480
Yeah, the combo of dessert and gelatin and savory foods in general.

307
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,720
What were we doing? Why did this happen?

308
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,680
My grandmother always make a jello mold.

309
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,480
She was like, I'm making a jello mold.

310
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,160
And then like once in a while, I would have fruit in it.

311
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,200
And I would like wait for the pieces of fruit.

312
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,360
And the fruit was always like not in there.

313
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,400
Not not the sweet chair, the different cherries.

314
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,840
I'm trying to think what the different type of cherries are.

315
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,440
Not maraschino cherries, but like a different sweet cherry.

316
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,680
And it would be all like it would be like basically fruit cocktail fruit.

317
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,200
Did you have that as a child?

318
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,600
It would be a fruit cocktail, which is like coated in this like sugar syrup.

319
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,200
So every piece, like it was probably like peaches and cherries

320
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,600
and then a couple other fruits.

321
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,600
And but it was coated in a sugar syrup as if fruit isn't sweet enough.

322
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,000
And then you throw that in the jello mold and then we would eat it as as children.

323
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,320
Yeah. Making. Yeah. That fruit needs a lot of help.

324
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,480
Yeah, it's really weird.

325
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,520
Yeah. But you got to remember changing

326
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,920
refrigeration and stuff like it used to be a real treat

327
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,680
to bring a bag of oranges back from Florida.

328
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,440
Like they would sell like citrus crates and stuff at the Contemporary

329
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,520
or like an orange in your stocking.

330
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,480
Like that was a real treat because like, oh, citrus season is either

331
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,840
ending soon. It's going to be harder or at least expensive.

332
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,440
Yeah. Yeah.

333
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,440
You get this stuff.

334
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,520
And we're only like 30 years away from going back to this

335
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:16,240
where there'll be scarcity for fruits and it'll be, oh, what a treat.

336
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,600
I got an orange in my stocking.

337
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,600
I've had an orange for seven years.

338
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,720
Yeah. So that'll be good.

339
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,560
Yeesh. Anyway, sorry to bring everyone down.

340
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,280
Oh, that's all right.

341
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,920
Hey, shout out to the sponsors of the of the Tahitian Terrace, Stouffer's

342
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,360
and Hickamon.

343
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,240
When you when you think tropical food,

344
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,920
when you think Hawaiian food, you think Stouffer's.

345
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,640
Stouffer's.

346
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,000
They were the ones bringing it to you.

347
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,120
So that but I don't really know much about what that entertainment was

348
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,200
or if it was like particularly I don't know if there was a regular there

349
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,080
like Wally Bogue, the host of Golden Horseshoe.

350
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,240
I don't know what the I don't know what I don't know what happened.

351
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,520
I believe it was like, yeah, Lou out.

352
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:04,120
Let's say like flame fire twirling.

353
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,960
Have you seen the video of it?

354
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,000
No, there's a video of you just search Tahitian Terrace, Disneyland,

355
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,080
the first video that comes up and it's got a great line read from Walt.

356
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,840
I think it's probably from a wonderful world of Disney.

357
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,040
And he's signing autographs at Disneyland.

358
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,960
And then all of a sudden, you're kind of like drums in the background.

359
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,880
And he goes, Hark, the jungle drums are calling.

360
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:28,920
And then like they go to the Tahitian Terrace and it's like Lou out dancing.

361
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,640
And what's great about this video is that there's a lot like

362
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,280
I don't know how to put this without sounding like a pervert.

363
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:42,200
There's attractive women dancing and they make sure to show pictures of

364
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,960
or excuse me, clips of the old men watching them.

365
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,000
And maybe I'm reading into it, but it's definitely to me,

366
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:54,920
seems like they put it in there to be like, hey, this guy is really enjoying the show.

367
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,920
And then there's like because they'll be like guys like they're

368
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,800
I guess what I'm seeing is that they're like leering a little too much in the video.

369
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,880
Like the Andy Daly like some daddy.

370
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,960
Yeah. And like one guy's eating a rib and like they really like

371
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,440
focus on this guy eating a real boy is watching these like young women dance.

372
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,040
And we have their bare midriffs.

373
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,360
And I'm like, why do they put that like just put the crowd shot and everyone's having fun.

374
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,680
But at least I have to look up to see the rib man.

375
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,240
I could be not interested in the beautiful women.

376
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,080
I just want to see this weird old man eating a rib real for a long time.

377
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,080
Can somebody just cut that down and just send that to you?

378
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,240
I mean, you have to sit through that.

379
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,240
Edit, read.

380
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,320
I mean, this all makes the fifties, you know, 50s, 60s.

381
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:43,880
You see the rise of tiki culture and like Hawaii like, whoa, what an exotic vacation

382
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:48,560
that we have to go to Hawaii and Hawaii becoming all these big hotels and resorts

383
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,920
springing up and.

384
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:55,880
Yeah. Obviously, for whatever reason, that that part of the world and Samoa and Hawaii

385
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,080
and Tahiti like was very in because of the Polynesian.

386
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,520
And I think my mom like that.

387
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,720
That's why we wanted to stay at the Polynesian the most.

388
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,880
I think there was like that was a very interesting culture.

389
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:10,680
I think that's a holdover to so many servicemen served in the South Pacific

390
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,280
and absorbed it there and brought back stuff and, you know,

391
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,560
yeah, sort of new and fascinating in the 60s.

392
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,200
Yeah, much easier to get to.

393
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,320
Yeah. Air travel becoming more affordable.

394
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:27,400
And we did we when I was young, we did the full like luau at the Polynesian.

395
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,680
Sure. Did you ever do that?

396
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,400
No, I well, I don't think so.

397
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,440
I don't think we ever did.

398
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,760
I think it's it's a pretty similar show.

399
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:39,480
It's just a lot of like dancing girls and then fire and then you eat a bunch of meat.

400
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:45,600
It's funny. Everybody gets one rib and you know, on it sensually.

401
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,040
I think you get to I think we got up and they get out.

402
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:54,680
There's it's much more like interactive, like they get they get dad up to do a little dance.

403
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,760
Oh, yeah. The impartial put on a hula skirt. Right.

404
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,400
You look like a total fool.

405
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,800
Who embarrassed dad is usually the was the main thing.

406
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,840
Theme park people do are the imagineers are like, all right, this is a great Star Wars.

407
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,240
It's great. But how will we embarrass dad?

408
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,520
What what thing? What photo op will we have that will embarrass everyone's father?

409
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,160
They do need to figure that out for Star Wars land.

410
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,880
I don't know what the Star Wars centric way is to embarrass dad.

411
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,360
But this has got to be someone.

412
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,680
You got to have an alien yell at him. Right.

413
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:31,880
You got to have like a smuggler or own own doc goes like, what are you doing?

414
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,280
Like, you know, which character is that?

415
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,760
What is the den of antiquities? I I.

416
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,320
Oh, which one is that? That's not the.

417
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,360
Oh, is that the robot that you'll you'll haggle with?

418
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:48,120
Yeah. Well, now it seems like it's up in the air whether that haggle is.

419
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,960
They've already probably cut that.

420
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,920
Seems like a terrible idea for the most crowded place in the universe that you.

421
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,000
Yeah. You'd set your own prices.

422
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,400
Yeah, for sure. There's no way.

423
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:05,000
Yeah, yeah. Maybe in 10 years, they like quietly turn the haggle toggle on the robot.

424
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,320
And then somebody's like, oh, heck with the robot today.

425
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,960
But yeah, no, it's crazy. I have to look that name up.

426
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,520
I don't know that. I don't know his name off the top of my head.

427
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,280
Doc. Home, home doc.

428
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,080
So that's what it'll be known as.

429
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,600
You're acting like I'm like some sort of no.

430
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,320
Sorry, doc owned are. That's familiar.

431
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,560
OK, there you go. OK.

432
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:32,360
Oh, it's like, no, no, I'm just acting like a whole episode about this.

433
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,280
I know I just it didn't sound familiar.

434
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,600
That's why I was skeptical that that's what it was.

435
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,600
Katz and Naka, Rontos, Roaster, like all these fucking names.

436
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,680
All those names sounded familiar to me. OK.

437
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:46,680
I because I read all these articles and I commit once I hear a new Star Wars character,

438
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,600
it gets committed into my memory. Sure.

439
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,720
It gets burned into my brain.

440
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,480
I don't remember the names of the main ones from the original movie,

441
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:58,600
the original trilogy and my wife, like, like in the last five years said,

442
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,760
what's the name of the gold one?

443
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:06,360
Like she actually can you do your I think you're the least big Star Wars fan of the three of us.

444
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,560
Is that right? Yeah, certainly.

445
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,880
Can you do 20 characters off the top of your head?

446
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,760
Do I have to?

447
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,440
You don't have to. But now that I've set up the audience will be really upset.

448
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:21,320
Well, let me skip a case. You know, I can say OK, three PO and R2D2 and whatever.

449
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,480
Uh, uh, should I just? All right.

450
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:29,480
OK, so Luke and Leia and Darth Vader and Maz Kanata,

451
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:35,080
Finn, seven, Ray, eight, uh, Darth Maul, nine,

452
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,680
Ogre, ten. Of course, that counts.

453
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,520
Doc Unc. I'll allow it.

454
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,080
Well, Unkar plot.

455
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,840
Plot. That's close enough. Yeah.

456
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,280
Twelve, right? Java the Hutt.

457
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,680
Yep. Getting the irony ones out of the.

458
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,960
Yeah, there's plenty more.

459
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,160
Oh, yeah. What's the one that the one everybody made for Constable Zuvio?

460
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,440
Constable Zuvio. Yep. He's not in the movies, but he is a toy.

461
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,080
Uh huh. Uh, in the trailer.

462
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,360
You got six more. Rex.

463
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,400
Easy. Rex. That's good.

464
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:11,080
Yeah. Um, you're missing an embarrassing one.

465
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,000
Anakin. Skywalker.

466
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,080
Yep. You're almost there.

467
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,080
Uh, I'm missing an embarrassing one.

468
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,760
Padme. Padme.

469
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,520
You're missing like two big ones.

470
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,800
Well, but there's plenty of big ones.

471
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,440
Yeah. Uh, oh, Kylo Ren.

472
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,600
Kylo Ren. Right. You didn't say that before.

473
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,760
No. And, uh, uh, uh, cool guy.

474
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,640
What's, what's his name? Mr. Cole.

475
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,200
Come on.

476
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,040
I can't Lando Calrissian.

477
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:41,560
Oh, I feel the ones I thought you're missing were Han Solo, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda.

478
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:41,960
He said Han.

479
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,280
You're right. I did not say any of those names.

480
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,200
I went to Unkar plot.

481
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:46,760
Yeah.

482
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,760
Cause that's like an almost ironic reference.

483
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,000
We did not get an IG 88, a Bosque.

484
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:59,080
None of the pod racers, not team Topagaly's, not Subulba, not, uh, uh, Juan Sandage.

485
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,680
I don't even like hearing these names.

486
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:06,360
Not Kira, that very dynamic character from Solo.

487
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,000
Oh yeah. Not any of the solo characters for some reason.

488
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,880
Kira?

489
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,480
It's Kira. We know Kira.

490
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,280
Just the regular name we have in our world.

491
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:14,680
Yeah.

492
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,480
But there's a Q and an apostrophe in there.

493
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:17,960
So all right.

494
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,600
All right.

495
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:25,160
We're heading to something with a Lucas character with a very normal name.

496
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:27,560
Matt.

497
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:33,400
Well, we'll hear. We'll go. We're one step away of history for, but anyway, thanks.

498
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,480
I think I deserve some applause for that.

499
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,440
I gave you the applause.

500
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,840
Yeah. I'm not, I'm not named. If you ask me to name 35, I'm in trouble.

501
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,400
I'll do my research.

502
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,400
Anyway, so Tish and Terrence runs for a while, seemingly well-regarded little restaurant

503
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:53,480
and dinner show. But around the nineties, they want to bring some more current IP into the park.

504
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,640
And we end up with Aladdin's Oasis.

505
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:01,720
And if you go in there, the main feature is that there is a big, very well done cave of wonders.

506
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:07,880
The big, uh, tiger head, the stone tiger head, uh, from Aladdin.

507
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,240
My memory was this opening, me seeing that get built, me loving Aladdin as a

508
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,960
kid, oh, the laden's going to have a place in the park. And I never, it felt like it was never

509
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:23,080
open or that, like as soon as it was built, I felt like it was two years, right. And it was gone.

510
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,800
Like the full show was, was two years and it was gone. Cause it was another dinner show.

511
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:33,400
Okay. Um, and I probably didn't want, I bet I refused to go in retrospect because I didn't

512
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:39,000
like like weird food, like, like rice. I think that is how it was as a child.

513
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:46,920
My mom was very, like, very skeptical of like, oh, Jason and Brian won't eat that. Like they're

514
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:52,520
not adventurous eaters. And I think what she was really saying was I am not an adventurous eater.

515
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:58,040
And I think my children will be the same. And as we got older, much more adventurous.

516
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:02,440
You excelled past your mom. Yeah. I think all our parents also were raised in a very dull

517
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,200
more in the era of the gelatin lettuce.

518
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,240
Jason needs fruit cocktail and diet custard. And that's it.

519
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:18,040
Well, I actually, I remember my, that I, I didn't like, I didn't want to go anywhere with rice

520
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:23,640
peel off and I still don't like rice. Oh, I love rice. Really? Yeah. What is, wait,

521
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:30,040
what is rice peel off? I'm not even sure. But let me tell you, I eat a lot of things with rice,

522
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:35,160
big rice guy here. Uh, something about peel off does not appeal to me. And maybe that's just my,

523
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:42,520
it's still my childhood. Uh, like bad for it can be boring. Like it's, I think it's really cheap

524
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:47,960
to make in large quantities. So it's often just tossed off. It's like the stuffing or something.

525
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,760
Yeah. I've eaten it before. I'll get a big bowl of rice peel off. Okay.

526
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,000
This.

527
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:06,520
So Aladdin's Oasis, it's some like, yeah, it's a dinner show that kind of tells a compacted story

528
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:12,040
of Aladdin. Um, not to be confused with what they did at California adventure later with a topical

529
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:17,480
genie, no topical genie. Um, yeah, I don't know. Like it was always there taking up so much real

530
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:22,680
estate and that sign was there. And like, I felt like the vast majority of its lifespan was spent

531
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:28,840
closed. Yeah. And then in Florida, they have the flying carpets, which similarly just feels like

532
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:36,120
dropped in adventure land. Like it messes up the traffic flow. It's kind of like off game. Like

533
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:41,880
it's not a hundred percent right there. I think, yeah, they clearly the Disney parks thought

534
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:49,160
adventure land is our way to get Aladdin in. But the, uh, Disneyland Paris, which I've had a lot

535
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:53,320
of complaints about, I think one very well done aspect is that it feels, although I guess it

536
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:57,880
predates Aladdin coming out, but maybe they knew Aladdin was on the way. Aladdin feels like more

537
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:03,240
nicely organically embedded into adventure. I think adventure land is very well done in, uh,

538
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:07,880
in Paris and a lot more like probably how galaxy's edge is going to be with little like,

539
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:13,720
you know, corridors and this marketplace feel and this odd little tight space where somebody pops

540
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:18,360
out and there's a little show. Um, but yeah, I totally agree. This thing steps six out,

541
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:25,960
like a sort of the adventure land vibe is clearly jungle tropics. It's not. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So

542
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:30,520
it's never really sat there perfectly well, I guess, cause they think like the thing across,

543
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:36,200
like the gift shops are like bizarre, like a little bit across the way from it, but that doesn't

544
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:43,080
feed it with the architecture a little like a, with the place making a little, um, kind of merging

545
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:50,200
those two things. But I think like, if you go too far in, in, in that direction, it is clumsy,

546
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:55,960
like Aladdin's Oasis was. Yeah. Yeah. That's fine. Carpets. Yeah. It just feels like here. Plop

547
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:03,640
unrelated. Um, yeah, I'm calling you out flying carpets a little bit. So, but you guys never saw

548
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:08,280
any Aladdin thing there. Did you ever go into that space? We would just cause cause when I went

549
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:13,240
in, whatever the first time 2007 or whatever, we would just be like, what is that? And it's closed

550
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:17,560
and you'd like peer in and you'd be like, just like tables in there and then when you go back there,

551
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:23,480
I feel like sometimes they would, sometimes they wouldn't. Yes. It was used as distribution for

552
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:29,640
like that, like pay $40, get a fast pass for paint the night, paint the night or fantastic.

553
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:33,480
And here's a box lunch. Yeah. They would give you a little box. That's where they would

554
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:37,640
distribute it or something. And then you'd get a fast pass, but that's the last. Yeah. So I,

555
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,680
we would walk in there, but there was never anything interesting happening. Nothing was

556
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:45,640
happening at all. So an enclosed courtyard full of boxes of chicken. Yeah. Yeah. That was the most

557
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:52,040
exciting time there as far as my memory in chicken hour, except what you were going to reveal, I

558
00:32:52,040 --> 00:33:01,000
believe, which is, uh, I guess in 2008 around the era of crystal skull, there were the Indiana,

559
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,880
there was a event at Disneyland, uh, called the Indiana Jones summer of hidden mysteries.

560
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:11,880
Oh, I don't know anything about this. I never experienced it. This, this could be a whole,

561
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:18,520
I think we had talked about doing like Indiana Jones in the parks, park two, Indiana Jones stuff,

562
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:24,280
because I don't think we really touched on the Paris kind of roller coaster or this. And we

563
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:30,120
certainly haven't done the stunt show yet. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good idea. Yeah. But I, I can't not

564
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:36,920
talk about this a little bit because it's insane. So they did a little show in the Aladdin's Oasis

565
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:44,520
space, uh, which as I've said, was dominated by the cave of wonders. How do you get around that?

566
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:49,080
Well, you fold it into the Indiana Jones mythology and you create a live

567
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:56,520
pseudo stunt spectacular called Indiana Jones and the secret of the stone tiger. Oh my God, really?

568
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:03,320
He's just running around the clearly Aladdin cave of wonders much more cartoony than anything in

569
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:09,560
Indiana Jones. Yeah. Yeah. Save for those squirrels that watch the cargo pie or whatever. And not

570
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:15,800
gophers. Yeah. A ton of room to do very elaborate fighting, but there was fighting. And do you have

571
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:24,840
the, the, the thing that makes this show stick out as like, Oh, that's weird. Yep. Uh, in this show,

572
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:32,040
probably the main, uh, thing to speak about of it is that, uh, Indiana Jones punches a woman in the

573
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:41,720
face. What? Yeah. The woman's name is Rachel. As I said, it's not some exotic, she's like a British

574
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:48,520
woman in Rachel. Well, she gets possessed, I believe is what I remember from the story. So they were

575
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:53,240
during the day, I think they were, they were doing not this Aladdin dinner show, but like more

576
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:58,840
storytelling shows where kids are involved and they need, they have some invented need for the kid

577
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:03,400
to come up and participate. And that's essentially what this was. It had some mild stunts, but it was

578
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:12,440
more like, uh, this, the majority of the show is Rachel, the, uh, uh, archeologist who, uh, I, I

579
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:16,520
didn't watch the whole thing, but you know, she seems to have a little tasks that kids come up and

580
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:24,600
help with. And then Indiana Jones shows up, bursts out of the cave of wonders and side issue. He's a

581
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:33,560
very OC Indiana Jones. He's a very like Orange County, San Diego, Kyle Mooney character, Indiana

582
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:42,680
Jones, who there is a part where, uh, okay. Okay. So, so Rachel is after, uh, a golden tiger,

583
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:47,320
like, uh, very, as we just talked about legend, the hidden temple temple, she's going to like put

584
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:54,520
it on a staff. It's this like coveted archeological thing that she's chasing. And, uh, um, so

585
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,200
she's after that. The kids are helping. Um, but once she gets it and it puts it on the staff,

586
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:05,320
she goes mad with power. It's too much power. And she turns evil at the drop of a hat.

587
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:10,920
So there is a moment where Indiana Jones, she, Rachel needs to get the jump on Indy. So Indy

588
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,760
goes, Indy's talking to the kids and I'll post this video somewhere, but let me do an impression of

589
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:21,640
his dialogue. Uh, uh, Hey, sorry about the snakes. You guys had to deal with snakes, huh?

590
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:26,120
Who's stuck their hand in the basket? Oh, is it you? Is you? Oh, wow. You're really, you're really

591
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:30,040
brave. Yeah. See, I heard the tiger roar. I knew you guys were solving the clues.

592
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:35,400
That's a little exaggerated, but that's essentially, this is what Indiana Jones sounds

593
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:41,160
like in the show. And then all of a sudden, uh, Rachel smacks him with the stick and they get

594
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:46,120
into a big, she, you know, he kind of like pushes her and she falls to the side of the stage. But

595
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:51,240
then they get into more hand to hand combat and just like pure punch in the face of this woman.

596
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:58,840
2008, huh? 2008, but only for like a couple of weeks because one of these, yet another

597
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:06,440
almost identically named website to the ones we go to mouse info.com, somebody complained about,

598
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:11,880
so this is, this is where we're at. We've made Indiana Jones into a character who shows up,

599
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:18,120
punches women in the face and then gets out of there. And also due to the contracts they had

600
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:22,440
with Indy at the time, he couldn't do like a meet and greet. So the kids didn't all get to meet

601
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:27,000
him. So at the end of the show, he just like runs up to the top of the jungle cruise line and you

602
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,760
don't, you never see him again. Well, see ya. But he stays up there and just kind of watches you

603
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:38,440
leave, but you don't get to like, get a picture with him. Uh, one thing that sticks out, uh, uh,

604
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:43,160
of this, like I think I was there a couple of times that summer, every now and then throughout

605
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:49,320
the day on one of the roof of the buildings in adventure land, Indy would show up and some bad

606
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:55,880
guys would show up and it would just beat them up. Well, that's, that's similar. There was an event

607
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:02,040
in 2014 that we went to that was the anniversary of the ride of the Indiana Jones ride. And they

608
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:07,720
had a show, they put a little show together. So like if you were by, um, the ride at a certain

609
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:14,280
point, like whatever, once an hour in the Tarzan tree house, you would see Indy fighting with some

610
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:20,040
goons. And they did a whole fun show like once an hour, just for like two days, two nights of this

611
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:25,960
celebration. Or maybe it was one night. There's a binder on a shelf somewhere or like a PDF in a

612
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:32,040
drop box that it's like, okay, here's the Indy, uh, fighting people on top of things, choreography.

613
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:40,680
And let's dust this off. Like foot charts, like old ballroom dancing diagrams. So yeah, maybe five

614
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:45,800
years from now, there'll be yet another Indy events and we'll get to see him fighting with people.

615
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:50,760
The smoking rubble that once people have destroyed it because they can't get into Star Wars land.

616
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:58,440
Disneyland. Yeah. This is where the ride used to be. Real people will be punching real women

617
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:03,320
in the face to just to get into the, uh, uh, not just, not just fake Indies.

618
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,480
What a buy a $200 lightsaber.

619
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:12,840
God, it'd be chaos. Uh, so there were, yeah, bizarre Indiana Jones show. Uh, and he, he,

620
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:19,000
he ends up pushing Rachel into the tiger's mouth and she dies. She dies. Yeah. Yeah. She eats.

621
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,360
Wait a minute. He doesn't even save her. Nope. He says like, Rachel, it doesn't have to end this way.

622
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,240
And then pushes her into it. I feel like you could at least like justify, well, you know,

623
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:33,720
she was attacking him, but he saves her at the end. So everything's fine. She just does. She's a

624
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:39,800
good guy, right? Who gets possessed. Well, I think they had the working, um, closing mouth, right?

625
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:45,080
Because it was the cave of wonders. No, no, it just fogs up and that's the end of it.

626
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:48,760
Okay. Well, they had the fog juice, so you gotta, stuff goes bad.

627
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:54,040
What a cold end of the show. I think it's, it's one of those scenarios. I think

628
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:59,640
to give them a little credit where, uh, she, if she were to like let go of the staff,

629
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:04,680
she could maybe save herself, but she's determined. She's like, you know, she chooses the treasure.

630
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:11,880
Gollum sorta rules. Yeah. I don't, I don't care for that. Yeah. Give the folks home happy for

631
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:17,240
God's sake. You don't need to end on a downer. The kids all cheer. They're glad Rachel is dead.

632
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:23,000
Even though they weren't helping Rachel like sort through fake snakes like 10 minutes prior. Now

633
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:30,600
they're like, Hey, fucker. Go to hell. You're dead to us. See you in hell, Rachel. He showed me

634
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:34,360
that you're true way. I'm glad he punched you. I'll punch you when I get to hell.

635
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:40,440
By the way, we're doing, these voices we're doing, we're very solid candidates to replace

636
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:46,040
Bob Saget as the voice of many, many pets on America's funniest known videos. Oh yeah. I'll

637
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:55,080
just drop out of this. I think it's bullshit about the new. Who is the current hook? I saw

638
00:40:55,080 --> 00:41:01,240
Alfonso Riviera, Tom Bergeron before that Alfonso Riviera. I saw it like, yeah, cause it's still on

639
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:05,640
like Saturdays at eight or seven or something. It's still like a prime time. It's still like

640
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:10,120
one of the top shows on television. We forget that, but the thing that it's missing is Bob Saget

641
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:15,480
doing his one voice. Yeah. Classic Disney synergy where he was on dancing with the stars

642
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:23,480
and hosting America's funniest known videos. Just as Bob Saget was full house. And then Kool-Aid,

643
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:29,000
funniest America's funniest people. America's funniest filmed at. With, oh, what was it?

644
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:36,280
Universal Florida. Yeah. With Tawny Catane, of course. Really? Yeah. Dave Kool-Aid and Tawny

645
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:43,320
Catane. Wow. Here's a little funnier die inside story. She came in, they made a sketch with her.

646
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:48,040
She was a person, a celebrity who took a meeting and they want to end her when they're like,

647
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:52,040
Oh, so any ideas you've had? And she's like, well, I'd love to go on between two ferns

648
00:41:53,000 --> 00:42:00,440
and the silence and the eye darting in this room as no one wanted to address the fact that Tawny

649
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:05,240
Catane would never be on. Poor Tawny Catane. Which at that point, you know, because now between two

650
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:14,120
ferns is the home to guests like Barack Obama and Sean Penn and like, no offense to Tawny. It's

651
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:20,680
just purely structurally, they were right. It's a plus list. I am the star meter has to be, you have

652
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:26,120
to be in the top 10. One of the biggest living stars. And Tawny Catane's more like number 11.

653
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:35,160
Right. Well, we'll have her on the show. Yeah. So that'll be your runner up for consolation prize.

654
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:43,080
Anyway, so that takes us through the history of it. Mostly unused venue and was kind of just

655
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:47,480
waiting for something cool to happen. And I think they did a nice little thing with the Tropical

656
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:51,240
Hideaway, which opened a couple of months ago. Yeah, there were rumors. I remember, I'm sure we

657
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:55,880
were texting about it, but it's like, Oh, they're doing something with the space because we follow

658
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:02,680
Twitter accounts that will follow different like permits filed for construction. Yeah.

659
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:08,680
Speak for yourself. All right. Two of the three of us will follow Twitter accounts that regularly

660
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:13,080
will say, well, a permit has been filed for construction. Or trademarks and copywriting.

661
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:18,120
And it's like, it's the Aladdin Oasis, the Aladdin Oasis space is going to have some construction.

662
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:22,600
So a lot of people are like, Oh, Tahitian Terrace coming back. So we were very, very excited because

663
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:27,800
like that, that would have been cool too. Also patents, patents are a big interesting look in

664
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:32,120
what theme parks technology will be in a few years. That's how we can guess what maybe some

665
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:36,600
Marvel attractions or Nintendo attractions are going to be. Any good patents lately?

666
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:42,600
I haven't seen patents in a couple of weeks. I feel like there's been a lot of,

667
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:47,800
I'm trying to think, universal things. Or like there was a boat that could like move, like an

668
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:53,080
omnimover boat, even though they kind of have that. Oh yeah. That's the wrong term. With no track,

669
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:59,080
but like using water jets to look at shows. And I'm trying to think of how it's different than

670
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:03,400
the one in pirates in Shanghai, but I don't. So I'll get back. We'll do an episode on the permits,

671
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:09,800
the new permits. They haven't filed a permit to make the globe come to life and talk. No, not yet.

672
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:17,400
Say hi to you. You will love dark universe. We'll get it right. You'll get it right.

673
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:22,440
Double or not then. We'll get it right. Give it to the Blumhouse boy.

674
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:27,880
That's what's happening. On our episode, Griffin Newman like threw that out. And then days later

675
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:32,280
it was announced that that is what's happening. That Blumhouse will start getting like monster

676
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,600
movies, like make monster movies, classic universal monsters. Smart. Yeah. Very smart.

677
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:42,200
So yeah, so it was very exciting. And then it was like, I remember the art got posted on the

678
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:47,560
blog a few months ago, what six months ago. Tropical hideaway, of course, a reference to

679
00:44:47,560 --> 00:45:01,000
the song. Welcome to the tropical hideaway. That was the saddest. Very tentative. We like this too.

680
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,880
We like this attraction. I think we were all just a little shy. Yeah. And I was worried about like,

681
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:11,640
I don't like hitting notes, you know, recording this early in the not really early.

682
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:18,440
My pipes don't open up till like 8 PM. You got to warm up. I couldn't remember what like a cartoonish

683
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:27,160
accents of members of the current at the time, UN security council, the victors, the UN security

684
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:34,520
council. Welcome to the Dickie room. And I guess one loser of world war II. Yeah. Cause there is a

685
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:41,000
German bird. They said when there was a treaty signed for equal country representation. Yeah.

686
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:48,040
When there is a animatronic Tiki bird show, part of the world war II agreement. Yeah. So they're,

687
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:56,280
well, the one thing that's weird about this, I remember reading blogs that they're saying,

688
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:00,760
or it's the tropical highway. It's kind of a connected to the Tiki room, new place to get

689
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:06,440
the dole whips and Rosita is going to be there. It is going to be there. And I read that and was

690
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:12,760
like, what's that? I don't know what I feel like every single thing I read acted as if I was deeply

691
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:17,880
familiar with Rosita already. I knew Rosita cause there's a cause especially cause a couple of years

692
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:24,440
ago, I real cause they've already done references to Rosita in trader Sam's drink. Is that right?

693
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:30,120
I think that's right. And there's also tons of bootleg. I know where Rosita went or like,

694
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:35,800
where did Rosita go shirts for sale online? There are. So you should have Scott known

695
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:44,760
there have to be people out there. Someone back me up. If this'll be, I mean, it is a non-secular

696
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:49,240
must've not known what, and I didn't have that show memorized. I guess what it, what is it a

697
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:56,280
really a reference to it's in the Tiki room. There's the mobile of the, like the chandelier

698
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:02,600
with all the singing birds comes down and they're all like bathing beauties, like from a 20s movie.

699
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:08,280
Uh, and they named them all. And then somebody says, what happened to Rosita? Whatever happened

700
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:14,520
to Rosita? I didn't know any of that sold a month ago. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, obviously yeah,

701
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:18,760
it's a non-sense. It's a throwaway line, but I think that it loomed large in the nerds at

702
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:23,000
Imagineering's head because it has popped up here and there. And then it's, yeah, it's on

703
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:31,240
several, whatever T public shirts probably that say, yeah, where did Rosita go? Am I crazy to

704
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:40,600
have missed this though? I feel like I had trouble finding any, an explanation. I kept looking. So

705
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:45,960
what is Rose and nowhere explained it from scratch. That's what I'm trying to do for anybody.

706
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:52,760
You, it is not you. You are a star tourist guy. Like that is you have combed every inch of it

707
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:57,240
and every history of it. I'm not a big Tiki room guy. You're not a big Tiki, but there are Tiki

708
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:02,040
room people, especially again, with the crossover of like Tiki bar culture and stuff, there's a lot

709
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:08,600
of Tiki group people. So I can see, like I can see, you know, different elements of fandom,

710
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:14,120
like missing other parts of the larger. Sure. And I think it's possible you could, if you

711
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:18,920
aren't super versed in haunted mansion, you might've missed hat box ghost where it, which was

712
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:24,840
presented in a way of like, it's, I feel like even that was announced to be part of a movie that

713
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:30,120
hasn't happened. And I wasn't totally clear on that box. Certainly the whole like blood story

714
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:35,640
that was like, Oh, maybe we'll do that. Or like all the potential backstories for haunted mansion

715
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:40,520
and stuff. And also we asked the question we had on our Patreon episode about Sonny Eclipse. I said,

716
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:45,320
well, if you're subscribed, you probably knew who he was before, but somebody did a poll and it was

717
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:49,560
like, there was a decent amount of folks who didn't know Sonny before listening to that episode. So

718
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:57,240
yeah, even nerds, even nerds have blind spots. Let's, you know, uh, we all, we all try our best.

719
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:03,400
We didn't know team Topagaly is either it was a pod racer. So there's no Duke of Unc.

720
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:11,640
Just going to keep like Xerox copying that name until I like Duke of Unc. That's my,

721
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:20,600
my original Star Wars character. Um, so Rosita this referred to, but not seen character in the

722
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:26,120
Tiki room. I texted my mom. I remember I texted my mom, the art of the, or the blog post announcing

723
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:32,600
this. And I think she texted back Rosita three exclamation points. Now I'm not sure if she,

724
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:36,840
I think she knew right off the top of her head and she's, she loves the Tiki room. That's like

725
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:43,160
one of her favorites. So I think she, yeah, I think she got that reference, but she probably

726
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:48,040
doesn't know who Sonny Eclipse is. He might look familiar to her, but she doesn't know the space

727
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:54,040
angels. So I guess since it's come up, how do we all feel about the execution of Rosita?

728
00:49:55,080 --> 00:50:00,520
How it was done. They do not execute her. That is not the show. I think it's terrible. And I think

729
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:05,640
if you're in support of it, you're a monster. Uh, no, I think, I think her, uh, the little spade,

730
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:09,640
that little nook is really nice. I think it's really nicely art directed, her little like

731
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:14,680
umbrella thing that she's on. And I think it's clever the way they keep it a little bit into the,

732
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:20,920
into the jungle cruise river. So you can't like touch her, throw food at it or execute it. Um,

733
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:26,120
she's sitting on, she's sitting on like boxes of bird seed and then she has luggage and her little

734
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:32,120
hat. That's really, and she's waiting for her skip. She's waiting for a specific jungle cruise

735
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:37,640
boat to come, I believe. Right. She's waiting for a skipper to come. Um, because she keeps mentioning,

736
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:44,120
I watched a mega cut of all the pieces of dialogue she has. Somebody just stood there and

737
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:49,080
recorded the whole thing. So she's constantly like, when is my skipper coming and blah, blah,

738
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:53,720
blah. Well, when you, okay, you know what? I like the art direction of it, but I watched some of

739
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:58,440
that video that you're talking about and I, I got bored pretty fast. I was not like dying to hear a

740
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:02,760
bunch more of this dialogue. I will admit. Well, there's a lot. Sorry. I was going to say,

741
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:10,840
I think the like kind of a borscht belt or corny jokes, I think the jokes themselves are good.

742
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:19,640
I just think the delivery is a little modern. Well, this is, I've talked a little bit about

743
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:28,680
this with some people. Uh, this character and the red head, uh, red, the new pirate red, uh,

744
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:35,080
enunciate a little too much for my liking. There's a very like modern sort of VO style. It's what

745
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:41,720
you're saying where very much I am going to pronounce like, and make sure that everyone

746
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:47,560
can understand. And I feel the same way with red where it's like, Hey, come on boys. They want the

747
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:53,720
rum. Like as opposed to the old Disney where it would be just these drunken character actors who

748
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:59,240
it gives the voices and the character a little bit more personality or character.

749
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:03,320
There is an, um, I don't think it's like one of the greatest

750
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:11,080
performances or animatronics ever in the part. It is a little that she, I have to say the way it's

751
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:15,960
set up, I was sitting there and I was a little far away. I was kind of in one of the tables in the

752
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:20,280
center and I watched it for a few minutes and I was like, you know, because she's kind of just

753
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:24,200
doing these jokes out into the ether, it almost feels a little like she's bombing.

754
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:31,800
But I guess the only other option is you either have it off to the side and people can enjoy it

755
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:37,560
if they want, or you have it like the Tiki room pre-show where it's like stopping everyone. Look

756
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:43,080
at this now. That's a little harder when people are eating and trying to get through lines and

757
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:47,080
stuff you would have had to like put her above things and had a big sound effects.

758
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:50,520
So they also probably want to move people in and out of that space. We're saying that about

759
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:56,280
sunny clips too. If it was like a more, if you were more directed to that show, um, you maybe

760
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,880
you don't want, you don't want people planting there for a super long time. Oh, also you were

761
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:04,280
right by the end of the jungle cruise. So if it was like a huge booming show and stuff, there would

762
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:10,360
be like weird sound bleed between attractions. I guess I think there's enough. I think there's

763
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:15,160
probably some math problem. They did some equation that there's enough spaces in between

764
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:20,600
every time she talks to make most people go, well, we can't sit here and wait for her to say

765
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:24,680
everything she says. So we got to get out of here because it's enough. If it was like every five

766
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:28,840
seconds she talks, I think you might, there might be people that go, oh, let's see everything she

767
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:33,960
says. Let's, let's maybe see the loop, but there's a big significant space between every time she

768
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:40,280
talks. So it's like, all right, well, I like this bird, but we can't sit here and watch this whole

769
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:45,960
thing. Yeah. Yeah. Designed to bore you a little. Yeah. Cause it can't, yeah, it can't be super

770
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:51,080
engaging or else. Yeah. The problem that's a limited seating situation there. This place is

771
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:56,840
pretty popular right out of the gate and, you know, deservedly so I've been there twice now. And

772
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:04,760
I've got, I think it's, I think it's a really nice space, aesthetically and the little like,

773
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:11,000
I think the signs nice and the little waterfall. And I like that it's this open air cascading

774
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:17,960
thing instead of the Indiana Jones's famous stone tiger block in the view. So I think just like

775
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:23,720
placemaking, I think they did a good job, but let's talk about the food. Can I actually,

776
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:27,640
sorry to go back real quick. A couple of the Rosita things I just wanted to say. Oh yes.

777
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:33,080
Okay. So yeah, as far as Rosita, a couple, so I went through all the dialogue. First of all,

778
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:38,920
Rosita must be a big fan of Billy Crystal because she says one of his big famous catchphrases,

779
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:47,400
you look marvelous. Really? Yep. She says it. I don't know if that's why she says it. I mean,

780
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:51,960
that's, I guess a phrase people say, but I don't, I don't, I don't know why I only think of Billy

781
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:57,800
Crystal. What's the character's name? Fernando. Fernando. Uh huh. This character that I never

782
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:02,920
cared for, but I think he never got it. I don't know what it was referring to. What is it? I think

783
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:08,200
he was just that guy. He's a, you look marvelous or whatever. And he would do it, I think every week

784
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:12,200
on Saturday Night Live for a year. In the one season he was on, I think they, yeah, they feel

785
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:17,560
like they did it in every episode. That I feel like is, is like, like when Looney Tunes would

786
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:21,880
reference Humphrey Bogart and the Marx Brothers, it's like going a little before. I can't, but what is?

787
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:29,960
Like a lounge lizard or like a weird entertainer or something. I don't know. She didn't do Billy

788
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:39,800
Crystal's other catchphrases. Sammy Davis Jr's catchphrases. He had two blackface characters.

789
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:43,480
And they play, there's a thing that I remember being funny where he and Christopher Guest are

790
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:48,760
like old timey baseball play like, you know, like old 1800s, but that, but also blackface.

791
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:53,640
Wow. Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, not go. Sorry. I led you right into the pool there. But I mean,

792
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:58,760
well, no, but I said, I think I remember the sketch being funny, but probably not okay.

793
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:05,640
We'll revisit that. She, the Rosita makes a reference that she looks like a pineapple

794
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:13,240
princess also, which I like because that's an old song, a Sherman Brothers song from, what is it?

795
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:19,240
It's from an Annette thing. Yeah. Is it a movie though? I can play pineapple princess on ukulele.

796
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:24,840
I won't do it right now though. Yeah. You know, I don't know on the ukulele. Yeah. You've never

797
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:30,600
heard pineapple princess. No. Oh my God. We got to pull all these missing areas. Is it better than

798
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:37,320
monkeys? Uncle? Uh, hell no. The beach boys are on that one. Well, it's sure as shit. That song

799
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:43,000
slaps. So all right. All right. I'm a big pineapple princess fan. There's also a remix of pineapple

800
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:49,240
princess on that, that, that album deconstructed an electronic version.

801
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:56,440
It's the remix. This is original.

802
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:15,800
That's a little bit of it before we. I am a big fan of Annette's output as far as a recording

803
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:21,320
artist. And there's like, she has a, she has an album called Italianette and they're all Italian

804
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:26,520
songs. And then there's a Hawaiianette, which is what this is from. And they're all Hawaiian.

805
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:31,720
I like that naming structure. Uh, and there's some really great Annette's though. You know what?

806
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:36,840
Patriot episode about Annette's singing career is for sure. Oh boy. Yeah, I'm way into that. I'm

807
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:43,880
way into that. So as long as we hit monkey's uncle. Now this is the remix of pineapple princess.

808
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:48,760
By what artist? Uh, it's on deconstructed.

809
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,840
I think a pineapple. If you're the DJ who did this, let us know. Kinsey,

810
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,760
Kinsey more remix.

811
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:09,800
Disney needs to learn not to match up old timey and electro.

812
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:18,840
No, this isn't suitcase in a dream territory. I say no, it's not. It's not great. I mean,

813
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:24,920
that's now play the little Xan feed the birds. Be the burst up as a bag.

814
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:32,040
But now subscribe to the Patreon for a future in that episode. Um, so yeah, pineapple prints.

815
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:35,240
She makes a reference to that. And then she also makes a reference to Tahitian terrorists

816
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:39,880
and Aladdin's Oasis. Really? Yeah. She says like this place used to be a real dump.

817
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:51,560
People are here for the first time in 20 years. Uh, yeah. So, uh, I like that. That's all I wanted

818
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:56,600
to say. They're always giving me grief in the Tiki room. I'm taking a bigger beating than Rachel.

819
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:04,120
I mean, if she made a Rachel reference, that would be pretty insane.

820
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:14,200
Rachel and her staff. Um, well, so food to the real reason that you're there, the food, uh,

821
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:17,480
what do we think? What have you guys had there? And Jason, I just feel like you've got some,

822
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:22,920
some hot, some takes hotter than the food. I had a bit of a journey.

823
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:30,200
Okay. So I was the last one to go to this place and I went a couple of days ago. Uh, uh,

824
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:34,840
I just hadn't gotten around to going down and trying it. So, uh, I had something to come back

825
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:41,960
for in the afternoon on a Friday. Uh, so I was at seven 11. Yeah. Uh, I thought you said potluck

826
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:48,680
dinner at seven 11. You were the corner of the store. So, uh, I was also, I was like, I'm going

827
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:56,920
to be down there for three hours. Um, and I was like, I, I, to preface, I was like, you know what?

828
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:03,800
I haven't been to in a while is downtown Disney, uh, you know, for an extensive visit.

829
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:08,920
I wonder what the parking situation currently is. Here's the current parking situation at

830
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:15,320
downtown Disney. Uh, no free time. You don't use to get free time. This ain't news to me. I know,

831
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:21,240
I know all about it. So here's the deal. Uh, if you spend $20 in downtown Disney, you get,

832
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:26,680
you get three hours validation. If you spend, I guess the same amount at any table service

833
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:35,640
restaurant, you get five hours. So, uh, my debate was, do I spend $20 for Mickey and friends, like a

834
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:44,440
schmuck or do I buy $20 of pizza? And that's what I did for three hours of parking. Um, $20 of pizza,

835
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:50,840
saving you the five extra dollars to park in the Mickey and friends parking. No, the Mickey and

836
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:58,360
friends up to $20, 25 or it's up to 25. Yes. So you spent $20 at food. Oh yes. So saving me. Yep.

837
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:03,800
Yeah. $5. And it also gave me a chance. I had not been down to see, uh,

838
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:10,120
Napolini the quick service, uh, pizza had been reconfigured from slices to personal pan pizzas.

839
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:17,080
So I bought two 10 inch pizzas. Uh, this is after, why would you, you're going to eat, huh?

840
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:20,520
You were going for a food place and you still bought two pizzas.

841
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:26,520
Yeah. I don't see the issue. Cause then I got a couple of meals out of this, uh, trip too.

842
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:35,720
I had a, like a slice of each pizza to try, uh, after tropical hideaway. And then I ate the rest

843
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:40,920
for dinner. So you brought two personal pizzas into Disneyland with you? No, no, I did it the last

844
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:47,240
thing. Okay. So I went in and I tried tropical hideaway. I got there at about 11 30 ish. So

845
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:52,840
shortly after it opened and it was already packed, like all the tables were full. There was a line.

846
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:59,800
I got to say the crowd flow could be better going to like, I was confused if I would have

847
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:05,480
it at the one station, if I would have that boat and, and they sort of like, I was just following,

848
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:10,040
there was people, like a line of people and strollers going into it. So I just followed them

849
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:16,200
and immediately they went the wrong way. Cause you can kind of go around the coolers they have set up

850
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:23,160
and they, they need more signage to say like, order a cold stuff here, order hot stuff here because

851
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:29,640
other people made the same mistake. So we, I was confused too. I agree. Yeah. That's a good point.

852
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:37,560
So I got, I knew what you had, you had gotten the big like kind of Sunday thing. So I tried the

853
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:42,360
other side, tried the pineapple raspberry squirrel, and then I got an order of the

854
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:52,600
pineapple Lu Pia, Limpia. I forget how it's an M in there. Yeah. Yeah. Lumpia, which is basically

855
01:02:52,600 --> 01:03:00,600
like a, it's kind of like the Dell taco cream cheese, caramel egg roll things, but it's pineapple

856
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:05,320
and cream cheese, and then it's covered in cinnamon sugar and then served with a side of what is

857
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:11,080
essentially sweet and sour sauce. Could have done without the sweet and sour sauce. The Limpia was

858
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:19,240
pretty tasty, a little small, the portion size. And then I had the, the pineapple raspberry

859
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:25,880
squirrel, Dole whip pretty good. My thing with Dole whip, I get sick of, I get a little tired

860
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:30,040
of it about halfway through where you're saying, yeah, I don't really finish. Yeah. It's an

861
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:34,280
overwhelming, I think all three of those flavors you get a little, it's overwhelming. And like,

862
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:39,320
it's a lot of citrus too. It'll be a little irritating. Yeah. I think you get tired of that

863
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:43,720
fat or I get tired of that faster than a chocolate dessert, which you can go and go forever.

864
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:49,080
That is my, my, one of my big complaints, I was like, you know, what would make this all perfect

865
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:54,760
is chocolate shell. I wish I could get chocolate shell topping on this, the hardened chocolate

866
01:03:54,760 --> 01:04:00,280
shell, because I love citrus and chocolate as a combination. And I think having the dip

867
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:06,760
would, would be great. That would, that would sell it for me. The whip, I will say I had the,

868
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:12,280
they call it a loaded whip. That's what we have. I split it with Lindsay, which also maybe that's

869
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:18,200
since we split it, I wasn't having too much of it. They have exotic fruit in it, which also means

870
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:25,720
just like oranges, oranges, pineapple and coconut. Right. It's very exotic. Fuck you. Exotic. I'm no

871
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:34,360
fool. And crystallized hibiscus, hibiscus, which is like little sticks. And so like, yeah, you get a

872
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:40,040
little like, this, you know, sweet, but then there's a little savory in there. So you can like kind of

873
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:45,640
you cleanse the palette a bit. So I did feel like it was a nice mix of things. And I could have

874
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:51,320
eaten one alone. I didn't, I didn't need to split it. Texture to me with ice, like I like something

875
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:57,880
else in there, like even as simple as sprinkles or like cookies and like something else besides

876
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:02,680
the creaminess. I like the texture. I'm sure we've talked about it on the show. What is your normal

877
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:09,320
ice cream purchase? Oh gosh. Well, I don't know. I mean at Disney or anywhere, I just like all of it.

878
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:13,480
Oh, at home, I switch it up. I'm all, I like to surprise myself. I really like a cherry,

879
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:18,360
a cherry chocolate chip. I like just regular chocolate chip ice cream because you get a

880
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:22,760
creaminess and then you get a lot of like chocolate chocolate. Right. But usually you're,

881
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:29,960
it'll have something in it, something in it. Yeah. Chunks, chunks, chunks or like a, like a caramel

882
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:36,040
ribbon or a marshmallow ribbon or something. So you're not, you're not doing just a straight up

883
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:41,800
chocolate ice cream. You want some, some texture beyond the cream. I want some. Yeah. I agree with

884
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:46,200
that. I like, if I like a strawberry ice cream, I like chunks of strawberry in there. Absolutely.

885
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:52,040
Yeah. I guess I like, I guess I agree with that. I like a cookie dough. I like, I like the Ben and

886
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:58,280
Jerry, there's cookie dough and chocolate or no, what's there's a half baked. What's that one?

887
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:03,320
That's like chocolate chip cookies, isn't it? No, it's got two things. It's got cookie dough in it.

888
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:07,000
And it always got brownie and brownie. Yeah. That's what it is. That's like extra. Yeah.

889
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:12,680
So fish food, I think is one of the tops because you get everything at that. You get little

890
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:16,840
chocolate fish, you get caramel, you get marshmallows and chocolate ice cream. Yeah. So

891
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:20,760
I feel like the loaded whip, honestly, like for, for maybe those who, and I don't actually have

892
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:25,240
the problem that you have. I don't always get to live. It's not my number one. It may not even be

893
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:30,040
top three snack at Disney for me, but I don't have the problem where I get tired of it. I do like it.

894
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:36,920
What are the, what are the sticks sticking out of it? Is that the hip crystalized? Oh wait, no,

895
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:42,280
you're right. That's like, isn't it? It's 10 cents worth of chocolate covered coffee.

896
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:47,480
This is that little, the drizzle of little like crystals. Yes. But I'm, yeah, you're right. What

897
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:51,080
is that called? Yeah. I think you're right that it's, it's Pocky. I was getting confused that that

898
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:55,960
was the hibiscus, but yeah, Pocky is the thing. There's like four little posts of like a salty,

899
01:06:55,960 --> 01:07:01,080
like kind of pretzely kind of a thing. And that's what you can really cleanse the palette with.

900
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:05,240
So that, I mean, it does look good. And I thought it would be a little overwhelming

901
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:12,120
to eat with one person because I wanted to try the limpia and I also wanted to get $20

902
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:21,240
worth of pizza. So I knew you had had that. I also like, I'm like, I mean that does look good,

903
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:26,440
but like you're not full of me. I know wholesale, like that's cheap fruit to buy. That's cheap.

904
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:31,560
That's five cents worth of five. You're doing the profit-esque math in your brain,

905
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:36,040
outsmarting this place. Okay. But here's, you're not at the point yet though, like,

906
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:39,320
like some old men where you like kind of tell all the employees that you know,

907
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:43,000
no, because I've seen this crap and we're like here at the grocery store and they're like, you

908
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:48,760
know, you can get this for cheaper at this other, like, uh-huh. Okay. Here, 20, $25 your total.

909
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:54,600
That's a few years away, I think, from you explaining to the, to Rosita, you know,

910
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:59,320
this is all whole set Pocky or 10 cents a pop. So well, but just thinking about that, I mean,

911
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:05,400
the Dole Whip, the Dole Whip swirl was five 69, the Limpia was six 99.

912
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:10,520
The profit episode. I'm picturing little infographics while you talk.

913
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:18,200
So, and then it's also, so no annual past discount. Yeah. No, any barbecue, which is a similar

914
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:26,360
stand with seats does give an annual past discount. So kind of confusing in that sense. Now,

915
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:30,600
side note, if you're comparing those two things, uh, my wife, a vegetarian

916
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:38,440
didn't really like veggie bow, uh, and has become a big fan of veggie, uh, like chish kebab or the

917
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:46,120
skewers. Uh, so better veggie option, cheaper with an annual pass. So, uh, Bengal barbecue is winning

918
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:50,920
points right now. What else, what did you guys have when you went besides the veggie bow? Um,

919
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:55,000
I had done the chicken bow and I'm actually like, I really want to do the beef one because that one

920
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:59,800
almost looks the best and looks like it fits with the sauce the best. Uh, I need to, but I like,

921
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:05,960
I like the chicken well enough. Uh, and I went on a very rainy, the cold day. So the steam coming

922
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:09,480
out of that thing was great. It was just what I needed. If I had it on a regular day, what I like

923
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:15,960
as much, I don't know. We just had regular sort of soft serve swirls, uh, not really like loaded or

924
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:21,720
whippified. Uh, Erin had one with raspberry and she found that to be kind of like medicine. She,

925
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:26,520
uh, she thought that was like a, that tasted like NyQuil or something. I liked mine more, which was

926
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:32,920
orange, uh, pineapple swirl. Um, I thought in a good way, it reminded me of a Flintstones push

927
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:37,240
pop. Oh, wow. That's a great, yeah. That orange flavor. They're kind of fakey orange flavor,

928
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:43,560
but I like it. So I was happier all told, uh, than, than my wife. So, but I, so I veer more

929
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:51,800
positive, um, so far, but I hear all the, I hear the negative points. I think my, I think I was

930
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:57,160
okay with it because I got the same swirl. I think the sweetness of the raspberry balanced out that

931
01:09:57,160 --> 01:10:03,880
like, you know, more tartness of the pineapple, but raspberry, it can be, it's a hard flavor

932
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:10,040
sometimes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think she felt the artificiality of it. Uh, yeah, I would like to try

933
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:15,480
that raspberry. Um, and she, and she tried my orange, uh, pineapple and found it superior.

934
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:20,760
Yeah. Uh, the, the load of whip has the pineapple and orange swirl together. Okay. I wasn't putting

935
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:24,760
it together that it's tastes like Flintstones, but I think that makes sense to me now. Yeah.

936
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:28,920
Well, nice little flavor flesh. Well, you had a fruit cocktail dumped on top.

937
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:36,280
Coated in sugar. Yeah. Uh, we had the bowie, the vegetable bowel and the beef bow. Um, both good.

938
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:43,480
I liked both of them. Um, I wasn't blown away. I think we're getting to the point where if it was

939
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:49,960
$3 and not $6, perhaps that would be a different thing because once we paid for everything,

940
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:57,080
I was like, Holy crap. Holy crap. So you get one bow for $6, right? Yes. That's one bow for $6.

941
01:10:57,080 --> 01:11:03,880
Yes. Small. And we, I'm sure if you look at bowel prices on the streets where the real bow,

942
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:10,120
it's probably the cheapest thing possible in Glendale, like Din Tai Fung, uh, which is like

943
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:18,760
a real bow, but like bow and bun and soup dumplings and, uh, uh, from Asia, there's a location in

944
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:24,520
Glendale, California. It's a may, it's great. But nothing is like super expensive. And like,

945
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:31,240
for like one order, you get at least like six of each item. But how has anybody surprised,

946
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:38,920
you surprised at the Disney pricing? So I am not, I'm just surprised that it's like $6 for one.

947
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:43,240
I thought it would at least be like two in a pairing or stuff. When, when those,

948
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:47,400
the Bengal prices are great, the Bengal prices are good. I guess that's sort of what I was

949
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:52,600
comparing it to where I was like, oh yeah, I don't ever feel like so ripped off at Bengal

950
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:57,640
barbecue. Obviously there's plenty of overpriced things at Disney, but it did feel, it's so funny

951
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:03,560
because it's such a small difference. It does feel like it's a dollar more than it should be.

952
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:11,560
$5. I probably wouldn't be as like, yeah, you're like Disney, like overcharged radar. It like goes

953
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:16,280
up a little bit here where it's like, it's just because you're used to a certain amount of being

954
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:20,360
overcharged. And then this one feels like it's a dollar more than that. And that's why we're like,

955
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:26,600
Hey, they're taking advantage of us. Well, and the lack of annual pass discount in like an identical

956
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:30,680
survey. I get that. Cause like, but the, but you don't get an annual pass discount on ice cream

957
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:37,080
and you don't get it on Dole whip. So I get that there's some thing there and then like certain

958
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:42,440
carts and food carts, you don't get an annual pass discount as well. So, you know, they could do it.

959
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:50,040
That'd be nice, but there is some precedent for it at least. Yeah. Um, I just, yeah, I was like

960
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:58,920
comparing the two receipts of like, I don't know who pizza things. Uh, I don't know, but see,

961
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:03,880
cause I had the outside the gate, it is outside the gate, but I had the opposite reaction of like,

962
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:09,960
I was surprised that the prices were still low at this pizza takeaway thing. Now I think that's

963
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:15,560
also a trick because Napolini that you used to get like a $4 pizza slice. Now you're getting a

964
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:23,240
7 95 whole pizza. So they're getting you to buy more, but I was surprised that it's still only

965
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:30,520
7 95 and the annual pass works there. They may also just be trying to, uh, siphon off people who

966
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:35,640
might just walk to the other side of the Esplanade. Cause there's a pizza press at that first hotel

967
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:42,440
across the street. So it is comparable to walk though. It's a long walk, but it is,

968
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:49,400
the prices are comparable to blaze pizza, rev pizza, these fast fire pizza places.

969
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:54,440
And the crust was better. Like I did. I like Napolini a lot. I think it is a great food option

970
01:13:54,440 --> 01:14:01,080
and easily the best pizza on Disney property. Um, yeah. And cheaper than the sit down restaurant

971
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:06,280
pizza port. I know. Can you believe that we're talking about values is like a single slice.

972
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:13,240
It was like a slice of sub Chuck E cheese pizza at pizza port is like, is up to like six bucks.

973
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:20,040
Like that much horrible. So go to downtown Disney and go to Napolini. Yeah. Yeah. There's your tip.

974
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:27,080
Do you feel good? Do you feel like, uh, you ended the day achieving value or not? I got out of there

975
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:33,480
with like 10 minutes left and then I think there is a 15 minute grace period. So I think I could

976
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:39,720
have stuck around for 25 more minutes in the park, but man, uh, noon on a Friday, it was already

977
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:46,280
getting crowded. I had time for one ride. What did you guys think I rode Casey jr. No, the boat.

978
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:51,240
Yeah. The boat. I rode the Mark Twain around cause the train, like I was like, oh, maybe I'll just

979
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:57,880
take the train back to main street. Two trains filled up and I was still like in line like there

980
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:06,200
was that crowded. How long did the pizzas last? You went down Friday. How long did you stretch

981
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:12,200
out dinner Saturday night? You had both pizzas? Uh, no, I had like two slices at downtown Disney,

982
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:17,880
two slices Friday night and then the rest Saturday night. Yeah. I was just wondering if you were

983
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:22,840
rationing it out still to like right now, like Homer with the sandwich. You made a pizza broth.

984
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:31,800
Yeah. Yeah. Some cups of pizza soup. It's better aged. Um, all right. So yeah, uh, let's talk a

985
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:36,520
little bit about all those numbers. We'll do the diagram. We'll animate diagrams of all of the

986
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:43,160
pricing, right? Sure. Post that our graphics team will, I mean, so that's my main thing. I like the,

987
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:46,840
of course we haven't talked about the oars. Uh, yeah, we're going to talk about a little bit of

988
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:52,120
the scenery. I was going to say as far as food, I was looking around for this because this does

989
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:58,600
feel like once alcohol comes into the park and star wars land, this feels like one of the prime

990
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:04,040
spots for a Tiki drink. So I was looking around and like, do they have anything that would like

991
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:10,680
a hint of like a hookup for a bar of any kind? I didn't see anything, but this is pert like

992
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:16,360
nothing would be better than sitting here at eight or nine o'clock at night with a Tiki drink.

993
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:21,640
And watching the jungle cruise boats go by in the afternoon, my man. Why are you waiting that long?

994
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:27,240
How about nine in the morning? Yeah. But like they only have pineapple juice. Like they need,

995
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:31,960
there's not even like passion fruit or guava or something. I would assume they would expand it

996
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:38,120
at a certain point, but I wonder if there is like a, in like a secret case somewhere with a lock.

997
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:43,400
And it's like, as soon as we are like, we're going liquor at Disneyland, they open it up and like a

998
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:49,320
couple different places you can do it. And this has to be one of them. I don't know. It just seems

999
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:55,880
like it's the perfect place. That's already. What does anyone think is going to happen? If we put

1000
01:16:56,680 --> 01:17:04,040
one ounce of alcohol into our Tiki desserts, that like shit is going to hit the fan. People

1001
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:08,120
are going to be barfing into the jungle cruise river. Like I don't know. People are going to be

1002
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:15,800
knocking Rosita off or perch into the deep. Have you spent time in Orange County? But you can drink

1003
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:23,400
everywhere else on that property. And do you like, where is it chaos anywhere? This argument that

1004
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:29,960
like Walt would be, I mean, we've said it a number of times, but mad. What are we? I can't believe

1005
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:35,400
that Disney has stuck with it. That for somewhere trying to soak you for as much money as possible.

1006
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:42,520
How isn't it crazy that in 2019 Disney is still like has a morality claw, like a fake morality

1007
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:48,440
clause. You walk a hundred feet and get as hammered as you want in so many places. Sure.

1008
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:53,960
Also, my favorite, one of my favorite things probably Bob Iger has ever done is that crack

1009
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:59,800
about Walt taking slugs or having a drink in his office and stuff. And then he had to apologize

1010
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:05,320
because the CEO was not supposed to say that. Facts about the founder of the company about,

1011
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:10,440
and also, Hey, as I'm advocating for on this show all the time, the idea of somebody who likes to

1012
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:18,040
have a drink, this being like a dirty sin. What are we talking about? The Walt Disney in the 50s

1013
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:23,400
liked to have a drink in his office. Oh, what a pervert. Like, what are we mad about? The,

1014
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:30,120
Iger had to apologize for that art like, and on the spectrum of 50s businessmen, he was like,

1015
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:35,000
probably one of the most sparkling, clean functioning alcoholics. Yeah. There's so many

1016
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:41,880
other things I should have positive for. Number one solo as I've said on recent episodes, I had

1017
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:49,560
only just seen solo and I am still upset. Oh, you do really very recently did. Yeah. I had not seen

1018
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:59,720
it. Uh huh. Name your least favorite character. Oh, least fit. Well, it would your 20 least

1019
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:07,080
favorite character. I mean, I think Lisa moment is having to watch Lando more like boy having to

1020
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:15,960
watch Lando process death. That's a weird moment in the movie, but one of the better moments in

1021
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:26,600
my mind, a spoiler alert Lando has like a female robot that he fucks, right? Well, they imply that

1022
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:31,720
they've had sex, but they don't do it or they don't show it. Like we make it work. Like there's an

1023
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:37,080
implication that the role, the robot and Lando are romantic. Um, but then the robot has a brutal

1024
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:41,960
death, brutal death. And then Lando is like very sad and it goes through multiple stages of grief.

1025
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:48,280
Yeah. Um, and I will say one of the better parts of the movie in my mind. I guess. Yikes. What a blast.

1026
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:53,960
That certainly seems like more fun than, uh, hundreds of Lord Miller jokes. Why would we want

1027
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:59,640
that in our movie? No, no. People I would have thought should have been fired because of that.

1028
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:06,040
I mean, recent Academy award winners. Yes. Recent when the movies were, when the nominations were

1029
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:12,520
said, the applause for Spider-Man was deafening in the theater. Like incredible too. Yay.

1030
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:18,600
We have to keep the U S the USC professor and his little boy on. We have to keep them.

1031
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:26,040
My God, super villain delivery. I would like to flesh out and show, uh, explain a picture of how

1032
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:31,480
Jason delivered that he had his arms crossed. And then as he said that, well, his right arm kind of

1033
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:36,440
like fluttered it away, like flipped it away, like this very dismissive. Um, and it was, yeah,

1034
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:41,560
as you said, it was a very super villain, the 20th most successful Kennedy. Uh, it's an evil

1035
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:47,160
gesture you could have done while holding a cat. Right. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Still more clear evil

1036
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:54,360
motivation than any villain in solo. What's Woody Harrelson's character's name? I was just,

1037
01:20:54,760 --> 01:21:02,040
I was honestly, that's, I was trying to make a joke about it. Her producer of red.

1038
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:05,880
I was trying to make a joke about it and I could not for the life of me remember what

1039
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:10,680
he else's character in solo has the most screen time, maybe the most dialogue of all the characters

1040
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:17,640
for some weird reason. Uh, and I cannot remember his name. Hmm. Um, well look, there's more

1041
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:23,960
important names that we have to get to and that's the names on the oars. Yeah. Members of sea

1042
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:31,080
members of sea. Just briefly, you explained seed from the ground up again. Okay. See stands for

1043
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:38,440
society of explorers and adventurers. And it is a fictional group, uh, made up by, we don't know

1044
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:44,440
if it's like Joe roadie, but it seems to come about in pleasure Island, uh, time, which is what? 25

1045
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:49,800
fish more than that years ago. These things factor into his ride, seemingly the most. Yes.

1046
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:55,720
And other stuff has been grandfathered in sort of the, the big thunder mountain lineage, uh,

1047
01:21:55,720 --> 01:22:02,840
Jason Chandler and Barnabas T Bullion. It ties basically ties multiple rides and multiple Disney

1048
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:08,120
parks across the world together by saying all of the people that maybe owned the ride or were in

1049
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:13,080
charge of the rider at something to do with the ride all belong to the secret society of like rich

1050
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:18,440
maniacs. So yeah, as you were saying, Barnabas T Bullion owns big or owned big thunder mountain

1051
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:24,520
railroad Harrison high tower at the tower of terror in Tokyo. He owns that hotel. So all these

1052
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:30,200
characters are in one little special club and they're not all from the same era necessarily,

1053
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:36,200
but they're, they've all belonged to this club at various points in time. Um, correct. Like some

1054
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:43,160
would be from like the isn't Schweitzer of Schweitzer falls. One of the oars. Yeah. He's a

1055
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:47,960
character from the jungle cruise mythology. Dr. Albert falls. Dr. Al. Oh, oh, right.

1056
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:57,080
Schweitzer is a real person. Okay. Yeah. Um, uh, Carmelia, I, I, where's my Carmelia Falco, uh,

1057
01:22:57,080 --> 01:23:05,080
one of the, the worst pot, the earliest member of this, of C and recently announced as the,

1058
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:12,360
the character in a Soren fantastic flight, which is coming to Tokyo Disney say,

1059
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:16,440
but this was her first mention was in this. And then they announced her for that.

1060
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:20,520
Well, so the, all right. So the thing, if you haven't been, the thing is that all of these

1061
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:28,120
characters are tributed with oars hanging right next to where you pay for your bow.

1062
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:33,160
Not a convenient place to dilly dally, much like where Rosita is not a good place to hang out and

1063
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:39,080
take pictures of dorky shit. Um, and yet that's where they put them. But I, but I think this is a

1064
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:46,040
fun, uh, you know, that's a, it's a fun little Easter egg. And if they're starting to tie all

1065
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:51,160
of this mythology together, that they can do something like this. It makes it, I think it

1066
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:55,640
elevates the, what could just be kind of a really just a quick service restaurant into, oh, it's

1067
01:23:55,640 --> 01:24:00,280
like it's placemaking and it ties together something from Tokyo or Hong Kong. Yeah. I mean,

1068
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:05,480
it's, I think that's what was kind of exciting about seeing Rosita there, like in the art was

1069
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:09,400
it was like, oh, this is not just going to be, this is obviously going to be touched by some

1070
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:14,200
nerdy imagineering people. Obviously we didn't know that there would be like sea paddles,

1071
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:20,360
but just Rosita itself is such an inside reference. You knew that there's going to be some aspect of

1072
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:24,440
that and there's going to be some history, there's already history happening here. And then the sea

1073
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:29,240
paddles were just an extra little cherry on the top of like, oh yeah, okay. This isn't just some,

1074
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:34,440
like the corporate people didn't just go, add a sir, serve them some different colored dole whips

1075
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:39,960
or whatever that they were like, they got approved little references. And then a tease

1076
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:45,160
to the character that would be coming to Tokyo Disney sea. But then there were three, like I

1077
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:51,800
looked at the full list again on, on the Disney Wiki and all of the characters had their own pages,

1078
01:24:51,800 --> 01:25:03,480
except three S Shio, Dr. J L Battarista and chef Tanja Tan Daji. Those did not have any answers.

1079
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:08,680
So those might be teases too, upcoming attractions. And an imagined year was quoted as saying like,

1080
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:14,200
there is hints of upcoming attractions in tropical highway. I mean, that's fantastic.

1081
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:20,680
That's interesting. Yeah. Uh, I don't know what's coming that involves like adventurers.

1082
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:25,160
Yeah, that's the problem because everything is coming is IP. So it is like where, yeah,

1083
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:28,520
where are you going to put stuff like that? I've, I'm trying to think like,

1084
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:35,880
yeah, Soren in Japan is, is like an original Disney ride. The chef makes me think restaurants

1085
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:40,040
that could be coming. I mean, there's lots of hotel work being done in Florida.

1086
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:46,600
Well, they just did the, uh, um, what Mary, what's her name? Uh, they just did some stuff with her.

1087
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:50,920
And, um, she's on the cruise ship and on pleasure Island. Yeah. So I feel like maybe now

1088
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:55,880
for a little while, the society of explorers and adventures are going to be like, uh, regulate,

1089
01:25:56,520 --> 01:26:06,120
relegated to, uh, non rides. Oh yeah. Well, and I mean, I have to, I would bet money on it,

1090
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:10,600
like something in the jungle cruise movie. I mean, it's been pushed for a while.

1091
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:18,200
Well, also the, there's a little clues in the places because, uh, chef Tandaji works on the

1092
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:25,880
Irrawaddy river, a real river in Myanmar. Um, so, okay. Well that's not it. So that's Burma.

1093
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:31,320
Is like, is that possible? I don't know where the jungle cruise takes place. Is that India?

1094
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:37,240
Um, I don't know. We have to look it up. I'm glad you said, I only know geography and not real ones.

1095
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:43,160
So we're not taking sides in the, there's a conflict. Yeah. Conflicts in Myanmar slash Burma.

1096
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:47,320
Well, this, the only side I take is the side of Trevor Noah being our greatest.

1097
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:52,280
Oh, it's a great time to be in the Trevor Noah business. Early March.

1098
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:59,240
He heals us with laughter. Um, anyway, uh, uh, hey, you know what else? I think the oars themselves

1099
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:04,040
are neat. They didn't just like stack up 10 oars. There's cool textures on these things.

1100
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:10,600
There are various levels of aging. One has an arrow in the side. One had some bites taken out of it.

1101
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:15,080
One has a crocodile skull attached to it. Is that merry weather pleasures?

1102
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:21,080
I think so. Yeah. From, yes. He, I guess being the founder of pleasure islands, right? Which crazy

1103
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:26,360
that like this old, this defuncts attraction that was essentially like a nightclub place where we

1104
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:33,560
went to see some disco is attached now to this same mythology that links up the tower of terror

1105
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:39,240
in Japan. Well, sure. And Jason Chandler was one of, going to be one of the like main like story

1106
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:45,880
points of discovery Bay. And then they, he was a young inventor. And so then they kind of factored

1107
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:52,120
him in into the big thunder mythos that he made the drilling machine that Barnabas T Bullion bought

1108
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:56,520
to drill into the mountain. And then he was like, Barnabas, I don't know if you want to,

1109
01:27:56,520 --> 01:28:01,800
there's a lot of spooky stuff happening. Maybe you should dial back, but his Barnabas is thirst for

1110
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:09,480
gold drove him further. Oh, wow. The thing I missed, which is embarrassing to say is that we

1111
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:13,400
didn't go in Tokyo and you're going to go to Tokyo soon. There's a restaurant in Disney called

1112
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:17,640
Magellan's and just like, you know, you can't hit everything. So I was just like, oh yeah,

1113
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:21,400
we didn't get to Magellan's. I think it's a little more expensive, but whatever. But Magellan's is

1114
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:27,960
the headquarters of C. Oh, so you have to go to Magellan's for the report. Yes. And anything I

1115
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:33,560
I'll take pictures of anything on the wall, even if I don't understand it, I will copiously. Yeah.

1116
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:38,200
Get ready for Magellan's. Yeah. That's where they all hang out. Cool. Okay. Neat. Neat. So they all

1117
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:43,400
got a flight to Japan and they're like balloons and dergables. Well, but it's not technically Japan.

1118
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:49,960
Oh, you know what I mean? It's like what part of Disney sees it in what's the error, the theme

1119
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:56,280
volcano and stuff. So what part is that around mysterious Island? Yeah. Yeah. So it's not really

1120
01:28:56,280 --> 01:29:03,320
Japan in the fiction. I see. It was Verney. Good point. I gotta get my head. I didn't think I

1121
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:10,280
realized one of the things that like kind of tanked Discovery Bay was the sort of lackluster

1122
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:16,760
results of Island at the top of the world. Oh, okay. The movie. Uh huh. Gotcha. Yeah. I had

1123
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:21,400
never known that. Do you think somebody on one of these oars is a character from the

1124
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:28,920
Dwayne Johnson Jungle Cruise movie? Yes. Oh, yeah. That could be it. That seems right. Yeah. I

1125
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:32,520
would assume because there's a lot of been a lot of talk for years now because they've been

1126
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:37,080
they just pushed this movie back another year for some weird reason from scheduling, but they've

1127
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:40,920
been talking about this right. That's this movie for so long. They've been talking about ride

1128
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:45,960
upgrades for so long as well. So it would seem like this is something they're expecting to be

1129
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:51,800
a giant hit and expecting that they'll get money now to redo Jungle Cruises across the world. So

1130
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:57,080
it wouldn't surprise me if they were. This was a real like synergy relationship from the start,

1131
01:29:57,080 --> 01:30:02,840
but potentially, I mean, I was just listening to an older Disney dish on the drive over about how

1132
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:08,040
like imaginary has been told to pump the brakes on the, uh, the Mary Poppins. Sure. That's true.

1133
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:15,400
Sort of attractions for the UK Pavilion. That's Jim Hill, right? Yeah. You cite your sources.

1134
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:18,840
I said Disney dish. Yeah. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Yeah. You're right. I missed it.

1135
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:26,120
Now I feel like this happens a lot because that happened with gigantic for the, yeah,

1136
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:30,920
they have a lot of grand plans and then the movie doesn't, but like, when does a movie go according

1137
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:37,400
to play? Like when has a movie besides like infinity war? Well, every Marvel Awakens been

1138
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:44,200
like the openings they expect. Only Marvel movies can you at this, at this moment in time count on,

1139
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:47,800
I think. Cause yeah, I don't think, I think Mary Poppins is just according to Jim,

1140
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:53,960
just broke even across the world and now is making money. So it was not a runaway success.

1141
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:59,400
And they were talking SQL, but who knows? Yeah. So what you're saying is we will see a Captain

1142
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:08,600
Marvel Air Force recruiting center. It's like a, just, yeah, it's just an angry person going like

1143
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:13,240
you, you got what it takes kid. And then you sign up and then yeah, you're in the military

1144
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:19,400
or in the air force. I've been over your fantasizing about if, if in fact this is a reference to the

1145
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:25,640
jungle cruise movie, I would like to see a new mythology society set up, which is I'm calling

1146
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:33,320
SOAR, S O R society of rocks. And this is the mythology that ties together all of the identical

1147
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:40,520
jungle running around rocks of which there are now three, I believe. I have the IMDb up in

1148
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:49,480
jungle cruise. His name is Frank in a rampage. His name is Davis Okoye and in Jumanji, he's Spencer.

1149
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:58,120
So let's start tying to get, they all wear sorta like, just like Explorer hats or like open shirts,

1150
01:31:58,120 --> 01:32:04,440
mainly open shirts. So if they like have, if they like took all of those busted open broad chest

1151
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:09,560
shirts and hung them up on a wall somewhere. Yeah, that's great. Yeah. And then so they have SOAR,

1152
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:14,440
we have source C and space. Space is the one we're inventing. Right. But a lot of people have

1153
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:19,320
the cosmic ones. People had some great acronyms, but we're not for that. Those are great, but

1154
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:23,960
we're still working on them. Yeah. And this is, and maybe I could also propose a society of

1155
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:28,600
food centric animatronics. Oh yeah, that's good too. That's good. Yeah.

1156
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:35,240
Food animatronics, digestimatronics, what about Dinamatronics? Ooh, I like that. That's clean.

1157
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:40,840
So SOAR, the society for Dinamatronics. Are there enough? Oh, you know what problem though?

1158
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:46,440
It sounds a little like dinosaur. Confusing potentially if you were a Dinomatronic.

1159
01:32:47,240 --> 01:32:52,200
Interesting. You just gotta put that E in there. Are there enough characters in the park that drink,

1160
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:57,800
like I can think of a pirate or two with a bottle of wine to make a club for like winos.

1161
01:32:58,040 --> 01:33:05,000
Hmm. The society, the SFA, the society of functioning. Wait, no, I guess, well, it's,

1162
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:11,240
it's a, what AA is, uh, uh, alcoholics. Yeah. Audio animatronic alcoholics anonymous.

1163
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:20,200
Oh, that's good. Yeah. Who else drinks? Um, I mean the pirates, mainly pirates.

1164
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:24,360
Right. But there's gotta be a, uh, at the table in the Haunted Mansion, someone's drinking

1165
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:28,760
because you see it go into them. The old Humphrey Bogart watches the old

1166
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:33,160
Ingrid Bergman animatronic get on that plane. He takes a swig from a flask in his coat.

1167
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:43,800
The most advanced audio animatronic sequence ever made that they demolished. Yeah. He's in, uh,

1168
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:51,320
and uh, who goes canteen. Okay. Yeah. Oh, I have to sing it in the rain. Uh,

1169
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:56,920
Gene Kelly animatronic was a little tipsy in that scene. Right. Fine. He's in. Yeah. All right.

1170
01:33:57,880 --> 01:34:01,480
Mary Poppins has all that. She's drinking all that medicine. There's gotta be some alcohol in

1171
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:07,320
there. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So she had Mary Poppins. She's in awe. She's in awe.

1172
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:14,440
Like we're forgetting a big one. Who else got to be, who else drink, but are they secret alcoholics,

1173
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:20,520
which they very well might be. Right. Um, yeah. Rocket raccoon drinks. Oh yeah. Yeah.

1174
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:24,280
First guardians. He gets real hammered. Oh, that's right. So he's in a,

1175
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:29,640
this is my kind of crew. I like all these. This is, these are a lot of my favorite characters.

1176
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:35,560
You and Poppins and rocket. Oh yeah. Oh, and you know, Rex gets down to he's, he's at that

1177
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:40,680
bar every day. He's getting free. Probably it's probably how they pay him is in drinks. He is.

1178
01:34:40,680 --> 01:34:46,360
Yeah. You definitely get some drink tickets. Uh, he, but I feel like he is constantly pouring

1179
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:51,080
liquid into his, what would be his mouth and it's sparking and he goes, Oh no, I forgot.

1180
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:59,240
That's right. Wait, I can't drink. Oh no, I'm still getting used to my

1181
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:06,280
digestive programming. Um, and you know what, to tie it back together, Chuck E. Cheese gets down to

1182
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:14,520
bowler hat. Chuckie. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's why I like that guy. He's I I'm imagining like a,

1183
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:23,960
uh, who's the, who's the drummer, uh, uh, as buddy rich, like a buddy rich tape of, uh, Chuck

1184
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:30,360
scolding the munches make believe band. I'm just like, you gotta stay on rhythm munch.

1185
01:35:31,720 --> 01:35:37,480
You're fucking flat every time. I mean, are you going to make that video now? Aren't you?

1186
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:45,560
I guess. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, uh, like, yeah. Yeah. Like, like Pasquale, I took a risk on you,

1187
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:50,040
taking you out of the kitchen. Maybe I should put you back in there. Maybe I put you on toilet

1188
01:35:50,040 --> 01:35:57,240
duty is because you're, because you're drumming is shit. Hey, uh, can, uh, can security come over

1189
01:35:57,240 --> 01:36:02,360
here? There's a guy who's been sitting right by the stage for an hour, just videotaping.

1190
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:10,760
He's not bothering anyone, but I feel bothered and murmuring lines to himself in a quiet chuck.

1191
01:36:10,760 --> 01:36:17,640
Chuck was talking about alts. He keeps writing down like notes on one pad and then like all

1192
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:22,920
something called alts on index cards. And he's, and he's up to his third glass of white wine,

1193
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:28,920
which is served to Chuckie cheese. I'll head there after this. Um, we should walk over there.

1194
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:34,200
Do we not do the, uh, uh, uh, I'm, I can go either way. How long, how long are we doing?

1195
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:45,880
55. 42 minutes. So, uh, we're almost at, we're almost at 40, one hour 40. Hmm. That's plenty.

1196
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:51,000
I was saying I wanted to do it, but, um, yeah, I would like to do it, but for the sake of time.

1197
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:55,240
Yeah. Yeah. That's why we call it for another. Yeah. Then maybe we could, we did it before.

1198
01:36:55,320 --> 01:36:59,240
Mine also, I would like to have more time to research it. Cause I just went down a real,

1199
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:06,440
I found something new this morning that ties into like KTLA TV history. And I'm fascinated

1200
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:12,360
with why it is associated, why this character is associated with Disneyland. Well, um, huh.

1201
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:16,680
We have an episode that could, I had an idea. I was gonna pitch you guys that it could tie into.

1202
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:21,960
So that's like another thing we'll talk about. Okay. So, um, how do we get out of there?

1203
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:26,280
Wrap up last thoughts. Yeah. I have one other little stupid thing I want to bring up.

1204
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:31,880
Okay. Uh, uh, okay. Um, anyway, yeah, yeah. Straight, straight to Jackie cheese, straight to

1205
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:40,680
the, uh, yeah, straight to the wine, uh, uh, the wine aisle. I'll bring up mobile order wine is good.

1206
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:46,200
I'll bring up one thing I like, which is just a nerdy thing is that the original Tahitian Terrace,

1207
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:52,600
Tahitian Terrace had a sign that said sun kissed, I presume, which is like a reference to, uh,

1208
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:58,520
Dr. Livingston, I presume. Yeah. Uh, and now the new tropical hideaway has something that says

1209
01:37:58,520 --> 01:38:05,160
Dole whip, I presume. Oh, so another nerdy reference to a classic thing, which again,

1210
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:10,920
you feel it. Nerds like us feel the detail, which is why you want to go back to a place like this.

1211
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:18,040
Doing it. I discovered, uh, not, uh, not everything from Aladdin's Oasis, uh, terrible.

1212
01:38:18,040 --> 01:38:24,120
They preserved a lot of the beautiful metallic and glass lamps and stuff. And they're off in

1213
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:29,160
the corner and it says like lamps for sale. That looks very, uh, pretty and a nice nod to the

1214
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:35,000
history of the area. I like that too. Yeah. I like all, I like all the little like, uh, scenic things

1215
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:41,000
and rugs and yeah, all that stuff's fun. Good lamps, good oars, great lamps. Okay.

1216
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:47,480
Food mixed food, but I have a nice feeling about it anyway. I'll say this like, yeah, like Mike said,

1217
01:38:47,480 --> 01:38:53,480
it might just be like a dollar too much. So I'd say put that annual past discount in there,

1218
01:38:53,480 --> 01:38:58,600
but you know, they may not want people, they, they want people to come and they want people to spend.

1219
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:04,840
But when I was there, I was like eating on a trash can for a while until a table opened up.

1220
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:12,520
And even then I'm like looking around and it's like, Oh, people have posted up. And then I am,

1221
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:16,760
and then I was looking around and like, Oh, families with kids are looking for a table.

1222
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:22,120
So then I'm like, woofing it down. Cause I feel very guilty. Just make a single person taking

1223
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:27,960
up a table for four. Yeah. Yeah. Um, and you're just in your cursing that without that annual

1224
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:34,200
past discount, you, you blew 60 cents cursing up a storm yelling, you're lucky. I'm going to get

1225
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:40,600
$20 worth of personal pizzas after this, uh, which I have to say one of the, uh, the pizzas,

1226
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:47,720
again, I recommend more good except one said it came with pancetta on it, like pancetta onions

1227
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:52,200
and cherry peppers. I thought that was going to be like the little crispy kind of fatty chunks

1228
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:59,560
of bacon. And it was like shaved pork. It was more like, like Italian pork kind of, so which

1229
01:39:59,560 --> 01:40:05,480
was okay, but not what I was expecting. Anyway, definitely check out tribal hideaway and check

1230
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:11,800
out Napolini too. If you need a quick bite in downtown Disney or to get your party validated.

1231
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:16,520
What an ad. Something tells me we're even though we talked about it here, we're not done talking

1232
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:23,720
about it in general. I think Napolini is, uh, maybe there's an appellate month, maybe four

1233
01:40:23,720 --> 01:40:29,880
episodes about Napolini. Uh, all right. Yeah. That's, I like it. Uh, all that would make it

1234
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:34,360
better is plus it up is let's get just a couple of Tiki drinks in there. It doesn't have to be

1235
01:40:34,360 --> 01:40:39,240
a full bar. There's not a ton of room. Make them pre-made. I don't care. Put a jug under the

1236
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:45,080
whatever counter, just pineapple juice and put some rum in there. Who gives a shit? Let, let us

1237
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:52,920
have it. Let us have our medicine. We just want, we just want to sit and watch boats go by. Of

1238
01:40:52,920 --> 01:40:59,880
course, I understand, you know, capacity wise, but whatever, let us put, put those spots all over

1239
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:05,240
the park so we can, you know, we don't have to all be in one centralized location. Oh, uh, cast

1240
01:41:05,240 --> 01:41:11,240
members were also all great there. Lots of people walking around, taking trays, uh, all the people

1241
01:41:11,240 --> 01:41:17,400
behind the counter. Very quick, very helpful. Uh, I know it probably sucks working at a new restaurant

1242
01:41:17,400 --> 01:41:22,840
the first six months as they're figuring stuff out. Everyone was really good. Hmm. That's great. Um,

1243
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:28,040
well, I say, uh, yeah, give us our medicine, make this the first place you turn on when liquor goes

1244
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:34,920
park wide, which will happen as soon as star wars is a hit. I would think. Yeah, it's got to. Uh,

1245
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:41,080
and I say retroactively make things right every once in a while, do a show where you let a

1246
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:46,200
woman punch Indiana Jones in the face over and over again. Great. Yeah. I think that's easy now

1247
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:50,120
cause this is, this is still pretty general. So yeah, you can run shows in there once in a while.

1248
01:41:50,120 --> 01:41:54,920
Yeah, there's, yeah, it's crowded, but crowded, but I mean, I'm saying it's not tied to another IP.

1249
01:41:54,920 --> 01:42:01,880
So, you know, let Rosita attack him. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Peck his face. This is for crystal skull.

1250
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:08,040
A fridge. Are you kidding me? Bring back Mutt Williams.

1251
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:17,400
Justice for Mutt. Mike, Mike, by the way, gave me for my birthday what you're a Mutt Williams action.

1252
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:25,400
That's true. Yeah, I did. I also maintain Mutt is a fine character. I, what is down the number 20

1253
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:32,760
on the list of, of issues with that movie. That might be true. Yeah. Uh, I love that switch blade.

1254
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:41,080
Yeah. Is it funny? Sure. That's hip stuff, Daddy. Oh, all right. You survived podcast, the ride.

1262
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:24,440
heck of a job, Robert. I'm assuming ours is a lot less maintenance than the doughboys one,

1263
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:31,240
which said you were also an admin on God's getting into suicide bomber territory over there.
