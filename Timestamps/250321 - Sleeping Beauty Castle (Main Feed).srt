Hey! It's Podcast The Ride!

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride with three

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
hosts who cleverly deploy forced

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
perspective. For example,

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Mike appears quite tall,

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
but in reality he's actually

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
a good deal shorter than Jason.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Funny how that works. You wouldn't

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
know when you see us on stage it's really

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
it's a very clever forced perspective

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
thing. Yeah you know this is Mike and

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
yes Bob Gurr designed Jason and I

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
almost 40 years

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
ago to this day. So we're coming

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
out about that. That's interesting. I've

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
heard that rumor. Yeah no it's true.

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I've seen it online but you're affirming this

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
only the clever

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
engineering mind could have created

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Jason Sheridan. You know I

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
put enough turrets on my head

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and paint on my body. That's

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
the thing people don't know after hours

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
a lot of paint needs to be updated

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
on me to keep the illusion

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
consistent.

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
There's a lot of maintenance going on. Your touch up team

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
your perpetual round the clock glam squad.

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And also got a great deal

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
on of that lead boy paint

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
or whatever it was. Lead

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
boy? What was it called?

45
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Dutch boy? Huh?

46
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Dutch boy lead paint. Yeah.

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yeah I don't think they were so

48
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
out with the lead

49
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
paint nature that it was in. Lead

50
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
boy. Lead boy.

51
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It might have been in the subhead.

52
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Like I feel like it was like

53
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Dutch boy lead paint or

54
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
something. Yeah forget the name of it.

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Okay wait. Dutch boy tomorrow

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
land. What was the actual thing? We're talking about

57
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
a weird original Disneyland.

58
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Let's see.

59
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It was something called our future. Oh

60
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Dutch boy paint gallery. So

61
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
yeah not lead boy

62
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
or

63
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
it's a fun idea though. If they really

64
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
had I mean it definitely was an exhibit

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
that involved how lead

66
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
paint will be part of our future. Right.

67
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But if it had been much more so

68
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
like they say 70

69
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
years in the future this

70
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
paint will be 10 times

71
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
as leady as it is today.

72
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I mean artists do your work. Jason

73
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Sheridan is lead boy. Lead boy?

74
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Sure I'll take it.

75
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Rejected 50's mascot

76
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
lead boy. Lead paint

77
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
marketing I feel like was like the

78
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
four out of five doctors recommend

79
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Chesterfields for your T-zone.

80
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Good for your T-zone.

81
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What's up with T-zone? T-zone like

82
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
your mouth, your nose

83
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
mouth. That was called the

84
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
T-zone? T-zone was a thing

85
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
in marketing. What does it mean

86
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
though? I think it's just like

87
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
your general lower

88
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
face area. That's confusing

89
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
because when you say T-zone I go to a different

90
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
part of the body. What do you

91
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
mean below the belt?

92
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Well that's the P-zone.

93
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yeah

94
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
that's the P-zone. That's why I was confused.

95
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Oh I see. When I think

96
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
T I think testosterone. Yeah which is

97
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
down in your P-zone. Or your T-zone

98
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
isn't it? I think testosterone is everywhere.

99
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I mean look. It's all

100
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
around us. I think of the engine

101
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
of the T-zone as being

102
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
your two T's.

103
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Is it the testosterone engine down there?

104
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Is that what it is? Am I just completely ignorant?

105
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Maybe.

106
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You think testosterone is coming out of your

107
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
knees? I mean I don't think it's coming

108
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
out of my knees. My T-zone is

109
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
my knee zone. Circulating.

110
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I don't know exactly where hormones are generated.

111
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You guys talk amongst yourselves.

112
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm going to find out where testosterone

113
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
comes from. Maybe it's the balls. Maybe it makes

114
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
sense I guess when you're saying it.

115
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I think there's glands.

116
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
If you were exposed to a lot

117
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
of lead paint in the 1950s

118
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
then that may have caused

119
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
your balls to expand to such

120
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
a rapid degree that people

121
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
would think it was a massive

122
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
throbbing T-zone. But really

123
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
that was just lead paint. T-zone could be

124
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
lower below the belt if you're talking

125
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
tinkle time.

126
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Excuse me? Tinkle time? Tinkle time, yeah.

127
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
When you go pee? Yeah, tinkle.

128
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You gotta tinkle. We're throwing a lot of

129
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I have the answer. Scott is correct.

130
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The majority of it is produced in the

131
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
testes. Where else

132
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
in your mind? But the adrenal glands is also

133
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
part, they make a smaller amount

134
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
of testosterone. Now here's

135
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
a dumb question. Where are the adrenal glands?

136
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Your adrenal glands are like right here. Okay, okay.

137
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So you are mostly correct.

138
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Okay, I see. But the adrenals make some

139
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I don't think my eyeballs

140
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
are producing all of my testosterone.

141
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Well I know you have like other different

142
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
glands. That's the only reason. So obviously

143
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
you were right. I'm just saying. Got tea shooting out

144
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
of my teeth. Yeah. I mean

145
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
the only one so far who's measured their tea

146
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
is me. But we still need to get definitive

147
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
tea rankings for the three of us I think.

148
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The audience really wants it.

149
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Do I just have to ask

150
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Next time you're doing a physical ask I think.

151
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I don't think

152
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
it's any extra. There's nothing

153
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
about me

154
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
that makes me believe mine

155
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
would be especially high or

156
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
higher than yours. I'll

157
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
just set the bar there.

158
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So if I'm incorrect. Right.

159
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
But maybe that's

160
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
kind of a mental tea block.

161
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I don't know. Maybe it's very high.

162
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You're making your tea lower.

163
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yeah. Or just assuming as such.

164
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I bet your tea is pretty good.

165
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I could be wrong. But I bet your tea is pretty good.

166
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Two kids.

167
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Well it might

168
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
have something to do with it. It's not ten kids.

169
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
But it's something. No it's not ten.

170
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It'll

171
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
never be two. If I had twice

172
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
made quintuplets.

173
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You're a pronatalist guy.

174
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You're one of those. What do you think

175
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
your tea would be? If you had to stack it

176
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
against.

177
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
If I'm thinking mine's lower than

178
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Mike's. And Mike's.

179
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Mine isn't.

180
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Well as we talked about before I was kind of disappointed

181
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
with mine. But then I saw what other

182
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
people had and it made me look like a

183
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
king or something. Like made me look like a warrior

184
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
of some kind. So I

185
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
was totally off on what I even expected.

186
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I think it's a big assumption also that kings have

187
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
high tea. That's why it's changed to warrior.

188
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
That's good. Because kings

189
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
might set out to become

190
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
kings in order to make up

191
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
for the lack of tea.

192
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I've been taking a lot of vitamin D lately.

193
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And I feel like, I feel like pretty good.

194
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So you're in your D zone.

195
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I think I'm in my D zone but it's helping my tea.

196
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And I wasn't taking the vitamin D as much back when I

197
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
had my tea tested. That was last year.

198
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So I'm taking the D to help the tea.

199
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I take D and

200
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
a B complex.

201
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So okay I take the D

202
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
in my T zone and it helps

203
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
my tea. You have to fill in, you just

204
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
point it to your mouth. The listener can't see

205
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
your mouth. My T zone.

206
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I said my T zone. I said my T zone like Jason

207
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
said. Yeah.

208
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
But you have to, the listener can't understand the point.

209
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
When you're just pointing at yourself you're in your P

210
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
zone. But they could hear, they could hear

211
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
the brushing of the, I assume they could,

212
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
the wind off of my. But that might be your finger

213
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
on your way down to below the belt. Yeah I guess

214
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
you're right. Below the B zone. Well I meant in my mouth.

215
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I take the D in my mouth

216
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
and it helps my tea. You take a big

217
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
tea in, yeah well you're going to end up with more tea

218
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
if you take a big D in your mouth. Very good point.

219
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Jason if you had to guess

220
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
where do you think you're falling? You know

221
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I don't really know. My immune system

222
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
is just constantly pulverized

223
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
these days by various

224
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
things. It's not fair. Your reading won't be fair.

225
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I've done some looking

226
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
and actually I did see

227
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
a video

228
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
from

229
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
another MS patient

230
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
who takes the same

231
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
okra, he takes the okra

232
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
in conjunction

233
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
with a testosterone

234
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
supplement. And he says he thinks

235
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
that is helping.

236
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Now, but I did some research

237
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
there hasn't been many definitive

238
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
studies, there's only been like one or two

239
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
studies back in 2007.

240
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Let's run a study. I will be in charge of it.

241
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
We'll do it just you and I

242
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
and we'll do a study on it. Just Mike

243
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
injecting me with

244
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
he comes over. Mike injecting you with

245
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
this big tea.

246
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Neugenics infusions every day

247
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
does not tell me about

248
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
like oh by the way unless you cancel

249
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
this at auto renews.

250
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's $80 a month.

251
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Don't believe the television commercials.

252
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Well we'll figure it out

253
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
and then we'll. I'll mention

254
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
to my doctor when I

255
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
need to go in for a physical at some

256
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
point soon. You say

257
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
ok so I've been you know I've been wondering

258
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
if maybe like an injection of extra tea

259
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
would help. So should my friend Mike come

260
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
over and put his D in my mouth.

261
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Just say it like that

262
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
too and if he needs to talk to me give him

263
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
my number because he can call me

264
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
and run it by me too. Hey Doc

265
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm up for it. I'll do it right now. Should I go over

266
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
there right now? Write me a prescription and go over

267
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
there. This is the Sleeping Beauty Castle

268
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
episode.

269
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Probably the

270
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
tamest possible

271
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
topic and here we've defouled

272
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
it instantly.

273
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It started with just the T whatever the T zone

274
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
he said he was talking about.

275
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'll find old cigarette ads.

276
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Chesterfield. There was no way the phrase

277
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
T zone was going to be said and have it

278
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
not send us into a direction like

279
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
that. But let me corral things

280
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
a little bit. Not quite

281
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
to get to the topic yet but to talk about

282
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
some other show plans.

283
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Some podcast business

284
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
that I've been wanting to talk about because we're all

285
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
here together after

286
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
some host departures and returns.

287
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
We seem to be here at least for the time

288
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
being. We'll see what happens.

289
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
But while we're here I think this is

290
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
a good chance to go over some

291
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
stuff that we might want to do

292
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
this year and some shots to call and

293
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
maybe this will hold us to doing some

294
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
things if we start kind of dangling some plans

295
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
that we think could be some fun plans

296
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
as I think these are. So

297
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
here's one. I'll address

298
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
this now. There was a shot

299
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
that I called before leaving

300
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
to make the movie and that shot was

301
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Celebruary 2.

302
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Now Celebruary

303
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
has passed and there was no Celebruary.

304
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Could April

305
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
become Celebruapril?

306
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I guess possibly. But

307
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
without going into it for various

308
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
mundane reasons it seems

309
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
like waiting on Celebruary 2

310
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
is going to be the thing to do. I think we will have a

311
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
stronger,

312
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
better, more coursing

313
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
with T version of

314
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Celebruary.

315
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So I think we are going to

316
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
put that in the T zone by which

317
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I mean table it until

318
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
2026. I think that is the plan.

319
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I think so. That sounds right.

320
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Flag on the field.

321
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Life finds way at some point

322
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
but for now we're pulling the Chinese

323
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
democracy on that one.

324
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I guess so.

325
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
We're going to get sooner

326
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
than that I think.

327
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Less weight than that.

328
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But what happened

329
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
and it is very much still in the cards.

330
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
We are thinking about that. We are going to do it.

331
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
But even thinking about Celebruary

332
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
got us

333
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
a little bit hungry.

334
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It got us hungry for a few things. It got us hungry for a

335
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
theme month which is something we haven't really done in a

336
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
while. It got us hungry for

337
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
theming and IP

338
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
as it relates to the world of

339
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
restaurants specifically.

340
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And there's you know

341
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
for whatever reason this theme park podcast

342
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
when we start to veer restaurant

343
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
suddenly is where things are really cooking.

344
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And with

345
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
that in mind there is a

346
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
giant area that we have

347
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
not covered where theming

348
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
and restaurant meet and

349
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
merge and make beautiful love.

350
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And I think that's why I

351
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
want to announce this for this

352
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
year to try to lock it in and

353
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
commit without saying

354
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
when it will be exactly. I

355
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
would like to announce for

356
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
hopefully the near future

357
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
podcast The Ride 2025

358
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
McMonth.

359
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
McMonth. A month

360
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
long celebration of

361
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
all things McDonald's except the

362
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
food.

363
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
We kind of floated this as a test

364
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
balloon online.

365
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I thought it was responded to very well.

366
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It seems like kind of a cousin

367
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
of Celebruary.

368
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And one that I'm very excited about where

369
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
it's one of those where if it seems a little

370
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
ridiculous on its face

371
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
you start adding it up and then you start to go

372
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
can it even all fit within a month?

373
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
There is so much there because this

374
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
becomes our opportunity.

375
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
And please tell me what you guys flash to.

376
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
But I'd say the big things

377
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
you know, McDonald

378
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Land, I mean the Play Lands

379
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
are its own thing, right?

380
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
These slides and these things that

381
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
you wander around, the mouths that you

382
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
go in, the heads that you get to sit

383
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
in, the McDonald Land characters

384
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
are on the table, Grimace is

385
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
on the table, Uncle O Grimacey

386
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
is on the table.

387
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Mac motherfucking tonight

388
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
is on the table. There is a

389
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
lot here I think.

390
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I think we will find that McMonth is

391
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
teeming, bursting at the

392
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
seams. But as I say

393
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
this, do you guys flash to anything?

394
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And I throw it to the listeners too,

395
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
like what do you think deserves

396
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
its own carved out territory in

397
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
McMonth?

398
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Fry guys,

399
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
birdie bringing you breakfast.

400
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
The symbol of breakfast.

401
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
She is the symbol of breakfast? I believe she was

402
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
introduced when McDonald's started pushing

403
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
breakfast. She's like an early

404
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
bird. Oh right, that's right, you're right.

405
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And

406
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Officer Big Mac may

407
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
make cheese.

408
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Now I don't know

409
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
if every one of these gets their own

410
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
star episode. No, no, I'm just

411
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
talking about. But we will meet and discuss

412
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
all of these people and get to know them very well.

413
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Well, and when you

414
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
didn't mention, the

415
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
founder.

416
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
The film.

417
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Ray Kroc, oh I'd love to do the founder.

418
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Ray Kroc, the McDonald's brothers.

419
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Oh my god, this is

420
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'm very fond of this film. That is

421
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
one of those just like perfectly

422
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
not average, it's better than average.

423
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You'd never call it an A plus

424
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
movie. It's in that

425
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
late shift zone. It's just like

426
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
the B plus-iest of B plus

427
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
movies.

428
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
You let a wolf into

429
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
the hen house.

430
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Dick, Ray Kroc

431
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
took everything. He took our names.

432
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm going to take it. I saw your name, I'm going to take it.

433
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I took it, I did, I'm going to take it.

434
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm a big fan.

435
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I've done a

436
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
lot of little founders plays in my

437
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
head. The milkshake, the

438
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
powdered milkshake at the steak house.

439
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Oh yes, that Linda Cardellini makes

440
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
so suggestively.

441
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It's really good. I like it.

442
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Got it in the lips there.

443
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Well we have to do that I guess now.

444
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I guess so. Thank you

445
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
for, this is good, I'm glad I asked.

446
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
A more recent one that

447
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I, you know,

448
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
we were busy being

449
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
teenagers or adolescents so I wasn't

450
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
tracking the McDonald's lore as

451
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
closely, but a few years ago

452
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
learning about, and I haven't watched

453
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
them all, but the Klaski, Suspo,

454
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
McDonald,

455
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Land, Chupo.

456
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Those kind of,

457
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
it's like really jagged

458
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Klaski, Chupo,

459
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
late 90's.

460
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Very much in that grotesque,

461
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
real monsters vein.

462
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
That made it a little bit far, you know some

463
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
of these, like Uncle Ogrimacy

464
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
was in a Club 3 poll, the Klaski

465
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Chupo cartoons were in Club 3, and then Club 3 is part

466
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
of this. I think if there's suggestions for

467
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
what does Club 3 want in

468
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
McDonald's world specifically,

469
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
we can figure that out. Yeah,

470
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I have a thing that pops into my head that you're not

471
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
going to like. Uh oh,

472
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
am I going to have to cancel the whole month now?

473
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
McDonald's points.

474
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Come on. It's its own

475
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
whole episode.

476
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
If the listener wants it, that's what

477
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
popped into my head. If they

478
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
want it, we'll see. And you think McDonald's

479
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
points are so specific in such a big

480
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
area that it could not possibly be

481
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
contained within. I didn't say it couldn't.

482
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I didn't say it couldn't. I just said it could.

483
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Grimace is kind of like

484
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
de facto Mets

485
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
mascot. He is?

486
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Is he? He kind of like

487
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
the Mets

488
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
fan base, I feel like kind of adopted

489
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
him. He might have

490
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
thrown out a picture or something in

491
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
the 2024 season.

492
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Is Mr. Mets still there? Mr. Mets

493
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
and Mrs. Mets are still there.

494
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
But they've adopted Grimace. But Grimace

495
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
is also kind of. He's their third?

496
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Skull King. He threw out the first

497
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
pitch somewhere in the run of

498
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
a seven game winning streak.

499
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
So he's beloved.

500
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Also merchandise.

501
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
McDonald's merchandise, including

502
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
the Happy Meal Toys. Happy Meal Toys.

503
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
That's three hours. That's great.

504
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
We can go. Narrowing it down.

505
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Yeah.

506
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Yeah. No, there's

507
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
so much to end and not even getting into

508
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
world's largest McDonald's, the

509
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
non-standard McDonald's, the weird McDonald's,

510
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
the Roswell UFO McDonald's.

511
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
There's so much here.

512
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Narrowing it down will be the hardest test of all.

513
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
This might be McMonth 1.

514
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Possibly. Yeah, yeah.

515
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
But let's do what we can.

516
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
McDonald's video games.

517
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
McDonald's video games. Jesus.

518
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Alright, so we better

519
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
do McMonth 1 so that

520
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
we can clear the path for McMonth 2.

521
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Give us your suggestions. I'm curious

522
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
anything anybody wants out of this.

523
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I think it'll be good.

524
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I think that's going to be a good old time.

525
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Now, to weave

526
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
us into today's topic. Today's topic

527
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
is also part of a broader

528
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
plan that we have cooking for

529
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
2025 because 2025

530
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
is the 70th

531
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
anniversary of

532
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Disneyland Park. And that seems

533
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
like as good a time as any

534
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
to cover things that

535
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
have been there from the beginning.

536
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Disneyland primaries,

537
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
classics, basics,

538
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
perennials. We have a lot on

539
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
the list of things that have been there

540
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
since day one. And it seems

541
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
like it would be a good idea to

542
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
tie them all together and to cover it

543
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
in this 70th

544
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
anniversary year. The platinum celebration

545
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
as everyone is saying.

546
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Double diamond.

547
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Oh man, they didn't use that.

548
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Like

549
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
podcast the ride's platinum celebration is one

550
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
way of branding it. I had another way

551
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
of branding it, which is calling this the class of 55.

552
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I have one more

553
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
way of branding it, which is getting a little

554
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
fancier and not just saying

555
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
class of 55, but saying class of

556
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
55.

557
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
My man.

558
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
That jazz

559
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
is it up? Yeah, that's great.

560
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'll leave that on the desktop.

561
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
That'll be ready to go anytime. They need to do

562
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
that for the commercials, the official commercial.

563
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Yeah, they got to license that.

564
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Most numbers

565
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
and years aren't shouted

566
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
by one of the great restaurateurs

567
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
in that way. It's the Red Rocker himself,

568
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Sammy Hagar. Yeah, yeah. There should be a

569
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Cabo Wabo with Downtown Disney.

570
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
But for some reason.

571
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Well, there should have been and it should have gone

572
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
out of business to clear a path for all the new

573
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
stuff they're doing. Yeah, I just saw

574
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Tortilla Joe's officially being gutted

575
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
right now.

576
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It's like a steak and bourbon place coming.

577
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Steak and bourbon.

578
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I'm kind of interested by it. I don't know what

579
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
the restaurant is called, but I was

580
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
real because I was so

581
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
annoyed at the like steak

582
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
and bourbon. Why are you annoyed?

583
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It's just a little exalt.

584
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
We're still doing this.

585
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
What do you mean? I'm not sure what he means either.

586
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I guess people are

587
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
still eating steak and bourbon. The faux

588
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
masculinity branding.

589
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It's

590
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
on the giant walls.

591
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's called Arthur and Sons Steak

592
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
and Bourbon. That's too much faux masculinity

593
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
for you. Nothing.

594
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It's just nothing.

595
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
First you already got Arthur.

596
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
There's one man.

597
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Patriarchy much.

598
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And then Sons? We've just added at least two more.

599
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
It just seems like nothing.

600
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It doesn't even say

601
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
steak and bourbon on it. It says Arthur and

602
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Sons and it's like a mid-century modern thing

603
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
that fits into the rest of downtown Disney.

604
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I don't know. I don't agree with you one bit.

605
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I'm confused by you. It just seems like

606
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
a little gibberish.

607
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It's a little Sip and Sonder

608
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
for me.

609
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Sip and Sonder doesn't tell you anything because what do you sip on

610
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
and what even is Sonder?

611
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It's acknowledging the inner

612
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
lives of the people around you.

613
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
We know what Sonder means.

614
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
But I know what steak is and I know

615
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
what bourbon is and I know what sons are

616
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
and I know that Arthur is a popular name in this

617
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
world. I don't know. What is one thing

618
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
that's obtuse about that?

619
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Did you think it was like Andrew

620
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Tate's Steak and Bourbon restaurant

621
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
or something?

622
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Tony Hinchcliffe presents Arthur and Sons.

623
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It seems like a nasty combo to me.

624
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Steak and bourbon?

625
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
What are you talking about? It's a great combo.

626
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It's a wonderful combo.

627
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
It is delicious. What's happening?

628
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Honestly, I don't know. I don't even

629
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I feel like if we dig in it's going to destroy the rest of the

630
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
episode, quite frankly. I don't want

631
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
to talk about the castle. I'm confused though.

632
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Scotch and steak I

633
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
can say. It's smokier.

634
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Kind of makes more sense. But it's harsher though.

635
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Why wouldn't bourbon's mellower?

636
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I don't think

637
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
bourbon is mellower at all.

638
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
What? I completely think

639
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
it's a little mellower.

640
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I don't know. It sounds delicious

641
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
to me. I know. I'd love to go have some steak

642
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
and bourbon. This is the most contentious the show has ever been

643
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
or at least in the last two years.

644
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
This is like country bears level

645
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I think we're at right here when we had

646
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
the disagreement. So if we said we're going

647
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
for work for the podcast

648
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
we're taking you to Arthur and Sons.

649
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Wow. What if we made you have steak

650
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
and bourbon together?

651
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Maybe steak and water?

652
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Maybe

653
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
a little sloppy steak.

654
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
If you don't want to drink that's fine.

655
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
To me that is the most natural

656
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
combo in the world.

657
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm not sure. Look I don't know.

658
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I don't know what's happening.

659
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I don't like to drink too much

660
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
in my early 20s. I don't understand.

661
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I'm just showing you this picture of

662
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
a chef on the outside.

663
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I hate to keep digging in

664
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
but you called like the like because this doesn't seem

665
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
so like aggressively masculine

666
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
to me. It doesn't seem like he's not

667
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
like smoking a big stogie and he's shirtless

668
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
making a steak and bourbon or anything.

669
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
No that picture looks

670
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
like stock image.

671
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
They both look like stock

672
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
image. It just seems

673
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I don't know it just seems a little hollow

674
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
to me. Hollow?

675
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
As opposed to Tortilla

676
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Joe's a restaurant that I

677
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
only went to once and it made me sick.

678
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Tortilla Joe's at least I mean he's a guy

679
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I guess you can think of him as like a little guy.

680
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I'm not saying I'm mad at Tortilla Joe's.

681
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Joe good. Arthur toxic.

682
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
We haven't seen what Arthur and his son look like

683
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
though. We don't know. We're

684
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
looking at the sons.

685
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
They're bare naked at all times

686
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
waving their big

687
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
flappy hogs around. These guys

688
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
are disgusting.

689
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
They're what's wrong with society.

690
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
They're like UFC fighters

691
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
or something.

692
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
And they're jacked.

693
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Fascinating. Well this is going to be

694
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
a big I didn't think about this.

695
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I didn't even know the name of the restaurant.

696
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I didn't know the name of the restaurant.

697
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Immediately it's now one of the great podcasts

698
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
The Ride Debates. This is going to be

699
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
open what in the next year I hope.

700
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
And we're all going to have to do it.

701
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Unless Jason burns the construction

702
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
site down. I hope he doesn't

703
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
because I'm interested in trying it.

704
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
But maybe you know if it happens it happens.

705
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Okay. So

706
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
with that

707
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
alright nevermind Class of 55

708
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
cancelled. It's going to be shit like this

709
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
from now on. No no no but I think like

710
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
as a you know maybe not as a series that

711
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
runs together but something like Tomorrowland

712
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
which ended up taking us a little bit

713
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
but a kind of when in doubt

714
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
when we got no other ideas like what's

715
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
something that we can default to

716
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
it seems like covering some Class of 55

717
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
stuff could be good the rides that are still around

718
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
maybe some original weird old

719
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
school stuff that has disappeared or things that never

720
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
got built. I flashed to some other things.

721
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
One thing that I flashed to is The Bench.

722
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I think that's an episode for sure we

723
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
discussed this a little bit. By which I mean

724
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Walt's Bench. The place where

725
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
he sat and stewed

726
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
while his daughters went on a

727
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
merry-go-round without him. And one question

728
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I've always had is why weren't you on the

729
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
merry-go-round? I've been to that specific

730
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
merry-go-round and it's quite easy to be on it

731
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
with your children. So I don't understand

732
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
why he felt like and then he just

733
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
ended up building a carousel that also a dad

734
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
could not be on. I've always

735
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
been confused by the story

736
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
but that's one of the things that we can delve into

737
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
the Griffith Park Carousel

738
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Origins of Disneyland.

739
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
There's potentially an episode out there

740
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
called Disneyland

741
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
where we just like talk

742
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
about the origins, whatever.

743
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I mean I kind of like

744
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
that deep into the podcast

745
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
with all these micro topics

746
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
that at some point we would just do Disneyland

747
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
and figure out what that means.

748
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
The orange groves.

749
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
The orange groves.

750
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Absolutely.

751
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Oh and who owned these lands before and how

752
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
they pieced it all together. There's a lot of

753
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
primaries in just

754
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Disneyland here at 70. And it seems like

755
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
a good thing for us to do.

756
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I think

757
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
we carry a little bit

758
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
of a mantle like we need

759
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
to celebrate Disneyland 70th

760
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
because my suspicion is Disneyland

761
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
is not really going to celebrate Disneyland 70th.

762
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Well there'll be some

763
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
banners.

764
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Banners on Carthay and maybe they'll repaint

765
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
the theater.

766
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
It's under scrims and scaffolding

767
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
right now. So there's going to be some paint

768
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
and there's going to be some signs

769
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
and it'll say 70th.

770
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Projection mapping. Maybe a little

771
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
projection mapping. There's some drips and

772
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
drabs. Obviously we're getting the Walt robot

773
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
but I don't know.

774
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
The Walt robot's a big one. That's a summer blockbuster

775
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
for us. We're going to have to get there soon.

776
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
But we're going to have to get there in August because we're not going to be able to

777
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
go with our shit passes.

778
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
It just occurred to me

779
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
for making near future plans

780
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
that like oh I don't get Fridays.

781
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
How dare I want a Friday.

782
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
We're both on the same worst one

783
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
and you don't get Fridays.

784
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
We'll get to it but it's going to have to be

785
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
August by the time we

786
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
see it. But it got delayed until July.

787
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Maybe it gets delayed longer.

788
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Are they trying to have Walt robot up and running

789
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
for the actual day?

790
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
For the actual day probably. I would hope.

791
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Gotcha.

792
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Get in line Fantastic Foreign Jurassic World

793
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Rebirth.

794
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
The blockbuster this summer is the Walt robot.

795
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
People flocking

796
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
saying no we're not going to the movies. We're going to Anaheim.

797
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I don't have time to see a movie.

798
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Fantastic Four coming to Tomorrowland.

799
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
In Disneyland.

800
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
You say this like as if it's for sure.

801
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
It is.

802
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Walk around.

803
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I know I thought you were referring to

804
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
things that we've texted about because you have the theory

805
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
that Fantastic Four is the best hope

806
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
that we have for Tomorrowland to get a little bit of juice

807
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
in it because it's kind of this throwbacky

808
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
mod thing and we always feel like

809
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Tomorrowland just needs to go back to 60s

810
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
vibe. And Feige on stage said

811
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
modeled after Epcot and

812
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Tomorrowland. The aesthetic of the movie.

813
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Alright. So

814
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
maybe they'll be meeting a little

815
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
lead boy.

816
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Scott's not the only one

817
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
who's been off on Secret

818
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Project.

819
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
It's clobbering time.

820
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I'm doing what Mike did

821
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
earlier. I'm doing physical

822
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
movements.

823
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
As lead boy are you fighting the Fantastic Four

824
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
or are you their friend?

825
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I'm just one of Mole Man's disgusting

826
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
creatures that like skitter

827
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
around behind him. You're a lackey for

828
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Mole Man. Yeah.

829
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
He's already kind of a lackeyish villain let's be

830
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
honest. Yeah he's a lackey

831
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Alda of Horde. He's got mole people

832
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
but still yeah. Yeah. Well alright.

833
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
We're excited about that. I think if Fantastic Four doesn't

834
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
work it's not only

835
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
it's so much trouble for Tomorrowland

836
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
ever getting a redo but also like

837
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
is Marvel just are we

838
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
done with the MCU if Fantastic Four

839
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
bombs? It seems like the last

840
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
hope. I think we got two big ones

841
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
coming and if those don't do well

842
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
then we'll see. Yeah.

843
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
They're putting a lot of money into those. I liked

844
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
hearing that Robert Downey Jr. is apparently

845
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
writing a lot of backstory for

846
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Doctor Doom. If only there

847
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
was already

848
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
sixty years of

849
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
backstory available for

850
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Doctor Doom. I also think

851
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
by a bunch of losers by people who

852
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
don't have the brains. They don't have the

853
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
brains of RDJ. I wouldn't worry

854
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
too hard about him working on

855
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
the backstory. I wouldn't worry

856
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
about him. He's gonna work too hard.

857
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
He's gonna think of too much. I wouldn't worry.

858
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
And he's going there. He's taking pictures of Stark

859
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
flight tests or whatever.

860
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I know. I saw the photos. Yeah. Yeah.

861
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
And he has glasses on. I know. He's thinking

862
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
really hard about it. I like the ride better.

863
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Yeah. Yeah. He said he's gonna stay

864
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
on after he's done with Marvel.

865
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
He's gonna stay on helping Imagineering.

866
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
That's what he said.

867
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Really? Yeah.

868
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Okay. Yeah.

869
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Got my work cut out for me.

870
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Everybody's slacking around here.

871
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
What's he gonna

872
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
do? He looks good question. I don't know.

873
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Like, wow, it's incredible.

874
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Robert Downey Jr. personally figured out

875
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
how to make the Matterhorn smooth again.

876
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Yeah. He saw what

877
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
none of us could.

878
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
All right. Well, we look forward to his work. Maybe he'll

879
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
come be on the show. Maybe we can interview him purely

880
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
as an Imagineer.

881
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
And then it'll be the Billy Bob effect of like

882
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
now people know you for your other career as an actor

883
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
and then he warms out of the room.

884
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Yeah, sure. It could happen.

885
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
But it's worth a shot. RDJ's at

886
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Imagineering. Ariana Grande

887
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
says she has ideas for

888
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
wicked projects in the parks.

889
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
These actors

890
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
are chair Imagineers now, you know?

891
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Yeah. Everybody thinks they can do it.

892
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Only we can.

893
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Only the three of us can. Our genius ride ideas

894
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
we throw out sometimes. That's right.

895
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
We're the pros.

896
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
So, anyways,

897
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
that brings us to this point, and this

898
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I guess would be considered the first

899
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
of the class of 55.

900
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Oh no, I don't have it teed up.

901
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
55!

902
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
And that is a real

903
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
fundamental, the most fundamental

904
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Sleeping Beauty

905
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
castle. I think it makes

906
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
sense as a place to start.

907
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
It is the centerpiece

908
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
of everything. It was

909
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
the symbol of the park before there even

910
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
was a park. They

911
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
wedded America's Appetites

912
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
in 1954

913
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
with concept art of this castle.

914
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
So by the time anybody got to the park

915
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
in 55, they knew it

916
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
from their TVs already.

917
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
They knew it. They loved it.

918
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Sleeping Beauty Castle is pretty damn

919
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
important. And yet it took us eight years.

920
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
What happened? I don't know. Too many

921
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
restaurants. Life got in the way.

922
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Life finds a way.

923
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Life finds a way to get in the way.

924
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
That's

925
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
like a mug or a towel or a

926
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
pillow. You gotta get that.

927
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Oh, that should be on what's the store at Downtown

928
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Well, it's gone, I think. Yeah, I know. But what was it?

929
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I don't know. Sleeping Saunders.

930
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
It's all 28.

931
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
The one that just had a wooden plank that

932
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
said imagine all the people.

933
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
It's a hundred dollars.

934
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Yeah.

935
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I don't know.

936
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Everyone likes the castle, I think.

937
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
The only time I ever hear anything negative is

938
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
when people are comparing it

939
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
to bigger castles. That's the only time I ever hear

940
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
anybody trash it. Sure.

941
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Mike, I wanted to ask you that because

942
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
you grew up in the Midwest. I grew up on the East

943
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Coast and

944
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
we went to

945
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Disney World fairly

946
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
regularly, so any times we

947
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
would see clips of Disneyland,

948
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
we'd be like, that castle's so

949
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
small. I want to go to Florida. It's massive.

950
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I understand there's an adjustment.

951
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Yes. Because it does

952
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
feel kind of like a toy castle. The first

953
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
couple times you go and

954
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
you're used to the Cinderella Castle from Orlando.

955
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
So I understand it,

956
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
but if you go to Disneyland enough,

957
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I think you really grow to

958
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
love it and appreciate it.

959
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
This is interesting. Is this a perspective thing?

960
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Do I prefer

961
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
the humble charms

962
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
of Sleeping Beauty Castle, being

963
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
that that was my home park?

964
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Yeah. Do you have a...

965
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Gosh, I don't know.

966
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Well, it's a good fundamental

967
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
debate to get into at the top here.

968
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
It seems like one of those

969
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Mitch

970
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
he probably did this in our third episode

971
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
or whenever we had Mitch on. He was

972
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
probably like, it's bigger. Cinderella's

973
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
bigger. It's better.

974
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I would imagine. I think that the

975
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
coziness of Disneyland itself

976
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
and by the statue and everything,

977
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
all of that

978
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
together makes me actually now like

979
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Sleeping Beauty's castle better.

980
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
But if it was just

981
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I would say if it was just the castles

982
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
completely separate from the

983
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
actual theme parks themselves,

984
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I can see the

985
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Cinderella you liking it better.

986
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
It's a bit hard to argue.

987
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I mean, one is more of like a

988
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
architectural

989
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
marvel. Yeah. But I do like

990
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
being in Disneyland in that

991
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
area on Main Street better than I like

992
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
being in the Magic Kingdom, even though I still like

993
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
being there in Magic Kingdom.

994
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Are you like more at ease?

995
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I think it just feels comforting. It feels comforting

996
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
to me more so.

997
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Again, I don't dislike being on

998
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Main Street in Florida, but

999
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
often there's some big stage.

1000
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
It does feel like there's always a lot of nonsense

1001
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
in Florida, too. I was thinking how

1002
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I have very few memories of just

1003
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
walking in the castle gate.

1004
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Like walking

1005
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
over the bridge

1006
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
in Florida, because usually there's something going on.

1007
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Something going on. There's so much more space

1008
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
there. So again, you're in the

1009
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
coziness of Disneyland and

1010
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
you see the castle there. Now I do

1011
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
prefer that experience as a

1012
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
whole. But I

1013
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
can, I could, I don't know

1014
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
if I have necessarily a preference

1015
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
separating the castles from their location.

1016
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
This, a

1017
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
lot of websites mentioned, of course

1018
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
this is the only castle Walt

1019
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
ever worked on

1020
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
when he was alive, like had

1021
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
a hand in the direct

1022
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
development. Sure, yes.

1023
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
And it was

1024
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
specifically from him

1025
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
originally, like

1026
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
the origins of there being a

1027
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
castle go back to the sketch

1028
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
that Herb Ryman did, I think

1029
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
in 53, which was

1030
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
like, it's one of those, if you look up

1031
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Herb Ryman Disneyland

1032
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
map or Disneyland plans,

1033
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
it's one of those images you know for sure.

1034
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Like, oh yes, they've put this up in like

1035
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Disney Gallery or, you know,

1036
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
like the Lincoln lobby or whatever.

1037
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
It's one of those, like, it's not the

1038
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Disneyland we know, but it sure has

1039
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
a lot in common with it.

1040
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And a lot of the, like, original base ideas.

1041
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
So that, I think

1042
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
he left Herb Ryman

1043
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
to do this sketch.

1044
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
And he said, biggest thing,

1045
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
it's all got to build to a huge

1046
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
castle. That's going to be the symbol of

1047
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
the whole park, we need a castle in there.

1048
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
And what he drew,

1049
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
it was all the way in the back.

1050
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
It was like the entire park built

1051
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
to it as opposed to it being the centerpiece.

1052
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
And it was also

1053
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
a lot bigger.

1054
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
It was like,

1055
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
yeah, just like a more

1056
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
imposing

1057
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
European rising up

1058
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
over everything kind of castle.

1059
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
And I think it was his decision

1060
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
later to like, maybe I'd like it

1061
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
a little more gentle, more humble.

1062
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
And then I also heard that

1063
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
there was an idea to flip it

1064
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
as well. Yes, right.

1065
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Which is what he did. And if you look at

1066
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
his map,

1067
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
or like, here I'll flip this around.

1068
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Here's an old sketch

1069
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
that I'll show you, where

1070
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
the,

1071
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
it went away, but you saw what I was...

1072
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I saw what you were getting at.

1073
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Here is like the front entrance of the castle,

1074
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
but the back, like the window pattern

1075
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
definitely feels like what we know

1076
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
is the back today.

1077
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
And the story of

1078
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
that is that once this was turned

1079
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
from a sketch, which I just showed you, into

1080
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
a 3D model,

1081
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Walt was away

1082
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
on a trip or something,

1083
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
and was coming back, the first order of

1084
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
business when he gets back is to look at this

1085
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
model. There was an engineer

1086
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Fred Yorger, who

1087
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
made a model based on the sketches.

1088
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
And once it was physicalized, he brought in

1089
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Ryman and asked what he thought, and he said, well,

1090
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I don't like it. And it was built

1091
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
to split in half, like exactly

1092
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
at that point. And he said, I don't know if you flip it

1093
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
around. And he flips it around, and everybody went,

1094
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
whoa, whoa, whoa, that's not what, like,

1095
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Walt's coming in in 10 minutes, you can't just do

1096
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
that. And he's like, why not? I don't know.

1097
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I like it better. It seems like, I don't

1098
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
know, back seems like the front and vice versa.

1099
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
And Walt came in, and the first thing he said was,

1100
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
love that.

1101
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
He loved it out of the gate. So,

1102
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
yeah, a little last minute twist around

1103
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
was a smart thing to do.

1104
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
This is one where I think, I feel

1105
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
like I saw multiple

1106
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
urban, like, apocryphal

1107
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
stories of, like, well, they were just

1108
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
cleaning up, and they accidentally assembled

1109
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
it backwards. And that's

1110
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
what, well, Walt's like, oh, I like

1111
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
that. So, I

1112
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
feel like there's different stories

1113
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
and justifications out there about

1114
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
it. Sure, sure. As

1115
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
kind of fits in with the

1116
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Walt Disney as kind of a tall

1117
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
tale, American tall

1118
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
tale figure. Walt sneezed, and

1119
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
the sneeze blew the castle around on the

1120
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
model. And he said, ah, wait a minute,

1121
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
that looks better.

1122
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
We made a little sound spun around.

1123
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Right. Yeah, yeah. Now,

1124
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I'm glad this happened because

1125
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
here's a take. I don't know

1126
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
if this is going to be a controversial take. Oh,

1127
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
interesting. I don't really like the back.

1128
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
There's something that I've never

1129
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
liked about the back. The view that you have

1130
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
essentially from the carousel and

1131
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
from the Fantasyland rides. And I've never

1132
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
been able to put my finger on why

1133
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I don't like it. But when I heard that

1134
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
the back was going to be the front,

1135
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I was like, that's a disaster. I think

1136
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
that's a really great last minute

1137
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
decision. There's something really warm

1138
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
and welcoming about what ended

1139
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
up being the front. But I

1140
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
was like, oh, this is an audio medium.

1141
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I need to be able to put into words why I

1142
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
don't like that back. And I couldn't figure

1143
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
it out. Do you have any idea why?

1144
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
And I thought this when I was a kid.

1145
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I don't. I like the back.

1146
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I like seeing the little... Let's see if I can

1147
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
figure it out. Do you think it's a mental

1148
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
thing of like,

1149
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I am being presented

1150
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
with this as the back

1151
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
of the cat. Like, if

1152
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
if you had first

1153
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
encountered the castle with the back,

1154
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
it's the front.

1155
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
You see what I mean? Are you like, oh,

1156
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
it's the back. It doesn't matter. You know?

1157
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
No. I don't know if it's

1158
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
that. Or maybe the back

1159
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
just can't compare to the front.

1160
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
I'm not

1161
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
sure. I like...

1162
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
There's a lack of like,

1163
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
you could maybe consider part

1164
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
like, it doesn't look as finished

1165
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
even though it is. Yes. Because it doesn't

1166
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
have the... I think I've always felt that. Because the blue, like the blue

1167
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
on top, whatever you would call those like

1168
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
things that cover the

1169
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
whatever, the towers? I don't know.

1170
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Like, there's... It feels

1171
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
a little like less finished just because there's not as

1172
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
much blue sticking out

1173
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
as there is on the front.

1174
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
You know what? Maybe also the back.

1175
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
There's something about it where I feel

1176
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
the 50s nature

1177
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
of it. It feels more dated to me. I see

1178
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I can see that. I see what you're saying there with the pinks.

1179
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
It's a more 50s style of molding

1180
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
or something. Yeah, I know what you're saying.

1181
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I don't... Look, I'm not going to turn my

1182
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
back to the back. You're allowed to.

1183
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I'm not going to spit on it. I don't feel

1184
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
that strongly. You could, but it would be maybe not a good idea.

1185
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I don't think I would make it that far. I'm not that

1186
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
good of a spitter. I don't know. If you spit

1187
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
on the castle, how fast

1188
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
is anybody saying... Is anybody saying anything?

1189
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Do one spit?

1190
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
One spit and two

1191
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
employees see you and one's maybe working like

1192
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Toad and one's working...

1193
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
That's what I don't know. I don't know. I don't know if the answer is nobody

1194
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
sees it or if they have

1195
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
a dedicated 14 person

1196
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
behind-the-scenes staff trying to prevent

1197
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
exactly what you're describing.

1198
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Spit squad. I think if you

1199
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
are real slick about it

1200
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
and you're dribbling on the castle,

1201
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
no one would notice. But if you walk

1202
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
up and do a hawk... Wait a minute.

1203
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
So if you lean over

1204
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
and you start drooling all over

1205
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
the castle... Oh, I guess drooling is

1206
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
different than spitting.

1207
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
But if you walked up and did a hawk too,

1208
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I think people would

1209
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
be upset.

1210
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
You might get stopped. If you hawked too

1211
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
on the Sleeping Beauty castle,

1212
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I think no one would say anything

1213
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
unless there was a higher-up

1214
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
manager that happened to see you.

1215
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
That's my prediction. By the way, no one try this.

1216
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I don't want you to do it. Yeah, don't do this.

1217
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
And I'm not winking when I say that. I truly don't want you to do it.

1218
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
But hypothetically,

1219
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I bet most average employees would just be like,

1220
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
God, I hope they don't do that again.

1221
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Because then I have to say something.

1222
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I hope they don't stay here for the next few hours

1223
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
summoning all the saliva

1224
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
they can find so they can spit on that castle.

1225
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Spit on that thing.

1226
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Spit on that thing.

1227
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I bet you'd get away with one.

1228
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
That's my guess.

1229
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
But we'll never know because you should not do it.

1230
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I don't know. I think we're going to start getting videos.

1231
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I heard you, Mike. We should edit this out.

1232
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I wink-wink. You don't want me to do it.

1233
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I don't want you to do it. This one's for you, Mike Carlson!

1234
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
No, stop!

1235
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Then they're

1236
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
detained, but it was like, wait, but who gave you the idea?

1237
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Because really, that's where the crime rests.

1238
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Alright, Magic Key cancelled.

1239
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
He already couldn't go on Fridays or during July.

1240
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
It's basically no change.

1241
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
It was Scott who did the idea, though.

1242
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I was the first who said spit.

1243
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
And Jason's the one who added the

1244
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
hoctua, which really gave it the oomph.

1245
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
And the friend Sam Spittle.

1246
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I don't know in the

1247
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
spring of 2025

1248
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
that hoctua has quite any

1249
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
oomph left. She'll be back.

1250
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
She'll be back.

1251
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
When we see the fruits of the

1252
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
many, many television development deals

1253
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
that she got,

1254
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
she'll be back bigger than ever.

1255
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
How does Secretary of State hoctua sound to you?

1256
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Because I think

1257
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
in the next year or two,

1258
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
little Marco's going to drop the vault.

1259
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
That's what I'm saying.

1260
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Maybe she's up for it.

1261
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
She'll be back.

1262
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Well, I don't know.

1263
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Again, I don't want to spit on the back.

1264
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I guess if that ever struck anybody.

1265
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
It's not a hate. It's just like, that's the back?

1266
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Yeah, I think probably what you

1267
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
respond to, I think, is what you were saying.

1268
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
It feels a little bit older for whatever reason.

1269
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
And I think if there was almost

1270
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
more blue in the

1271
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
front section here, I think

1272
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
you would like it better. Maybe so.

1273
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Now, you have some inherent

1274
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
pink and peach.

1275
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
There's different color

1276
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
schemes. It's always stayed basically

1277
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
what it is. But subtle

1278
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
adjusts and subtle. Again, this is the

1279
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
sort of thing we can look forward to in anniversary years

1280
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
is it's a more royal blue

1281
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
on the turrets.

1282
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
And they see if they...

1283
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Is that enough of a thing we did for the

1284
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
70th? They should

1285
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
honor early Tomorrowland

1286
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
and put decorations made

1287
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
of aluminum like that creaking

1288
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
rocket that used to be in Tomorrowland.

1289
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
That would be nice.

1290
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Which was going to be on the

1291
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
castle more and then because it expanded

1292
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
too much. I don't know that

1293
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
it was. I just remember the rocket

1294
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
was sponsored by

1295
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
an aluminum company.

1296
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
The tips of

1297
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
the castle are made

1298
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
of gold. And there is

1299
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
another one of these apocryphal stories

1300
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
as you described, Jason,

1301
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
where

1302
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Walt wanted the spires to be covered in

1303
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
22 karat gold leaf. He knew

1304
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
his brother Roy would never approve the

1305
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
extra expense. So rumor has it he

1306
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
sent Roy on a business trip and

1307
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
authorized the detail while he was gone.

1308
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I know. That's really good.

1309
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
It waltzed up to

1310
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
shenanigans, which is really funny.

1311
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
That like his business partner,

1312
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
his brother, you just have to trick him.

1313
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Like that's really good.

1314
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
It can't

1315
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
have been a great relationship on some level.

1316
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
It involves trickery and

1317
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
being put on a plane

1318
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
under false pretenses.

1319
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I don't

1320
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
understand. I have to go out of town

1321
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
for, I have to go out of town

1322
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
for 12 days to meet Disneyland's

1323
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
official vendor of beef Wellington.

1324
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
That doesn't even seem

1325
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
practical. Day to day we're going to

1326
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
have beef Wellington for 40

1327
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
cents. That seems like we're getting

1328
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
ripped. No, you go up there.

1329
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Walt insisted. He wanted me gone.

1330
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Some of the stories when you add

1331
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
them up about Walt and Roy,

1332
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
and even more so about Walt's

1333
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
father, you're like, oh, maybe

1334
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
some of this, maybe some of this

1335
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
was a nightmare.

1336
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Maybe there was a lot of very

1337
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
complicated family dynamics

1338
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
going on. I think that's very true.

1339
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
And that he's expressing a lot of like

1340
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
strange, like stunted growth

1341
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
things via the, I mean,

1342
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I think, look, as we've covered in a lot

1343
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
with all the guys we've run into, I think

1344
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
if you're, you know, if you're carving

1345
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
up the planet and putting weird stuff

1346
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
on it, like it comes from

1347
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
some strange psychology. It has to.

1348
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
It's the only way it can. Yeah.

1349
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
It's a lunatic.

1350
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
It's the only way to explain it.

1351
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
But a nice lunatic. He presented well on television

1352
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
and was friendly

1353
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
and friendly. Yeah, folksy.

1354
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Right. Yeah. So we'll talk

1355
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
about his bench later. We'll talk about

1356
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
that aspect of it. Yeah.

1357
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Yeah. And why, like, just be on it.

1358
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
What do you mean? Like, go be

1359
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
at, like, there's, adults can be on

1360
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
carousels. Maybe there was a, but what if we find

1361
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
that there was a weight limit at the time?

1362
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
I don't believe there was any rules

1363
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
for rides back then, though. Oh, that's

1364
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
a good, yeah, what am I saying? Yeah.

1365
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
In 1951? Yeah. And it's all

1366
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
aluminum and lead paint. That's where you see

1367
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
all those, like, I,

1368
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
something I think we need to get into at some point

1369
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
is, like, the kinds of

1370
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
rides that you see only in old

1371
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
jittery films from 1892.

1372
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Yeah. Like, I always love those things

1373
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
where it's people in, like,

1374
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
four layers of thick

1375
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
burlap, like, women in, like,

1376
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
you know, like, skirts that add

1377
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
up to, like, five inches

1378
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
of thickness between all the

1379
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
layers, and that they're just, like, sliding

1380
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
down a conveyor belt, and then, like,

1381
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
being, like, shaken around like it's a

1382
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
raisin factory or something.

1383
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Like, those kind of things are so crazy

1384
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
to me. It's like you get in a wash tub

1385
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
and you get pushed off a hill, and that was

1386
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
at a theme park. Yeah. And that was

1387
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
a ride. Oh, man. Early Coney

1388
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Island was so crazy.

1389
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Even crazier in that

1390
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
some stuff is not documentary

1391
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
because often stuff would just burst

1392
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
into flames. Oh, yeah.

1393
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Mm-hmm. Uh,

1394
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
yeah. It's sometimes on purpose. That was the

1395
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
idea. That was it, yeah. Yeah.

1396
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Uh, so. The

1397
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
exploder. It's not

1398
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
going to actually explode, is it? No, that's exactly what it's

1399
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
going to do. Uh, alright, fine, I'll

1400
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
do it. Dynamite crate.

1401
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
So it's an illusion?

1402
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
It's an illusion of a dynamite crate,

1403
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
you say. Yeah. Uh,

1404
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
sure. No, it's, yes. Well, it's less of a

1405
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
crate and more of an enclosed box. So, yes,

1406
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
it is an illusion. Mm-hmm.

1407
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Uh-uh. Uh, lots of old-timiness

1408
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
to get into. Uh, another

1409
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
bit of old-timiness is that, you know, there's a

1410
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
few people. I mentioned that Imagineer and I mentioned

1411
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
her Ryman. But then there was another guy who I

1412
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
think, like, was, like, the actual architect.

1413
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Or maybe not. Wait a minute.

1414
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Okay. Forgive me. I don't know exactly this

1415
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
guy's role. I ran into a name. Roland

1416
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
E. Mill. Uh,

1417
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Roland E. Mill was part of, became

1418
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Disney's castle guy at a point. And here's

1419
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
the history here. Roland was a pilot

1420
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
in World War I. He crashed his

1421
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
plane and spent the remainder of the war

1422
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
driving officers around France

1423
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
and doing American government reparations.

1424
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
While on the road, he sketched many of the castles

1425
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
that he saw in both France

1426
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
and Germany, including Nusch von

1427
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Stein Castle in Bavaria,

1428
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
which became the basis of this castle.

1429
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
In October 1919, he met

1430
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Walt Disney, also

1431
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
a driver in France, showed him his castle

1432
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
drawings, and they became great friends.

1433
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
So when Walt starts his movie studio,

1434
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
he remembered his old

1435
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
ambulance driving

1436
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
castle drawing friend.

1437
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
I mean, that's, that's an odd

1438
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
the, well, and hey, this

1439
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
ties to Ray Kroc, too, because they also met

1440
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
while driving in war. Right. Cause you've all been

1441
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
in, we've all been in, like, a cab or a lift

1442
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
and there's a chatty driver

1443
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
who maybe has some conspiracy theories

1444
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
or they want to show you something. Yes.

1445
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
And we always end up being great

1446
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
dear old friends with those drivers.

1447
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
It's possible. I mean, I've had plenty of nice

1448
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
people who, like, are very chatty and then some

1449
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
people who are lunatics

1450
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
tap both ways. So some... But if they

1451
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
hand you drawings, you know you're in good shape.

1452
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
You know those are going to be normal. If they're

1453
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
normal, yeah, if they're normal drawings.

1454
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Here, I sketched you while I was

1455
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
driving or something like that. That's probably a problem.

1456
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
That's not good.

1457
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
How did you, maybe I should have been washing

1458
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
your hands. Yeah.

1459
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
But Walt was a folksy guy,

1460
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
I guess. I guess he was open to it if...

1461
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Just like meeting people. Open to things.

1462
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
What, and he's 18 at that point?

1463
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Yeah, I guess that's right. It's just weird how 18 years old

1464
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
he's in the war

1465
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
driving around and he meets the guy

1466
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
who ends up making the castle

1467
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
for his theme park. Words that would have been

1468
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
nonsense back then. Right.

1469
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Hemingway was a driver in World War I

1470
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
as well. He drove an ambulance. Really?

1471
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Farewell to Arms. The book

1472
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
is based on that. But did he meet

1473
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
any friends that he worked

1474
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
with later? I don't know. We've got to look

1475
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
into drivers because it seems like

1476
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
World War I drivers may have

1477
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
shaped the 20th, much of the

1478
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
20th century. Notable drivers, perhaps.

1479
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Maybe that's an episode.

1480
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Notable drivers.

1481
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Hey, fun fact about New

1482
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Schwannstein Castle, it

1483
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
served as a depot for Nazi

1484
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
plunder that was taken from France

1485
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
during the Second World War.

1486
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Wow. Nazi plunder depot.

1487
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Your one stop shop.

1488
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Storage.

1489
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Does that mean, so like

1490
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
they took it but then they got it back

1491
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
and then that's a place where like

1492
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
a crazy Larry type guy was trying

1493
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
to move it all at low, low prices.

1494
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
I think from just

1495
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
reading on Wikipedia

1496
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
that castle is not strategic.

1497
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
It's not in a

1498
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
strategic location.

1499
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
So I think stuff

1500
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
stolen from France was put there

1501
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
because it was secure. It was a pain to get to like a Costco.

1502
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
It was a pain to get to like a Costco.

1503
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Oh yeah, yeah, well

1504
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
it was parking lots.

1505
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
And if you need gas,

1506
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
God forbid. How much stolen French

1507
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
art is in Sleeping Beauty's castle?

1508
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Or was when Walt was around?

1509
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Oh yeah, how much

1510
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Nazi

1511
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
plunder did Walt personally

1512
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
have? Some of the projects,

1513
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
the Operation Paperclip guys working

1514
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
on Tomorrowland would just drop stuff

1515
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
to store in Sleeping Beauty Castle.

1516
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
I'm jumping around but did you see what

1517
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
before they opened the walkthrough, because the walkthrough

1518
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
didn't open right away. No, Castle

1519
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
is 55, Walkthrough is 57.

1520
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Sleeping Beauty does not

1521
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
come out till 59.

1522
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Something I never even thought about.

1523
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Yeah, it was a pre-promotion.

1524
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Yeah.

1525
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Getting the word out about Sleeping Beauty well

1526
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
before it came out. I think it was delayed.

1527
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I don't think they meant it to be that but it ended up

1528
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
being that. Sleeping Beauty was delayed

1529
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
I mean. Oh, gotcha.

1530
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
But you're saying, yes, because the

1531
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
I swear to God also, I mean this like

1532
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
this is probably a basic fact

1533
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
to people listening to this theme park podcast

1534
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
but I also think it's distinctly possible

1535
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
that there are people who don't know that

1536
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
there is this exhibit that you can

1537
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
walk around in the castle. Oh yeah.

1538
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Because it is pretty easy to miss.

1539
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
That is like an awning that says

1540
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Sleeping Beauty Castle and you might look at that

1541
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
and say, yeah I know, but what you might

1542
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
not know is that you can walk around

1543
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
in there and see wonderful dioramas.

1544
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Yeah, I like that it's not publicized

1545
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
that much because it does feel like

1546
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
and I don't think I went on it for a little

1547
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
while because I don't think I knew it was

1548
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
there. I do think I happened

1549
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
upon it one trip early on.

1550
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Right. Oh, so you were, it's not like

1551
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
you came to Disneyland

1552
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
with a big list of all the stuff that you knew

1553
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
there is to do. Right. Yeah, it is a real

1554
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
bump into situation. Because that's the best

1555
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
stuff is when you happen upon things.

1556
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Yeah. In a lot of ways. Obviously not the big

1557
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
rides but I'm saying when you feel like you've discovered

1558
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
something that still feels exciting.

1559
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Whether it's this

1560
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
or whether it's the first time I discovered

1561
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Abracadabra on the boardwalk.

1562
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Like whatever it is, you go, oh look at this

1563
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I didn't know this was here. They don't publicize this.

1564
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
So you gotta have little things like

1565
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
you know, walk through.

1566
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Yeah, well and yeah you know what you're right

1567
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
that is like, it's part of the texture

1568
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
that you know, like

1569
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
maybe budgets don't always allow

1570
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
these little things that

1571
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
because like, now forgive me

1572
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
I don't remember what this is but

1573
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
DisneySea has great stuff in that capacity.

1574
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
There's something that's like kind of

1575
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
the headquarters of SEA or like

1576
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
one of the primary places.

1577
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Are you talking about Magellan's the restaurant?

1578
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
No, there's more of

1579
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
a walk through kind of situation

1580
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
with interactive stuff for kids

1581
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
to play with. Yeah, what's the name

1582
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
of that place? It's over by the volcano.

1583
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
I think that's what you're talking about.

1584
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
What's the bar in the steamer?

1585
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Is it Roosevelt's?

1586
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Yeah, is it Roosevelt's in the ship?

1587
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Yes. But that's not SEA

1588
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
as much SEA stuff in there I don't think.

1589
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Literal SEA but not SEA the society

1590
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
of explorers and adventurers I don't think.

1591
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
No. But it's all SEA I guess maybe.

1592
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Maybe I'm wrong. Now when you talked about just

1593
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
bumping into things, I flashed

1594
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
to something, forgive me, I'm

1595
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
delving into my eye photo

1596
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
and this might not be interesting

1597
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
it's not even called eye photo anymore. Look at me.

1598
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Oh geez, 2006 so much.

1599
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Looking at my photos.

1600
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
When you talk about just bumping into weird little

1601
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
exhibits that you don't know exist

1602
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
I wanted to talk about this

1603
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
on the show forever ago. We did

1604
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
a little like baby moon

1605
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
before our second baby showed up

1606
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
in Westlake Village

1607
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
and we stayed at kind of a moderate

1608
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
hotel in Westlake Village but we wandered

1609
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
around the nearby Four Seasons

1610
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
which has a really nice bar and

1611
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
after we got a drink, not

1612
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Erin, pregnant, she did not

1613
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
but we were like

1614
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
let's just wander the grounds here because we always like doing that

1615
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
at hotels and we saw that there was this great

1616
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
gallery of a very

1617
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
like

1618
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
I don't even want to say Banksy

1619
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
more of a Mr. Brainwash

1620
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
who did things

1621
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
like here's, oh my god I forgot

1622
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
it's Mickey. It's like Mickey Mouse

1623
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
heads that are dripping with weird rainbow paint.

1624
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Okay. And you look at the like

1625
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
oh very good and then like

1626
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
how much would you pay for that? Oh maybe

1627
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
$150. $6,000

1628
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
for like

1629
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
here's like a melting Darth

1630
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Vader that you can buy called

1631
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Galactic Blast that you can buy

1632
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
for a mere $15,000.

1633
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I was taking a lot of pictures in here

1634
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
because I was thinking about Michael Ferrari

1635
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
the wonderful artist we've gotten to know

1636
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
via City Walk and the

1637
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Venice Boardwalk keeper. But a lot

1638
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
of, I just, this gallery was

1639
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
so funny and douchey. There was a lot of stuff

1640
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
by a guy named Josh Mayhem.

1641
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
So

1642
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
I'm like, I was instantly like oh man

1643
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Michael Ferrari would get along with

1644
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
the thieves with Josh Mayhem, or their enemies

1645
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
I don't know. Of the

1646
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Westlake Mayhems.

1647
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
That's right they own

1648
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
everything around there.

1649
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Oh the tire magnets.

1650
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I looked at Josh Mayhem's website just now and it

1651
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
has like that, what is that from

1652
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
is it Panasonic? Oh that's exactly the kind

1653
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
of thing, yes. It's the, isn't that

1654
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
or is that RCA records? Oh RCA yes you're right.

1655
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
The thing where the guy is in the chair

1656
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
and he's getting blown back by the sound of the speakers

1657
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
and his tie's flying back

1658
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
of, he's like reclining like

1659
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
whoa man. Rainbow paint version

1660
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
of it. It's that with just paint splattered all over

1661
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
and it's dripping all the way on the back. I kind of like this

1662
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
honestly. I mean I, look

1663
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
I will admit I was taking pictures thinking

1664
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
there are some things in here that I think

1665
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Mike would like. Yeah that's one of them.

1666
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Including, I can't believe

1667
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
this was back in August, I can't believe I haven't brought this up on

1668
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
the show. A lot was

1669
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Josh Mayhem and then there was another artist

1670
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
whose name is just Risk.

1671
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
All caps.

1672
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
And here is a photo

1673
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
check this out, as you look at the photo

1674
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Risk is to

1675
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
art what Aerosmith

1676
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
is to rock and roll.

1677
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Wow, well now you. This is the most Mike

1678
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
sentence. That says all you need

1679
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
to say. And that is a quote from Aerosmith.

1680
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
It's attributed to all of them

1681
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
together despite the photo being

1682
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
of Risk, Steven Tyler

1683
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Joe Perry and Slash.

1684
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Slash? Yeah I know.

1685
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Gets along with Slash, Andy

1686
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Deep and Aerosmith. What does Chris

1687
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Angel fit into this picture? Oh man.

1688
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
They're right off the camera.

1689
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
They cropped him, he just wasn't

1690
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
applicable. The quote's about music

1691
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
so we just don't want Chris in there. Seems right.

1692
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
He was at this, no question

1693
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
he was at the event I'm showing you this picture.

1694
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
He must have been. Can I show something to

1695
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
get Jason's T levels revving

1696
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
up? Yeah yeah rev that T. Jason

1697
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Josh Mayhem has

1698
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
a blown away Popeye.

1699
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
It's colorful

1700
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
rainbow Popeye. Whoa a totally

1701
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
fucked up pop art Andy

1702
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Warhol

1703
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
steroids Popeye. Drippy paint

1704
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Popeye. Drippy paint Popeye.

1705
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
I like that.

1706
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Scott you don't know this but I

1707
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
did make a one dollar

1708
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
reservation for a deck of

1709
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Popeye tarot cards.

1710
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Wait hang on.

1711
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
A reservation? Like

1712
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
they hadn't launched the Kickstarter

1713
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
yet. But you got a big

1714
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
discount. You got like a 20

1715
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
dollar discount. I saw it on Instagram, I sent it to

1716
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
him last night. And he sent it to me. I'm like

1717
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
I truly don't know where

1718
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
any of my tarot cards

1719
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
we have a few decks of tarot

1720
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
cards in the house but I think they're still

1721
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
in like drawers or boxes or

1722
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
something. He's going to be a

1723
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
full tarot card guy now that

1724
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
these Popeye cards are being made.

1725
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
When Jane and I first started dating we

1726
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
used to do three card readings for each

1727
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
other pretty regularly. Could you do

1728
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
a three card reading for us? I probably

1729
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
could. With the Popeye deck?

1730
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Yeah.

1731
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
That's great content. I don't know what every card

1732
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
means but it comes with a booklet.

1733
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
I've never cared about this

1734
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
I've never cared about this kind of thing

1735
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
until Popeye entered the party.

1736
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
I was of course

1737
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
as a man about to turn 40

1738
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
I got really into it from

1739
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Ricky J and his history

1740
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
of playing cards

1741
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
and trick dice and tarot

1742
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
cards. He was a tarot card guy? I like saying that like

1743
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
say it with me folks. Ricky J

1744
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
it was funny that you said it as if we knew

1745
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
what you were doing. Ricky J don't make me finish

1746
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
it. Ricky J Museum of

1747
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Jurassic Technology in Los Angeles.

1748
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Can I borrow

1749
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
that tone to say a further fact about

1750
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Risk? Like 10 things to know about Risk.

1751
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Okay say it with me. Risk

1752
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
was knighted by the Medici family

1753
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
in Italy. He's Sir

1754
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Risk. Sir Risk. Why do they get

1755
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
to knight people? Who the hell is the Medici

1756
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
family? That's a good point.

1757
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Not a family you want to cross.

1758
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
How could you be rock and roll

1759
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
and a knight? Josh Mayhem

1760
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
has a Scrooge too

1761
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
there's a Scrooge here. Do we get prices

1762
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
on these? No you have to call

1763
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
I think it's probably like 10 grand.

1764
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Look I'm glad I saved it and just did it on the air

1765
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
instead of texting you. I'm glad you're discovering

1766
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Josh Mayhem. Your new favorite

1767
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
I don't like every Josh Mayhem piece

1768
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
but there are some I wouldn't mind

1769
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
having but I'm not going to

1770
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
save up for some of them. There's one that

1771
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
if you look at this another

1772
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
drippy one

1773
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
this is like

1774
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
kind of like Mickey Mouse but it's also like one

1775
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
of those bear bricks. It's a bear brick yeah.

1776
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
The dumbest thing you like.

1777
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
So if you want an expensive

1778
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
bear brick for

1779
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
$10,500

1780
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
That one doesn't get me going.

1781
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
That doesn't get my tea going

1782
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
as much. I looked

1783
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
risk the artist

1784
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
has kind of an Alan Moore Rick Rubin

1785
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
look

1786
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
the long white hair. That is accurate

1787
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
and so I was like

1788
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
immediately endeared me to

1789
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
him that look.

1790
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
This just shows you

1791
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
be open to anything

1792
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
try anything. Bump into

1793
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
expensive art galleries

1794
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
whenever you can.

1795
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
This doesn't really apply to Sleeping Beauty

1796
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
because you can't buy that stuff.

1797
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
You know what though I was going to say like

1798
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
I was ready to do like oh yeah they redid it

1799
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
in the 70s and now they've done it in kind of this classic

1800
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
way and I'm like no fuck that

1801
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
I want Josh Mayhem and Risk

1802
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Takeover of the Sleeping Beauty

1803
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
dioramas. Make it rock and roll

1804
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
guys. Well what if

1805
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Arthur and Sons now is owned by

1806
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Josh Mayhem and Risk

1807
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
and fuse it with like some extra

1808
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
little more. Oh now you like it.

1809
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Okay good because of that Popeye

1810
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
statue. Yeah

1811
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
yeah. Be a Popeye statue when you walk in. If you

1812
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
could get steak au poivre

1813
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
but it's all different colors and it's

1814
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
drippy. Steak what?

1815
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Steak au poivre. And what's steak

1816
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
au poivre? That steak with like black

1817
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
black peppercorn sauce.

1818
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
I Tom

1819
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
plays the clip on the best show

1820
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
a lot of

1821
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Orson Welles

1822
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
I think it's from F for Fake and he goes

1823
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
I love the steak au poivre please.

1824
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Like to a waiter

1825
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
like to like

1826
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
and it just seems

1827
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
it's a very funny clip. It's

1828
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
just big cape Orson Welles

1829
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
just ordering something.

1830
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Would you wear a big cape

1831
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
when we go to Arthur and Sons?

1832
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Oh you know

1833
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
it's getting to that age

1834
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
you know. You're almost a cape

1835
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
age. Say it with me.

1836
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
As a man who's almost 40 I'm now at

1837
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
cape age.

1838
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Look at this. It's a big year for you two you know.

1839
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
You're both at cape age.

1840
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
So 40's cape age

1841
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
I don't think I realized. It is.

1842
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
You haven't been taking enough advantage of that.

1843
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
That's right. I haven't. I'm insecure

1844
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
about my cape wearing. The three of us

1845
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
entering the next live show we do with a

1846
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
big unfurl of a cape. Hello.

1847
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride.

1848
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
And then I come out. You're hiding

1849
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Or Cape Fabe I unveil mine

1850
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
and he comes out because he's actually tiny.

1851
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Cape Fabe.

1852
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Or a Sleeping Beauty

1853
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Escalusion where

1854
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
because that's one of the things that happens in the dioramas

1855
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
where the prince is

1856
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
played by an owl and a bunch of birds

1857
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
all carrying a cape.

1858
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
So that'd be a nice thing if people

1859
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
think it's Mike but wait that face looks like

1860
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Jason and then the whole thing's unfurled

1861
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
and you're being lifted up by

1862
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
several owls.

1863
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
I've talked about it.

1864
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
You know I'm realizing

1865
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
there was like I feel

1866
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
you know a lot of guys

1867
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
RH I feel like oh

1868
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Roxanne from Goof Troop was so cute

1869
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
and then girls

1870
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
I've known multiple women

1871
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
I feel like oh Fox

1872
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Robin Hood was like a big

1873
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
cartoon crush. Did anyone

1874
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
crush on fake prince

1875
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
that's birds in cape?

1876
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
I was really into

1877
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
the birds in cape.

1878
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
My biggest crush was 10 birds

1879
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
all under one cloak.

1880
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
I was

1881
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
now I can't call it a crush but when I remembered

1882
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
that there was that scene I was like

1883
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
oh that's cool I like this guy.

1884
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
I like Mr.

1885
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Mr. Birds

1886
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Mr. Multiple Birds

1887
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
That's Prince Birds do you?

1888
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Oh yes knighted

1889
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
just like risk.

1890
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Prince made

1891
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
of birds. Prince made of birds.

1892
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Is there any

1893
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
what's the term I'm thinking of slash

1894
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
something? The porno

1895
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
online fiction?

1896
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
R34. No no no you're talking

1897
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
about slash. Why can't I think of

1898
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
the name of slash fiction?

1899
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
What's the

1900
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
dirty version though of fan

1901
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
fiction? Rule 34 is the

1902
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
slash something. Am I wrong?

1903
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Slash is like we're like hooking characters

1904
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
up. I think it can be dirty.

1905
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
There's got to be something about birds

1906
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
in cape.

1907
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Has anyone ever been well I can explore that

1908
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
a little bit. Let us know if you had a crush

1909
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
on birds in cape.

1910
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
On Prince Birds in cape.

1911
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
To give full credit

1912
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
here now that I'm looking at it because

1913
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Prince made of birds did

1914
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
result in the Google image that I needed

1915
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
and it was it's an

1916
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
owl is the base. Two

1917
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
smaller birds are the hands.

1918
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
There's a squirrel on top of the

1919
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
owl and then the boots are bunnies.

1920
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
So it's not

1921
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
though Prince made of birds

1922
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
worked for me. Technically

1923
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
that is erasure of the bunnies.

1924
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Right okay good to know.

1925
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
And now to look for the porn of this.

1926
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
That'll take me away from talking

1927
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
for too long.

1928
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Let's talk about these dioramas a little

1929
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
bit longer because there were two versions

1930
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
of it. It opened in 57 because

1931
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Walt started complaining about

1932
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
something up there. There's nothing. What do you mean

1933
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
empty space? Put something in the castle.

1934
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
All right I guess we'll figure something out.

1935
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
And they started doing it

1936
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
when that's tight. This is very tight

1937
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
space. I don't know what we're going to put in there.

1938
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
And they realized that well

1939
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
if we do this art style they

1940
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
worked with the production designer of the film and they did

1941
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
this space maximizing

1942
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
style of diorama

1943
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
which you know

1944
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
as the forest perspective you know

1945
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
like makes you feel like there's more depth

1946
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
than there is. Because the actual little windows

1947
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
like the spaces they had to make the little

1948
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
exhibits were extremely narrow.

1949
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
So the depth is all kind of

1950
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
your eye telling in the gaps.

1951
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
So

1952
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
it was this one in the 50s

1953
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
that was kind of like

1954
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
clever and made of flats

1955
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
and almost like in the world of the multi plane camera

1956
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
like the way the movies are done.

1957
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Just things stacked on different levels.

1958
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Then they redid it in the 70s.

1959
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
And that looked kind of more like a

1960
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
display at the Disney store.

1961
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
That was done with like dolls. It was kind of

1962
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
and then

1963
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
at some point I think early 2000s

1964
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
they evicted that and said let's go back

1965
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
to the original. It's like a little bit more

1966
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
classic and feels more like the film.

1967
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
And in fact I went and looked at

1968
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
that 70s version. It is kind of

1969
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
there's something like kind of sort of a creepy

1970
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
70s Barbie air

1971
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
to it for sure. I don't know what it

1972
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
is. It actually is a lot more dated

1973
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
than the original one was.

1974
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Makes sense because the way that it is now

1975
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
it feels so timeless to me.

1976
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
It really is like

1977
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
I still think it looks really cool.

1978
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
It's really the depth

1979
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
is deceiving.

1980
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Like how deep and big the little scenes are.

1981
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
But yeah like dolls

1982
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
I guess dolls give it too much

1983
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
of a physical presence.

1984
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
It grounds it in reality

1985
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
too much I think.

1986
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Having them be more

1987
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
I don't know what you would call it.

1988
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Not using the same effects I suppose

1989
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
and just having them be represented

1990
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
by dolls just makes it too much.

1991
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
You know what. Here's the aesthetic.

1992
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Here's what the 70s version looks like.

1993
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
It looks like is the show Thunderbirds?

1994
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
The show that

1995
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Team America was based on.

1996
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Like the prince looks extremely Thunderbirds.

1997
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
There's a charm to

1998
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
the pictures I saw.

1999
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
But it doesn't feel

2000
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
quite the same. Like I think I would still like

2001
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
going through it but it would be a little bit

2002
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
more that it like creeps me out.

2003
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Yes. Yeah.

2004
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
It also reminds me of the

2005
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Todd Haynes did the movie about

2006
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Karen Carpenter with Barbie dolls.

2007
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Oh maybe.

2008
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
I mean as with all things

2009
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Karen Carpenter is really like heart

2010
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
searing because she's so tragic

2011
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
and it's a very upsetting unauthorized movie

2012
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
about her spiral

2013
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
done with Barbie dolls.

2014
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
I'm looking at Sleeping Beauty I'm like

2015
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
oh no.

2016
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Sleeping Beauty the band's going to die.

2017
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
You're going to get unhealthy. Be careful Sleeping Beauty.

2018
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
It very much

2019
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
looks like a diorama.

2020
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
The definition

2021
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
of like school project diorama

2022
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
where it's like I put a Barbie

2023
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
and a GI Joe

2024
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
and they're signing the Declaration of

2025
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Independence.

2026
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Yes. Extremely.

2027
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
They seem like their bodies

2028
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
aren't made to have like big hats

2029
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
and wigs on them. There's something a little

2030
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
disproportionate. Does anyone have a shoebox?

2031
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
It is

2032
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
just for school. Just because they're small I

2033
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
do like think oh like there's little tiny

2034
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
versions of them living in the castle and I don't

2035
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
think that when I see the current

2036
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
version. Like it feels more to you like

2037
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
little doll souls are trapped.

2038
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Right. It's like oh yeah here's like tiny

2039
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Maleficent and here's tiny

2040
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Aurora and they're going about

2041
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
their day or whatever but the way that

2042
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
they have it now I do

2043
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
my brain just sort of doesn't

2044
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
think about the scale.

2045
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
If they're 3D and physicalized

2046
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
they're like half alive to you.

2047
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
If they're flat they have no souls.

2048
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
So you're not worried about them being trapped

2049
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
in the castle forever.

2050
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
This feels like these little dolls are trapped in this

2051
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
castle forever.

2052
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
That's upsetting.

2053
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Well you'll be happy to hear that now

2054
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
they're all gone and we're incinerated.

2055
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Burn them.

2056
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
This was

2057
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
a switch out in 2008

2058
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
that they went back to this original style

2059
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
and boy this feels like unfamiliar to

2060
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
me because I would go see

2061
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
the dolls version because I was like

2062
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
I liked being a kid and knowing oh there's this

2063
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
kind of secret thing. Like I think I did

2064
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
always make a point of going to the Sleeping Beauty

2065
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Walkthrough when I went to Disneyland.

2066
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
As an adult rarely I think I've only

2067
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
seen this like once since they did

2068
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
it in 2008 which is a long time ago

2069
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
now. Yeah I

2070
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
because I went in 2007 for the first

2071
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
time to Disneyland and I don't remember

2072
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
the dolls. I don't think I ever saw

2073
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
the dolls. I'm not sure. I don't think you could

2074
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
go in there. I think that was during

2075
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
a stretch of time. Oh when it was closed. Okay so then

2076
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
it was never possible that I would have seen the dolls.

2077
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
You would not have seen the dolls. Okay that makes sense then.

2078
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
I don't think I saw the dolls. I don't think I really discovered

2079
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
this until the 2010s.

2080
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
The rare dolls Mike has

2081
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
never seen. Oh and it makes me upset

2082
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
because I could have been in the presence of these weird dolls

2083
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
which is all I want in my life

2084
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
is to be near weird dolls.

2085
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
You're going to get a perfect recreation of all

2086
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
of Susan's dolls from Seinfeld.

2087
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Everyone exactly where they were

2088
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
on the shelf. Oh I would buy

2089
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
what are the ones

2090
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
which one did you have the doll look like?

2091
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
George's mom. George's mom. Yeah.

2092
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
I would buy an official Seinfeld

2093
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
branded George's mom doll.

2094
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
God. That would be good. I wouldn't

2095
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
buy it but I'd happily come

2096
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
over to see yours. I would like to go

2097
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
see it. That would be good. That is an extremely funny

2098
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
prop. Uh huh. Yeah. Hey talking

2099
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
about school projects. The thing I was

2100
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
thinking about recently.

2101
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
I feel like we did a lot of projects

2102
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
where they would say like go

2103
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
home next week bring in a

2104
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
coffee can.

2105
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Like a tin coffee can.

2106
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
And like one teacher

2107
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
like poked holes in either side

2108
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
and had rubber bands in a weight

2109
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
it put rubber bands

2110
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
in a weight in it and you'd wind it up

2111
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
and it would move like a remote

2112
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
controlled car. Okay. Like

2113
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
to demonstrate motion and

2114
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
inertia and that sort of thing.

2115
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
I was thinking the other day like

2116
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
looking at a bag

2117
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
of coffee grounds. I'm like

2118
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
wait nothing I think I have like

2119
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
a can of Maxwell House

2120
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
in the house and that's like a

2121
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
cardboard can. Like

2122
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
do kids they

2123
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
they just don't do those projects.

2124
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Kids don't play with cans anymore?

2125
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Well cause everything's like plastic

2126
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
tubs of coffee

2127
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
or bags of coffee.

2128
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Or curing pods.

2129
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Certainly can't do anything with those. No.

2130
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
So you're concerned about the lack of kids

2131
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
coffee projects in today's

2132
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
elementary schools. Even

2133
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
paper mache. Oh go home bring in

2134
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
a bunch of newspaper.

2135
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
It's a pain in the ass to get a whole newspaper nowadays.

2136
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
I guess that's true.

2137
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
That's true. Well

2138
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
if you ever run for elected office

2139
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
would you put this on your platform?

2140
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Just to get kids to be able to work

2141
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
with paper mache and empty coffee cans again?

2142
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
I would prefer coffee manufacturers

2143
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
not use so much plastic.

2144
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
So yes. Cause it was tin?

2145
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
The old cans were tin or metal? Like what were they?

2146
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Some kind of metal. Lead.

2147
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Lead boy. Lead boy.

2148
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Lead boy. Lead boy coffee.

2149
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Careful

2150
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
mom and dad your son might end up being

2151
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
a podcaster if he drinks enough of that

2152
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
lead boy coffee. Too much lead boy.

2153
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
He's going into the arts and entertainment.

2154
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Too many school projects it ruined your brain.

2155
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
I remember once in school

2156
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
I was like okay I gotta make Stonehenge

2157
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
I'm gonna get Styrofoam

2158
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
I know that's easy to cut up and we'll just

2159
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
buy a can of spray paint and we went to the

2160
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
craft store and they're like you can't

2161
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
if you spray paint Styrofoam

2162
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
it shrinks. You can't do that.

2163
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Oh I remember learning that. Yeah I had

2164
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
no idea. Did you make

2165
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Stonehenge? Yeah just

2166
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
out of Styrofoam and like paint that

2167
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
you just dab with a sponge. How did it look?

2168
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Um

2169
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
We did our best.

2170
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
We did our damnedest. Got it. Understood.

2171
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
We did it the Sunday before

2172
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
the Monday it was due.

2173
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
PTR challenge. All of us make Stonehenge.

2174
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Who would make a better Stonehenge?

2175
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
I'll make Stonehenge.

2176
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Maxed in pyramids much easier

2177
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
to make with Styrofoam.

2178
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Did I make? I feel like I

2179
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
did make some pyramids once and I can't

2180
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
remember for what project but I

2181
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
definitely made pyramids.

2182
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
I think I made planets too. I don't know who of us

2183
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
would be the best. I don't know that any

2184
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
of us are particularly handy

2185
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
good with our hands. The only challenge

2186
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
really where we all made something

2187
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
was the Ronto wrap

2188
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
and I in that

2189
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
I blew y'all out of the water. Yeah yeah mine was the worst.

2190
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
The saddest thing I've ever. Sometimes

2191
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
my phone

2192
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
my phone that is now full of

2193
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
photos of my children

2194
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
sometimes my phone will still decide

2195
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
memories and it's

2196
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
a photo of your

2197
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
weird sad Ronto wrap.

2198
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Kids a lot of kids probably

2199
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
bored of that huh? Memories

2200
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
weird hot dog today.

2201
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
There's some stuff that you can't believe

2202
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
technologically were there and then there's some

2203
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
stuff where you go this is the dumbest computer

2204
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
I've ever seen. Like

2205
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
why is it showing me a hot dog?

2206
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Remember hot dog day?

2207
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
That seemed important to you. I was

2208
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
listening to you. You were all excited

2209
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
about it. I saw it like the AI

2210
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
AI confidently answers questions

2211
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
wrong so often.

2212
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
It's so fucking dumb this AI already.

2213
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
It's so so dumb.

2214
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
You seem upset Trump back in office

2215
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
want happy memory from better

2216
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Biden days? Look at hot

2217
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
dog.

2218
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
I recently

2219
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
searched Citywalk

2220
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Billabong to try to find pictures

2221
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
and I had been trying out DuckDuckGo

2222
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
it's my search engine

2223
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
and the first

2224
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
cause it's more secure it's more secure

2225
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
than like Google.

2226
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
The first result was our

2227
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
fandom wiki

2228
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
about the Citywalk Saga

2229
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Billabong Sector.

2230
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Wow and that was even before

2231
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Wave Santa got out there.

2232
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Wave Santa has made it

2233
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
absolute and like

2234
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
very tight bond between

2235
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
us and Citywalk Billabong.

2236
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
He's sweeping the nation

2237
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
in a lot of ways. Oh that's nice to think about

2238
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
I'm just imagining him surfing everywhere

2239
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
surfing on the Pacific Ocean

2240
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
but then surfing on the Mississippi River.

2241
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Right.

2242
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Have a fun journey Wave Santa.

2243
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
One of his legs broke clean off

2244
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
as I was leaving here.

2245
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Makes a lot of sense.

2246
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
I gotta super glue it back on.

2247
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Those were really really skinny legs

2248
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
those are puny legs to hold up

2249
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
a whole wave. I pulled it out of the car and it fell

2250
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Thanks for aesthetic there's a reason the back was

2251
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
covered in Velcro squares.

2252
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
But don't worry he's in the garage he's alright.

2253
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
He's still partying.

2254
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
I think we can't move on from the

2255
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
story of the diorama without

2256
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
saying that it was closed

2257
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
for a number of years you could not

2258
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
access that you could not go in the castle.

2259
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
That changed

2260
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
in 2008 but it started in 2001

2261
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
because of

2262
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Oh

2263
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
see I saw this

2264
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
I saw this mentioned

2265
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
but maybe the line

2266
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
September 11, 2001

2267
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
in the terrorist attacks

2268
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
on the United States.

2269
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
I was reminded

2270
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
of the correct pronunciation from

2271
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Mike's lovely Wave Santa

2272
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
montage video.

2273
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Oh yeah because he took a picture outside.

2274
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
So next time you need to know

2275
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
just take a picture look at that video

2276
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
with Wave Santa.

2277
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
What is it Jason? Hold on.

2278
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
It's my version of Memento

2279
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
I just have Polaroids

2280
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
mostly Wave Santa.

2281
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
What do you remember about

2282
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
your life? There was a cool

2283
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
wave I think he delivered presents.

2284
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
That's all I got.

2285
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Okay now you

2286
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
were hesitant to say that the castle

2287
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
was closed because of 9-11 because

2288
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
they deny that.

2289
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Again like

2290
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Tall Tales urban legend like

2291
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
a former head of Disneyland

2292
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
was like no

2293
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
because of 9-11.

2294
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
They just actually didn't feel like running that anymore.

2295
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
It wasn't worth the

2296
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
staffing. It wasn't worth one person

2297
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
to open the door in the morning.

2298
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Yeah so maybe not

2299
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
because like I don't know once you got

2300
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
they got security measures.

2301
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
I don't know what you're going to do in the castle.

2302
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Well I guess I don't want to

2303
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
I don't know the ins and outs of bombs.

2304
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
I don't know what you could do.

2305
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
But I don't know you could also blow one up just next

2306
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
to the castle. I don't think they're stopping

2307
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
all the threats by not letting you

2308
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
go inside. Well if they're not going to stop a loogie

2309
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
what else?

2310
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Yeah well that'd be the fear I guess

2311
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
maybe like what if you're spitting

2312
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
something explosive. What if

2313
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
you're like that's gasoline and

2314
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
then the next person comes along with

2315
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
like a fire eater. Yeah.

2316
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
You should drink gasoline and

2317
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
you hock two with some gasoline

2318
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
out of your mouth. Chris Angel

2319
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
would do that I think. She said you got

2320
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
to hock two of that thing but if

2321
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
you're a flame thrower or if you're a flame

2322
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
eater. Yeah. Maybe you don't

2323
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
got to do that. That's dangerous for everyone.

2324
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Did Ricky J ever hock two of some lighter

2325
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
fluid and turn it on?

2326
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
There's no way he did it not.

2327
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
You're saying he did of course. Yeah of course.

2328
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Alright they all do it. We call

2329
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
this hock twoing.

2330
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
I invented the phrase.

2331
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
What have we missed

2332
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
just general

2333
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
I was going to say I think the

2334
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
dioramas if I'd seen it as a little kid

2335
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
I would have been really into it

2336
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
because it's pretty dark in there. It has

2337
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
these similar aesthetics

2338
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
to a haunted house.

2339
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
But it's Sleeping Beauty. I know I'm not going to get

2340
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
scared. Yeah that's true

2341
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
yes. Like you're nervous because it's

2342
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
narrow corridors and like

2343
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
you know and it's like there is

2344
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
like evil laughing in there with

2345
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
maleficent and stuff but like probably nothing

2346
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
is going to. Yeah you know what it's a good

2347
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
It's like a little test out I'd say of

2348
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
of a maze or something.

2349
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Yeah. Yeah. There's an

2350
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
old I was seeing I don't

2351
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
there was a creepy picture from the original

2352
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
version and it says

2353
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
meet maleficent's demons

2354
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
and you would see did you see this photo?

2355
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
No. It's a really like it's a black

2356
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
and white photo of these two really scary

2357
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
like kind of the pig guard

2358
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
guys and

2359
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
there was an illusion where you would like look through

2360
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
a keyhole and then your eye would be reflected

2361
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
back as if they had a real eye

2362
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
and it looks like this would just scare the shit

2363
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
out of children. That's scary as hell.

2364
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Oh I take it back then I guess.

2365
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
So I was like oh that was

2366
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
kind of cool. Damn. You know as we

2367
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
as we fight against the removal of everything

2368
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
scary at the park I'm like oh yeah

2369
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
give me back these pig goons.

2370
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Let me see the pig goons with the real eye human eye.

2371
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Yeah that's scar you might have dreams about

2372
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
pig goons for the rest of your

2373
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
childhood. At least give us a little corner

2374
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
of scare like be like if you want to take

2375
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
your kids over to get them scared by the pig goons

2376
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
it's over here. Yeah. You don't have

2377
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
to they don't have to if you don't want it

2378
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
to. Yeah. Yeah. But for like

2379
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
for like my daughter who seems to like

2380
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
my daughter want to take a picture with Beetlejuice

2381
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
at Universal on Wednesday.

2382
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Cool. And she turned down all the Simpsons.

2383
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
She turned down any Simpson

2384
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
any like Chief Wiggum statue or

2385
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Marge or whatever and then we saw Beetlejuice

2386
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
and she doesn't know what Beetlejuice is but

2387
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
I go it's Beetlejuice and she's intrigued.

2388
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
I go you want to take a picture with Beetlejuice? She goes yes.

2389
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
I go is he scary or funny? She goes funny.

2390
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
I go okay so we go and we have

2391
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
a picture and she's like staring right at him smiling.

2392
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
She like seems to

2393
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
like scary stuff. That's great. Weird

2394
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
looking. That's nice. Just remember

2395
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
to take her to parks too. Well

2396
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
there's a park at Universal. I've been concerned about. Park at

2397
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Universal. I guess yes. There is

2398
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
she loves it. They're okay well good. All right

2399
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
if that's what it takes to get her to

2400
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
I'm concerned about getting this kid into an actual park.

2401
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
She goes to parks. I'm just explaining that

2402
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
it's very stressful because of how often

2403
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Bossy's seven year old just takes

2404
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
my child grabs her

2405
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
around the waist takes her down the slide.

2406
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Not the same kids different

2407
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
kids every time. Different

2408
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
kids I would say eighty percent of the

2409
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
time this happens.

2410
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Your daughter is very tall though you gotta

2411
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
teach her some wrestling moves so she

2412
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
can put those older kids in their place. She's two and a half

2413
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
I don't know that she's

2414
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
no self defense yet.

2415
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
But I assume she'll

2416
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
hopefully know it soon. But

2417
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
we ran we kind of ran into a same situation

2418
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
at the park at Universal

2419
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
inside the playground equipment at Universal.

2420
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Oh my god.

2421
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Where she's an older

2422
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
kid is doing something like climbing

2423
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
on top of the playground.

2424
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
She's trying to do it.

2425
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Okay. Okay. And then if I go no you

2426
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
just go in the slider go over here she starts screaming

2427
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
at me. And she's like

2428
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
no let me. I'm like that

2429
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
kid is climbing on top of the tube

2430
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
not through it. Just go through it it's

2431
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
fine. And she starts screaming at me cause she's trying

2432
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
to struggle her way up.

2433
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
She's very aggressive.

2434
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
She's very spirited.

2435
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
So no she still goes

2436
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
to some real parks. But she also meets

2437
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Beetlejuice on a Wednesday afternoon.

2438
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
That's what you get when you're

2439
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
my daughter. I can't say that

2440
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
a regular park gives you that.

2441
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
You cannot meet Beetlejuice at a park.

2442
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
And if there's a guy who looks like Beetlejuice

2443
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
it might be just a guy who spent the night

2444
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
there. Yeah. Get out of there.

2445
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Sleeping Beauty

2446
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Castle

2447
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
is of course the original Disneyland

2448
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Castle. But it also got a sequel

2449
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
when Hong Kong Disneyland

2450
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
opened. And the idea was

2451
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
that here for this new

2452
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
park we will pay homage to the original

2453
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
park and we will exactly recreate

2454
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
the original castle.

2455
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
This was weak sauce.

2456
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Boo. I don't buy that for one second.

2457
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
It seemed like after

2458
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
we've had the evolution of like the

2459
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
little castle only works as part of the like

2460
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
little charming nature of Disneyland. Now

2461
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
that we've built bigger and better castles

2462
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
it just I mean I don't know about that. I don't even want to say

2463
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
better. I really like Sleeping Beauty Castle. But the

2464
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
like the idea that we're going to go back. It was just

2465
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
such a I see through. This is no tribute.

2466
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
You just are looking for a reason to build

2467
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
a small castle. And then sure enough

2468
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
years later it's gone. Building

2469
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
new giant castle. Right. Everybody

2470
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
happy fun. Well whichever CEO was in charge

2471
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
I don't know about that choice.

2472
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Well I'm sorry to tell you it was

2473
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
the decaying days of the one

2474
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
that we like. Yep.

2475
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Yeah. I don't believe it. I

2476
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
I'm sorry. I refuse to believe it. I mean maybe they

2477
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
you know maybe it was like Trump blaming

2478
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
things on Biden kind of thing. Yeah.

2479
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Maybe they threw him under the bus.

2480
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
It was that. Hong Kong also

2481
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
surrounded by beautiful lush

2482
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
green mountains. Mountains behind

2483
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
the castle. And stuff so.

2484
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
I want to know what it looks like in person because they

2485
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
added stuff to it to make it bigger.

2486
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
But I feel like maybe it looks odd

2487
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
in person. Because Tony Baxter

2488
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
was talking about doing that to Sleeping

2489
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Beauty's castle. They were thinking about

2490
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
like what can we do. Could we make

2491
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
it bigger. And they were just running

2492
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
into problems with the force perspective

2493
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
and just how it would look versus

2494
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Matterhorn and how it would look through. So

2495
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
they considered it and they just determined that

2496
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
like if we make it bigger it's going to throw

2497
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
everything off I think. So they

2498
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
decided against it which is probably the right

2499
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
call. They talked about really. Yeah.

2500
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
I wonder in what. I mean I don't know how

2501
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
close they ever got. But that was just they threw that out.

2502
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Like man we could make it bigger maybe.

2503
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
What would it look like. And they thought

2504
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
it was a bad idea. Well this maybe

2505
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
naturally brings me to something that

2506
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
I've had this proposition and maybe

2507
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
we'll find this to be fruitful or

2508
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
we'll let it go. But something that I thought

2509
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
we could do as we pay homage to

2510
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
original days of Disneyland. We could also

2511
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
pay homage to original days of

2512
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Podcast the Ride. Maybe do

2513
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
something that we haven't done that we completely

2514
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
lost years ago. Which is

2515
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
bringing back the original

2516
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
rating mechanism which is

2517
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
I don't remember the right order but

2518
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
plus it up. Keep it as is. Burn it down

2519
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
for the insurance money. I think that the

2520
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
class of 55 could get run through

2521
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
this perspective. Because

2522
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
in 70 years there's certainly a lot

2523
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
of ways that you could plus things up. But also

2524
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
is it more classic to keep it as is.

2525
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
And also we've already talked about a lot of

2526
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
you know vandalism

2527
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
and terrorism happening to the castle.

2528
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Do we just go all the way and burn it down for the

2529
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
insurance money? It's a good question.

2530
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Now I've read

2531
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
and I don't know if this is true but I've read

2532
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
that a big part of the

2533
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
the castle is 77

2534
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
feet tall I believe right? Did you read

2535
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
that? That's right.

2536
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Which is very small when you think about what it might be.

2537
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
It's not even in the top 10

2538
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
structures size wise at the

2539
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
Disneyland Resort. Relatively short compared

2540
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
to everything else. But I think a big part of

2541
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
it is that the Matterhorn would look really

2542
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
weird if

2543
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
you built a bigger castle.

2544
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
The Matterhorn now with the perspective looks like

2545
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
it's a mountain in the distance a little bit. But I

2546
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
think the

2547
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
building this I don't know what the actual numbers are but

2548
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
you had 30 feet and then it's

2549
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
the same size as the Matterhorn which feels

2550
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
weird. So

2551
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
if they were

2552
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
like we're going to do the same exact design

2553
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
but bigger but we're also demolishing

2554
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
the Matterhorn and building

2555
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
a bigger Matterhorn or one that's

2556
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
looks in a different like I don't know if you can

2557
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
make the perspective different. Then I could

2558
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
possibly be interested

2559
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
in burning down

2560
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Sleeping Beauty's Castle for

2561
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
insurance money. It's both. This is

2562
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
a pact. Both have to go.

2563
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
That's what I'm saying. But come back.

2564
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
Yes. And I would argue that

2565
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
if you're going to build it bigger at the very least

2566
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
it should look almost give the

2567
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
exact same vibe as the

2568
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
current one. Just make it bigger and like

2569
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
make it have more. You'd still have a walk

2570
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
through it I bet. Unless you want to

2571
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
have a ride if it's big enough which I don't think it could be.

2572
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
But I could be

2573
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
convinced to burn it down

2574
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
but I think you have to rebuild the

2575
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Matterhorn as well. Interesting.

2576
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
But now are you

2577
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
how would you feel about it's just bigger

2578
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Matterhorn and not

2579
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
because I also

2580
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
like the idea of the Matterhorn being way

2581
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
taller. So you're saying Sleeping Beauty stays the same

2582
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
and Matterhorn gets double the size?

2583
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Double Matterhorn. I'm in for that.

2584
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
And again that's another really

2585
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
really steep dips in there but smooth.

2586
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Well again that's a rumor

2587
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
we've read is that that thing's going to have

2588
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
to be torn down in the next couple decades because

2589
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
it's falling apart. Yeah I was going to say

2590
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
structurally it's amazing it's still standing at

2591
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
all. So maybe you

2592
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
have to double it in size if you're going

2593
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
to redo it. I mean I think you want to compete

2594
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
with today's rides. Yeah. Yeah.

2595
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Or who knows what will become

2596
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
of it. It would end up being so

2597
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
skinny that I think it would

2598
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
just feel like this big odd

2599
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
lump if you because it couldn't get much wider.

2600
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Yeah. You're right. Right.

2601
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
So just like it's a it's like a big

2602
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
thick pole basically

2603
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
like heading up into the sky. Yeah. Yeah.

2604
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Yeah. I kind of like it.

2605
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
It could be weird. Big thick pole.

2606
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Big thick pole. And let

2607
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Josh Mayhem do it. Make it all rainbow

2608
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
drippy. Yeah and you can you can

2609
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
watch the big pole. There's a show

2610
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
that happens but you can watch from the roof of Arthur and

2611
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Sons from downtown Disney.

2612
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Your big cigar.

2613
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Your stogie and your verve.

2614
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
You get injected with tea.

2615
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
You get injected testosterone

2616
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
at the table too. If somebody comes around

2617
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
sir will you laugh. So laugh

2618
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
with all the spittle laugh

2619
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
at everyone around you.

2620
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
But I

2621
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
yeah I I'm

2622
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
I'm not so this is really

2623
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
I feel like I've almost evolved in some of my

2624
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
thinking. I don't want the rivers of America

2625
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
to go away in Florida. I think

2626
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
that's probably a bad

2627
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
idea. I don't know why it had to come to that.

2628
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
It doesn't seem right to do

2629
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
that. I mean I understand it's

2630
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
expensive to keep up the swamp

2631
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
land with the water. Like that's probably part of

2632
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
the part of the decision. But you could spend

2633
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
a lot of money and fix it I think. I don't think

2634
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
it's impossible. Yeah. But

2635
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
I am not so

2636
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
precious that I wouldn't

2637
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
I couldn't be convinced of

2638
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
demolishing some landmarks

2639
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
and making cool version

2640
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
cooler new versions of them. Okay.

2641
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
I think. Okay. But it depends.

2642
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
It depends what the new one would look like.

2643
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
And it depends on the philosophy.

2644
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
Any thoughts Jason about

2645
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
the old ranking system.

2646
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Yeah I think this one

2647
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
I'm going to go with keep the same.

2648
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
I think it is charming. I think it

2649
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
suits Disneyland

2650
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
well.

2651
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
I don't know that the newer

2652
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
iterations of the company I would

2653
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
trust. I got to

2654
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
look at that Hong Kong castle again because

2655
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
I have looked at it before and the concept

2656
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
art looked very cool

2657
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
of like little pieces of different

2658
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
castles or different characters

2659
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
homes.

2660
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
And the execution and

2661
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
taking something from two dimensional

2662
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
drawings to three dimensional

2663
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
space. That's what I'm wondering.

2664
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
It just looks like a hodgepodge. That's what I'm wondering

2665
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
if it looks weird in person. Yeah.

2666
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
I guess there's something silly seeming

2667
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
about it. Yeah I'd be curious.

2668
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
I wouldn't mind and they kind of did

2669
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
it's not connected in Disney World when they did

2670
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
the Fantasyland expansion.

2671
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
I wouldn't mind if they like made the castle

2672
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
like wider. Like I wouldn't

2673
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
mind if like because right now it kind of

2674
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
blends into like the little

2675
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
what's the where

2676
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
the dancing takes place. Fantasy Fair.

2677
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Fantasy Fair. Thank you with Figaro and everything.

2678
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
But I wouldn't mind if they even

2679
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
like did something

2680
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
that would like I don't know make

2681
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
it take up more space but doesn't have to

2682
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
go vertical. Maybe there's no room for

2683
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
that but expanding

2684
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
the like spires and more. Yeah like

2685
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
I don't know. I guess you'd have to

2686
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
get rid of dark rides probably.

2687
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
More impenetrable. Yeah. More to fight spitters.

2688
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Yeah. I think

2689
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
my I think I would do the most

2690
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
subtle plus it up which is

2691
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
give me room to have a drink

2692
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
up there. Well I want to go to the top.

2693
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
I don't like

2694
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
and I you know I mean another person would be

2695
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
nice. I guess I'd like to share this with Aaron

2696
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
but you can only fit one

2697
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
you know. Maybe it's a good place to go get some reflecting

2698
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
done. I want a glass of champagne

2699
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
on top of the

2700
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
imagine the feeling of like you're

2701
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
all it's like just

2702
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
just having the tip of the

2703
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
castle to yourself. So it's a

2704
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
bar for one person? Yeah.

2705
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Okay. Yep. Yeah. Okay.

2706
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
And it's just like I want anyone carping my

2707
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
style. Even my

2708
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
best friend.

2709
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Is there a bartender up there too?

2710
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
No.

2711
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
No you get the they give you the drink and then

2712
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
like all right she's all yours and then you walk

2713
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
up a little spiral staircase. Okay.

2714
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Then you just sit and think.

2715
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Just think about your life. Think like

2716
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
my god it all goes by so fast.

2717
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Once I was just a kid here and now I'm at

2718
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
cape age.

2719
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
But they

2720
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
they play a kids bop

2721
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
version of closing time when you have to

2722
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
leave. Kids bop

2723
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
version. You don't have

2724
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
to go home but you can't stay here.

2725
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Okay. And technically that

2726
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
you know that's not

2727
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
doesn't have to be about a bar. Like they don't have to

2728
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
kids bopify it. You know that could be about a

2729
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
cheeky cheese closing. It's a very good point.

2730
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Yeah.

2731
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
You don't have to go home.

2732
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
It's creepy.

2733
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
I want to be there so bad. Just the solo.

2734
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
I'm not even a champagne person

2735
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
really but like what else would you drink up there?

2736
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Bourbon. Bourbon.

2737
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
Alright.

2738
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
I think you survived.

2739
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Did you see

2740
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
that before the walk through was open?

2741
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Did you see this? What the castle

2742
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
was full of?

2743
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Not Nazi plunder. Not Nazi plunder.

2744
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
Cats and fleas.

2745
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
I saw multiple

2746
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
fleas full of fleas. There was one

2747
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
door you could open. Ah! Visible

2748
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
fleas. Tens of thousands

2749
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
of them. Multiple people online have

2750
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
said that it was full of fleas

2751
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
because of the cats. So Walt went

2752
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
in there to look and he got like fleas

2753
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
on him.

2754
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
So they were like oh shit. He opened a door

2755
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
and they all vocalized

2756
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
ah! Yeah.

2757
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Jumped right into his mustache.

2758
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
We can thrive

2759
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
in here. Yeah. Sleeping Beauty's

2760
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Castle was full of fleas

2761
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
before it had the walk through.

2762
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
So if we're really

2763
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
being traditionalists here, if we're really going

2764
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
class of 55, they should

2765
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
honor that tradition. They should bring the

2766
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
fleas back. Bring the fleas back.

2767
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
It's a wedding day fleas.

2768
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Another castle kind of

2769
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
annex. The Castle

2770
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Heraldry Shop. Did you guys

2771
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
ever pop in there? Oh I've been

2772
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
yeah. Where you could get family crests.

2773
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
You could get like a shield right?

2774
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Yeah you could get a shield or an expensive

2775
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
sword. And that's not

2776
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
there anymore. It's I

2777
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
I'm seeing it left in 2017.

2778
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
But I

2779
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
I wandered in there once years after first going

2780
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
to Disneyland and went you can buy a fucking

2781
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
piece of armor but it felt like that in there. Yeah.

2782
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Wow. It was like why is this

2783
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
and then like of course shortly after I discovered

2784
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
it was there. It was gone

2785
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
because they were like no one's buying. Wow.

2786
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
Very expensive. No one's ever in the year.

2787
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Wow. So if you

2788
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
wanted protection while you

2789
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
stormed a toxically

2790
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
masculine bourbon and

2791
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
steak place. Downtown Disney yeah. If you went in

2792
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
charged in with a sword

2793
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
and needed some help blocking the

2794
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
security guards. That's where you

2795
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
would have gone. Trying to cut it up.

2796
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
You would have gone there.

2797
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Jason carving J into everything

2798
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
like Zorro.

2799
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Did you buy it? I reclaimed this place

2800
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
for innocence.

2801
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
Tortilla in the honor of

2802
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Tortilla Joe. T.J.

I will avenge you Tortilla. T.J.

2804
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
What for Trader Joe's?

2805
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
No. No. Tortilla Joe's.

2806
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Make you proud sir.

2807
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Tortilla Jason is here.

2808

2824
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
reading of something that I

2825
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
when I looked up people who

2826
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
met Walt Disney in the War

2827
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
it led to the always reliable

2828
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Quora results.

2829
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
People looking for an answer to the question

2830
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
did Hitler and Walt Disney

2831
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
ever meet? Oh God.

2832
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
And the answer is no.

2833
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Wink wink.

2834
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
I could not

2835
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
I could not find

2836
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
anything because Walt gave

2837
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Lenny Riefenstahl a

2838
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
tour of like Walt Disney Studios.

2839
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
I did not see any

2840
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
stories of her going to Disneyland and

2841
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
going like oh it's like a tiny

2842
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
new swatch castle.

2843
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
