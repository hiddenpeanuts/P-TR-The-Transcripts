1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,160
Have we ever sang Hey Hey Mr. Postman to start one of these?

2
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,160
I don't think so.

3
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,160
You don't think so?

4
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,440
That'd be good to do because there's not that many different things to do.

5
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,960
So to say hello on an episode like this?

6
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,960
Yeah I get it.

7
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,240
I mean are we all at once?

8
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,640
Are you just going to take it or?

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,720
I really only know Hey Hey Hey, how many hey's are there?

10
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:46,360
Mr. Postman, hey hey hey hey hey, is that it?

11
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:52,040
Mr. Postman, look and see, is there a letter in your bag for me?

12
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:57,840
You know I know that less from the original and more from the Carpenter's version of it

13
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,760
which has a really delightful music video that was filmed at Disneyland.

14
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,560
Things tied together here.

15
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:10,640
It's actually very nice because it's not, you know, they're not going to let a music

16
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,640
entity that they don't own film a music video there at this point, I don't think.

17
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,520
You don't think they let Meghan Trainor film a video?

18
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,320
Well they let her, they have a lot of-

19
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,320
She's in the family.

20
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,320
Yeah.

21
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,880
You're correct though that it's not like all of those artists are Disney artists as proven

22
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,680
by the Smashing Pumpkins participation.

23
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,680
Right.

24
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,920
Actually that's a good question, any other, of all the music videos, not music videos

25
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,640
but little musical numbers that have been filmed in all these various, do you guys flash

26
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,000
to any like oh that one makes me so happy?

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,120
This is so nice, they're on the Mark Twain, they're doing all the old timey Americana

28
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,120
kind of stuff.

29
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,040
Oh, because you know what's another one, there's some 4th of July special that starts

30
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:02,880
with Tevin Campbell later singer of Eye to Eye doing a cover of Sweet Freedom, the Michael

31
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,560
McDonald song that goes for like 10 minutes, more of a patriotic version with a marching

32
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,560
band.

33
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,880
Shine sweet freedom, that's coast to coast, it goes to Orlando and then comes back to

34
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,880
Disneyland.

35
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,880
Wow.

36
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,880
Big show stopper.

37
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,040
Any other, and do you guys flash to anything though?

38
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,560
I like Glen Campbell wandering through marshland.

39
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,480
Oh that's right, the opening of Disney World, yeah that is a good one.

40
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:39,920
Gloria Estefan at the, it's timed with the opening of Caribbean Beach, I think they filmed

41
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:46,800
during one of the, maybe a Christmas parade, does she, I think she does conga.

42
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,800
Seems very possible.

43
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,800
And Goofy might be there.

44
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:54,880
I mean there's a lot of Gloria Estefan Disney association and numbers, but yeah I gotta

45
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,840
place the one you're talking about.

46
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,480
If we talk much about that, those Sebastian videotapes, what's the guy's name, Samuel

47
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,400
Wright, the voice of Sebastian, that he did these Calypso concerts, the Caribbean Beach

48
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:14,240
Hotel maybe, those are some nice old home video recommended, maybe we'll watch them

49
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,240
some day.

50
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,320
Hey they were, things filmed at the parks, that means we owe it, that means we could

51
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,560
get episodes out of it.

52
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,720
Two videos, that means two separate episodes, the Sebastian double block coming.

53
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:33,600
But for now, let's take your questions, anybody see, is there a letter in the bag for us?

54
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:40,200
Oh I think there are a few letters, yeah, Megan Cherry asked, what do you think will

55
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,400
be the next portal added to Epic Universe?

56
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,960
Hopefully it'll be a long while before they do so, but the parks concept is definitely

57
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,480
designed to expand.

58
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,280
Yes, I don't know that it'll be so long, the way Universal builds.

59
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,640
I don't know that it'll be, you know, more than ten years.

60
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:04,040
I feel like it'll be under, let's make a prediction, how soon will a new portal be built at Epic

61
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,040
Universe?

62
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,800
Do you think five years, ten years?

63
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,560
I believe there'll be a new one within six years.

64
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,360
I think there'll be a new portal at Epic Universe, Jason, what do you think?

65
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,080
We're starting to bet, which I like on this show, we're starting talking about betting

66
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,360
for D23, and I think we should do more bets in general.

67
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,880
Playing with house money, with Patreon money, yeah, yeah, alright, this is for, I don't

68
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,360
get a cut this month if I'm wrong.

69
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,360
I don't pay bills this month.

70
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,880
Jason, you have a year?

71
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,560
So Scott was eight.

72
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,880
Mine was six.

73
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,880
Yours was six.

74
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,880
Yeah.

75
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,320
I'll go under, I'll say five.

76
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,040
Okay, five, you undercut me like Price is Right style.

77
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,040
Yes.

78
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,080
Okay, very good, that's okay, I'm comfortable with that.

79
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,840
You know, as opposed to Price is Right, this is anti-glamactic because we don't have the

80
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,840
answer right now.

81
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,840
We don't, that's true.

82
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,840
We have to wait five years.

83
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,840
No, time will tell.

84
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,840
Yeah.

85
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,840
Yeah.

86
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,800
But properties are things, what's in the portals?

87
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,840
Yeah, so the thing is, I think they're going to do more of, like, we're getting a lot

88
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,040
of Nintendo.

89
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,760
So I feel like we're getting, like, another portal for Nintendo because, like, Nintendo

90
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:21,600
can expand out, expand out, but I feel like it's not going to be maybe another, like,

91
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,600
wildly different property.

92
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:29,200
I know the rumor is Pokemon going into Simpsons Land in Orlando and Zelda going into Lost

93
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,200
Continent, but, like, I think they're going to go, like, hog wild here and I think we

94
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:39,520
could get, like, a full another, like, Mario Land or something with a different portal.

95
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,760
Maybe that's wrong.

96
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,800
Maybe, I'm hoping it's something totally new, but.

97
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,640
Well, I would happily take every, let's do the Pyramids Land, let's do the land where

98
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,880
everything's big.

99
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,320
Even I will take that.

100
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,760
That'd be cool.

101
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,880
I always think not enough Mario 2 representation.

102
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,160
I love Birdo, but it's a whole other world.

103
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,240
Like, I think they'd be, it's one of those they'd analyze, like, is there really an appetite

104
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,240
for Mario 2?

105
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,640
I'm like, I think so.

106
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,640
It's in our bones, right?

107
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,640
Yeah.

108
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,640
Mario, yeah.

109
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:13,680
Like, not the canon, but don't we all kind of, like, don't we all want to take a bite

110
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,400
out of a big turnip?

111
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,400
Of course.

112
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,400
Yes.

113
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,840
Mario 2, there is something very, I love all the Mario games, but Mario 2 definitely felt

114
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,840
special and it felt special because you could play as the different characters for the first

115
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,840
time.

116
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:30,280
Imagine opening a door or, like, you know, taking a, drinking from a vial, a big, big

117
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:36,080
red vial, and then you go into a weird negative zone of the same place that you were already

118
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,880
in and you got to leave six seconds later.

119
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:47,040
Also Mario 2 would be space efficient because you could build up, you know, more up happening

120
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,040
in that game.

121
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,040
That's good too.

122
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,040
Yeah, build to the sky.

123
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:55,080
I will say my wish for it is, and that's not my original idea, I've seen people say this,

124
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,920
retro universal portal.

125
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,600
This should be the next portal they make.

126
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,600
Yeah.

127
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,000
Like, I understand it's not going to be a full portal of, like, back to the future land

128
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,760
because they're not making new movies right now.

129
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,760
But a full-

130
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,760
Shudder when you say that.

131
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,920
I know I say it every once in a while.

132
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,920
It's true.

133
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,920
You know it's true.

134
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,920
I know, but yeah.

135
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,920
It's a matter of time.

136
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,920
Clock's ticking on that.

137
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,360
At least we got, at least there's people alive preventing it from happening.

138
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,360
That's right.

139
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,560
But it's, clock is ticking.

140
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:28,240
At the very least you could, like, sell it to money people and be like, well, back to

141
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,580
the future is still popular.

142
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:35,260
At the very least you could sell, like, smaller rides or experiences based on Ghostbusters

143
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:39,540
back to the future ET, obviously ET's still in Orlando.

144
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,540
But at the very-

145
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,980
Wait, that's a question actually.

146
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,820
If it's not ET, what's, I mean, wouldn't a-

147
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:45,820
Jaws?

148
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,820
Yeah.

149
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,620
I think the retro universal land would have to be back to the future Ghostbusters Jaws,

150
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,620
right?

151
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,620
Those are the big three.

152
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,620
And if you hit anything else, then you do.

153
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,620
Sure.

154
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,540
I wouldn't be mad at some other ET thing there.

155
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:00,300
But yes, there would be no reason, I guess, to build a new ET ride, dark ride.

156
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,820
Unless it was to, like, protect the, I don't like that.

157
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,300
I feel like it would get jazzed up a little too much.

158
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,300
Yeah.

159
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,660
We haven't talked about Botanicus' cape, I don't think.

160
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,180
Oh, we haven't talked about that.

161
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,180
Yeah.

162
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,180
He has a new cape.

163
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,180
A big leaf cape.

164
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,420
He has a cape.

165
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:24,540
And then also in the epic universe, dark universe footage, you do see a Dracula in a cape.

166
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:28,020
So they got our letters, you know?

167
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,440
Because you mentioned specifically on when we were talking about the reveal that Dracula

168
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,740
did not have a cape and I said the same thing.

169
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,940
I was talking about how I was upset that he didn't seem to have a cape.

170
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,260
But I guess he does have a cape.

171
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,260
Yeah.

172
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,260
So that's good.

173
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,260
Okay.

174
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,260
And they're adding capes left and right in Universal Orlando, which is where we're at.

175
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,260
Everybody needs a cape.

176
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,260
Mario's getting a cape.

177
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,260
Super Mario World Mario had a cape.

178
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,260
Mm-hmm.

179
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,260
And he flew, when he flew.

180
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,260
True.

181
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,260
And he hit people with it.

182
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,260
I'd like to see that cape.

183
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,260
Yeah, yeah.

184
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,260
The cape should be in play.

185
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,260
Absolutely.

186
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:55,980
All right.

187
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,980
Two is its own world.

188
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:57,980
World is its own.

189
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,980
I don't know.

190
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,980
Yes.

191
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,980
And then all the recent ones.

192
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,980
Galaxy, whatever.

193
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,980
100%.

194
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,980
Well, even just rides.

195
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,140
Like, Metroid and Star Fox, tailor-made for rides.

196
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,140
No, Star Fox.

197
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,540
Look, Star Fox doesn't get treated well by Nintendo.

198
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:16,900
And that's a whole nother episode of this podcast, or a different podcast.

199
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:20,100
But yeah, Metroid has a new game coming out they just announced.

200
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,860
But yes, Retro Universal should be the next one.

201
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,060
You could sell all of that stuff in pieces.

202
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,060
That's the only way it's happening.

203
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,060
It's not going to be Jaws Land.

204
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,300
It's not going to be Back to the Future Land.

205
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,540
But I think maybe if you put all the little pieces together, you could sell it to the

206
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,540
people in charge.

207
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,540
The greatest hits.

208
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,300
I think that's a really cool idea.

209
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,380
Well, this is what the parade is.

210
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:45,220
This is what their big new parade in the summer.

211
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,540
Creative people know that's what the people want.

212
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,540
So you're getting it in small.

213
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:52,700
It's vintage stuff for the millennial parents and then the minions for the kids.

214
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,420
If kids still like minions, presumably.

215
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,420
I think they do.

216
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,740
But yeah, so you're seeing it everywhere.

217
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,740
You're seeing the parade.

218
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:02,340
You're seeing it in the new show they're doing, the new Lagoon show, which looks cool.

219
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,340
And it's drones.

220
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,460
But it's got Back to the Future.

221
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,460
It's got Ghostbusters.

222
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,700
You see a big stay puff in the drones.

223
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:14,620
We act like Ghostbusters is a given, but is Sony going to just...

224
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,620
I don't know.

225
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:20,460
Maybe we don't end up with Ghostbusters due to corporations not getting along.

226
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,460
It's possible.

227
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:27,100
Their presence has been felt in different things in the retro, in the retro sphere at

228
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,100
Universal Orlando.

229
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,940
Would we take, if they're going to take things that they own...

230
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,420
I mean, I don't know.

231
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,420
That Ghostbusters show.

232
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,940
I never got to see it in person, actually.

233
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:35,940
It seemed cool.

234
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:41,940
But I would definitely take if Retro Universal Land was instead Jaws Back to the Future King

235
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:50,620
Kong and it's like an old style revamped so that it's less of a breakdown risk.

236
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,420
But that's kind of a good greatest hits.

237
00:10:53,420 --> 00:11:00,020
And then the portal could be like the old entrance was, or going back to original Studio

238
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,020
Gate.

239
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,100
Yeah, that would be awesome.

240
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,260
So that's what they should do.

241
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,420
But I think it'll be like, oh, a portal, but it's like kind of another Nintendo Land.

242
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,420
That's my guess.

243
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,420
I don't know.

244
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,420
This might be related.

245
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:13,220
Matt Vullich, what ride has opened up in the last 15 years that was the biggest letdown

246
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,780
and what would you do to fix it?

247
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,180
I go to...

248
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:22,060
Maybe we've covered this a little bit, but I definitely go to Mario Kart in terms of

249
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,700
how much we built up.

250
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:28,940
And I guess we already talked about, but I mean, I love the idea of it being more of

251
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:35,360
like a wild mouse and you're in a little style cart and it's more about like, it's less about

252
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:41,860
interactivity and more about like quick turns and ducks and weaves and every car is different.

253
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,460
But that's like a cop out.

254
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:47,620
Is there any way they could take what they currently have and make it...

255
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,620
No.

256
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,620
No?

257
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,620
I don't think so.

258
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,620
What if you just make it faster?

259
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,620
No.

260
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,620
I don't think so.

261
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,620
Yeah.

262
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,620
I think it is what it is right now.

263
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:03,220
I mean, you maybe could make it go faster, but I think it would be a lot of work.

264
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,260
I don't think that track is prepared for that.

265
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:10,860
So yeah, in order to change it, I think it would be a tremendous amount of work.

266
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,860
And I don't know.

267
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,580
It doesn't seem like, yeah, it's fixable.

268
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,060
And again, people like it.

269
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,020
So I guess some people claim it doesn't need fixing, but...

270
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:26,660
You know, now that I've played so much on the Switch, I get why they really honed in

271
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:34,300
on the items, but I'm also really just trying to go fast, trying to outrun the other items.

272
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,860
This remains so interesting that you are new to Mario Kart this year.

273
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,860
Yeah, I never...

274
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:43,220
I would play it every now and then at a friend's house, but it was never a huge thing for me.

275
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,220
Now that I'm playing...

276
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:49,820
Now that I'm playing, we bought the DLC, it doubles the amount of tracks.

277
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,860
You essentially get a whole second game.

278
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,860
Yeah.

279
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,860
Are you good at the game?

280
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,860
Well, we're pretty good, but...

281
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,740
We are good as...

282
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,740
Together we're good?

283
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,740
You're talking about...

284
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:04,380
Jane and I, well, we race each other, but we usually turn on the auto.

285
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,420
Like, there's steering...

286
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,940
There's an easier steering you can turn on, you know what I mean?

287
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:10,940
Oh, you're playing in like easy mode.

288
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,940
Yeah, oh yeah.

289
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:12,940
So you're not drifting.

290
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,940
Because it's more fun.

291
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:14,940
Who wins more often?

292
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,940
No, you can drift.

293
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,260
I think she wins more.

294
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,260
Okay.

295
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:23,260
Do you play like on hard or the hardest levels when you're playing the computer, or do you

296
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,540
just race each other?

297
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,780
I'll play against the computer.

298
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,420
A lot of times we'll pick random.

299
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:35,420
I like to do a full, like, all four circuit.

300
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,420
Okay.

301
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,420
Sometimes.

302
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,420
Four tracks, yeah.

303
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,420
Yeah.

304
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,420
I haven't played in a bit.

305
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,420
I don't know.

306
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,060
I'm wondering how we would stack up in a Mario Kart contest.

307
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,060
Cool.

308
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,060
I'm wondering.

309
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,060
It'd be worth doing.

310
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,060
We could do that.

311
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,060
And fun.

312
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,060
Jason's the one playing.

313
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,380
I haven't played in Mario Kart in a few years at this point.

314
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:55,860
We like to toggle items, like certain items on and off.

315
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,660
You mean before the race starts?

316
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:03,020
Yeah, you can customize which items you have.

317
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:06,780
Lightning Strike is kind of annoying.

318
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:07,780
You turn it off?

319
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,780
Yeah.

320
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,180
What is this version of Mario Kart you're playing?

321
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,180
We're customizing it.

322
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,220
We're eliminating big, exciting things that can happen.

323
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,660
Turn on easy steering and turn on lightning.

324
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:20,060
But we're not doing that when we play.

325
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,660
I like Boomerang, but she likes Fire Flower.

326
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,660
Okay.

327
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,660
I feel like.

328
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,780
Do you turn them both on or off?

329
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,260
I'll turn them both on.

330
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,260
Okay.

331
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,260
What?

332
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,500
I say tomato and you say tomato.

333
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,500
Toilet.

334
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,780
She likes the Boomerang and I like the Fire Flower.

335
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,780
Okay.

336
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:42,740
Do you do any other modifications?

337
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,740
I don't think so.

338
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,740
I think just normal.

339
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,780
Who's your player?

340
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:50,620
I switch around a lot, but I like Wario.

341
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:53,100
I like Tanooki suit Mario.

342
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,100
Sure.

343
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,700
I like Toad.

344
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,020
I usually like faster racers.

345
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,020
Yeah.

346
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,020
They should make it so you can.

347
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:07,940
I would love if you could unlock outside of the Marioverse, a la NBA Jam, you could unlock.

348
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:12,340
I want to play Mario Kart as Charles Barkley or Christian Leitner.

349
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,340
Yeah.

350
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,780
An old NBA.

351
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,620
Brianna asks, is Harbor Hoedown still on the table?

352
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,380
And quickly I'll just say yes.

353
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,980
I didn't consult with my co-hosts, but I'll say yes.

354
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:24,980
This was not discussed.

355
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,980
I'll just say yes.

356
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:26,980
It's on the table.

357
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:27,980
But they don't.

358
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,980
Yeah.

359
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:29,980
They don't.

360
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:30,980
We'll talk about that off mic.

361
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,940
Heather Miller asks, aside from Eisner, who are each of the hosts dream guests?

362
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:38,540
And I will say right now I got my eyes focused on Mr. Billy Corgan.

363
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,060
I got somebody working on it and we'll see.

364
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,420
I don't, I'm not promising anything.

365
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:47,300
It might be impossible, but that's my man right now is Mr. Billy Corgan from the Smashing

366
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,300
Pumpkins.

367
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,300
Seems possible.

368
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,300
It seems possible.

369
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:54,300
I'm just saying I'm not promising it yet, but right now that's who I've honed in on as

370
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,500
I'm working on it.

371
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,580
Nobody else is working on it for me.

372
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,580
Is that so?

373
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,580
Yeah.

374
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,580
Oh.

375
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,580
Oh boy.

376
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,580
Hey, that's good.

377
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,580
Yeah.

378
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,580
Dream guest.

379
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,580
God.

380
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,580
I don't have a dream guest.

381
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,580
Yeah.

382
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,900
Eisner is our dream guest number one.

383
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,900
I think collectively.

384
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,900
Yeah.

385
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,900
Yeah.

386
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,220
And then, and then Breck Eisner, you'd have to include in there.

387
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,780
That would be part of it.

388
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,780
Yeah.

389
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:24,820
Is anybody like in a lot of specials who we could, you know, or anybody who is in a TGIF,

390
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,140
you know, let's talk to Coolie.

391
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,140
Yeah.

392
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,020
I tried with a Jody Sweeten a couple of years ago.

393
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,300
We could try that again.

394
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,300
You tried Jody Sweeten?

395
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,300
Yeah.

396
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,820
That might not be out of the realm of possibility.

397
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,260
They all podcast now.

398
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,260
That's what I mean.

399
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,260
Every one of them has got a podcast.

400
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,620
Like a Kurt Russell might be interesting.

401
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,620
I love Kurt Russell.

402
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:44,060
Obviously everyone does, but he was around in the old days.

403
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,620
He seems affable.

404
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,620
Yeah.

405
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,620
So that's, that's up there.

406
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,620
I would think.

407
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,620
That's a pie in the sky.

408
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,620
I haven't tried with Kurt Russell.

409
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,620
Yeah.

410
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:54,220
But you know, is there an old, yeah, Jason, do you have anybody?

411
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:58,900
Well, he's gone from the company now and I, I think he has a book out, but it's probably

412
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:04,260
through Disney publishing, but Bob Weiss is at a different company now.

413
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:09,020
And he worked on a lot of, in addition to being the head of Imagineering, like he worked

414
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,020
on like.

415
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,020
That's probably doable.

416
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,020
Yeah.

417
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,020
Send an email.

418
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,020
Some interesting stuff.

419
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:19,420
And I think some calamitous stuff through no fault of his, just through timing and budgets.

420
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,900
Don't say anything bad about him here.

421
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,580
If we want him on the show, it's paywall or okay.

422
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,700
Yeah.

423
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,700
Fair enough.

424
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,700
Fair enough.

425
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,700
Does anyone want to be our booker?

426
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,700
Does anyone, is anyone better with people?

427
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,700
Oh my God.

428
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,700
We would need a booker.

429
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,700
Yeah.

430
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,700
And pushiness.

431
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,700
Yes.

432
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,700
We need a lot of people to do the jobs we do.

433
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,700
That is a good point.

434
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,700
We do all the jobs, if anyone's wondering.

435
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,700
Yeah, it's true.

436
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,940
We're all operating multiple cranks and levers and pedals at all.

437
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,980
We're all one man bands like Bert and Mary Poppins.

438
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,060
I have one here.

439
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:58,940
Cassie says, heard there is going to be a Munsters reboot called 1313, but it's horror.

440
00:17:58,940 --> 00:17:59,940
Discuss.

441
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:04,700
I don't have a lot to discuss, but when Munsters isn't funny, it's just the universal monsters,

442
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,700
isn't it?

443
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,700
Yeah.

444
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,700
Isn't that?

445
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,700
Yeah.

446
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,700
Then the premise is imagine if there was a Frankenstein.

447
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,700
Right.

448
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,700
Well, so.

449
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,700
The Munsters become monsters.

450
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:20,220
I suppose that the interesting thing is that like a Frankenstein has a father-in-law who's

451
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,460
a vampire.

452
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,460
I guess them all being together.

453
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,460
I guess that's still somewhat interesting.

454
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,460
Yeah, but I don't.

455
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,460
But it's still the monster.

456
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,460
They're monsters now.

457
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,460
Mm-hmm.

458
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,460
So.

459
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:31,060
I don't really want to see like, I don't want to see what it's like to like, you don't

460
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,780
understand dad, you're a Frankenstein.

461
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,780
I'm a Wolfman.

462
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,780
Right.

463
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,780
That's funny.

464
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,780
We have nothing in common.

465
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,780
Uh-huh.

466
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,780
That's funny.

467
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,780
Level with me.

468
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,780
Am I adopted?

469
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:45,980
I was going to say they already kind of tried this with the Brian Fuller, Brian Singer one.

470
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,500
They tried this every seven years.

471
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:53,740
There's these properties that they just like, all right, we're going back at it.

472
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,700
Flintstones are trying it again.

473
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,700
Look, God damn it.

474
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:01,140
And the press release, the Deadline Articles are like, God damn it, we're trying the Flintstones

475
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,140
again.

476
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,140
All right?

477
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,140
Shut the fuck up.

478
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:09,780
Flintstones with Family Guy people got pretty, it might've gotten some scripts written.

479
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,780
What do you mean?

480
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,780
Do you remember this?

481
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,780
The Flintstones were going to get rebooted.

482
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,980
Oh, Simon Carlin was doing a new Flintstones, but it never came out.

483
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,980
It never came out.

484
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,980
I do remember this.

485
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:21,260
It's like the Donald Glover Deadpool where it's like he got pretty far and then they

486
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,260
pulled the plug.

487
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:27,580
At any moment there are 10 people working on a new Flintstones or a new Scooby-Doo.

488
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:30,420
There's five Scooby-Doo's on the air right now.

489
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:35,740
There are five to 10 more people working on new Scooby-Doo's to replace those Scooby-Doo's.

490
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:39,780
It has only gotten weirder and worse when it comes to new stuff.

491
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,700
And everything, everything in this list Josh Gad is attached to.

492
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:47,220
And Josh Gad is involved in every single property.

493
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:51,820
So yeah, I did hear that and I'm, I'm open to it.

494
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,820
If somebody says it's good, I'm open to it.

495
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:58,420
It just feels a little bit silly to not make the Munsters silly.

496
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,420
Yeah.

497
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:05,500
It feels a little silly to me to not, to take the humor away from the Munsters.

498
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:12,360
I would say give it back to any still living original writers.

499
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,360
From the Munsters?

500
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,520
I don't know if those Munsters are from I Love Lose.

501
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,600
Any 80 or 90 year olds, let them take a crack at it.

502
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,600
I don't know if those writers are, I don't know if we got any living Munsters writers.

503
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,720
I think more television.

504
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,320
We have enough boobers.

505
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,320
We have enough millennial saturation.

506
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:36,000
I want some geriatrics writing comedy scripts.

507
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,240
Let's take a page from Washington.

508
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,520
Why do we allow 20 year old comedians to do anything?

509
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,760
Let's put up blockades and all writers need to be north of 80.

510
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,440
That's a great point.

511
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,440
Let's let 20 year olds be politicians.

512
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:55,480
Let's write television, let television writers, you got to have an AARP card.

513
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,560
You got to be on social security.

514
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:02,400
I just doubt that there are a lot of living Munsters writers because I feel like they

515
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,400
were all 70 then.

516
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:10,040
Oh, that's a good, should we do a little betting on this?

517
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,560
How many Munsters writers are alive?

518
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,560
I bet there's like one.

519
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,560
I bet there's one Munsters writer that is alive.

520
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,560
I don't know if I feel comfortable saying zero.

521
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,560
I'll say one.

522
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,560
Let me go counter to my point and say three.

523
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,560
Okay.

524
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,560
We can figure this out afterward.

525
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:36,560
One of the creators born in 28 died in 2010.

526
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,560
That's not so long ago.

527
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,080
14 years ago.

528
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:46,080
He's only been dead for 14 years, so probably a lot of them are alive.

529
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,080
He's only been dead for a very long time.

530
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,080
Yeah, super long time.

531
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,080
Okay, I'm going to throw this one out.

532
00:21:55,080 --> 00:22:02,080
Tomas Maranera, what film that one of the parks would never adapt into a tacky 20 minute

533
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:08,080
truncated stage show like Beauty and the Beast, would you most want to see adapted into a

534
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,600
tacky 20 minute truncated stage show?

535
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,600
This is a little innovative question.

536
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,600
I like this.

537
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:21,600
To call out the genre of the condensed mini musical, fitting the entire story into a theme

538
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,600
park run that you can do five times a day.

539
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:32,600
I had this idea while staring at this question, if you guys want to think on it, but I think

540
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:39,120
a funny one, again, and they wouldn't do it now, but maybe they should do it now, because

541
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:46,120
there probably is a lot of nostalgia for Lizzie McGuire the movie, the filmed in Rome, I'm

542
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:53,520
sorry, the Lizzie McGuire movie, which is now over 20 years old, and that's the point

543
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,520
where there's a lot of nostalgia hunger.

544
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:01,520
Seeing theme park actors play Lizzie and Gordo.

545
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:09,440
Those could be face or they could wear giant mascot heads of Lizzie McGuire, that'd be

546
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,600
fine too, but that song at the end is pretty fun, right?

547
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:19,400
When she's the pop star, this is what dreams are made of or something, I'd like to see

548
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:26,400
that done on stage, and then having to do a Roman Vespa ride with a cycling background

549
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:32,400
that people have to move by hand, you get to travel in it, that's a good thing of these

550
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,400
shows, if everybody can get on a plane that just goes five feet and then like, hey, we're

551
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,400
here in Rome, so that's my vote, I want to hear, yeah, let's all of a sudden, out of

552
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,040
nowhere, the Lizzie McGuire movie live.

553
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:50,920
I in the same ballpark, I'm going to say, that's still very mysterious to me, but I'm

554
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:57,920
sure a lot of them are on Disney, plus now that era of early, I want Home on the Range,

555
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:06,120
Brother Bear Chicken Little, Treasure Planet, oh, there's one I'm missing.

556
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:15,680
These are mostly still a mystery to me, because I was like, I want to see 20 minutes, ooh,

557
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,520
that'd be great, that would actually be a really fun, because then you, oh, Home on

558
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:25,720
the Range, then you can kind of downplay the Roseanne connection, they seem like they've

559
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:29,800
distanced themselves a lot from that production.

560
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,040
I think it's cutting into their bottom line, I think we're seeing Disney hurt by the Roseanne

561
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:37,040
connection every day, they haven't distanced themselves enough, frankly, on the day that

562
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:43,480
that happened, Disney said nothing, I think they stand by Roseanne's tweet, as her former

563
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,600
employer.

564
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,680
They got to really address the Home on the Range situation.

565
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,080
Maybe they did say something, because they made Roseanne the show.

566
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,880
And then they changed it to the Connors.

567
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,840
But they didn't say jack shit about Home on the Range.

568
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,600
Well separating the art from the artists, like you don't want to penalize those poor

569
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,720
animated cows.

570
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,720
That's true.

571
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,720
Don't penalize the cows.

572
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,720
Don't penalize the cows.

573
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,720
Don't penalize the cows.

574
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,960
Rookie of the Year, could we do?

575
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:13,680
Does that technically follow the, yeah, Rookie of the Year never had like much Parks stuff,

576
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,040
or any Parks stuff, I've never seen a Rookie of the Year anything.

577
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,040
That's great.

578
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,200
And it would have to get songs then.

579
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,320
It would have to get songs.

580
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,560
And I guess, yeah, I guess they have to be original songs.

581
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,720
There's no original song from Rookie of the Year, is there?

582
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,400
Oh, we forget though, the John song, I'm Still Here, will be in Jason's, of course, the Johnny

583
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,040
Resnick song.

584
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,400
You just called that the John song.

585
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,400
The John song.

586
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,400
The John song.

587
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,920
Isn't it called the John song or something?

588
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,920
Well, I don't know that.

589
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,840
I thought you were calling it the John song because Johnny Resnick sings it.

590
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,240
Well, I do in my head, it's the John song.

591
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,960
I was thinking of the Joaquin Phoenix, I'm Still Here song.

592
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,920
Jim's, I'm sorry, it's Jim's theme.

593
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,920
John's song.

594
00:25:54,920 --> 00:26:00,880
It's Jim and John, J names boring, my name's boring too, I'm not insulting those names.

595
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,000
Sorry, Jim's theme made by John.

596
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,520
Jim's theme, parentheses Jim's theme, parentheses John's song.

597
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,520
Right.

598
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,840
So Rookie of the Year will also have a Johnny Resnick music that has been commissioned for

599
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,760
this 20 minute version.

600
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,840
The singer of the Goo Goo Dolls is doing.

601
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,840
Yeah.

602
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,840
Yeah.

603
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,840
That's a 90's movie.

604
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,840
I mean, it's a little, yeah.

605
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,840
1993.

606
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,040
Coming down the Pitcher's Mound.

607
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:30,320
It's parodies of Goo Goo Dolls songs.

608
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:35,640
Going faster than the real Cubs.

609
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:39,800
But you know, this is a, I feel like any kid who saw this had some affection for this movie

610
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,640
and I feel like this is underrepresented and you could have like that Daniel Stern character

611
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,840
is like real goofy.

612
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,840
He's like, I forget what he is.

613
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,480
Is he a pitching coach or something?

614
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,480
Yeah.

615
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,240
He gets like stuck in the middle of like two hotel rooms.

616
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,240
It's kind of like weird.

617
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,760
He's like doing slapstick in the middle of this movie, but you know, that's a good, that's

618
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,640
a fun character to see on stage.

619
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,640
Sure.

620
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,000
And then just, yeah, having the ball.

621
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,560
You could do like a, like a Phil Hart Magic Donald Duck thing with a cannon where he like,

622
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:12,240
the Rookie of the Year throws the ball out into the audience and then you see like, oh,

623
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,200
in the back it like, it bursts through the wall or something.

624
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,200
Oh, yeah.

625
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,200
Yeah.

626
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,600
It makes it do some bit like some kind of stereo, like whipping fast sound using the

627
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,600
speakers.

628
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,960
It makes it seem like a ball's going really fast.

629
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:29,000
And you look back and yeah, Daniel Stern's been like thrown into the, it'd be like, since

630
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,400
my pitching arm has been broken.

631
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,400
Yeah.

632
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,000
It would be both basically like that.

633
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,720
I guess we could just rewrite it then.

634
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:41,480
He doesn't have to actually, John, Johnny Resnick doesn't have to be involved.

635
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,960
We could just do parodies of everything.

636
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,400
Well, he gets the music money and we, he gets the music.

637
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,400
Yeah, he gets the music money.

638
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,400
The lyrics are us.

639
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,760
And I'm trying to think like, you know, how would you change the lyrics to Black Balloon?

640
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,160
It feels a little blasphemous, but you would have to do it.

641
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:59,520
Well, it'd be so jarring to people because everyone, as we've determined, everyone knows

642
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,600
the song so well from note one.

643
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:08,080
It is so instantly iconic and recognizable and people know the words really well.

644
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:14,480
When it comes time to sing the song, everyone can easily toss out every one of those lyrics.

645
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,480
Yeah.

646
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,240
Rookies, magic arm helps him throw.

647
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,800
That would be a good first line for it.

648
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,360
And people would go, oh, it's a Black Balloon parody.

649
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,680
The thing I'll say about Black Balloon is that the people that know Black Balloon do

650
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,120
feel the way I feel.

651
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,920
I believe that everyone should know Black Balloon, but then there's also people that

652
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,920
haven't heard it.

653
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,960
So it's almost like two separate universes.

654
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,160
What I'd say, I know, well, this is the, you know, the world we live in where we get our

655
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:43,560
news from different sources and we don't all have the same amount of exposure to Black

656
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,560
Balloon.

657
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,560
Right.

658
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,840
But what I would say to those people and what I'd say to you is I can't change my past.

659
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,520
I can't give myself exposure to Black Balloon that I never had.

660
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,520
Yeah.

661
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,840
I know that you wish that for me.

662
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,840
I do.

663
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,000
And it might have changed my whole life.

664
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,520
Maybe I would be, maybe I wouldn't make fun of you for liking Johnny Resnick so much.

665
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,520
Yeah.

666
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:06,240
But if I had that emotion, that might've, that might've propelled me to having a girlfriend

667
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,880
when I was 13 that I didn't have.

668
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,760
Well, it didn't propel me to having a girlfriend.

669
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:14,800
A love of Black Balloon didn't show the kind of sensitive guy you were.

670
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,800
It didn't help.

671
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,800
It didn't help at all.

672
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,800
It didn't.

673
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,800
Nothing could help.

674
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,680
Nothing at all could help.

675
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:27,640
The cool clerks at the record store, when I went in to ask for a ksingle of Iris, and

676
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,200
they were totally confused.

677
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,840
They're like, well, we have the CD and the whole soundtrack.

678
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,360
Did you say the word ksingle?

679
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,360
Yeah.

680
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,160
I had just learned about ksingles and I was like, well, this is great.

681
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,560
I have a cassette player.

682
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,560
And they didn't exist.

683
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,600
They didn't have a cassette of Iris?

684
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,600
No.

685
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,600
Well, not a ksingle.

686
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,600
You had to ask someone?

687
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,600
Huh?

688
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,600
You went, you have, this is a memory you have is asking specifically.

689
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,600
Right, because they would have a cassette.

690
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,600
Do you have Iris on ksingle?

691
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,600
Yes.

692
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,600
Wow.

693
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,600
And this is like 1998?

694
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Uh, was that when it came out?

695
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
97?

696
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
97.

697
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I'm like, this was 2011.

698
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
The record store hasn't been here for 11 years.

699
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,480
Did I buy a cassette after 1995?

700
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,480
That's a good question.

701
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,480
I did.

702
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,480
I bought ksingles in middle school.

703
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,400
I know that's still in my parents' bedroom because I was listening to a lot of hip hop

704
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,400
at the time.

705
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:26,720
And I know that I have ksingles of The Locks, Money Power and Respect, and Ice Cube's Push

706
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,840
and Wait.

707
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,840
Really?

708
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,720
Yay, yay, a Push Rhymes like Wait, a Push Rhymes like Wait.

709
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,200
Okay, what year is that?

710
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,160
This is all like 97, 98.

711
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:41,440
You were actually, you were brought on stage at the Kendrick Lamar pop out show in Inglewood.

712
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,440
To do that song?

713
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,440
Yeah, yeah.

714
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,920
You were in the picture of like 30 people.

715
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,040
You're actually there.

716
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,880
Now give it up for the guy who remembers Push and Wait.

717
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,760
You're to perform half the chorus and that is all.

718
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,760
People went wild though.

719
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,800
Uh, yeah.

720
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,800
You know what?

721
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,840
I know also in that closet I should own up to having a joint ksingle of Puff Daddy's

722
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,640
Been Around the World and all about the Benjamin's Rock Remix.

723
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,640
Oh yeah, I know those.

724
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:10,240
And I should really go back, I should find that in my parents' closet and due to Diddy's

725
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,720
recent and clearly forever actions, I should go run over that ksingle with my car.

726
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:22,400
Oh, I was going to say just tape over it with Black Balloon and then you can learn it.

727
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,400
You can work on learning it.

728
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,400
That would make him so mad.

729
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,400
Then I'll tweet at him.

730
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:33,280
Scott J. Klepper asked like a hundred questions, but the one that sticks out to me, which isn't

731
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,280
really a question.

732
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:38,160
I mean, it is a question, but he says, my wife says I bet Michael was a late bloomer.

733
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,160
What does she mean by that?

734
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:47,560
I mean, one of the safest bets that's come up recently on this show.

735
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,560
Yeah.

736
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,400
And I wonder too, like does, does your wife listen?

737
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:55,320
Does she like just catch stray things that I say and go, I bet he was a late bloomer.

738
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,680
Is it like in that way or is it more you're having a discussion about it?

739
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:02,200
Cause like that's how I picture it, where somebody walks by and listens to me talking

740
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:07,880
about something from my childhood and they go, I bet, I bet it was all happening a little

741
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,880
too late.

742
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,840
Or is she saying that the bloom still hasn't occurred?

743
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,840
That's a good question too.

744
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,880
I would just like more elaboration of what the, what your wife means, sir.

745
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,280
How late is this bloom?

746
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,920
How late is the bloom?

747
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,760
There's certainly parts of me that haven't bloomed.

748
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,760
I will agree with that.

749
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,080
I know you gave us your slightly below average teat count.

750
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,160
Some of it, some was, I don't know.

751
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,520
Well, you think maybe that, maybe that is what's happening is that I haven't fully

752
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,560
finished puberty.

753
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,040
It makes a lot of sense.

754
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,640
Oh no, he's going to get taller.

755
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,800
I'm going to get taller.

756
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,520
Whoa, yeah, you're waiting on your spurt.

757
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,320
Yeah.

758
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,040
It was like, I got a half spurt.

759
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:44,520
I'm supposed to be seven, eight, and I'm only six, three.

760
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,640
So in the next 10 years, I think I will finish puberty and I will finally, like my

761
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,240
final form will be apparent.

762
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,360
Wow.

763
00:32:53,720 --> 00:33:01,200
New, new dream guest for podcast, Baron Trump in five years, once your spurt has

764
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:08,280
occurred so that the two, the two tallest white men can be in one place and we'll

765
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,560
have to duck to get into the studio door.

766
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,040
Yeah.

767
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:16,480
But I'm going to take, you know, at my part, we're, we're listening to a lot of

768
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,440
Sabrina Carpenter, you know?

769
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,880
So I'm the hip one.

770
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,200
I'm the hip reference now.

771
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,720
We've got Espresso.

772
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,000
We're watching the music video with Barry Keough.

773
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,640
Also, don't forget that this episode's coming out way later in the summer.

774
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,120
And this is not, by this point is not very current.

775
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,200
No, that's fine.

776
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:40,560
I've been thinking how I'm like, cause I also, I like Espresso and I've been

777
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:45,000
thinking how it's going to come up on the show and I'm, I will be God damned if

778
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,400
that song comes up in the typical PTR way, which is like, you know what?

779
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,320
I like a song.

780
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,240
I like a song that is a new song.

781
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,160
I actually like Espresso.

782
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:53,920
There I said it.

783
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,000
I like Espresso.

784
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,080
Like I will, this will not be the tone.

785
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,680
Whose voice is that of Jason or I don't know.

786
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:06,480
I don't, I can't say what variety of blooming that voice could be ascribed to.

787
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,640
I do like that song.

788
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,640
I will say that.

789
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,560
We all like Espresso.

790
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,040
You said it very normally and I appreciate it.

791
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,520
I say things normally.

792
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,280
There is a new song.

793
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,160
There is a new song that has come out this summer and this is a song that I

794
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,640
like and I like a song.

795
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,400
Yeah.

796
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:24,560
I mean, I'm mostly listening to Lefty Frizzle, a song, an old, long dead country

797
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,680
music guy that my daughter seems to like with his hit song, Shine, Shave, Shower.

798
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,000
She really likes that one.

799
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,760
That's your normal morning routine.

800
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,280
It's like daddy, he shines his action figures.

801
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:42,480
He shaves his action figures and then he showers his action figures.

802
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,160
Yeah.

803
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:45,640
Yeah.

804
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:49,240
So anyway, Jason is hip right in the moment he's saying.

805
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:54,000
There will be nothing hipper in whatever month this comes out

806
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,000
than still Sabrina Carpenter.

807
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,400
Yeah.

808
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,840
I like current cool music too.

809
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,960
I just don't talk about it.

810
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,600
It's coming out.

811
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,040
I just don't talk about it on the show.

812
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:05,600
And you know what?

813
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,200
And I like, and I like current and cool and hip.

814
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:08,480
Yeah.

815
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,200
And I won't even say the different things, the different hip people I like.

816
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,360
I don't need to do it.

817
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,040
There's so many different hip people.

818
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,720
I'm so hip in so many different ways.

819
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,280
And there's so many different hip people that to start the list

820
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,240
and then we'd never be done with the list.

821
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,920
And when you get around, when we all get around to learning how to pronounce

822
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,840
Chapparoon correctly, we'll name one of her songs.

823
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,400
Would we ever do a music loop final four?

824
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,120
Maybe.

825
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,680
It's a complicated one to condense.

826
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,200
I think it is a really good idea.

827
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,440
Music loop final four, but like, how do you explain them quickly?

828
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,400
And it's so like, it's just tough to, you know, you can't like do it.

829
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,200
It's all a 10 second synopsis.

830
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:52,520
I mean, I guess you could like really break down, like what scale it's in

831
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,520
and why that's complicated in the arrangement.

832
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,960
I suppose you could really try from a music theory perspective.

833
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,200
But you think we're going to talk about what scale it's in.

834
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,760
We're going to do pretty scale analysis.

835
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,280
I'm not a Rick Piotto over here who knows all of his scales.

836
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,040
Look, none of us are Rick Piotto, OK?

837
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,000
He knows his scales.

838
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,200
He knows it on the guitar.

839
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,240
Very accomplished.

840
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:18,760
That is the fastest 60 seconds from I like current and cool and hip to Rick Piotto.

841
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,560
Rick listens to some of the young people's music and he doesn't like it.

842
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,360
He often doesn't like it.

843
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,600
He doesn't like the like simple

844
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,960
chord changes on a Taylor Swift song sometimes.

845
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,000
If you're a guy who knows a lot about record

846
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,120
engineering in the 70s and 80s, there's no way that you like a lot of current music.

847
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:40,360
Right. He goes through the top 10 sometimes and he goes, oh, come on.

848
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,080
As opposed to you would do.

849
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,760
Well, there'll be an episode one day where we'll go through the current top 10.

850
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,360
Mike will know at least six of them and he'll say, oh, come on.

851
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,600
That's right. Into my ears. Right.

852
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,760
I'll say it there like a come hither in my sound in my voice.

853
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,920
Here. Oh, are you?

854
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,400
Did you? Oh, go ahead.

855
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,720
Joe Glass says, design your dream popcorn pocket.

856
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,480
Novelty popcorn buckets.

857
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,040
We've talked about this a few times recently.

858
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,400
Privately.

859
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,600
Yeah. Privately.

860
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,960
Question one, we have. Question two, privately.

861
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,200
This came up with Griffin.

862
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,400
He was talking about novelty popcorn buckets a couple of days.

863
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,760
I'll say this.

864
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,560
I'm going to sound like a real square.

865
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,840
I want a napkin dispenser on the side.

866
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,280
My hands get too greasy eating popcorn.

867
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,440
Wait a minute.

868
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,520
So your dream popcorn bucket is just a very functional.

869
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,640
It's a regular bucket with its unthemed.

870
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:42,600
It just has how how many napkins can fit in this napkin dispenser?

871
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,120
I think you want at least 10, because inevitably,

872
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:48,800
if you're sharing it with someone, you always give them a couple, two or three.

873
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,880
If you have a lot of butter on this popcorn as well.

874
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,160
I do like the butter on the popcorn.

875
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,840
I'm not going to hide it.

876
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:00,680
OK, so is there any like is do you have like your trademark?

877
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,520
Like you've it's a thing you've created now.

878
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,560
Is there any sort of say like trademark Jason Sheridan?

879
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,800
Is there anything else on the on it other than?

880
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,360
Sure.

881
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:13,920
Um, this is in my mind, because on the other episode, you were talking about candy

882
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,480
and I was kind of shocked you were naming all these songs

883
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:21,120
and you did not mention the Archie's sugar sugar.

884
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,720
That is a shocking thing. I agree.

885
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,840
So I would like a functional popcorn bucket that plays with the napkin.

886
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,920
Well, I was going to say the Archie's with their instruments just around it.

887
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,400
Just pictures of the Archie's doing that music.

888
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,520
Well, sugar sugar.

889
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,520
You're getting sugar.

890
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,200
Is that a kettle corn in your popcorn?

891
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,840
Oh, that would be good, too.

892
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:42,720
Because like the napkin dispenser is first

893
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,400
and then the cartooned Archie's band is second.

894
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,560
So you just want the Archie's because you like them. Yeah.

895
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,480
You want like the cartoon band that sings a song about candy

896
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,320
to be on your popcorn bucket, which is otherwise occupied by a napkin dispenser.

897
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,760
Yeah. And probably I like kettle corn, but I like salty popcorn butter.

898
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,600
So there might actually not be any sugar involved.

899
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,520
I just want my friends.

900
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,280
I want my friends to be serving it to me.

901
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:14,120
So there's a crunchy, crunchy salty butter.

902
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,360
I love it so much.

903
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,760
They're serving it, but aren't they playing their instruments?

904
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:24,600
But in theory, if they're on the outside of the bucket, not in theory,

905
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,400
in theory, you're just watching them play.

906
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,040
I am just watching them play.

907
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:31,720
But a bucket of popcorn serves you the popcorn.

908
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,760
That's true. That's true.

909
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,960
A bucket does serve you.

910
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:40,360
Yeah. By containing it, it doesn't pick it up and give it to you.

911
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,120
You still have to use your hands. Yeah.

912
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,440
I mean, what we're getting like this question, I assume.

913
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,360
And look, I'm going to I don't want to be so filthy here.

914
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,720
But what this this question is getting at is this recent trend with popcorn

915
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,400
buckets where it looks like some sort of a flashlight.

916
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:58,080
It looks like something that you're going to have sex with.

917
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,560
This was, of course, the Dune popcorn

918
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,360
bucket that really resembled like a flashlight.

919
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:07,920
And now Deadpool has sent up this whole idea with his reveal

920
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,080
of the Wolverine popcorn bucket.

921
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:14,080
That's a very disgusting looking Wolverine head with a giant open mouth,

922
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:19,520
which is like you're going to Wolverine's going to blow you basically.

923
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,680
And then the studio tour

924
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:27,640
glamour tram one, you can just destroy your genital sweat.

925
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,480
And you finally be free.

926
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,040
No, you just run over it and then you're free from this curse.

927
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,600
The tram will destroy your genitals.

928
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,640
Yeah, that's what you're talking about.

929
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,520
So you're in Woody Woodpecker is driving it is.

930
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,360
Is that true?

931
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:46,320
Woody Woodpecker is driving the glamour tram popcorn bucket.

932
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,400
Yeah. OK.

933
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,840
And you can meet Woody and Winnie now. Now?

934
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,960
Yeah. At the tram loading.

935
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,400
I feel like, oh, they're there.

936
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,920
They're back. They've been around in the park.

937
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,960
They've been around, but I think they went away and now they're back.

938
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,240
OK, interesting.

939
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:05,880
Now, you can't have sex with the the napkin dispenser on your popcorn bucket.

940
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:11,160
Um, no, but with enough creativity, you can fuck anything.

941
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,960
And like if you need to clean up,

942
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,840
you I guess you could keep the bucket on your nightstand

943
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,760
and then you have some napkins.

944
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,720
That was too far.

945
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:23,200
You know, we started talking about dirty stuff, but that was too much for me.

946
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,320
Sanitation, thoughtfulness.

947
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,080
That's too much for you.

948
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,240
It's too realistic, honestly.

949
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,640
I guess, yeah, well, now you think about it.

950
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,920
Yeah, you're talking about the opposite of dirty.

951
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,200
We're talking about cleaning up.

952
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,680
So I don't want to have a dirty popcorn bucket.

953
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:40,360
I want mine to just be a fun little thing to eat popcorn out of.

954
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,680
Yeah, that's what I was talking about.

955
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,240
One that had a napkin dispenser and the art cheese on it.

956
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,640
I was just making sure you were getting at something that was wholesome.

957
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,240
And it sounds like yours was wholesome.

958
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,880
OK, so yours would not.

959
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:54,480
Your ideal popcorn bucket would not recreate any part of Minnie's body.

960
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,400
No, that's what I knew we were going there.

961
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,600
But that is not what it would be.

962
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,200
And you can't have me.

963
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,400
I was not going to pick Minnie at all on here because there's no way that any part

964
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,840
wouldn't be misconstrued as me doing something perverted.

965
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,800
It can't be like Minnie giving like a thumbs up or something.

966
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,440
And there's popcorn in her hand.

967
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,000
That doesn't work.

968
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,720
I'm not doing that.

969
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:18,000
It can't be like Minnie's shoe, because people will be like,

970
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,200
you have a weird shoe fetish.

971
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,480
Like you take the beat, the popcorn out of Minnie's shoe.

972
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,440
And then God knows what some pervert is doing with that shoe.

973
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,040
And that's not what I'm going to pick.

974
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,760
Some hypothetical pervert, right?

975
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:32,160
I've never met who's not in the room and not Winnie, right?

976
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,920
What Winnie the Pooh?

977
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,680
No, Winnie, Woody Woodpecker's partner.

978
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,760
This is we have a real issue with familiarity on this show.

979
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,680
John's theme is just said.

980
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,440
And we're meant to assume what that is.

981
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,520
That was Winnie with no.

982
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,440
That was just wrong.

983
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,360
I just said, Winnie, and I know you just talked about.

984
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,720
But the first time you said it, Winnie and Winnie.

985
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,920
And like, I kind of know it's Winnie Woodpecker.

986
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,920
But it's Winnie's girlfriend.

987
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,320
She's got a little pink dress on.

988
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,920
I'm just saying this is not an iconic character.

989
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,360
I'm sorry, Winnie Woodpecker, but you are not an icon.

990
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:09,200
And I, of course, even we just talked about Winnie Woodpecker.

991
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,120
And Mike, you still went to Winnie the Pooh.

992
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:15,000
I know. Well, so that's where I'm like, I think you got a full name at Jase.

993
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,200
As much as I know, you'd like to be on a first name basis and are

994
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,880
on a first name basis with Winnie Woodpecker.

995
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,520
I think it needs a little bit of context.

996
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,480
All right. Fair enough.

997
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:26,600
I can't have a character because that's where this question goes.

998
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,560
It can't be a character's face.

999
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,880
It can't be figment.

1000
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,240
It can't be anyone because people automatically now associate popcorn

1001
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,760
bucket with like like a sex toy.

1002
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,640
So it's got to be something I didn't, by the way.

1003
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,240
Really? No, it's popcorn buckets that are just like, you know,

1004
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,320
but recent trends in popcorn buckets is sexual.

1005
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,400
The recent trends suggest.

1006
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:51,080
And again, Deadpool took it up a notch.

1007
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,560
Deadpool made it so outrageous.

1008
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,880
Well, that's what he does.

1009
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,840
He takes things up.

1010
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:59,600
And yes, so I'm just I'm going to have to just do some.

1011
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:04,280
I'm going to have to think of something that is like an inanimate object.

1012
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,200
That's just kind of a fun thing

1013
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,040
based on like something I like.

1014
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,960
So let's say what do I like doing?

1015
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,280
I like playing video games.

1016
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,200
I like playing tennis.

1017
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,040
Oh, I like playing tennis.

1018
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,840
OK, so here we go.

1019
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:26,480
OK, there is like, you know, sometimes when you get a bucket of balls,

1020
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,800
it's or it's like a basket. Here we go.

1021
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,520
You see that already.

1022
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,040
You already said the phrase bucket of balls.

1023
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,320
It's a basket or a bucket of balls.

1024
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:36,120
And it looks like but it's popcorn instead.

1025
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,720
And then how would you know it's a bucket of balls

1026
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,840
if it's a bucket with other things in it?

1027
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:45,080
Because it looks like that kind of like wire like basket

1028
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,960
that you do put a bunch of balls in.

1029
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,560
Although I guess that wire basket.

1030
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,640
Yeah, that popcorn's falling right out.

1031
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,920
Yeah, it can't be a tube.

1032
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,680
It can't be the normal like tennis balls.

1033
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:57,880
There's three balls in like a can of tennis balls

1034
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,160
because that looks like a flashlight.

1035
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,960
It does a tube of who's the filthy minded one now?

1036
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,240
A tube of you can't even go by a tube of tennis balls

1037
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,600
because you're you're thinking about like, I mean,

1038
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,000
people are going to think I'm a pervert.

1039
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,440
When you're when I'm checking out from Big Five,

1040
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,480
they're going to think like you do.

1041
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,680
You do go by tennis tubes from Big Five.

1042
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,480
But as you're checking out, you say, oh, and by the way,

1043
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,720
I'm not buying this to put my dick in it.

1044
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,560
I'm not having sex with this.

1045
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,840
I do try to add that under my breath.

1046
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,160
That's why I try to check out too wide.

1047
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,400
You still need like maybe not for you, Mike.

1048
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,480
But I know some customization will be involved.

1049
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:41,440
The width of how do you you need some something

1050
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,600
to provide more friction?

1051
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,920
You can't just put your penis into a tennis.

1052
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:47,200
Well, you need some sort of sleeve.

1053
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,920
Yeah, some some other component has to be in there to like

1054
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:54,160
a sleeve of crackers.

1055
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,840
Well, no, that'll cut you right up the like saltine sleeves.

1056
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,880
Like that. No, that's too OK.

1057
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,120
Well, again, I've not done this.

1058
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,560
I'm just trying to think of something,

1059
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,640
a popcorn bucket that's not sexual.

1060
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,000
That's what I'm trying to do here.

1061
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,440
I'm trying to be clean here.

1062
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:11,120
I'm trying to not be a pervert.

1063
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:15,320
So everyone else is the one ascribing perverse things to it.

1064
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,240
I'm the one who's doing good.

1065
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,280
I'm the one who's making this wholesome.

1066
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,480
Yes, an attempt, an attempt at wholesomeness.

1067
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:27,920
And that's why you're avoiding sexy, sexy objects like balls in a tennis tube.

1068
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,240
And you you delete it.

1069
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:35,440
I'm still here, Jim's theme, which again, I I did have to look up.

1070
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,560
I thought I was going crazy, but it is

1071
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:43,760
John Resnick's solo song from Treasure Planet.

1072
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:48,880
And I just was like, what am I forgetting?

1073
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,280
What is Jim's thing?

1074
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,320
Oh, you don't even remember that.

1075
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,000
I remember that, Jason.

1076
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,760
No one should feel crazy for not properly remembering.

1077
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,840
I'm still here. Jim's theme.

1078
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:01,000
This is not something that is famous.

1079
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,360
This is not something that is well regarded.

1080
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,920
Well-remembered the other day.

1081
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:10,280
So I just wanted confirmation that I had the name right.

1082
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:14,040
I'm just saying of all the things to feel crazy about, like, boy, I don't know.

1083
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,280
I'm losing my mind.

1084
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:20,480
I couldn't even remember the full name of the song from Treasure Planet

1085
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,960
or whether it was the full Goo Goo Dolls lineup or only John Resnick.

1086
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,320
Or Johnny Resnick.

1087
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,720
I can't even remember if we say John or Johnny.

1088
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,680
I mean, I feel like it was Johnny when he's younger.

1089
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,960
And maybe he says John more now.

1090
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,240
And he's like, you know what?

1091
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:36,600
I'm not a Goo Goo Doll anymore.

1092
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,680
I'm a Goo Goo Man.

1093
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:41,080
Well, well, Billy Corgan was going by William Patrick Corgan

1094
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,120
for a little like media cycle.

1095
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,120
So people change.

1096
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:46,200
People have preferences that change as far as their name.

1097
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,480
How about there's a big garbage bank full of popcorn or a pillowcase?

1098
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:51,960
That's kind of fun.

1099
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,400
That's like a DIY thing.

1100
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,360
And you get a lot of it.

1101
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:56,240
And you could suffocate yourself with it.

1102
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,360
Oh, shit. Yeah.

1103
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,400
You can get off on that.

1104
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,120
Yeah, you could suffocate yourself.

1105
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:04,480
The fact is, any popcorn bucket out there can be used for sexual purposes.

1106
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,560
Oh, man.

1107
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,400
All right. Well, I don't like all of it.

1108
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,720
Let's edit this all out, then.

1109
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,880
Let's keep it in the sexual neck of the woods.

1110
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:12,640
Although not really.

1111
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,360
This is more of just a way to debate.

1112
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:20,760
Seth Finkelstein, Mary Fuck Kill, boat ride, omni-mover, trackless, dark ride.

1113
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Interesting.

1114
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:27,200
Omni-mover, boat ride, trackless, trackless.

1115
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,240
So like Wi-Fi control, Mickey Minis,

1116
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:32,880
Runway Railway, Poops, Honey Hut, Riser's Resistance.

1117
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:33,640
Yep.

1118
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,360
Uh, who, who, who?

1119
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,720
All right. I got it.

1120
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,840
Kill, trackless, dark ride.

1121
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:44,800
Wow. Fuck, omni-mover, Mary, boat ride.

1122
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,160
I think I might agree with you.

1123
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:50,720
I think you want to settle down with just a with a solid one.

1124
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:56,040
Yeah. Omni-movers with their high backs provide the most private experience.

1125
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,080
Oh, I don't care about that.

1126
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:00,760
And trackless, dark rides, ultimately, you know, they're the eye.

1127
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:07,080
What if they're like a flash in the pan due to their ability to break down?

1128
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,000
Yeah. That's the one you got to let go.

1129
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,240
It's all it's it's at the end of the day, it's not a theme park staple.

1130
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,240
Breakdown a lot.

1131
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:15,640
They're hitting like ubiquitous.

1132
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,160
It's kind of the go to.

1133
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,680
Yeah. Do you agree with this assessment in order, Mike?

1134
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,960
I'll switch the F and the Mary.

1135
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:26,120
Mm hmm. It's really good that you clean that up now.

1136
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:30,760
After 15 minutes of discussion of how sexual tennis.

1137
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,280
I was saying it in the anti way.

1138
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,560
That's why it was more of a clinical discussion versus me being vulgar.

1139
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:41,560
That's what I so I wanted to go back to the wholesomeness of F Mary.

1140
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:46,920
So, yes, I would ask the boat ride Mary, the omni-mover.

1141
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,880
OK. And kill the track list.

1142
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,360
And still, wow. But we fully.

1143
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,800
And all I would K.

1144
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,840
And we K. The trackless dark.

1145
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:56,040
That's aggressive, too. Mm hmm.

1146
00:49:56,040 --> 00:50:00,280
Yeah. Maybe this is a fun outro.

1147
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,400
Austin Beltran, this is primarily a Jason question.

1148
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:07,200
What would be your dream blunt rotation of theme park animatronics?

1149
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,760
Oh, good question.

1150
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,920
Leave us out of it. We're hip.

1151
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:16,320
Sorry, we're not hip enough to be in the to to to S a B.

1152
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:20,760
I tried. I tried to meet a weed mint in the last six months.

1153
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,720
And it took a long time to start.

1154
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,600
And then it didn't start till I was going to bed.

1155
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,640
You know, I thought I will take a mint.

1156
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,640
I will take a minute. I'll listen to Sabrina Carpenter.

1157
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,360
I will listen to a current song for this song.

1158
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,680
I'll listen to it. I'll eat a current.

1159
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:39,320
I don't remember the new one, the name of the new one, but I like it a lot.

1160
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:41,880
Don't prove them right.

1161
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,640
Don't embarrass me, motherfucker.

1162
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,240
You know, I like it.

1163
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,800
Uh, well, OK.

1164
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:54,800
I'm going to include defunct animatronics.

1165
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:59,720
And I am thinking about people who probably partially

1166
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:04,840
like Timekeeper would be cool because I just think he's cool.

1167
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,640
He knows about a lot of stuff, too.

1168
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:11,160
Yeah. But I think the alien from Alien Encounter

1169
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:15,680
and the bird from America Sings probably need to chill it out.

1170
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,120
The bird, what's the bird?

1171
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:21,040
The burlives, the bird, the eagle.

1172
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:22,320
Yeah. With the hat.

1173
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:25,760
Wait, so you're you're you're saying blunt rotation in this instance

1174
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:29,960
is something you're deciding because you think those characters need to smoke?

1175
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,440
No. Well, I'm going to split it.

1176
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,200
I'm trying to think of who the last one would be.

1177
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:37,240
Forgive me. Isn't blunt rotation like, oh, like you're hanging out

1178
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:39,520
and you get really like deep into conversation.

1179
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,160
Yeah, I think they're cool guys.

1180
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:45,120
I just think those two are a little high strung and they could stand to relax.

1181
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:47,760
But Timekeeper, the alien is a killer.

1182
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,680
Well, it's just his nature.

1183
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:53,360
You know, I'm just saying the alien will maybe kill you.

1184
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,800
Well, not if he chills out first.

1185
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,040
How can you get that blunt in the mouth before the alien tries to eat your head?

1186
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,760
Oh, good question.

1187
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:03,880
I mean, that might be where the Timekeeper can also come into play

1188
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:07,760
because he's just a robot and we can repair the Timekeeper

1189
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:13,360
and take you to when the alien was at a baby and you can smoke him out.

1190
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:18,680
Smoking out a baby alien or even just going to the alien's own planet,

1191
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:21,720
like he's probably more chill when he's not being kept in a

1192
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,920
dark room with a very lit cage.

1193
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,480
You know, that's true.

1194
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,440
Where that was a four, right?

1195
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,640
I saw one more. There was no number said.

1196
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:34,080
Oh, yeah. Oh, OK. Yeah.

1197
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,200
Or as few. All the presidents, every president.

1198
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,240
And then I guess of the last, of course, would have to be

1199
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,680
Botanicus. Great.

1200
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:48,160
Yeah. So I think there's my four right there from the Carousel of Progress.

1201
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:51,600
I mean, I just worried he'd be a little too stodgy.

1202
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,960
Well, Uncle Werville could probably party.

1203
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:56,960
Yeah. But you might not want that. I don't know.

1204
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,040
He might go a little too, too nuts on it.

1205
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,440
He might go a little too up.

1206
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,400
You've described something that seems stressful to me.

1207
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:07,280
These alien and I mean, Botanicus is obviously the dream.

1208
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,760
I think he's number one for all of us.

1209
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,920
Yeah. I don't want to speak for Scott, but I think I'm right here.

1210
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:14,280
But unless he's like trying to send you on missions all the time,

1211
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:15,680
you might be the only thing.

1212
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,400
Well, he's wait.

1213
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,520
Don't just sit around.

1214
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:23,120
You know, everyone has their thing.

1215
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:26,480
The Eagles just going to be trying to bring it back to America.

1216
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,200
And it's like, hey, chill out, man.

1217
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,080
We're just trying to relax here.

1218
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,920
He's going to sing some of your favorite songs.

1219
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:37,800
Yeah, he's going to say all my songs about the sticking hoots.

1220
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:39,600
Goodbye to Tutsi.

1221
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,040
Goodbye, boy.

1222
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:44,160
Pop Goes the Weasel hits really hard when you're high.

1223
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,000
Oh, yeah.

1224
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,520
It's really here. All the subtleties of it. Sure.

1225
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,360
Rick Beato breaks down. Pop Goes the Weasel.

1226
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,520
Rick Beato can't tell.

1227
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:56,880
Ten reasons why the chord progression in camp town races

1228
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:00,240
blow your mind.

1229
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,960
Yeah, I guess the question wasn't for us.

1230
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:05,600
But yeah, I really Botanicus has to go in there.

1231
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,880
Maybe we can submit you can mix in.

1232
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:10,640
You could shave off some parts of his big leaf cape.

1233
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,360
Yeah, yeah, sure.

1234
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:15,640
Get that in the rocket raccoon certainly going in there.

1235
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:19,000
If there's a guy I want to hang with, he's a party dude.

1236
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,840
Yeah, I don't think I want that.

1237
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,440
He's going to steal from me.

1238
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,600
He might look around my wallets gone.

1239
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:29,040
Yeah, he's he's a little bit of a rascal, but he would be funny.

1240
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,160
You'd be entertaining.

1241
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:34,960
Yeah, he's one of the most gregarious animatronics, I think, in any Disney park.

1242
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,360
Yeah, yeah.

1243
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:39,360
Hondo Inaka, I was thinking, but I don't know that I need him.

1244
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:40,840
I don't know.

1245
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:43,560
He's not so fun.

1246
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:47,840
But I think I know I was going to say Hondo, but no, I'm not saying Hondo, not Hondo.

1247
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:52,640
Maybe he would smoke in an interesting way, though, because of his weird like face.

1248
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,040
Yeah, he would have a contraption.

1249
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:58,400
He would have like a crazy water pipe or like a box.

1250
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,960
Yeah, like a vape box sort of thing.

1251
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,320
That's very complicated.

1252
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:05,280
Didn't Jason say C-3PO, who could use to chill out?

1253
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:11,640
He could really look, you know, is it got to keep it like a small gathering?

1254
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:12,240
Yeah, sure.

1255
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:16,520
It's nice of you to think who might need it, who might need the mellow out.

1256
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,000
That's good. That feels like selfless.

1257
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,560
That it's not just you. It's not about you.

1258
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:23,080
It's about helping people with the power of weed.

1259
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:29,240
I mean, yeah, if I could also surround myself where I'm like, not the most neurotic,

1260
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:32,480
like if I get some other guys in there.

1261
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,720
You've also chosen characters.

1262
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:36,960
I think you'd be a little less like nervous about you might be like nervous

1263
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,360
about meeting the timekeeper if he's a hero of yours.

1264
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:43,280
Oh, yeah. But I think he's probably pretty humble and chill.

1265
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,760
Yeah, yeah. Oh, really?

1266
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,760
Oh, you're a fan of me, really? Oh, geez.

1267
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,920
I forget that I anybody even I'm in such a bubble here.

1268
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:54,200
You know, just me and Nineye, you know, I forget people even know of my work.

1269
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,160
I forgot about Nineye.

1270
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,800
Yeah, I guess we had to invite Nineye.

1271
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,360
Jason, what about any of the robots on the great movie ride?

1272
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:04,320
You don't want to smoke with any of your classic favorites?

1273
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:08,360
It is James Cagney from White Heat.

1274
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,000
That's right. I'm saying like you could really.

1275
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,840
He would be the most I think him and the showgirls from

1276
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:18,360
Footlight Parade, all the pre-code actors.

1277
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:19,640
Would be cool.

1278
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:21,840
Let me erase your answer and let me answer for you.

1279
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:25,840
Oh, OK. Dream Blunt Rotation is all the different dancers from Footlight Parade.

1280
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,600
I sure the dancers sharing a blunt.

1281
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:34,360
Oh, and then Jason rising up in the center on a on a big

1282
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,440
wheel wave of blunt smoke.

1283
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:40,120
Is there a Robert Mitchum animatronic?

1284
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:43,400
Because we already know he likes it. Yeah, I don't know.

1285
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,120
But we do. We know he was arrested for weed.

1286
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:48,320
It almost jeopardized his whole career.

1287
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,920
Again, Jason, the familiarity you assume.

1288
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:55,480
We all know. We all know about Robert Mitchum's

1289
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,840
weed arrest. Night of the Hunter.

1290
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:00,160
You know, we don't know what that is.

1291
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,440
Oh, that's great. It's a classic.

1292
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:05,720
Jim's theme, Mitchum's weed arrest.

1293
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,880
This is sort of normal stuff.

1294
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,560
A normal American should know this is stuff they should teach in elementary school.

1295
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,280
Yeah, a brick of our. Yeah.

1296
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:16,440
Mitchum played Phil Marlowe twice.

1297
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:19,440
Bogey only played him once.

1298
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:20,960
We're going to go back with our time machine.

1299
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,160
We can go anywhere in time.

1300
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:25,080
All the most important events like when Jim's theme

1301
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:28,200
from Treasure Planet was written or when Robert,

1302
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:31,720
I can stop Robert Mitchum from being arrested for marijuana.

1303
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:35,760
We squeeze a couple more movies out of them that way.

1304
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:40,920
Yeah, so I my my I'm I'm being selfish

1305
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:43,040
and I'm just trying to pick chill out people.

1306
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:47,280
Jason is going to smoke out of an alien, a murderous alien

1307
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:48,800
and a chilled out alien.

1308
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:53,200
Oh, yeah, the blunt goes in the tiny mouth because then it's easier.

1309
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,240
The blunt goes in the tiny mouth.

1310
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:59,680
Yeah. Oh, if you could have the alien encounter alien and the xenomorph.

1311
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,400
The xenomorph. Oh, maybe they would find love.

1312
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:03,840
What about two blunts?

1313
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:06,200
Xenomorph, tiny mouth has a little blunt

1314
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,480
and then the big mouth has a regular size.

1315
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:09,800
Has a big. Oh, OK.

1316
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:13,720
Has anyone made a like a pier, like a beach front pier

1317
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,280
bootleg shirt of that? Oh, that's cool.

1318
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:18,600
Yeah. Yeah, I guess one has to be out to the side.

1319
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:22,160
Yeah. What the big mouth that's coming out of the side and then the little one

1320
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,960
comes out and then, oh, that's a good idea. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1321
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,800
Ooh. Oh, well, maybe that's a that's a shirt.

1322
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:31,840
And then it says like class of twenty, twenty four at the bottom

1323
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:33,920
because they are there for senior week.

1324
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:39,760
Yeah. So so I think that's that's a good that's for certainly a good shirt.

1325
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:43,680
I'm trying to think of a good like botanical is such a perfect,

1326
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,440
you know, weed version of botanicals.

1327
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:46,680
I don't know what a xenomorph.

1328
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:48,640
We don't morph. We don't morph.

1329
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,080
Yeah, that's good. All right. Done.

1330
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:51,680
That works for now. We don't morph.

1331
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,640
All right. Yeah. Well, I think we're done with this, too.

1332
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,640
I think you survived podcast the ride.
