1
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,360
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,432 --> 00:00:23,712
Podcast the Ride, the second gate.

3
00:00:23,912 --> 00:00:27,232
I'm Jason Sheridan, joined today as always by Scott Gardner.

4
00:00:27,252 --> 00:00:28,132
That's me.

5
00:00:28,552 --> 00:00:29,412
And my Carlson.

6
00:00:29,592 --> 00:00:30,392
Hello, I'm here.

7
00:00:30,412 --> 00:00:33,252
As long as they have joined, we all do it,

8
00:00:33,352 --> 00:00:37,092
and we usually say today, join today by.

9
00:00:37,252 --> 00:00:38,632
Oh yeah, like as if.

10
00:00:38,852 --> 00:00:43,712
They would never not be the case, though you never know.

11
00:00:44,332 --> 00:00:47,492
So if some illness falls one of us.

12
00:00:47,632 --> 00:00:47,732
Sure.

13
00:00:47,992 --> 00:00:51,072
We all try to be there for all of them

14
00:00:51,072 --> 00:00:51,912
as much as we can.

15
00:00:52,032 --> 00:00:53,192
Edwin's here as well.

16
00:00:53,712 --> 00:00:54,492
The show dog.

17
00:00:54,652 --> 00:00:55,992
He's got his collar on, which is a mistake.

18
00:00:56,012 --> 00:00:56,772
I should take it off.

19
00:00:57,212 --> 00:01:00,192
One good Patreon piece of content

20
00:01:00,192 --> 00:01:01,892
would be an all Edwin episode.

21
00:01:01,912 --> 00:01:03,752
Let Edwin talk for a while.

22
00:01:03,752 --> 00:01:07,052
And then we just posted silent audio file

23
00:01:07,052 --> 00:01:08,252
and that gets us out of it.

24
00:01:08,252 --> 00:01:08,572
That's funny.

25
00:01:08,572 --> 00:01:09,452
It's got free.

26
00:01:10,312 --> 00:01:11,032
That's good stuff.

27
00:01:11,192 --> 00:01:12,592
So there's that's coming out.

28
00:01:12,632 --> 00:01:13,712
All right, the Edwin episode coming down.

29
00:01:13,872 --> 00:01:14,512
Edwin episode, yeah.

30
00:01:14,512 --> 00:01:17,752
But today the podcast, the Ride post office is open.

31
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:18,392
Is open.

32
00:01:18,732 --> 00:01:20,072
Welcome everyone.

33
00:01:20,072 --> 00:01:21,432
Welcome to the post office.

34
00:01:21,452 --> 00:01:22,252
Ding a ling.

35
00:01:22,452 --> 00:01:23,252
Very exciting.

36
00:01:24,052 --> 00:01:26,992
Oh, it looks like we have some letters today.

37
00:01:27,332 --> 00:01:28,792
Jason, would you like to.

38
00:01:29,012 --> 00:01:29,452
Sure.

39
00:01:29,812 --> 00:01:31,232
All right.

40
00:01:31,252 --> 00:01:33,032
I've got a few letters picked out.

41
00:01:33,152 --> 00:01:35,692
Scott and Mike don't know what ones I have.

42
00:01:35,832 --> 00:01:37,432
So let's just get into it though.

43
00:01:39,752 --> 00:01:41,472
This one I think this is good,

44
00:01:41,492 --> 00:01:43,952
but I think it's a nice one to start off with.

45
00:01:44,072 --> 00:01:45,072
Sean Jennings writes,

46
00:01:45,452 --> 00:01:48,092
are there any good books about theme park history

47
00:01:48,092 --> 00:01:49,072
you'd recommend?

48
00:01:49,972 --> 00:01:51,552
Especially around non Disney parks,

49
00:01:51,692 --> 00:01:53,152
which are a bit harder to find.

50
00:01:53,812 --> 00:01:56,192
So I think let's start.

51
00:01:56,612 --> 00:01:58,672
Well, let's start with Disney ones

52
00:01:58,672 --> 00:02:00,092
cause there's a lot of them.

53
00:02:00,092 --> 00:02:02,352
Disney has a publishing arm.

54
00:02:02,732 --> 00:02:03,752
And ads for a long time.

55
00:02:03,872 --> 00:02:06,452
Yeah, but my fear is that I'm gonna like start saying them

56
00:02:06,452 --> 00:02:07,652
and then not know the exact names.

57
00:02:07,692 --> 00:02:09,452
I might have my phone out while we do this.

58
00:02:09,752 --> 00:02:12,332
I remember a really good one

59
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,392
that is out of date at this point,

60
00:02:14,392 --> 00:02:15,752
but there was one at the library

61
00:02:15,752 --> 00:02:17,332
that was like the best one available to me

62
00:02:17,332 --> 00:02:18,572
when I was a kid called,

63
00:02:18,832 --> 00:02:21,252
I believe called Disneyland Inside Story

64
00:02:21,252 --> 00:02:22,912
that I liked a lot.

65
00:02:23,072 --> 00:02:24,812
And even if it's an out of date book,

66
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:27,252
there's always nice pictures and such.

67
00:02:27,432 --> 00:02:30,712
Yes, Disneyland Inside Story by Randy Bright.

68
00:02:30,952 --> 00:02:33,332
And I remember another one,

69
00:02:33,332 --> 00:02:36,212
I believe called Disney World the first 25 years.

70
00:02:36,332 --> 00:02:38,072
Does anyone recall that book?

71
00:02:38,272 --> 00:02:39,112
I have not read it.

72
00:02:39,112 --> 00:02:40,052
I recall it though.

73
00:02:40,052 --> 00:02:42,792
Yeah, I think we probably had it floating around.

74
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:45,032
I'll say I did write some down

75
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:46,712
knowing that I was picking this question.

76
00:02:46,992 --> 00:02:47,472
Secret.

77
00:02:47,712 --> 00:02:48,352
Thank God.

78
00:02:48,512 --> 00:02:49,892
There's one Scott and I,

79
00:02:49,952 --> 00:02:51,792
we both have at least one of these.

80
00:02:51,792 --> 00:02:52,792
Oh yeah, that's great.

81
00:02:52,792 --> 00:02:53,992
There's these coffee table books

82
00:02:53,992 --> 00:02:55,672
just called Disney Imagineering.

83
00:02:56,032 --> 00:02:56,892
There's two volumes.

84
00:02:57,212 --> 00:02:58,892
One was made in 1996.

85
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,012
One was made in 2010.

86
00:03:01,772 --> 00:03:03,972
So you get one has a Michael Iser intro.

87
00:03:04,072 --> 00:03:05,832
One has a Bob Iger intro,

88
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:07,892
which is funny to look at

89
00:03:07,892 --> 00:03:11,512
and funny to see what they're hyping in both.

90
00:03:11,732 --> 00:03:13,452
There's some great stuff in that first one.

91
00:03:13,472 --> 00:03:16,512
There's a full body sunny eclipse drawing.

92
00:03:16,512 --> 00:03:18,352
Oh yeah, you get concept art.

93
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:21,552
And you get, we were just texting this around

94
00:03:21,552 --> 00:03:23,912
because there's concept art for Captain EO

95
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,832
of Fuzzball and one of the other characters, maybe Hooter.

96
00:03:27,112 --> 00:03:29,792
And the concept art was done by Joe Roady.

97
00:03:30,952 --> 00:03:35,552
Now, maybe the most prominent current Imagineer

98
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:38,732
behind Avatar and Guardians and Animal Kingdom.

99
00:03:39,872 --> 00:03:43,012
Yeah, and there is also concept art in it too

100
00:03:43,012 --> 00:03:45,792
for the never completed the Downtown Burbank.

101
00:03:46,712 --> 00:03:48,972
Project where Disney was gonna build.

102
00:03:49,392 --> 00:03:51,552
So we gotta do, oh my God.

103
00:03:51,992 --> 00:03:52,552
That looks crazy.

104
00:03:52,892 --> 00:03:56,052
I don't, look, this might not be as interesting to people

105
00:03:56,052 --> 00:03:57,972
who don't live around here,

106
00:03:57,972 --> 00:04:00,152
but the fact that the Burbank Mall,

107
00:04:00,432 --> 00:04:02,332
really close to where we record,

108
00:04:02,732 --> 00:04:05,712
though could have been, it's now a mall in an Ikea,

109
00:04:05,732 --> 00:04:06,712
but the Ikea moved,

110
00:04:07,032 --> 00:04:08,472
but that this zone was almost essentially

111
00:04:08,472 --> 00:04:10,632
a mini Disney MGM studios

112
00:04:10,632 --> 00:04:13,192
with like Pleasure Island components.

113
00:04:13,932 --> 00:04:14,672
What is that insane?

114
00:04:14,672 --> 00:04:16,412
And now it's like a Fuddruckers.

115
00:04:16,712 --> 00:04:18,772
Yeah, which is good, don't get us wrong.

116
00:04:18,952 --> 00:04:19,912
Fuddruckers is good,

117
00:04:19,912 --> 00:04:22,372
but not quite as good as having a mini theme park.

118
00:04:22,452 --> 00:04:24,332
And also we would not be recording here.

119
00:04:24,832 --> 00:04:29,092
The value would be skyrocket in the area or the opposite.

120
00:04:29,692 --> 00:04:32,612
Yeah, because there's so many apartment buildings

121
00:04:32,612 --> 00:04:33,992
and single family homes.

122
00:04:34,252 --> 00:04:37,232
Burbank High School would have been next door.

123
00:04:38,032 --> 00:04:39,752
Like Burbank High School was just there.

124
00:04:39,772 --> 00:04:41,292
Maybe that was not gonna be sustainable.

125
00:04:41,472 --> 00:04:43,152
Maybe it would just be like wastelands

126
00:04:43,152 --> 00:04:44,332
of a park at this point.

127
00:04:44,672 --> 00:04:46,512
It might've been taken over by gangs,

128
00:04:46,792 --> 00:04:47,272
but at this point, yeah.

129
00:04:47,272 --> 00:04:48,212
High school gangs.

130
00:04:48,392 --> 00:04:49,192
Stay out of there.

131
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:53,652
But by gangs, I mean just like guys on hoverboards

132
00:04:53,652 --> 00:04:55,572
who I see as a gang,

133
00:04:55,592 --> 00:04:56,972
because I'm afraid of teenagers.

134
00:04:59,292 --> 00:05:00,492
The newest thing I was reading

135
00:05:00,492 --> 00:05:01,912
was that Haunted Mansion Imagineering,

136
00:05:01,992 --> 00:05:04,812
a Disney classic book, which is like a paperback,

137
00:05:05,392 --> 00:05:06,592
that they're like, they sell the parks,

138
00:05:06,672 --> 00:05:08,512
but you can get it on any Amazon and everything.

139
00:05:08,572 --> 00:05:09,492
It's pretty awesome.

140
00:05:09,692 --> 00:05:11,792
It's very in-depth, but it's just about one ride.

141
00:05:12,152 --> 00:05:13,252
There's a couple of those books

142
00:05:13,252 --> 00:05:14,792
that are just about all ride,

143
00:05:15,052 --> 00:05:16,632
but this question is about other parts.

144
00:05:16,732 --> 00:05:17,552
I mean, I don't even have.

145
00:05:17,792 --> 00:05:18,032
Oh no, no.

146
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:19,632
I think Disney ones are good.

147
00:05:19,932 --> 00:05:21,092
Marty Sklar's book is good.

148
00:05:21,092 --> 00:05:22,792
I've read a little bit of Marty Sklar's book.

149
00:05:22,792 --> 00:05:23,652
Oh yeah, absolutely.

150
00:05:23,992 --> 00:05:27,232
Included, which I think is called Dream It, Do It,

151
00:05:27,812 --> 00:05:30,152
and includes an insane chapter

152
00:05:30,152 --> 00:05:33,832
where he was doing a lot of PR.

153
00:05:34,012 --> 00:05:35,472
He was doing a lot of,

154
00:05:35,472 --> 00:05:38,092
he was writing scripts for the TV show

155
00:05:38,092 --> 00:05:40,752
and he was doing a lot of communications work

156
00:05:41,612 --> 00:05:44,972
that someone will read this or this is a press release,

157
00:05:45,192 --> 00:05:48,352
including him getting called into

158
00:05:48,352 --> 00:05:51,432
whatever higher-ups office was,

159
00:05:51,672 --> 00:05:55,392
like the day after Walt died and them saying essentially,

160
00:05:55,672 --> 00:05:58,952
Walt's dead, we need you to write our public statements.

161
00:05:59,212 --> 00:06:00,832
Oh my God, whoa.

162
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,332
What a tease for a book.

163
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:03,872
Yeah. That's great.

164
00:06:06,012 --> 00:06:08,692
Unofficial book, not Disney sanctioned,

165
00:06:08,692 --> 00:06:12,372
it's called Mouse Tales by David Koenig.

166
00:06:12,452 --> 00:06:13,632
Is that how you say it?

167
00:06:13,772 --> 00:06:14,772
Koenig, yeah.

168
00:06:14,772 --> 00:06:17,252
Yeah, that's a great, like, you know,

169
00:06:17,292 --> 00:06:21,572
that tells the weird stories about the deaths

170
00:06:21,572 --> 00:06:23,912
and people sneaking in and all the stuff

171
00:06:23,912 --> 00:06:25,572
they don't want you to know.

172
00:06:26,692 --> 00:06:28,972
But yeah, that's a very good one.

173
00:06:29,632 --> 00:06:31,512
I don't have this book,

174
00:06:31,512 --> 00:06:33,472
but I like their blog and their Twitter account.

175
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:35,732
The book is called Progress City Primer.

176
00:06:35,732 --> 00:06:38,312
I think the Twitter account is just called Progress City,

177
00:06:38,332 --> 00:06:41,172
but they post a lot of cool concept art.

178
00:06:41,832 --> 00:06:43,512
When it comes to non-Disney stuff,

179
00:06:43,632 --> 00:06:46,492
I wrote down a couple that see,

180
00:06:46,692 --> 00:06:48,632
I haven't, I can't vouch for either of these,

181
00:06:48,792 --> 00:06:51,952
but the one we've talked about before,

182
00:06:52,072 --> 00:06:54,432
J Bangs, Hal J Stein, MCA,

183
00:06:54,472 --> 00:06:56,872
and Universal invented the Modern Theme Park

184
00:06:56,872 --> 00:06:59,072
and beat Disney on its own game.

185
00:06:59,492 --> 00:07:02,032
That is written by a guy named Sam Genoway,

186
00:07:02,132 --> 00:07:04,972
who's also, he wrote the Universal versus Disney book

187
00:07:04,972 --> 00:07:07,492
that I quoted from a lot in the Jaws episode.

188
00:07:08,432 --> 00:07:10,632
And then another book that really interests me

189
00:07:10,632 --> 00:07:14,092
that I cannot vouch for the quality of is called Grandstand.

190
00:07:14,452 --> 00:07:19,012
That is the novel based on the story about Hard Rock Park.

191
00:07:19,432 --> 00:07:21,632
Oh, that's the fictionalized version?

192
00:07:21,872 --> 00:07:22,592
The fictionalized version.

193
00:07:22,592 --> 00:07:23,592
Oh yeah, right.

194
00:07:23,592 --> 00:07:24,572
The summary, quote,

195
00:07:24,872 --> 00:07:27,632
regional media conglomerate Caitlin Tufts

196
00:07:27,632 --> 00:07:29,972
and her managing editor Jack O'Banion

197
00:07:29,972 --> 00:07:32,252
have set out to discover the real story

198
00:07:32,512 --> 00:07:34,772
behind Rock Time Amusement Park

199
00:07:34,772 --> 00:07:36,512
and Myrtle Beach South Carolina.

200
00:07:36,732 --> 00:07:37,172
Rock Time.

201
00:07:37,172 --> 00:07:39,052
Oh man, Rock Time, love that.

202
00:07:39,512 --> 00:07:43,072
And then could you count the literary adaption

203
00:07:43,072 --> 00:07:44,872
of Escape from Tomorrow?

204
00:07:45,892 --> 00:07:46,892
The novelization.

205
00:07:46,892 --> 00:07:48,252
The novelization, excuse me.

206
00:07:48,472 --> 00:07:49,072
Yeah, that's what I meant to say.

207
00:07:49,932 --> 00:07:52,612
Which was written secretly inside a theme park.

208
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:53,872
Don't get caught.

209
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:58,532
We had to disguise our laptop as a fanny pack.

210
00:08:00,392 --> 00:08:01,552
Yeah, I don't know.

211
00:08:01,552 --> 00:08:03,332
I can't think of anything else off the top of my head.

212
00:08:03,632 --> 00:08:06,232
I've heard that the, I cannot vouch for it,

213
00:08:06,232 --> 00:08:08,892
but I've heard that the new book from Tashin

214
00:08:08,892 --> 00:08:10,772
called Walt Disney is Disneyland.

215
00:08:10,772 --> 00:08:11,812
Yes, I gotta get that.

216
00:08:11,852 --> 00:08:13,032
That's what people have been saying as well.

217
00:08:13,112 --> 00:08:15,972
Yes, I've sent them emails asking for a review copy

218
00:08:15,972 --> 00:08:17,032
and I've not heard back.

219
00:08:18,012 --> 00:08:19,112
Review means free.

220
00:08:19,352 --> 00:08:19,752
Yes.

221
00:08:20,672 --> 00:08:23,372
Also the Disney Imagineering Field Guide.

222
00:08:23,472 --> 00:08:24,912
So these little pocket-sized books

223
00:08:24,912 --> 00:08:26,412
with lots of behind the scenes stuff.

224
00:08:26,532 --> 00:08:28,872
The idea being you can take them to the park

225
00:08:28,872 --> 00:08:30,392
and look at the attractions

226
00:08:30,392 --> 00:08:33,032
and then look at the little stuff in it.

227
00:08:33,092 --> 00:08:34,072
Disney put those out.

228
00:08:34,132 --> 00:08:34,792
They're pretty neat.

229
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:36,132
You know what I would like to look at?

230
00:08:36,272 --> 00:08:41,032
I was so obsessed with just the Burn Bombs guide

231
00:08:41,032 --> 00:08:43,072
to Disney World.

232
00:08:43,512 --> 00:08:44,812
Those are on eBay.

233
00:08:45,452 --> 00:08:46,092
Just like those.

234
00:08:47,012 --> 00:08:50,172
I read this on the flight to Disney World.

235
00:08:50,312 --> 00:08:54,332
I read this thing cover to cover, the Burn Bombs guide, 1992,

236
00:08:54,832 --> 00:08:58,172
so that I knew every single thing, exactly what it was,

237
00:08:58,512 --> 00:09:00,552
every detail as soon as we walked up to it.

238
00:09:00,572 --> 00:09:03,452
I bet it'd be charming to look at those old ones

239
00:09:03,452 --> 00:09:06,332
that you might have highlighted stuff you saw as a kid.

240
00:09:06,392 --> 00:09:07,072
That's fun.

241
00:09:07,332 --> 00:09:09,052
Yeah, this is a nice question

242
00:09:09,052 --> 00:09:11,472
that we have a nice real answer to.

243
00:09:12,472 --> 00:09:13,132
Yeah.

244
00:09:14,372 --> 00:09:15,452
What do we got in the mail bag,

245
00:09:15,592 --> 00:09:16,572
unless we have more books?

246
00:09:17,072 --> 00:09:18,332
Are we done with the mail bag?

247
00:09:18,552 --> 00:09:19,592
No, no, I've got more.

248
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,712
No books in the mail, but we didn't get any books today.

249
00:09:21,832 --> 00:09:22,892
That's good, it would've been heavier.

250
00:09:23,232 --> 00:09:23,952
But it would've been good

251
00:09:23,952 --> 00:09:25,492
if we got a review copy in the mail bag.

252
00:09:25,492 --> 00:09:26,552
It would've been nice to get a Tash and a Bean copy.

253
00:09:26,952 --> 00:09:28,892
No Tash and Book in the mail bag,

254
00:09:28,952 --> 00:09:30,312
but there's more of your letters.

255
00:09:32,052 --> 00:09:33,832
John Rhodes writes,

256
00:09:34,432 --> 00:09:35,212
Dear Podcast The Ride,

257
00:09:35,352 --> 00:09:37,152
as someone who has been to Walt Disney World

258
00:09:37,152 --> 00:09:39,472
on numerous occasions, but never been to Disneyland,

259
00:09:39,732 --> 00:09:41,352
I was shocked when I watched a ride through

260
00:09:41,352 --> 00:09:43,292
of Guardians of the Galaxy Mission Breakout,

261
00:09:43,632 --> 00:09:46,152
only to discover that the ride leaves out

262
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,132
all of the excellent pre-drop aspects

263
00:09:48,132 --> 00:09:51,752
of the Orlando version of Tower of Terror, he means.

264
00:09:52,332 --> 00:09:54,132
Thankfully, you mentioned on a later episode

265
00:09:54,132 --> 00:09:55,532
that this was always the case

266
00:09:55,532 --> 00:09:58,392
and not something the IP-based reworking extracted.

267
00:09:58,812 --> 00:10:01,772
Either way, it got me thinking, for better or worse,

268
00:10:02,232 --> 00:10:04,572
what are the biggest differences between rides

269
00:10:04,572 --> 00:10:08,872
that exist in multiple Disney or Universal parks?

270
00:10:10,992 --> 00:10:14,892
I mean, the Tower of Terror, Anaheim, Orlando one,

271
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,392
that was a big thing for me.

272
00:10:16,392 --> 00:10:18,492
It's always there, and when people get mad

273
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:20,572
about the removal of Tower of Terror in California,

274
00:10:20,612 --> 00:10:24,892
I think it's weird because it was always a cheaper version

275
00:10:24,892 --> 00:10:27,592
that was missing big, expensive elements.

276
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:31,852
And cheap, expensive, cheap elements too.

277
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:34,432
The end of the ride in Florida,

278
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:39,052
you end up in a spot with the dummy and other fun.

279
00:10:39,412 --> 00:10:39,912
And the eyes, yeah.

280
00:10:40,052 --> 00:10:41,412
Well, but at the end of the ride

281
00:10:41,412 --> 00:10:43,092
is fun, Twilight Zone stuff.

282
00:10:43,292 --> 00:10:45,232
There's memorabilia as you land,

283
00:10:45,832 --> 00:10:49,192
and the dummy and chairs, and there's this whole little scene

284
00:10:49,192 --> 00:10:51,572
that happens sort of at the end, and nothing plays out.

285
00:10:51,672 --> 00:10:53,332
It's just you land in a different spot

286
00:10:53,332 --> 00:10:54,712
than you started on the end of the ride.

287
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:58,952
Just that is different, because you start from the same place

288
00:10:58,952 --> 00:11:00,272
and you land in the same place in California,

289
00:11:00,312 --> 00:11:01,992
so they can't do something fun like that.

290
00:11:03,192 --> 00:11:07,592
And the Paris one is also a minimized version, I believe.

291
00:11:07,812 --> 00:11:10,612
Yeah, and the one in Tokyo is the same.

292
00:11:10,972 --> 00:11:12,432
The one in Tokyo is a whole other story

293
00:11:12,432 --> 00:11:14,332
because the theming is so excellent,

294
00:11:14,372 --> 00:11:17,192
but there's no fourth dimension room there either.

295
00:11:17,432 --> 00:11:18,392
It's the same one.

296
00:11:18,492 --> 00:11:20,812
Oh, okay, so only the Disney World one.

297
00:11:20,952 --> 00:11:21,392
Yeah.

298
00:11:21,392 --> 00:11:22,532
So it's all been sort of like,

299
00:11:22,532 --> 00:11:25,492
you don't even want to say lesser towers in all these cases,

300
00:11:25,612 --> 00:11:26,852
but they are missing that.

301
00:11:26,912 --> 00:11:28,952
They're missing that, which I mean.

302
00:11:28,992 --> 00:11:31,172
A big one that sticks out for me,

303
00:11:31,172 --> 00:11:35,592
and the comfort of my spine is Space Mountain in Orlando

304
00:11:35,592 --> 00:11:38,072
versus Space Mountain in Anaheim.

305
00:11:38,672 --> 00:11:40,212
Totally different tracks, totally different.

306
00:11:40,272 --> 00:11:42,852
Well, there's two, yeah, and there's two tracks in Florida.

307
00:11:43,072 --> 00:11:43,672
Oh, yeah.

308
00:11:44,332 --> 00:11:45,252
And it's rough as shit.

309
00:11:45,412 --> 00:11:46,892
It's closer to the Matterhorn

310
00:11:46,892 --> 00:11:49,852
in that it'll just fuck your body up.

311
00:11:50,092 --> 00:11:52,132
Yeah, it's real rough.

312
00:11:52,332 --> 00:11:54,592
I feel like it's not as bad almost as the Matterhorn,

313
00:11:54,592 --> 00:11:55,652
but it's still pretty bad,

314
00:11:55,652 --> 00:11:56,832
and it also makes you really feel

315
00:11:56,832 --> 00:11:58,312
like you're gonna fly out of the car

316
00:11:58,312 --> 00:12:00,952
because it feels more like a toboggan,

317
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:02,032
whereas Disneyland feels like

318
00:12:02,032 --> 00:12:03,852
you're in a full roller coaster vehicle.

319
00:12:04,032 --> 00:12:05,572
Yeah, that thing's pretty hefty at this point.

320
00:12:05,912 --> 00:12:06,012
Yeah.

321
00:12:06,012 --> 00:12:07,092
It feels safe in there.

322
00:12:07,932 --> 00:12:09,772
What's the big, I mean, the Space Mountain,

323
00:12:10,372 --> 00:12:13,912
that might be the biggest feeling of a change

324
00:12:13,912 --> 00:12:15,592
to go from one to the other.

325
00:12:16,532 --> 00:12:17,992
Pirates, obviously,

326
00:12:18,492 --> 00:12:20,252
because there's no waterfall,

327
00:12:20,592 --> 00:12:22,832
there's no drop in Florida.

328
00:12:23,372 --> 00:12:24,012
There's no drop?

329
00:12:24,492 --> 00:12:25,712
Yeah, it just sort of starts.

330
00:12:25,992 --> 00:12:28,732
Oh, really, and you don't come back up out the waterfall.

331
00:12:29,112 --> 00:12:31,732
And that whole fun, maybe that's the biggest

332
00:12:31,732 --> 00:12:34,552
drastic change is because you miss this whole fun,

333
00:12:35,032 --> 00:12:38,032
all the ambiance, the restaurant is gone,

334
00:12:39,232 --> 00:12:40,092
and you just- The bayou is gone.

335
00:12:40,372 --> 00:12:42,372
The bayou is gone, you don't have that minute

336
00:12:42,372 --> 00:12:46,472
of just crickets and banjo man on the porch

337
00:12:46,472 --> 00:12:48,732
that's obviously like something's wrong with him,

338
00:12:48,912 --> 00:12:51,552
but it's nice to see him.

339
00:12:51,552 --> 00:12:51,912
Yeah.

340
00:12:51,912 --> 00:12:54,392
We had to do a whole episode about the banjo man.

341
00:12:54,612 --> 00:12:56,132
Yeah, oh, the banjo, that'd be great.

342
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,352
So that, I feel like that is missing

343
00:12:58,352 --> 00:13:00,152
such a crucial element to the ride.

344
00:13:00,272 --> 00:13:02,412
It almost feels maybe more important to me.

345
00:13:02,412 --> 00:13:03,772
Well, then, Tower does, but maybe not.

346
00:13:04,192 --> 00:13:06,332
And that's maybe a change here and there

347
00:13:06,332 --> 00:13:09,312
is the lack of space that doesn't give you as much time

348
00:13:09,312 --> 00:13:13,572
to settle you into the story or what have you.

349
00:13:14,492 --> 00:13:17,972
The rides are the same, but the Little Mermaid

350
00:13:17,972 --> 00:13:22,692
is different in land and world in terms of setting.

351
00:13:22,832 --> 00:13:25,652
And world is maybe superior in that you're actually

352
00:13:25,652 --> 00:13:30,632
in the Little Mermaid facade rather than the-

353
00:13:30,632 --> 00:13:32,152
Whoopi Goldberg movie.

354
00:13:32,152 --> 00:13:35,692
Yeah, the San Francisco palace that is left over

355
00:13:35,692 --> 00:13:38,352
from the golden dreams.

356
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,992
There's the sea cabs.

357
00:13:42,632 --> 00:13:47,112
It's the same Nemo experience in the submarines

358
00:13:47,112 --> 00:13:49,672
as in the path to the Living Seas.

359
00:13:49,672 --> 00:13:50,932
Oh, the Living Seas, yeah.

360
00:13:50,952 --> 00:13:54,372
Yeah, it's the characters in these bubbles

361
00:13:54,372 --> 00:13:55,952
that are projected.

362
00:13:56,392 --> 00:13:59,872
So that's the same stuff, but one is submarines

363
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:02,792
and one is the Living Seas sea cabs,

364
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:04,652
which that feels more functional.

365
00:14:04,892 --> 00:14:07,292
It's more of like, let's get you down here

366
00:14:07,292 --> 00:14:09,072
rather than a ride in and of itself.

367
00:14:09,632 --> 00:14:12,272
You used to just take this big elevator.

368
00:14:12,412 --> 00:14:13,712
The Hydra later.

369
00:14:13,892 --> 00:14:14,392
The Hydra later.

370
00:14:14,672 --> 00:14:15,132
Not to be-

371
00:14:15,132 --> 00:14:16,132
Is that a Cyber later?

372
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:16,872
It's not a Cyber.

373
00:14:16,872 --> 00:14:17,672
Oh, it's not a Cyber.

374
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:18,772
I always fuck that up.

375
00:14:18,852 --> 00:14:20,852
No, no, no, it's powered by Hydral.

376
00:14:21,052 --> 00:14:23,912
It's powered by water rather than powered by

377
00:14:23,912 --> 00:14:26,792
the digital Infoscape.

378
00:14:28,872 --> 00:14:30,612
The, what else?

379
00:14:31,712 --> 00:14:35,032
Very minor differences in the Haunted Mansions

380
00:14:35,032 --> 00:14:36,952
between Orlando and Anaheim.

381
00:14:36,952 --> 00:14:39,512
Certainly the building designs are different.

382
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:41,952
There's like an extra room.

383
00:14:42,072 --> 00:14:44,752
There's like an MC Escher room in Florida,

384
00:14:44,952 --> 00:14:45,712
which is kind of cool.

385
00:14:45,732 --> 00:14:46,672
That's kind of cool.

386
00:14:46,672 --> 00:14:48,112
I like that.

387
00:14:48,492 --> 00:14:53,712
Railroads, there's no Medieval or Primeval worlds

388
00:14:53,712 --> 00:14:55,672
in Disney worlds.

389
00:14:55,932 --> 00:14:58,232
Is there any, the train in Disney world

390
00:14:58,232 --> 00:15:00,772
doesn't take you through anything special in particular?

391
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:01,852
Oh no, not really.

392
00:15:02,832 --> 00:15:05,752
In Orlando, it's much more functional

393
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:07,632
because that park is so more-

394
00:15:07,632 --> 00:15:07,992
It's a bigger place.

395
00:15:08,072 --> 00:15:09,472
Yeah, it's so spread out.

396
00:15:10,052 --> 00:15:12,212
I mean, I would say just the Tomorrowland out here

397
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:13,712
doesn't have Sunny Eclipse.

398
00:15:14,192 --> 00:15:15,552
That maybe is the biggest one.

399
00:15:15,632 --> 00:15:18,352
That would shut me up about a lot of this stuff

400
00:15:18,352 --> 00:15:20,772
if they'd throw a Sunny over around somewhere.

401
00:15:20,892 --> 00:15:22,912
Yeah, Tomorrowland can rot like it's rotting now

402
00:15:22,912 --> 00:15:25,412
as long as there's a robot in there rotting with it.

403
00:15:25,412 --> 00:15:28,692
As long as he's doing songs and he's rotting, that's fine.

404
00:15:28,792 --> 00:15:29,432
Yeah. Absolutely.

405
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:30,872
Oh, you know what's another one?

406
00:15:33,272 --> 00:15:38,092
In Paris, Big Thunder is Tom Sawyer Island.

407
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:40,012
It replaces Tom Sawyer Island.

408
00:15:40,952 --> 00:15:44,712
So the mountain is in the middle of the rivers of America,

409
00:15:45,132 --> 00:15:46,952
which makes it a longer ride.

410
00:15:46,972 --> 00:15:49,692
I love the Big Thunder in France.

411
00:15:50,792 --> 00:15:54,292
It takes you underneath the rivers.

412
00:15:54,812 --> 00:15:55,712
That's really cool.

413
00:15:55,952 --> 00:15:58,712
Yeah, it adds a lot of time and added a lot more time

414
00:15:58,712 --> 00:16:00,772
the other way because that was the place

415
00:16:00,772 --> 00:16:03,372
where I got stuck on the third lift hill,

416
00:16:03,612 --> 00:16:05,352
which is probably the furthest point.

417
00:16:05,672 --> 00:16:08,852
It gave me like the most distance to have to walk through

418
00:16:08,852 --> 00:16:11,092
to get back to where we came from.

419
00:16:11,232 --> 00:16:13,432
And we were walking under the river.

420
00:16:14,052 --> 00:16:14,532
So super cool.

421
00:16:14,572 --> 00:16:17,532
That was like such an ideal breakdown experience.

422
00:16:17,632 --> 00:16:19,712
And the ride up until that point was great.

423
00:16:20,372 --> 00:16:23,032
Although I heard, I think Tony Baxter said

424
00:16:23,032 --> 00:16:27,272
that the finale of Thunder Mountain Paris

425
00:16:27,272 --> 00:16:29,932
is superior to the other ones

426
00:16:29,932 --> 00:16:31,252
because they had more space.

427
00:16:31,332 --> 00:16:33,512
And I don't really know why or what happens

428
00:16:33,512 --> 00:16:34,232
because it stopped.

429
00:16:34,352 --> 00:16:37,212
So I'm missing out on potentially something.

430
00:16:37,532 --> 00:16:39,512
I don't know, there's no like big effect I'm missing.

431
00:16:39,692 --> 00:16:41,592
I think it just like is a more superior.

432
00:16:41,932 --> 00:16:43,832
Because you know what's a bummer about Disneyland

433
00:16:43,832 --> 00:16:48,772
is that the most thrilling zone probably

434
00:16:48,772 --> 00:16:51,852
is between lift hills one and two.

435
00:16:51,852 --> 00:16:53,952
And then it kind of just sputters out.

436
00:16:53,952 --> 00:16:55,192
You get that splash down,

437
00:16:55,192 --> 00:16:58,752
but that's not particularly an exciting drop or anything.

438
00:16:59,112 --> 00:17:01,232
So Big Thunder Disneyland does kind of like,

439
00:17:01,232 --> 00:17:03,012
it's a little bit of an unsatisfying end.

440
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:05,012
Yeah, I think now that I'm thinking about it,

441
00:17:05,012 --> 00:17:07,392
what is my definitive answer for this question?

442
00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:09,372
I believe I have the answer.

443
00:17:09,492 --> 00:17:15,652
It is Pooh's Honey Hunt from Tokyo to California.

444
00:17:16,092 --> 00:17:17,152
Well, but that's not called,

445
00:17:17,152 --> 00:17:19,332
this is a different attraction I would say.

446
00:17:19,712 --> 00:17:20,652
I don't think you would quite.

447
00:17:20,872 --> 00:17:23,752
It's not, we're talking many adventures versus Pooh's.

448
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:27,152
But it's so, but there's so many of the scenes are the same.

449
00:17:27,152 --> 00:17:29,352
Michael, you're out of your fucking mind.

450
00:17:29,712 --> 00:17:31,392
I am not out of my fucking mind.

451
00:17:31,532 --> 00:17:32,632
You're losing it, dude.

452
00:17:32,632 --> 00:17:34,872
Not true, the narrative of the ride is the same.

453
00:17:35,772 --> 00:17:36,992
But the ride system is.

454
00:17:36,992 --> 00:17:39,592
But the ride system is so much different.

455
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,112
Well, but that holds true for the people movers

456
00:17:42,112 --> 00:17:44,592
in Florida versus the late one in Anaheim.

457
00:17:44,632 --> 00:17:45,372
Yeah, but I don't think you can,

458
00:17:45,412 --> 00:17:47,992
because there's no, well, there's a few little scenes

459
00:17:47,992 --> 00:17:50,512
for people movers, but I'm saying as far as a ride,

460
00:17:51,072 --> 00:17:52,872
this is the same narrative.

461
00:17:53,792 --> 00:17:54,932
And then you go through the same.

462
00:17:55,012 --> 00:17:56,672
So there's a Heffalub and Woozle scene here.

463
00:17:56,672 --> 00:17:58,872
There's a Heffalub and Woozle scene there.

464
00:17:59,032 --> 00:18:01,012
And the one there is so much better.

465
00:18:01,952 --> 00:18:02,172
Mm-hmm.

466
00:18:02,412 --> 00:18:03,392
I think this counts.

467
00:18:03,572 --> 00:18:05,312
I would quantify these as different experiences.

468
00:18:05,632 --> 00:18:05,972
I know.

469
00:18:06,072 --> 00:18:07,052
The names are different.

470
00:18:07,312 --> 00:18:08,532
But the names are different

471
00:18:08,532 --> 00:18:11,492
because they didn't want to invite comparison

472
00:18:11,492 --> 00:18:13,092
is my feeling about it.

473
00:18:13,152 --> 00:18:15,572
One is so vastly superior.

474
00:18:16,392 --> 00:18:18,132
Yeah, I know that.

475
00:18:18,412 --> 00:18:20,852
I know that's why I would call them different things.

476
00:18:21,092 --> 00:18:22,492
This is a splitting of hairs.

477
00:18:22,672 --> 00:18:24,452
I think we're splitting hairs here because.

478
00:18:24,452 --> 00:18:26,892
But like just even there's effects from the one

479
00:18:26,892 --> 00:18:30,152
in California and effects there and just robot wise,

480
00:18:30,512 --> 00:18:33,112
the poo is so cute and furry in Tokyo

481
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,092
and he's just not quite there.

482
00:18:35,092 --> 00:18:38,132
He's cute, don't get me wrong, but he's not the Tokyo poo.

483
00:18:38,532 --> 00:18:41,892
You mean to tell me that the Japanese

484
00:18:41,892 --> 00:18:44,252
got something cute, correct?

485
00:18:44,472 --> 00:18:46,272
Like they made a very cute thing.

486
00:18:46,512 --> 00:18:47,872
I am saying that.

487
00:18:47,912 --> 00:18:48,792
I don't believe that.

488
00:18:49,192 --> 00:18:51,052
So I believe that my answer stands

489
00:18:51,052 --> 00:18:53,352
and I believe I am the most correct.

490
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:54,612
Now.

491
00:18:54,892 --> 00:18:56,392
Well, now we're taking it too far.

492
00:18:56,872 --> 00:18:57,552
I believe I am.

493
00:18:57,552 --> 00:18:58,432
I am most thing.

494
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,272
The most correct.

495
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:01,852
That's the stubbornness I would expect from an Eeyore,

496
00:19:02,012 --> 00:19:02,752
not a poo.

497
00:19:03,832 --> 00:19:04,192
Is he?

498
00:19:04,252 --> 00:19:06,772
I think rabbit is more stubborn maybe than Eeyore.

499
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:07,892
Yeah, fuck I think you're right.

500
00:19:09,252 --> 00:19:09,992
Yeah, Eeyore is.

501
00:19:09,992 --> 00:19:10,712
Eeyore is too.

502
00:19:10,712 --> 00:19:13,592
Stubborn in terms of like wanting to stay sad

503
00:19:13,592 --> 00:19:15,212
and not wanting to get help.

504
00:19:15,232 --> 00:19:15,752
Yes.

505
00:19:15,892 --> 00:19:17,352
He doesn't want out of his funk.

506
00:19:17,352 --> 00:19:17,612
Right.

507
00:19:17,612 --> 00:19:19,052
Because it kind of defines him.

508
00:19:19,212 --> 00:19:21,832
It's like people who own and nurse their own depression.

509
00:19:22,012 --> 00:19:22,332
Exactly.

510
00:19:22,332 --> 00:19:24,012
And they use it as an identity.

511
00:19:25,352 --> 00:19:27,852
Eeyore, all your friends care about you.

512
00:19:27,852 --> 00:19:28,592
They want to help you

513
00:19:28,592 --> 00:19:31,012
and they're going to like you even if you cheer up.

514
00:19:31,372 --> 00:19:31,512
Anyway.

515
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:32,572
So if Eeyore is listening.

516
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:33,052
Most correct.

517
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:34,272
Oh boy.

518
00:19:35,112 --> 00:19:37,812
I'll let it slide for now.

519
00:19:38,912 --> 00:19:39,972
What else we got?

520
00:19:40,132 --> 00:19:40,392
All right.

521
00:19:40,532 --> 00:19:41,032
Shake another one loose.

522
00:19:41,292 --> 00:19:44,192
This is where the, I think the mailbag episode,

523
00:19:44,372 --> 00:19:46,352
the post office episodes are where we're,

524
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:49,052
we've like diverged from being a comedy podcast.

525
00:19:49,312 --> 00:19:50,012
This is where this like.

526
00:19:50,012 --> 00:19:50,312
For sure.

527
00:19:50,512 --> 00:19:52,192
These first two have just been like,

528
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:53,232
we're being tested.

529
00:19:53,512 --> 00:19:53,812
Yeah.

530
00:19:53,872 --> 00:19:55,872
These first two questions are like test questions.

531
00:19:55,872 --> 00:19:57,872
And we're all kind of eyeing each other.

532
00:19:58,012 --> 00:19:59,272
Like, do you know it?

533
00:19:59,352 --> 00:20:00,252
I think I know the answer.

534
00:20:00,412 --> 00:20:02,612
Is this next mailbag question,

535
00:20:03,012 --> 00:20:05,532
answer 10 questions about the history of Disney?

536
00:20:06,192 --> 00:20:06,792
No.

537
00:20:06,832 --> 00:20:07,892
We should do a quiz.

538
00:20:08,412 --> 00:20:08,432
Yeah.

539
00:20:08,432 --> 00:20:09,412
Maybe that's a fun,

540
00:20:10,072 --> 00:20:12,072
but like if we somehow like,

541
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:15,072
I don't know who could be impartial enough to give us

542
00:20:15,072 --> 00:20:17,532
questions, but a little competition.

543
00:20:18,112 --> 00:20:18,852
That's a fun episode.

544
00:20:18,992 --> 00:20:20,672
I don't have, I don't know the mechanics of that.

545
00:20:20,672 --> 00:20:22,452
Like trivia stuff though.

546
00:20:22,452 --> 00:20:22,572
Yeah.

547
00:20:22,632 --> 00:20:24,132
But it would have to be a variety of topics.

548
00:20:24,132 --> 00:20:25,852
Who would call that though?

549
00:20:26,272 --> 00:20:26,492
Yeah.

550
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:27,352
I mean, there might be some.

551
00:20:27,892 --> 00:20:29,652
Oh, that's interesting.

552
00:20:29,932 --> 00:20:31,052
Quiz master Jones.

553
00:20:31,412 --> 00:20:32,832
He might be into that.

554
00:20:33,152 --> 00:20:33,352
Yeah.

555
00:20:33,912 --> 00:20:37,892
I wonder if there's some book that exists that we could

556
00:20:37,892 --> 00:20:41,472
like pull from or somebody could kind of randomly select.

557
00:20:41,912 --> 00:20:43,512
But Doug is the quiz master.

558
00:20:43,652 --> 00:20:44,992
That would be different.

559
00:20:44,992 --> 00:20:47,812
Cause I feel like we're not tight to like,

560
00:20:48,092 --> 00:20:49,972
if we have it written down, we'll go like,

561
00:20:49,992 --> 00:20:52,232
actually that opened in like,

562
00:20:52,232 --> 00:20:53,112
that didn't open that year.

563
00:20:53,112 --> 00:20:55,092
I might eat shit if it's a lot of dates.

564
00:20:55,332 --> 00:20:56,952
I forget dates a lot.

565
00:20:57,792 --> 00:21:00,452
We would all discover our own areas of weakness.

566
00:21:01,072 --> 00:21:01,592
And yeah.

567
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,852
We'll come, that sounds like fun.

568
00:21:04,072 --> 00:21:05,292
The great trivia challenge.

569
00:21:05,292 --> 00:21:05,832
That's fun.

570
00:21:05,992 --> 00:21:06,452
All right.

571
00:21:06,512 --> 00:21:08,992
Or maybe, or with quiz master Bugsy.

572
00:21:09,912 --> 00:21:13,072
That's a very different kind of thing.

573
00:21:13,432 --> 00:21:17,332
And if you lose, you gotta suck my jewels.

574
00:21:19,192 --> 00:21:19,992
All right.

575
00:21:20,152 --> 00:21:23,792
Amanda Hasaka writes, first off, love the podcast.

576
00:21:23,872 --> 00:21:24,492
Thank you, Amanda.

577
00:21:25,472 --> 00:21:27,752
But now that Netflix has passed over Disney

578
00:21:27,752 --> 00:21:29,952
in terms of being the biggest media company,

579
00:21:30,152 --> 00:21:32,732
do you think they'd get into the theme park game?

580
00:21:32,772 --> 00:21:36,072
If so, what are some properties that would make the cut?

581
00:21:36,272 --> 00:21:38,612
The only thing I could think of is a stranger things

582
00:21:38,612 --> 00:21:40,052
upside down situation.

583
00:21:40,052 --> 00:21:43,032
Or maybe they can take all the Netflix Marvel properties

584
00:21:43,032 --> 00:21:44,312
and do something with those.

585
00:21:44,632 --> 00:21:45,992
Would love to hear your ideas.

586
00:21:45,992 --> 00:21:47,112
They can't do that because it's Marvel.

587
00:21:47,192 --> 00:21:47,312
Thanks.

588
00:21:48,072 --> 00:21:50,512
And congrats to Scott for being a launch queen.

589
00:21:50,592 --> 00:21:51,612
Okay, first off.

590
00:21:51,872 --> 00:21:52,212
Wow.

591
00:21:52,412 --> 00:21:53,452
All right.

592
00:21:53,692 --> 00:21:54,612
Hold on, I gotta say,

593
00:21:54,832 --> 00:21:57,192
one launch does not a launch queen make.

594
00:21:57,412 --> 00:21:58,092
Oh, really?

595
00:21:58,672 --> 00:21:59,532
That doesn't count.

596
00:21:59,532 --> 00:22:00,332
Let's not go crazy.

597
00:22:00,592 --> 00:22:01,952
Where do you draw the line?

598
00:22:02,052 --> 00:22:04,872
What do I have to do to earn your respect?

599
00:22:05,352 --> 00:22:07,692
You know, well, first off, you have my respect.

600
00:22:07,992 --> 00:22:08,492
Oh, that's good.

601
00:22:08,492 --> 00:22:08,772
I know.

602
00:22:09,132 --> 00:22:13,832
But I think like, let's not go overboard.

603
00:22:13,972 --> 00:22:16,332
Let's not, you already said you love the podcast.

604
00:22:16,332 --> 00:22:18,512
Let's not hype ourselves up too much now.

605
00:22:18,532 --> 00:22:20,352
I say let's not contradict

606
00:22:20,352 --> 00:22:22,532
this person who said nice things about the show.

607
00:22:23,472 --> 00:22:26,172
Well, I think if, I think let's let the fans decide

608
00:22:26,172 --> 00:22:28,012
what constitutes a launch queen.

609
00:22:28,692 --> 00:22:30,692
You tell me what kind of queen I am.

610
00:22:30,852 --> 00:22:32,852
For the listeners, you should know

611
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:36,012
we are both squeezing apples as we say this.

612
00:22:36,052 --> 00:22:38,872
So they explode to get our anger out.

613
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:43,392
No, I think that is a very funny question.

614
00:22:43,572 --> 00:22:44,412
What do you guys think?

615
00:22:44,412 --> 00:22:45,812
What is Netflix?

616
00:22:46,372 --> 00:22:48,632
I'm scrolling through here.

617
00:22:48,692 --> 00:22:50,412
What could we do?

618
00:22:50,612 --> 00:22:52,512
So yeah, Marvel has to be out because that's Disney.

619
00:22:52,652 --> 00:22:55,092
And even though Netflix is showing them, that doesn't work.

620
00:22:55,172 --> 00:22:56,612
I want to be legal here, too.

621
00:22:56,612 --> 00:22:57,892
I don't want to do something.

622
00:22:58,532 --> 00:23:00,292
We can't use a property that wouldn't be able to.

623
00:23:00,292 --> 00:23:04,672
So it has to be like a Netflix property that they own.

624
00:23:04,872 --> 00:23:09,012
We take a tried and true lesson from a playbook.

625
00:23:09,032 --> 00:23:12,992
I think you want big letters spelling out Netflix

626
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:16,652
in front of the whole California adventure.

627
00:23:17,432 --> 00:23:19,792
But we have new technologies now.

628
00:23:19,872 --> 00:23:25,652
So I think you get some really high def OLED screens

629
00:23:25,652 --> 00:23:28,492
on those letters so that it looks like they disappear

630
00:23:28,492 --> 00:23:31,972
and then they reappear and that Netflix pop

631
00:23:31,972 --> 00:23:34,672
and they constantly playing the boom.

632
00:23:34,952 --> 00:23:37,732
Well, I think when you check in, when you scan your ticket,

633
00:23:37,732 --> 00:23:38,852
boom boom.

634
00:23:39,172 --> 00:23:39,992
Oh, for sure.

635
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:40,792
That's good.

636
00:23:40,932 --> 00:23:42,492
Every time you hit in the door.

637
00:23:42,932 --> 00:23:43,912
How about this?

638
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:45,452
So there has to be different lands.

639
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:48,352
And look, it's a trope maybe at this point,

640
00:23:48,352 --> 00:23:51,232
but there has to be some sort of Western theme land.

641
00:23:51,512 --> 00:23:52,212
Yeah. Okay.

642
00:23:52,512 --> 00:23:54,612
But it can't just be, you know, frontier land.

643
00:23:54,792 --> 00:23:55,972
It can't just be old West town.

644
00:23:56,232 --> 00:24:00,172
I would like to theme this to the Netflix original movie,

645
00:24:00,732 --> 00:24:02,712
Adam Sandler's The Ridiculous Six.

646
00:24:03,092 --> 00:24:03,912
Oh yeah.

647
00:24:04,252 --> 00:24:05,672
Photo ops with all six.

648
00:24:05,672 --> 00:24:06,772
All six. So not godless.

649
00:24:07,432 --> 00:24:08,932
No, not godless.

650
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,272
You can make it Westy.

651
00:24:10,272 --> 00:24:10,772
Is that what you thought I was going?

652
00:24:10,852 --> 00:24:13,212
A restaurant based on it or a store,

653
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,372
but let's keep it minimal.

654
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:16,272
Let's keep it to properties

655
00:24:16,272 --> 00:24:18,472
that are like the most popular properties

656
00:24:18,472 --> 00:24:20,812
because I want to make money off of this thing too.

657
00:24:20,832 --> 00:24:21,092
Yeah.

658
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:22,572
And Ridiculous Six, the Adam Sandler movies

659
00:24:22,572 --> 00:24:24,312
do very well for Netflix.

660
00:24:24,612 --> 00:24:25,632
They've re-upped with him.

661
00:24:25,972 --> 00:24:27,652
So this is going to be a big draw

662
00:24:27,652 --> 00:24:29,712
and you're going to meet all of the characters

663
00:24:29,712 --> 00:24:31,332
from the movie, characters like Tommy,

664
00:24:31,652 --> 00:24:33,592
characters like Chico and Herm and little Pete

665
00:24:33,592 --> 00:24:36,812
and Ramon and Danny and Will Patch.

666
00:24:37,892 --> 00:24:40,332
And one of those I can only assume is vanilla ice.

667
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:43,872
So definitely we want a vanilla ice walk around.

668
00:24:44,372 --> 00:24:47,092
So that's for sure going to be the fun to your land area.

669
00:24:47,572 --> 00:24:50,012
I think that there's got to be a mini land next to it

670
00:24:50,012 --> 00:24:55,592
of like the Ridiculous Six land felt, you know, guilty

671
00:24:55,592 --> 00:24:57,772
of like, well, we got to do something for this guy.

672
00:24:57,812 --> 00:25:01,012
And so there's going to be a real Rob land, right?

673
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:04,212
Rob Schneider's the real Rob.

674
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:06,012
Based off Adam Sandler's relationship with.

675
00:25:06,212 --> 00:25:08,812
Oh, I think like if you're going to build an Adam Sandler land.

676
00:25:08,872 --> 00:25:10,812
There's kind of a real Rob land.

677
00:25:11,392 --> 00:25:12,772
Yeah, you got to throw Rob a bone.

678
00:25:13,112 --> 00:25:14,832
Like, yeah, the Rob zone.

679
00:25:14,872 --> 00:25:17,592
And it doesn't have to be a lot of room.

680
00:25:17,772 --> 00:25:23,152
And then all of the buildings in the real Rob zone

681
00:25:23,152 --> 00:25:25,792
are all colored oddly orange,

682
00:25:25,812 --> 00:25:28,072
like all of the actors in the real Rob.

683
00:25:28,292 --> 00:25:30,532
Watch the trailer, you'll see what I'm talking about.

684
00:25:30,532 --> 00:25:31,232
I know what you're talking about.

685
00:25:31,532 --> 00:25:34,592
There could be a world showcase vibe

686
00:25:34,592 --> 00:25:36,832
because Netflix films take you all over the world.

687
00:25:36,832 --> 00:25:40,092
So for sure, you'd want to land after Ibiza

688
00:25:40,092 --> 00:25:42,492
or as it's now known, Ibiza love drunk.

689
00:25:42,892 --> 00:25:45,972
We got to go to Ibiza with our favorite ravers,

690
00:25:46,192 --> 00:25:48,792
Gillian Jacobs and the others.

691
00:25:49,352 --> 00:25:52,112
And you can buy their unicorn onesies.

692
00:25:52,332 --> 00:25:53,952
How many people now that you're like,

693
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:55,332
we've heard of Ridiculous Six.

694
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:57,132
They know Ibiza love drunk.

695
00:25:57,232 --> 00:26:00,212
I feel like maybe at this point we've lost everyone.

696
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,332
When you say Ibiza.

697
00:26:01,612 --> 00:26:03,532
Well, I'm going to bring them back.

698
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:04,852
Hit them with a hit, hit them with a hit.

699
00:26:04,852 --> 00:26:05,912
Hit them with a hit, yeah.

700
00:26:08,032 --> 00:26:11,812
Licensing, big parks do have to license stuff

701
00:26:11,812 --> 00:26:14,072
from other things.

702
00:26:14,352 --> 00:26:16,892
And this is like, license.

703
00:26:17,012 --> 00:26:18,752
This is a big Netflix crowd blazer.

704
00:26:19,152 --> 00:26:21,272
I'm talking the Great British Bake Off.

705
00:26:21,892 --> 00:26:22,372
Okay.

706
00:26:22,852 --> 00:26:23,252
Yeah.

707
00:26:23,612 --> 00:26:24,452
I'm trying to think.

708
00:26:24,452 --> 00:26:25,432
That's just a good idea.

709
00:26:25,472 --> 00:26:26,892
I was going to say this is actually good.

710
00:26:26,992 --> 00:26:29,412
I mean, signature dining, just to me.

711
00:26:29,572 --> 00:26:32,232
I mean, you're going to get some great sweets and stuff.

712
00:26:32,292 --> 00:26:34,092
And I think that can be,

713
00:26:35,092 --> 00:26:40,592
I similarly, there is other great food stuff on Netflix.

714
00:26:41,052 --> 00:26:41,952
Well, here's how the great,

715
00:26:42,052 --> 00:26:45,632
you go to the Great British Bake Off Cafe

716
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:51,612
and you order, you know, like beignets

717
00:26:51,612 --> 00:26:53,452
or profiteroles or whatever.

718
00:26:54,072 --> 00:26:58,292
And then like, and then Eager Baker is like, okay.

719
00:26:58,372 --> 00:27:00,172
And then goes off and sweats it out

720
00:27:00,172 --> 00:27:03,092
and makes it up from scratch for four hours.

721
00:27:03,192 --> 00:27:05,292
And you, while you sit and wait,

722
00:27:05,592 --> 00:27:07,272
and then you, you can't leave.

723
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:07,952
You can't go on other rides.

724
00:27:07,952 --> 00:27:09,072
You can't leave, you have to watch

725
00:27:09,072 --> 00:27:12,692
from like beautifully shot, like Mind of a Chef or

726
00:27:12,692 --> 00:27:13,192
Yes, absolutely.

727
00:27:13,192 --> 00:27:13,632
Chef's Table.

728
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:16,152
And you have to like pay compliments.

729
00:27:16,212 --> 00:27:18,732
You can't get impatient because it's a very nice show.

730
00:27:18,972 --> 00:27:20,932
So you have to like, say they're doing a good job,

731
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,632
encourage them if something goes wrong

732
00:27:22,632 --> 00:27:25,772
and it melts before it gets in the oven or it doesn't hold.

733
00:27:26,052 --> 00:27:28,352
You have to like be encouraging and pat them on the back.

734
00:27:28,492 --> 00:27:30,212
But it's, yeah, it's the world's only

735
00:27:31,372 --> 00:27:33,732
four hour dining experience in a theme park.

736
00:27:34,032 --> 00:27:35,912
Who needs quick service when you could

737
00:27:35,912 --> 00:27:38,032
have a cake baked from scratch?

738
00:27:38,632 --> 00:27:38,712
Yeah.

739
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:42,672
I have another restaurant idea for the Ridiculous Sixland.

740
00:27:43,032 --> 00:27:44,232
I think this fits.

741
00:27:44,532 --> 00:27:46,452
It's not, it's gonna loosely, it's on Netflix.

742
00:27:46,472 --> 00:27:49,172
So it's not Adam Sandler, but you're gonna have to go eat

743
00:27:49,172 --> 00:27:50,992
at a little place called The Ranch.

744
00:27:51,512 --> 00:27:51,832
Yeah.

745
00:27:51,832 --> 00:27:52,512
All right.

746
00:27:52,572 --> 00:27:53,772
So The Ranch is gonna be a different,

747
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:56,292
like a different restaurant, highly themed restaurant.

748
00:27:57,452 --> 00:28:01,072
There's a college student dressed as the Sam Elliott

749
00:28:01,072 --> 00:28:02,832
character from The Ranch.

750
00:28:03,052 --> 00:28:03,372
The character.

751
00:28:03,492 --> 00:28:05,432
The character we all know the name of.

752
00:28:05,932 --> 00:28:06,992
Do we all wanna say it?

753
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:07,452
Yeah.

754
00:28:08,332 --> 00:28:09,932
Hold on, I'm looking at the...

755
00:28:09,932 --> 00:28:10,872
Billy?

756
00:28:11,752 --> 00:28:12,472
Is it Billy?

757
00:28:12,472 --> 00:28:12,912
Billy Hannigan.

758
00:28:13,012 --> 00:28:14,132
Robert Hendrix.

759
00:28:15,312 --> 00:28:18,112
All right, my guess is that his name is Louie.

760
00:28:18,452 --> 00:28:21,132
That's our, Bo is his name.

761
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:21,692
Yeah, yeah.

762
00:28:21,692 --> 00:28:22,172
Yeah, that's perfect.

763
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:22,992
Bo is great.

764
00:28:23,332 --> 00:28:23,732
Bo Bennett.

765
00:28:23,792 --> 00:28:25,712
Bit, we were messing with you.

766
00:28:26,672 --> 00:28:28,412
So there's that, I mean, for sure,

767
00:28:28,432 --> 00:28:30,232
there's gotta be a fuller house.

768
00:28:30,232 --> 00:28:30,732
House.

769
00:28:31,132 --> 00:28:33,252
You wanna see the, you wanna walk through

770
00:28:33,252 --> 00:28:34,492
the famous red door.

771
00:28:34,592 --> 00:28:36,792
Of course, who do they live next door?

772
00:28:36,932 --> 00:28:38,372
Uh-oh.

773
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:42,432
The brownstone that just Claire Underwood lives in.

774
00:28:42,852 --> 00:28:42,952
Yes.

775
00:28:42,952 --> 00:28:43,532
From House of Cards.

776
00:28:43,752 --> 00:28:44,612
Just Claire Underwood.

777
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,252
There will be no representation of Frank Underwood.

778
00:28:46,452 --> 00:28:48,672
No Frank Underwood in the park.

779
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:51,752
Frank Underwood was, there were plans for,

780
00:28:51,832 --> 00:28:53,492
I mean, there could still be a White House

781
00:28:53,492 --> 00:28:55,152
because Claire's president now,

782
00:28:55,852 --> 00:28:58,652
but Frank Underwood been scrubbed from the park, thank God.

783
00:28:59,712 --> 00:29:03,352
It's nice, you know, Disneyland has nostalgia,

784
00:29:04,092 --> 00:29:05,672
but I like it, and even in the new parks

785
00:29:05,672 --> 00:29:09,012
that Disney still honors classic properties that they have.

786
00:29:10,112 --> 00:29:10,752
So they're still, you know,

787
00:29:10,752 --> 00:29:13,372
they're gonna build a new Peter Pan land over in Tokyo.

788
00:29:13,532 --> 00:29:14,172
And like, that's great,

789
00:29:14,192 --> 00:29:15,912
because obviously that movie is very old,

790
00:29:15,912 --> 00:29:17,912
but they're still honoring the classics.

791
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:20,052
And I think that obviously a Netflix theme park

792
00:29:20,052 --> 00:29:22,092
has to honor their heritage.

793
00:29:22,092 --> 00:29:24,472
And they have to go, and they have to remember,

794
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:29,772
it all started with a gangster in Norway, right?

795
00:29:29,792 --> 00:29:30,472
What kind of gangster?

796
00:29:31,592 --> 00:29:33,212
What was the tagline?

797
00:29:33,452 --> 00:29:34,152
A New York gangster?

798
00:29:34,292 --> 00:29:36,812
A New York gangster in Norway.

799
00:29:37,912 --> 00:29:39,632
I'm talking about Lillehammer.

800
00:29:39,752 --> 00:29:41,992
There has to be a Lillehammer dark ride.

801
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:42,832
Yeah, absolutely.

802
00:29:42,972 --> 00:29:44,572
Okay, and it takes you through Norway,

803
00:29:44,672 --> 00:29:46,872
and it takes you to meeting all of his paisanos.

804
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:50,672
But then how's this New York guy gonna navigate in Norway?

805
00:29:51,152 --> 00:29:52,092
How is it gonna work?

806
00:29:52,152 --> 00:29:54,132
And like, you're gonna have to navigate the streets of Norway,

807
00:29:54,172 --> 00:29:57,112
just like our famous Lillehammer.

808
00:29:57,412 --> 00:29:58,112
Is that his name?

809
00:29:58,312 --> 00:29:59,932
Or is that, no, that's- Yeah, Lillehammer is his last name.

810
00:29:59,952 --> 00:30:00,172
Yeah.

811
00:30:00,292 --> 00:30:01,952
It's not the place in Norway he's going?

812
00:30:02,952 --> 00:30:04,692
Wait, is it a place in Norway?

813
00:30:04,692 --> 00:30:05,252
I don't know.

814
00:30:05,392 --> 00:30:06,772
I always thought it was his last name.

815
00:30:06,992 --> 00:30:08,252
I also, you know, I don't-

816
00:30:08,252 --> 00:30:09,532
No, it's not his last name.

817
00:30:09,552 --> 00:30:11,252
Lillehammer is the place, I think.

818
00:30:12,512 --> 00:30:14,672
Rural, Lille, yeah, Lillehammer is in Norway.

819
00:30:14,852 --> 00:30:17,332
His name is Frank Tagliano.

820
00:30:18,012 --> 00:30:18,452
Oh.

821
00:30:18,272 --> 00:30:21,792
I love a good Tagliano-Bullionese.

822
00:30:22,692 --> 00:30:26,512
I know it's not, I don't know that this is on Netflix,

823
00:30:26,572 --> 00:30:28,572
but if it is or ever will be,

824
00:30:28,812 --> 00:30:31,812
and you can, I think other properties can be roped in.

825
00:30:31,892 --> 00:30:35,632
I think in Lillehammer hand, you wanna meet the snowman.

826
00:30:36,132 --> 00:30:37,192
You gotta meet the snowman.

827
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:40,232
Yeah, if we're going, you gotta meet the snowman's friend.

828
00:30:40,392 --> 00:30:41,252
Oh, what was his name?

829
00:30:41,572 --> 00:30:42,532
With Harry Holley Walker.

830
00:30:42,532 --> 00:30:44,052
Harry Holley, yes.

831
00:30:44,232 --> 00:30:46,752
This feels like we should have had a little notice

832
00:30:46,752 --> 00:30:47,892
that we were doing this,

833
00:30:47,972 --> 00:30:50,132
because we could have gotten some more specifics.

834
00:30:50,152 --> 00:30:53,512
No, no, no, I like that we gotta throw it out

835
00:30:53,512 --> 00:30:56,532
off the top of the dome or off of shows up on our phones.

836
00:30:56,752 --> 00:30:58,712
I have the snowman, I have the book at home,

837
00:30:58,712 --> 00:31:00,752
and I have read another Harry Holley thing.

838
00:31:01,172 --> 00:31:02,872
They are very dark and sad.

839
00:31:03,272 --> 00:31:03,692
Oh, okay.

840
00:31:04,392 --> 00:31:07,412
Well, you know, you got live glow wrestling

841
00:31:07,412 --> 00:31:09,512
five times a day. Yeah, hell yeah.

842
00:31:10,572 --> 00:31:16,672
Whenever you go into a store to buy shirts or memorabilia,

843
00:31:16,752 --> 00:31:20,832
you can see if it fits, but it's not with any,

844
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:23,332
just any mirror, with a black mirror.

845
00:31:26,192 --> 00:31:28,572
You gotta go visit the penitentiary,

846
00:31:28,752 --> 00:31:31,952
where all our, where the crazy kooks over

847
00:31:31,952 --> 00:31:33,192
in the women's prison live.

848
00:31:33,192 --> 00:31:33,832
Sure.

849
00:31:34,672 --> 00:31:37,132
And there can be, and there's like, you know,

850
00:31:37,392 --> 00:31:40,412
maybe there's different rides based on every season,

851
00:31:40,412 --> 00:31:42,912
one through five or six, but everybody,

852
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:45,852
most people stop doing the rides after season three.

853
00:31:46,772 --> 00:31:50,012
I think the glow entrance needs like a carnival barker,

854
00:31:50,172 --> 00:31:52,332
like a Mr. Potato Head style carnival barker

855
00:31:52,332 --> 00:31:53,832
of Mark Maron's character.

856
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:56,812
And he's in character, you know, hyping you,

857
00:31:56,812 --> 00:31:59,752
you gotta get in the ring, like, you gotta do this.

858
00:32:00,032 --> 00:32:02,932
But then pretty quickly at the end of his loop,

859
00:32:03,412 --> 00:32:05,852
he like devolves into regular Maron

860
00:32:05,852 --> 00:32:07,412
and starts talking about like,

861
00:32:07,412 --> 00:32:09,992
ah, what is your Lorne story?

862
00:32:10,692 --> 00:32:11,792
Well, at the end of the day,

863
00:32:11,792 --> 00:32:12,872
when they have to close up the ride,

864
00:32:12,912 --> 00:32:14,632
he has to say, lock the gates.

865
00:32:14,692 --> 00:32:15,232
Lock the gates.

866
00:32:16,752 --> 00:32:18,112
They play that announcement,

867
00:32:18,112 --> 00:32:19,612
they play that like the recording.

868
00:32:20,412 --> 00:32:20,772
Yeah.

869
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,032
I would like to just add another detail to the ride

870
00:32:23,032 --> 00:32:24,632
because there's gonna be highly detailed animatronics

871
00:32:24,632 --> 00:32:25,972
in that Lillehammer dark ride.

872
00:32:26,012 --> 00:32:26,372
Of course.

873
00:32:26,712 --> 00:32:29,532
And the big iconic scene is when you meet

874
00:32:29,532 --> 00:32:32,152
the famous character from Lillehammer,

875
00:32:32,592 --> 00:32:35,572
Giuseppe, Joey the Undertaker, Tagliano,

876
00:32:35,832 --> 00:32:38,832
of course the character played by Bruce Springsteen

877
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:40,532
on one episode of Lillehammer.

878
00:32:40,832 --> 00:32:41,112
Hell yeah.

879
00:32:41,112 --> 00:32:41,952
Once, really?

880
00:32:41,952 --> 00:32:44,212
Yep, that's gonna be your like, kind of,

881
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,512
he's gonna be like the Yeti on the Matterhorn.

882
00:32:46,912 --> 00:32:48,772
You're gonna like get glimpses of him

883
00:32:48,772 --> 00:32:50,812
and then it's gonna be like, wow, there he is.

884
00:32:51,072 --> 00:32:54,712
There's Giuseppe, Joey the Undertaker, Tagliano.

885
00:32:56,432 --> 00:33:00,652
I think phase two of the park, I mean.

886
00:33:00,932 --> 00:33:03,332
Oh, we're cutting it off here for budget reasons?

887
00:33:03,752 --> 00:33:05,132
We can't do more than a phase.

888
00:33:05,132 --> 00:33:07,332
I mean, it's better to

889
00:33:07,332 --> 00:33:08,432
You gotta get something up.

890
00:33:08,552 --> 00:33:11,452
under-promise and over-deliver, you know.

891
00:33:12,432 --> 00:33:15,392
You know, people like colors

892
00:33:15,392 --> 00:33:18,372
and they like shows that are a little off.

893
00:33:18,672 --> 00:33:21,732
You gotta get that maniac ride in there, right?

894
00:33:22,212 --> 00:33:24,532
We're all going god-awful for maniac.

895
00:33:25,072 --> 00:33:27,112
Yeah, but I think you gotta allow a little time

896
00:33:27,112 --> 00:33:28,772
for it to sink in.

897
00:33:29,692 --> 00:33:30,412
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

898
00:33:30,452 --> 00:33:31,672
No, let it grow.

899
00:33:32,332 --> 00:33:34,672
The tough thing about kind of budgeting

900
00:33:34,672 --> 00:33:40,052
the future of Netflix land is that

901
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:44,092
it's hard to do the math on it because when you

902
00:33:44,092 --> 00:33:46,552
like, so what were the attendance figures for this year?

903
00:33:46,572 --> 00:33:49,652
We cannot say, we will never say our attendance figures.

904
00:33:49,892 --> 00:33:51,872
How dare you ask for our attendance figures?

905
00:33:52,612 --> 00:33:54,972
So that does like prohibit the growth.

906
00:33:55,012 --> 00:33:57,932
That being said, Netflix land is on track

907
00:33:57,932 --> 00:34:01,252
to produce 5,000 original rides every single year.

908
00:34:01,612 --> 00:34:03,452
And then also like there's like certain deals

909
00:34:03,452 --> 00:34:06,912
like they're gonna give Bob Gurr $200 million

910
00:34:06,912 --> 00:34:08,992
to design a new Skyway.

911
00:34:09,152 --> 00:34:11,772
They're just throwing so much money at Imagineers

912
00:34:11,772 --> 00:34:13,672
and you're like, this doesn't seem sustainable.

913
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:16,232
His best work is clearly behind him.

914
00:34:16,252 --> 00:34:17,672
Why are they even doing this?

915
00:34:18,072 --> 00:34:19,692
But yet Bob is gonna make a lot of money

916
00:34:19,692 --> 00:34:20,692
and we're happy about that.

917
00:34:20,972 --> 00:34:24,252
The Ryan Murphy land is just insanely expensive

918
00:34:24,252 --> 00:34:26,772
but no one has any idea what it's gonna be.

919
00:34:28,292 --> 00:34:29,912
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

920
00:34:29,972 --> 00:34:33,892
They give $2 billion to Barack Obama

921
00:34:33,892 --> 00:34:36,072
and it might just be him sitting in a chair.

922
00:34:36,592 --> 00:34:40,332
Who could forget the beloved walk around the character

923
00:34:40,332 --> 00:34:41,552
for this park?

924
00:34:43,692 --> 00:34:46,692
People dressed like our dear friend of the show,

925
00:34:46,872 --> 00:34:47,492
Mike Mitchell.

926
00:34:47,612 --> 00:34:48,612
For love.

927
00:34:49,112 --> 00:34:49,992
Oh wow, yeah.

928
00:34:50,112 --> 00:34:51,252
His character for love.

929
00:34:51,812 --> 00:34:54,052
The most beloved character on Netflix.

930
00:34:54,372 --> 00:34:55,052
Yes, of course.

931
00:34:56,372 --> 00:34:58,672
Yeah, so you can, and also Joey Tagliano

932
00:34:58,672 --> 00:35:01,452
is a walk around character from Little Camer.

933
00:35:01,592 --> 00:35:02,592
Oh sure, yeah.

934
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,552
Oh man, and if they see each other,

935
00:35:04,592 --> 00:35:05,792
they're gonna do a little interact.

936
00:35:05,792 --> 00:35:07,592
Yeah, they're gonna do a little bit of.

937
00:35:07,592 --> 00:35:11,392
There's so much street-mosphere going on.

938
00:35:12,272 --> 00:35:13,832
Just from the Lillehammer characters.

939
00:35:15,752 --> 00:35:18,652
And when you, and as you exit each ride,

940
00:35:18,832 --> 00:35:22,392
you get to rate it and based on your ratings,

941
00:35:22,392 --> 00:35:25,392
you might see different rides than the other people

942
00:35:25,392 --> 00:35:26,812
you came into the park with.

943
00:35:27,452 --> 00:35:31,192
It's really, it's very metaphysically confusing in that way.

944
00:35:31,532 --> 00:35:35,772
The review feature, your ability to review the movies,

945
00:35:35,772 --> 00:35:38,492
that went to yesterland a long time ago.

946
00:35:38,492 --> 00:35:39,432
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

947
00:35:39,652 --> 00:35:42,632
And on the app, the Netflix theme park app,

948
00:35:42,632 --> 00:35:44,952
you get to say what theme park rides

949
00:35:44,952 --> 00:35:46,892
you're thinking about going on,

950
00:35:46,912 --> 00:35:48,912
but it's weird because even a couple years later,

951
00:35:49,292 --> 00:35:50,792
you haven't gone on any of the rides

952
00:35:50,792 --> 00:35:53,532
and you're not sure why, but they're just sitting in there

953
00:35:53,532 --> 00:35:54,992
and then you're like, well maybe they didn't ever

954
00:35:54,992 --> 00:35:56,492
really wanna do any of these anyway.

955
00:35:57,112 --> 00:35:59,632
Yes, this will be the first theme park in the world

956
00:35:59,632 --> 00:36:02,732
where people spend a lot of time looking at the map.

957
00:36:03,312 --> 00:36:05,752
A lot more than actually enjoying the experience.

958
00:36:07,072 --> 00:36:09,712
Although that might actually, depending on a busy day,

959
00:36:10,232 --> 00:36:12,432
that might be more of a theme perfect

960
00:36:12,432 --> 00:36:14,052
Disney theme park experience.

961
00:36:14,112 --> 00:36:14,992
Well that is true.

962
00:36:14,992 --> 00:36:17,552
Going on five rides and looking at a map most of the day.

963
00:36:17,952 --> 00:36:22,552
Yeah, some people just go on the first 90 seconds of a ride

964
00:36:22,552 --> 00:36:25,412
and then bail, you just jump out of the vehicle.

965
00:36:25,452 --> 00:36:27,532
A lot of people buy tickets to this theme park

966
00:36:27,532 --> 00:36:29,232
and forget about it.

967
00:36:29,552 --> 00:36:30,292
And they just never.

968
00:36:30,792 --> 00:36:33,892
Yeah, they just rely on kind of.

969
00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:35,732
There's like a million, a couple million people

970
00:36:35,892 --> 00:36:39,012
that totally forgot they bought tickets and never used them.

971
00:36:39,532 --> 00:36:40,632
And that's just how this works.

972
00:36:40,892 --> 00:36:42,172
Any ideas for hotels?

973
00:36:45,092 --> 00:36:47,952
Hotel, full house hotel.

974
00:36:48,192 --> 00:36:50,152
Oh maybe that's it, maybe it's an immersive

975
00:36:50,152 --> 00:36:53,872
and you get like the Knott's Hotel

976
00:36:53,872 --> 00:36:55,492
where Snoopy tucks you in.

977
00:36:55,792 --> 00:36:58,092
You get tucked in by a.

978
00:36:58,092 --> 00:36:59,852
An orc from the movie Bright.

979
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:06,532
Do you think that'd be a good eat?

980
00:37:06,732 --> 00:37:08,212
Nah, let's do it as a hotel.

981
00:37:08,932 --> 00:37:11,032
No, no, Bright is a hotel.

982
00:37:13,492 --> 00:37:18,252
Meanwhile, unfortunately after the 39 days in operation,

983
00:37:18,572 --> 00:37:20,412
Cecil land burnt to the ground.

984
00:37:21,892 --> 00:37:23,032
RIP Cecil land.

985
00:37:23,272 --> 00:37:24,372
Poor Cecil land.

986
00:37:26,152 --> 00:37:27,592
Well, look.

987
00:37:27,832 --> 00:37:28,852
It sounds great.

988
00:37:28,972 --> 00:37:29,312
Yeah.

989
00:37:29,312 --> 00:37:31,512
It sounds really good.

990
00:37:31,712 --> 00:37:32,892
So we're gonna need.

991
00:37:33,712 --> 00:37:35,052
Oh, you know, and you know what?

992
00:37:35,092 --> 00:37:37,192
We haven't talked about where to build it.

993
00:37:37,312 --> 00:37:39,332
We're gonna need a lot of land.

994
00:37:39,372 --> 00:37:42,232
We're gonna need so sprawling acres.

995
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:46,012
And obviously it should be built on the former site

996
00:37:46,012 --> 00:37:51,272
of Rajneesh Puram, the cults community in Wild Wild Country.

997
00:37:51,652 --> 00:37:58,392
We will go to the actual former spot of the town.

998
00:38:00,212 --> 00:38:03,292
Cause it gets enough to contain all the dreams

999
00:38:03,292 --> 00:38:05,312
that Netflix land could possibly have.

1000
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:05,552
Of course.

1001
00:38:05,832 --> 00:38:07,972
I'm really though not looking forward

1002
00:38:07,972 --> 00:38:10,592
to the American Vandal themed bathrooms.

1003
00:38:11,692 --> 00:38:17,292
Will there be a statue out front

1004
00:38:17,292 --> 00:38:19,472
of Ted Sarandos and Bojack Horseman?

1005
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:22,792
Oh yeah.

1006
00:38:23,252 --> 00:38:23,772
Walk partners.

1007
00:38:24,192 --> 00:38:26,372
Pointing, walking, whatever.

1008
00:38:26,892 --> 00:38:29,452
And then there's a whole like show

1009
00:38:29,452 --> 00:38:31,672
where Bojack comes to Hollywood.

1010
00:38:31,672 --> 00:38:35,352
It's like a suitcase in a dream,

1011
00:38:35,572 --> 00:38:38,072
a California adventure with Mickey coming out to Hollywood.

1012
00:38:38,712 --> 00:38:42,832
And don't forget in the air, he arrives in an Uber

1013
00:38:42,832 --> 00:38:44,872
a la 2016.

1014
00:38:45,332 --> 00:38:46,272
Yes, right, right, right.

1015
00:38:46,492 --> 00:38:47,912
Bojack gets out of an Uber.

1016
00:38:47,932 --> 00:38:48,332
Right.

1017
00:38:48,452 --> 00:38:49,912
And performs a little music number.

1018
00:38:49,932 --> 00:38:50,352
Sure.

1019
00:38:50,532 --> 00:38:50,932
Yeah.

1020
00:38:51,172 --> 00:38:51,732
This is good.

1021
00:38:51,852 --> 00:38:53,032
I mean, this is all pretty good.

1022
00:38:53,392 --> 00:38:53,732
Yeah.

1023
00:38:54,272 --> 00:38:54,632
Yeah.

1024
00:38:54,772 --> 00:38:57,072
Hey look, I sprung it on you without any,

1025
00:38:57,172 --> 00:38:58,892
we had some real prep time, you know.

1026
00:38:58,892 --> 00:39:01,852
Oh yeah, this would be 10 times better if we had prep.

1027
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,152
Yeah.

1028
00:39:03,152 --> 00:39:06,712
But also, we would have done this for hour.

1029
00:39:06,772 --> 00:39:08,092
We would have lost days.

1030
00:39:08,092 --> 00:39:09,232
Yes, that's true.

1031
00:39:10,712 --> 00:39:12,992
Basically to arrive at almost the same points.

1032
00:39:12,992 --> 00:39:13,932
Exactly the same jokes.

1033
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:16,092
You would have laughed about the same.

1034
00:39:16,092 --> 00:39:17,312
It just might have been.

1035
00:39:17,312 --> 00:39:18,352
There's mild laughter.

1036
00:39:18,972 --> 00:39:20,352
No laughter at all.

1037
00:39:21,572 --> 00:39:22,592
It might have been about the same.

1038
00:39:23,232 --> 00:39:25,952
Less hesitation and at less time

1039
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:27,212
that we spent pulling out our phones

1040
00:39:27,212 --> 00:39:29,292
and looking at what the hell is on Netflix.

1041
00:39:29,592 --> 00:39:30,852
Steven Van Zandt's character name.

1042
00:39:32,932 --> 00:39:35,152
Well, I'm all for it.

1043
00:39:35,312 --> 00:39:40,092
Let's get up to rural Oregon and get this thing,

1044
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:43,392
kick out that kids camp that's now where the cult used to be.

1045
00:39:43,712 --> 00:39:43,992
Yeah.

1046
00:39:44,352 --> 00:39:46,272
I mean, they're gonna need a lot of land

1047
00:39:46,272 --> 00:39:50,992
because Hulu land will be coming, you know, a while after.

1048
00:39:50,992 --> 00:39:52,632
Like a while, while after.

1049
00:39:53,872 --> 00:39:54,832
Yeah.

1050
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:56,952
But Hulu land is mainly,

1051
00:39:57,352 --> 00:39:59,452
there's just a TV playing old Seinfeld.

1052
00:40:00,052 --> 00:40:02,012
That's really what sustains Hulu land.

1053
00:40:02,272 --> 00:40:02,472
Yeah.

1054
00:40:03,132 --> 00:40:05,712
So there'll be a whole Seinfeld land then.

1055
00:40:05,992 --> 00:40:06,592
Yeah.

1056
00:40:06,592 --> 00:40:07,652
That's most of it.

1057
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:10,532
Oh yeah, well, I mean, if you start thinking about Hulu land,

1058
00:40:10,652 --> 00:40:14,392
you had to include most of filmed entertainment.

1059
00:40:17,712 --> 00:40:20,632
Well, let's get breaking ground.

1060
00:40:21,192 --> 00:40:23,052
That was an excellent question.

1061
00:40:23,392 --> 00:40:26,912
And legitimately, like,

1062
00:40:27,152 --> 00:40:30,332
if they are the biggest media company in the world.

1063
00:40:30,692 --> 00:40:31,332
Why not?

1064
00:40:31,692 --> 00:40:32,212
Yeah.

1065
00:40:32,772 --> 00:40:33,112
Sure.

1066
00:40:33,232 --> 00:40:35,692
That's what all the other biggest ones have done.

1067
00:40:35,972 --> 00:40:36,852
Warner Brothers was opening,

1068
00:40:36,972 --> 00:40:39,012
it was putting like scare mazes on the lot,

1069
00:40:39,532 --> 00:40:41,192
on their lot in Burbank.

1070
00:40:41,332 --> 00:40:42,132
Yeah, that's crazy.

1071
00:40:42,252 --> 00:40:44,372
Like full Arkham Asylum, full It-Hat.

1072
00:40:44,592 --> 00:40:45,972
So like, let's do it.

1073
00:40:45,972 --> 00:40:46,012
Wait, really?

1074
00:40:46,132 --> 00:40:47,932
Yeah, there's a full Arkham Asylum,

1075
00:40:48,172 --> 00:40:49,992
which this will come out after Halloween,

1076
00:40:50,032 --> 00:40:51,472
but there's a full Arkham Asylum

1077
00:40:51,472 --> 00:40:53,612
that you can go to the Warner Brothers and do.

1078
00:40:53,612 --> 00:40:54,552
I didn't know about this.

1079
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:56,332
There's like, they're turning Warner Brothers lot

1080
00:40:56,332 --> 00:40:57,892
into like Halloween horror nights.

1081
00:40:58,152 --> 00:40:58,412
Wow.

1082
00:40:58,432 --> 00:40:59,692
Yeah, that's really cool.

1083
00:40:59,912 --> 00:41:00,652
And the walkthrough,

1084
00:41:00,732 --> 00:41:01,512
the walkthrough is fun.

1085
00:41:01,532 --> 00:41:03,572
Like there's actors playing all the Batman villains.

1086
00:41:04,312 --> 00:41:06,312
What's funny is the Batman villains all have to act

1087
00:41:06,312 --> 00:41:08,272
sort of as the line keepers too.

1088
00:41:08,752 --> 00:41:10,412
So like Joker's like, hello there,

1089
00:41:10,772 --> 00:41:12,372
but whoa, hold on a second.

1090
00:41:12,372 --> 00:41:16,352
Just let these people go by first and then you stay here.

1091
00:41:16,452 --> 00:41:17,632
And then, but you're like, oh,

1092
00:41:17,632 --> 00:41:20,232
but Joker seems really concerned with the flow of the crowd.

1093
00:41:20,392 --> 00:41:21,732
How many in your party?

1094
00:41:22,492 --> 00:41:24,612
A devious amount, four.

1095
00:41:25,572 --> 00:41:27,412
But that's, yeah, let's do it.

1096
00:41:27,412 --> 00:41:28,492
Everybody should do it.

1097
00:41:28,632 --> 00:41:29,052
Yeah.

1098
00:41:29,272 --> 00:41:31,732
Open up that fucking Netflix building.

1099
00:41:31,892 --> 00:41:33,932
Let's have some scare mazes in there at least.

1100
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:36,832
They just, well, they just bought the rest of the building.

1101
00:41:37,112 --> 00:41:39,792
It's a 10 story building and only some of it was Netflix

1102
00:41:39,792 --> 00:41:40,812
and now it's all of them.

1103
00:41:40,812 --> 00:41:44,192
And I want the rest of it to be an indoor themed experience.

1104
00:41:44,212 --> 00:41:45,372
Like Sid and Marty Croft.

1105
00:41:45,612 --> 00:41:47,972
Yeah, all of us in Marty Croft or Disney Quest.

1106
00:41:48,212 --> 00:41:50,992
That Netflix building that you can see in Hollywood now

1107
00:41:50,992 --> 00:41:54,812
on Sunset Boulevard is built on studio land

1108
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:56,392
that has been there for decades.

1109
00:41:56,432 --> 00:41:58,512
So there is probably real ghosts.

1110
00:41:58,512 --> 00:41:59,932
So you're halfway there.

1111
00:42:00,372 --> 00:42:01,332
You think there's ghosts?

1112
00:42:01,632 --> 00:42:02,792
You think there's ghost Hollywood ghosts?

1113
00:42:02,792 --> 00:42:04,832
It's adjacent to Sunset Gower, isn't it?

1114
00:42:04,872 --> 00:42:07,092
And a lot of people have died at Sunset Gower.

1115
00:42:07,512 --> 00:42:08,032
I mean, I think.

1116
00:42:08,212 --> 00:42:09,712
Where was William Frawley's apartment?

1117
00:42:11,772 --> 00:42:13,272
William Frawley's from I Love Lucy.

1118
00:42:14,172 --> 00:42:15,212
Ted Sarandos' office.

1119
00:42:15,212 --> 00:42:16,952
Oh, God, I was just reading about that hotel.

1120
00:42:18,192 --> 00:42:22,232
I would love to do a highly themed William Frawley's ghost maze

1121
00:42:22,232 --> 00:42:23,812
in the Netflix building.

1122
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:25,152
What was that hotel called?

1123
00:42:25,692 --> 00:42:27,812
That's Fred Merch from I Love Lucy, Kids.

1124
00:42:28,092 --> 00:42:29,492
It was a show from 70 years ago.

1125
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,952
Hey, get out of my apartment.

1126
00:42:32,672 --> 00:42:35,172
Telly wasn't esoteric enough.

1127
00:42:35,372 --> 00:42:36,972
We had to get into Frawley.

1128
00:42:36,972 --> 00:42:39,152
People know Fred Merch.

1129
00:42:39,632 --> 00:42:42,132
Yeah, more than Telly Savalas.

1130
00:42:42,952 --> 00:42:45,692
But people might not know that his name is William Frawley.

1131
00:42:45,712 --> 00:42:51,012
But I'm sure Fred from I Love Lucy is still sort of known to people over

1132
00:42:51,012 --> 00:42:54,632
28. He's known to people because he's haunting them.

1133
00:42:55,332 --> 00:42:56,632
Yeah. Yeah.

1134
00:42:56,972 --> 00:42:59,152
Get out of my place, you ragamuffin.

1135
00:42:59,212 --> 00:43:00,752
He died in his studio apartment.

1136
00:43:02,452 --> 00:43:04,172
I know he died in the street.

1137
00:43:04,652 --> 00:43:04,752
He died outside.

1138
00:43:04,912 --> 00:43:06,012
But he wasn't in the street, right?

1139
00:43:06,272 --> 00:43:07,652
Sorry. It was like a hotel.

1140
00:43:07,652 --> 00:43:10,252
It was a hotel a lot of people would stay at.

1141
00:43:10,372 --> 00:43:13,412
I thought it was more of a flop house, but it was a place people would live.

1142
00:43:13,752 --> 00:43:17,392
I hear his ghost and Vivian Vance's ghost do not get along.

1143
00:43:17,692 --> 00:43:20,232
Absolutely not. Don't put them in the same.

1144
00:43:20,232 --> 00:43:22,272
They go to opposite sides of heaven.

1145
00:43:23,572 --> 00:43:26,132
Well, great question. Great questions.

1146
00:43:26,772 --> 00:43:30,752
And with that podcast, the podcast is closed.

1147
00:43:31,492 --> 00:43:33,032
Get out of here.

1148
00:43:33,172 --> 00:43:35,892
You're not willing for all these ghosts chasing you out of the post office.

1149
00:43:35,892 --> 00:43:38,832
He's the postmaster, the ghost postmaster.

1150
00:43:39,432 --> 00:43:41,252
A ghost master needs to sleep.

1151
00:43:42,012 --> 00:43:43,152
The ghost master.

1152
00:43:44,272 --> 00:43:50,392
So be aware if you send a question to us at podcasttherideatgmail.com

1153
00:43:50,392 --> 00:43:54,372
and we don't answer it, it could be because the ghost postmaster,

1154
00:43:54,532 --> 00:43:56,812
William Frawley, didn't deliver the letter to us.

1155
00:43:56,872 --> 00:43:57,852
Yeah. And blame him.

1156
00:43:58,012 --> 00:43:59,492
Blame him. It's his fault.

1157
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:00,532
He's a grouch.

1158
00:44:00,812 --> 00:44:03,972
Yeah. But keep those letters coming.

1159
00:44:04,312 --> 00:44:05,652
That's a lot of fun.

1160
00:44:06,772 --> 00:44:08,452
Yeah. And we'll do we'll do more of this soon.

1161
00:44:08,452 --> 00:44:11,172
Later. Goodbye. Bye.
