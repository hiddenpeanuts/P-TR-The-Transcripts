00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
Warning, the following podcast may contain buffaloes forced to live in a brittle French field,

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:12,480
a sports bar called Sports Bar, and a Disney hostess named CJ who seems to be your dad's favorite.

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,760
Finally, what you've all been asking for, two hours of complaints about the weird mall outside

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:32,320
of Disneyland Paris with guest Julia Prescott. Bonjour, it's Podcast the Ride.

5
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:49,280
Hey, welcome to Podcast the Ride, where we know the only real way to solve the crisis in Syria

6
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,280
is to send an intergalactic space captain to dance at Assad and unlock his inner beauty.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,680
Right? Agreed? Yeah, we agree with that. Desperate times call for desperate measures,

8
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,440
and that's the only way to really change the world, as it were. As long as he has sidekicks,

9
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,280
though, that are adorable and you can make plush out of them. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. A band of

10
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,280
misfits. And a literal band as well. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the only way to really solve a crisis.

11
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:25,360
You think me beautiful? Yes, Mr. Assad, but without a key to unlock it. We're not going to,

12
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,240
Phil, if you don't know what we're talking about, sorry. Yeah, this is the gate behind

13
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:38,240
which you should stay. Yeah, if you don't get the reference, then you're out. We're all people who

14
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,840
understand these these references. I'm Scott Gardner. I'm one of them. And joined as always

15
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,600
by Mike Carlson. Hey there. And Jason Sheridan. Hi, I was trying to figure out the one to one

16
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:56,480
of like Hooter to John Bolton or like, hmm, which one is Michael Flynn and Michael Flynn Jr.

17
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:02,720
I guess they would be the ball, I guess. Yeah, is Michael Flynn Fuzzball? I think John Bolton is the

18
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:09,680
give her the gift. I think he's that guy. He appears to be a hologram to sort of keep him on

19
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:17,760
track. Yeah. Which one is Doug Benson? Oh, yeah. Benson is the same character. Oh, great. Fantastic.

20
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,240
He plays the exact same role in this crisis that he didn't kept. Yeah. Yeah. He's like a hundredth

21
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:32,160
guard at Assad's Where Does He Live compound? I don't know. And yeah, he gets turned into like

22
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,560
a into a bright red wearing break dancer. That's how this is going to play out once we get on board

23
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:45,200
with this plan. Anyway, hey, well, joining us today also also clearly a mega theme partner and

24
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:51,840
one of the first real friends of the show. You were very supportive right away and I really appreciate

25
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,520
it. She is a writer and comedian and one of the hosts of the podcast. Everything's Coming Up

26
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:02,240
Simpsons. It's Julia Prescott. Hey. Hi. Hi. Thanks so much for having me. Absolutely. So excited.

27
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:10,080
I'm so pumped. I was looking forward to this all day. Oh, good. That's fine. Yeah, because I think

28
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,440
when I saw like the moment you guys announced that you were on Feral, because we all used to be on

29
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:21,600
the same podcast network. Yes. Remember tweeting something like I'm angry I didn't do this myself

30
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:28,000
for I found something so relevant to my interests. You know, it makes me upset. Yeah, that would have

31
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:36,000
been the other topic given things you're obsessed with. Yeah. But yeah, I've listened to the podcast

32
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,200
a bunch. And so yeah, all day today, I was like, Hi, you know, how's this episode going to start?

33
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,800
They're probably gonna ask me like what my personal history at Disneyland and like going through like

34
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:50,560
the general. I was like, what am I doing? I gotta stop. That's a question I have if I've in the rare

35
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,640
event I'm on other podcasts like how much should I know or should I just or will I speak to rehearsed

36
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:04,720
if I chose the wrong tact on doughboys, which is because I listened to it a ton and I studied it

37
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:10,960
too hard and I was very stiff. I've been analyzing my doughboys appearance ever since. I think you're

38
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,200
the same way. Correct? Yeah. Well, I thought there was a couple things I don't even remember them,

39
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,040
which is good. So let's not bring it up. But there were a couple things on that episode that I did

40
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,640
where I was just like, you're an idiot. I can't believe you did that. And then like, I was like,

41
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,160
people are going to think you're stupid. I thought your episode was great. Well, thank you. I

42
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,720
appreciate that. It wasn't fishing for compliments. Scott just brought this up. I have a very specific

43
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,840
memory attached to your episode. Wow, really? Yeah. Because another big fan of doughboys,

44
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:42,080
I was saying off podcast OP before we started recording that I feel like my Simpsons podcast

45
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,880
and this podcast and the doughboys all kind of exist in the same shared universe of podcasting.

46
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,240
We all used to be on Feral too. So that's all true. And it's all about like, uh, uh,

47
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:59,920
silliness and kind of like obsession super high art pretentious stuff. It's about a rapturous

48
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:04,880
love of, uh, of silliness. I think. Yeah. I like the idea of the shared podcast universe

49
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,520
and we could all come together. There was an idea to bring together all the podcast. Sorry,

50
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:17,040
that's the Sam Jackson Marvel Avengers speech I was about to give. So I was going to say that I

51
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:23,040
listened to, um, your episode of doughboys, uh, when my husband and I, we went to Costa Rica,

52
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:28,320
uh, for like one year dating anniversary. And I just remember, uh, driving the winding roads

53
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,280
of Costa Rica, listening to your Margaritaville episode. That is like kind of perfect, isn't it?

54
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:40,800
Yeah. Yeah. I was there in my mind and I was also there presently in the jungle environment.

55
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,560
Well, thank you. Uh, but yeah,

56
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,520
Cool breeze and palm trees and that been a dry description of fake cool breeze and palm,

57
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,160
fake palm trees. And I do love that Orlando Margaritaville. It's wonderful. Yeah.

58
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,360
It's what we'll do a whole episode on it soon. I haven't been actually. Oh my gosh. I haven't,

59
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,040
I haven't done an Orlando since we started doing this. And at what point is it irresponsible for

60
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:08,560
me to be presenting as a, right? You have to go without, I haven't you gone like three times

61
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,880
since I have been to Orlando in the last year twice. Uh, I have the premier pass, which means

62
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,800
I can get into the Orlando park anytime for a year until September. Will I go again? Maybe,

63
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,360
maybe. I don't know possible. It's cheap. It makes sense. It does make it. Look,

64
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:32,640
it makes a ton of sense for me to constantly go to Florida. I went in 2008, I think in 2010. And I,

65
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,880
I didn't think it was that cheap, but maybe there's a, I mean, you gotta look, I, as everyone knows

66
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,520
on this podcast, I love to check. I'm a checker. I'm a checker too. So I love to check. I check

67
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,400
every day. Yeah. I check for playing like stuff goes down, stuff goes up, but what are your sites?

68
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,920
Oh, uh, what are your sites? Who are your guys? Who are you guys? I mean, I have a deal.

69
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:59,680
I have a pretty good Michael. Yeah, we're good, Mark. I just had a big problem with you back at

70
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:07,840
the comedy store. What is, what is Lauren thinking? Lauren, but is it, is it is our Lauren Michael

71
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,880
Eisner? Yes, I think he's, yeah. Yeah, I would say so. Yeah, probably. Well, let's start talking

72
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:21,200
about it. Then I don't know. I don't know. I think I care about, uh, uh, Eisner more than Iger. Yes.

73
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,640
I'm, I would like to talk to Isner. I'll look, I'll happily have Bob Iger on the show. If it came

74
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:31,120
to that. Right. Right. Right. If he's, you know, not doing a million things. If he doesn't,

75
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,560
boy, you're right down the road. Pop right down. I'll then make a lot of directions directly.

76
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,920
Jason, this is a secret place that no one needs to know about. Uh, I like the website. I go to just

77
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:49,920
the basic stuff. I have Expedia. I have stuff like that. I do have a thing called, um, I forget,

78
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:56,240
it's called like cheap flying or something and it's a Twitter. And basically I have it sent to my

79
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:05,120
phone. The alerts. So I'll get like LA to Columbia is on sale for $195. I get those alerts too through

80
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,360
we don't, this doesn't have to be the podcast episode, but we're just talking about travel

81
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,680
websites. Airfare watchdog, stuff like that. Yes. Yes. I go on that. Yeah. As well. Uh, so yes,

82
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,640
I love to check. I love to check, uh, everything. So yeah, you can get it still a pretty good.

83
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:25,760
I got my, I think my last flight was one way was 89 bucks and the other way was 130 or something.

84
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,200
So you can look, there are deals. I'm actually going to Orlando in September.

85
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:36,880
I feel like this podcast probably played a, sure. Yeah. And making those plans. Cause you, you, I

86
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,480
remember message you message saying, is this a good time to go? And I said, yeah, that food festival

87
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,640
will be going on and the crowds will be probably down because people are back in school, back at

88
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:52,720
work sort of thing. But like buy a few travel insurances because of hurricanes. I missed the

89
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:59,120
hurricane last year by like four or five days. Really? Yeah. Yeah. I read, I got deep into this

90
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,320
internet rabbit hole of like reading a bunch of dad blogs that are based on like, like centering

91
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,360
on Disney world. I think one's just called like dad's rules. Um, dot com or something. And it was

92
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,160
like, gotta go. Hey guys, here are my top five weeks to go to Disney world. And like one of them

93
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,080
was like the last week of September. So that's when we're going. That's probably a good time.

94
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,760
I never thought about dad blogs. I mean, I know there's a huge Disney has a huge network of mom

95
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:29,520
blog, like mom blog affiliates and stuff. And where you find out where all the best place to

96
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:36,800
have a cold beer is. Get a break from your, your damn old lady and kids. That's what I'm into.

97
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,880
Shows that are live shows that are hosted by cute gals and skimpy outfit. That's what I recall about

98
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:50,240
my dad, who was kind of uninvested in Disney world until we saw the show that was, it was in Mickey

99
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:56,640
star land. And it was a show where all the Disney afternoon characters, uh, came to life and perform

100
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:03,520
and it's hosted by kind of a perky girl named CJ. I remember my dad talking about CJ a lot. I assume

101
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:11,680
it was always a different CJ. Uh, that was the uniform. Yeah. Yeah. For days. That's C J. It was

102
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,880
you want to, you want to, uh, Scott, you want to see that show again? I like that CJ.

103
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:23,040
If my dad, a little bit of eye candy, that was also Disney's first use of using a computer

104
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:29,360
algorithm to come up with like, what is the name for a cool host computer and a man or a woman

105
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,880
could slot in a relatable name that is not specific to any particular race. I don't think that I'm,

106
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,800
I don't think I'm the only one who knows this, but I think that's the name of Pamela Anderson's

107
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,240
character on Baywatch. I think you're correct. So I, so I feel like maybe that's was on purpose

108
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:52,800
because you would associate another favorite of dads. Yeah. Presumably. And she's also very like

109
00:10:52,800 --> 00:11:00,960
classic, like short blonde, like base definition of lay of cute gal, as my dad would say.

110
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:08,160
It's like a 1992 is fuck name though. Yes. Oh yeah. Yeah. It feels like she could have also

111
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:14,480
been like your camp counselor. Yeah. Oh, sure. She's the gal next door, but she's also beautiful.

112
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,800
Like there's a whole, you know, she's not, she's not too, like she's not too aggressive,

113
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:27,600
but she's like the bright ball of porridge. I don't know. That was a wreath. That's something

114
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,120
that's where, that's where you and Lindsay, uh, really sealed the deals when you were brave enough

115
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:39,280
to call her the right bowl of board. I think that's a new level. My husband is yet to say

116
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:45,120
that about me. Am I in trouble? Should I? I want to say it. Standard of relationship.

117
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,440
He's looking at the dad blogs a lot. It's like trick gets closer and closer. He keeps looking at

118
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:58,000
like quiet places to hide. That's a tag on these blogs. That would probably be relevant to his

119
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,360
interest because he's not as obsessed as I am. Yeah. Oh, do you, well, cause this is sort of,

120
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:09,280
although I don't know. I also, I never mean to present the, uh, the image on, on the show that

121
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:14,400
Aaron or Lindsay is less into this stuff than it is just mathematically. They just are because we

122
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,760
sort of, uh, ascend the heights, but they're pretty big Disney people as well, but not quite,

123
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:26,400
but is it a sort of a similar ratio like into it, but like there's a, there's a wall, a ceiling.

124
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:34,080
Yeah. Well, he also, um, grew up in Cincinnati and so, uh, you know, there's, I think they have,

125
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:39,760
I forget what theme park they have out there. Kings Island episode of that has not not come out

126
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:47,760
yet, but we, we talked about that place. In the spatial, in the space and time we're recording

127
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:54,720
it, it hasn't, but in you, the listeners timeline, I, I haven't a clue. It's a surprise. I'll probably

128
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,600
cut this out. It's worth, you know what? The moment you say that on a podcast, you won't,

129
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,000
you won't. Yeah. You know how, where you watch your Conan's and your Letterman's, you know,

130
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,440
you gotta leave, leave it in the magic like this. Cause when you say I'm going to cut that out,

131
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,840
the listeners hearing you say that and they're going, Ooh, this was almost, I don't know.

132
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,880
You're saying, yeah, they feel like they got a treat. Yeah. Let's dissect the art of podcasting.

133
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:27,680
It is an art, a high art. Oh, absolutely. That we're very careful about and very committed to. Yeah.

134
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:33,360
There's so much fun stuff. Like, do you, do you acknowledge the animal walking by in the room?

135
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,360
Do you acknowledge the fire truck going by outside the studio? It's lesser podcast. What I would say

136
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,080
you think that at a certain point you just keep rolling and ignore. You have to stay focused.

137
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:50,640
Mm hmm. We haven't had the podcast sort of coming of age where we record a whole episode

138
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:55,520
and it gets lost. And then we spend 15 minutes at the top of another episode talking about it,

139
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:01,760
getting lost. Oh, and maybe like being with the guest again and acknowledging that we're doing

140
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:08,560
this for the second time. Deja vu for us. This will be us. Hopefully not. Yeah. I should curse

141
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,080
this episode and say, we're going to, what a bad thing to have you as a guest and say, we're going

142
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,280
to lose your episode. But I'm going to say right now, if this episode does get lost and I have to

143
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:21,280
come back, what a joy. Okay. Good. It's like a private show basically. It's like a bonus. Yeah.

144
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:27,600
Well, what I was saying is for my husband, Mike, yeah, he grew up in Cincinnati and only had Kings

145
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,880
Island. And I think actually used to work. He's an artist and he works in animation. So he used to

146
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:39,120
be a caricature artist. That was like his first summer job as a teenager there, I think. But he

147
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,480
like didn't make a lot of trips out to go to Disneyland when he was growing up. And I grew up

148
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:51,360
in LA. So I think, and my mom's also worked at Disney since I was two. So I think that may have

149
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,800
affected it, but I'm not sure if that's like the root of my obsession or proximity as opposed to,

150
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,760
because I could see it going the other way where I'm nowhere near a Disney park. And I, I dream

151
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,160
about going to one one day and I got the taste of it now. I'm obsessed, but I got, yeah, you're right.

152
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:12,640
Maybe proximity makes a lot of sense. Yeah. But he's open. Like it's not that I've, I have dragged

153
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:21,040
him to a couple of parks now. And it's not that he hates it when we go, but it would never cross

154
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:27,600
his mind. Like we went to Tokyo and that was, you know, like a real like, let's do this first,

155
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,480
you know, kind of thing for me. And that probably would not have been on his list. Oh, sure. Oh,

156
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:38,240
we skipped it entirely. Interesting. Oh, did he like it? Glad he did. He didn't tear up like I did

157
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:44,800
when I saw Tokyo Disney sea. And then said to him, it's weird. It's just weird to see something.

158
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,800
I've Googled so many times in the flesh that that was my quote to him in that moment.

159
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:55,600
Yeah. I know some of these places I've looked at on just Google street view and just a moment

160
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:01,840
with this was my view in real life. You just drive in that Google street view. Like this is such a

161
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:09,040
perfect setup to today's topic. This is true. Yes. You've looked at pictures and you long to go.

162
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:18,880
And you too, Scott and Julia have seen this in, in person or lay person. That's about the extent

163
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,840
of my French. Yeah. Thank you for being on. Did you study up before you went? Oh God, no.

164
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:31,040
We pretended we were going to learn some as soon as you're in an actual transactional situation.

165
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:37,120
You've a, you bail. Yeah. Well, I actually, so I started planning this trip late last year and then

166
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:43,520
my work picked up and I was actually in the process of canceling it. And then like canceled

167
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:51,360
everything except for the flights. And then I got laid off. Oh no. Like the day I was going to

168
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:57,440
cancel the flights. Like that was my lunch break task. And then I got laid off like that morning

169
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,480
at 11 and was like, all right, trips back on. Oh, Hey, yeah. It was happening in a couple of weeks.

170
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,280
So it was one of those weird instances I've never experienced where I didn't have the months of

171
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,680
anticipation of this trip. I had like put it out of my mind and then all of a sudden it was back on.

172
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,920
So it was kind of a scramble within a couple of weeks to like get my mind wrapped around it.

173
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:20,960
How weird. And so I was like furiously dueling going. And the only thing I learned was like,

174
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:26,880
I am a woman and you're a man. Like that never came in handy. So why would you have had to

175
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,600
clarify that? But if anyone asked, I could say just we love them. And that would get me around,

176
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:38,640
you know, so no numbers seems to help. Although also in many situations, the numbers are printed

177
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,360
in front of you and they aren't, uh, those aren't different. The numerals are not different in foreign

178
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,320
countries. So I felt like I tried a little bit harder in Japan. And this time around, I was like,

179
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:55,280
ah, you guys know, you know, come on, look at me. So yeah, just help me. And yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

180
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,080
We hit those moments very quickly and you're at look, come on. I, we all know what this is.

181
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,520
Cut to the chase. Um, but anyway, yeah. So, uh, I mean, I'm, and I'm sure, uh, there are,

182
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,960
there are a ton of theme park topics that we, we, uh, could be discussing with you, but we, uh, uh,

183
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:18,080
I was happy you took us up on this because, uh, yes, fresh from a trip to, uh, Disney Paris,

184
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:25,600
which I did on my honeymoon a couple of years ago. And I, I felt kind of scarred ever since. Yeah.

185
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:32,000
And I wasn't sure. We, we, uh, uh, DMed a little bit about advice about various things. And then

186
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,800
the morning you were there, you tweeted us this photo of, uh, the, the main, the, uh, Mickey and

187
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:43,440
Donald and goofy. And I forget if it was all of them, but Donald, at least to these very bizarre

188
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:49,360
dilated eyes. Um, and this, and this is at, by the way, this, that was, I believe at the Disney store

189
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:55,520
at the Disney village, Paris, which is what this episode is about. Um, but I was, I was wondering

190
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:02,720
from that bizarre, I was like, Oh, I wonder if she is having the same experience of oddity as I did

191
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,600
at this place. A hundred percent. Well, first of all, the Disney store in Disney village is like

192
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:16,160
one of, I want to say 12 Disney stores in that area. Most of the shops are just, uh, only slightly

193
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,600
different ticks away from each other. And they're all given like a different name. Like this one's

194
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,600
like the Disney boutique, but this one's like the Disney store proper. This one's Disney world,

195
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:29,040
you know, it's just like gallery, the world of Disney. The Wikipedia list of shops was very

196
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,800
weird. I mean, the restaurant, I feel like restaurants are going to be a big part of this

197
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:39,360
episode. Uh, but like just reading the shop, I was like, there's only like six stores and everyone

198
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:45,120
has like Disney. Like there's not like, I mean, I know it's France and tastes are different,

199
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:53,120
but I'm like, there's no like flip-flop shop or Crocs or even like a newsstand or a bookstore

200
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:59,200
or something or fridge magnets. No stock market. Yeah. It was really bizarre. I mean, the first

201
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:05,440
thing that you see when you walk in is, uh, the giant planet Hollywood. Yeah. And I'm sure I'm

202
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,960
not the first person to think this upon seeing it, but this is still around. I would have thought

203
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,560
that they went bankrupt several years ago. I felt like that was the rumor in and out several times.

204
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:26,320
Apparently. Yeah. But there's still a few hanging on. Orlando Vegas, uh, Orlando Vegas, time square.

205
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:32,080
I think there's an another few. There's six on the planet earth. There was one at Niagara falls

206
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,720
that I saw, but I think that one now is gone. Does it look, do they all, cause this one, I was,

207
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,760
when I was looking at the YouTube video, this planet Hollywood looks like this, like it did

208
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:47,280
when it opened. It's a giant. It's the globe. You take like an escalator in or it's a walkway.

209
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,600
I'm not even sure. This is what the Orlando one looked like until about two years ago.

210
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,840
Two years ago. Yo, it is. It's been that recent. They would have looked like that. I mean,

211
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,920
they turned it into like an observatory for Disney Springs. Believe me, I've been to Orlando many

212
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,600
times in the last year. So I've seen the observatory version of the planet Hollywood. I was just

213
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,520
wondering, do they all look like this other than that observatory? Do we know? Oh, the time square

214
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:16,560
one is like built into an office. The sky scraper. As is, um, the Vegas one used to be in the Caesar's

215
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:23,840
palace mall with the fake sky, right? Where it's a cloud covered ceiling. Yeah. Yes. And I, I feel

216
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,120
like I went to that one, but now it's in a more boring part of the same mall and it's just, and

217
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:35,920
it's just kind of a very bland pseudo hip design. So it's all over the map in terms of its branding,

218
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,040
which is a summoning a Marcus Marcus, Lamonis, the prophet to me right now.

219
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:47,280
Oh, another obsession. Julie and I have talked about it a lot lately. That was a bright day for me when I

220
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:52,320
realized not only do we have the theme park thing, but also the prophet, which I feel like no one else.

221
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,480
Yeah. No one else that I know in real life. I mean, we're in real life, but you know,

222
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,560
when you said no one else, you kind of pointed in the direction of Mike,

223
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:06,320
shoving you back into the corner who didn't even know what you were talking about. When you guys

224
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:13,760
started mentioning the show for listeners who don't know the prophet is a, a CNBC original CNBC show

225
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:20,320
where a guy named Marcus Lamonis, who was like an investor and like, I think the head of the company

226
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:25,520
camping world and a million other companies, famous camping world helps struggling businesses.

227
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,720
It's sort of like bar rescue. My joke that I, I, I bet to tweet out, like you forget, is that a,

228
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:36,640
a bar rescue in the morning to wake you up profit in the evening to cool down because the profits

229
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:42,400
pretty chill. Uh, Marcus only doesn't yell that, but he's pretty nice. He gets frustrated,

230
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:48,400
but he's not screaming at people and throwing stuff like John Taffer is or it's or the hell's

231
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,520
kitchen or what he's not one of these kitchen Ramsey. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's not a yeller.

232
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:58,160
He's just such a genuine guy. That's what you get with. He's a genuine guy. Any episode where he's

233
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:02,320
helping a candy company or an ice cream company, he's just, he's just loves it. Cause he's just

234
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,120
like, I always wanted to have a candy store growing up and since I was young, I've been a candy man.

235
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:17,200
He's got, that's my favorite. So great. And like wooden and incredibly stiff reality show moment

236
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,640
where he's describing something that happened as if it was that day, but he's not able to do it

237
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:28,880
casually like somebody on big brother. So it has this stilted quality, but Scott Gardner has come

238
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,520
to love. He gets more and more comfortable on camera over four seasons. You could see him get

239
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,760
more and more comfortable and you can see them hire a stylist gets it goes from a lot of khakis

240
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:45,440
and button ups to like calm diggers on a uniform. I feel like I've seen him wear the same outfit,

241
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,640
like across seven episodes in a row where it's like the white button down or white polo, sorry.

242
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:56,800
And he's got these dad jeans and this very like thick belt that's just like holding it up and

243
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:02,400
he's like walking into businesses and giving them, you know, a tough time. But they changed the,

244
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,480
the opening credits at one point where he was just in like a normal suit. And more recently,

245
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:12,720
he's been in aviators and like a military jacket with like a bomber jacket. So he's like a one man

246
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,680
shark tank. Yeah. He's like a one man shark tank. And you actually see the stuff happen,

247
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:22,080
which I suspect that a lot of those sharks don't ever go to the place. How could they?

248
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:27,040
The cameras are on. How could they? They're all, they buy new businesses every single episode.

249
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:33,680
Yeah. Seven an episode. Right. Right. Good Lord. Which Marcus buys a lot, but he'll, he'll bail on

250
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:39,680
them too. Which when you realize there's only seven minutes to go and it's a bail episode.

251
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,920
And you're usually so happy for him because he's leaving a real hornet's nest. I love it.

252
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:49,760
Some of them, I suspect he had no intention of continuing to stick around. Uh, like the one

253
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:55,280
that got very dramatic with where it was a marshmallow company that shared space with a

254
00:24:55,280 --> 00:25:00,320
garlic and spice compass. So like all of the marshmallows started smelling like garlic.

255
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:07,840
Stupid manufacturing problem. There's a lot more con artists on the profit than bar rescue and

256
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,960
stuff. Like there's a lot to bring, to connect it back to the theme parks. There is a popcorn

257
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,320
episode about a company called planet popcorn. Uh, I still haven't done that one. They have a

258
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:24,240
contract and I don't know if it's still there, but they were, they had a stand in downtown Disney

259
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:31,280
and then they would sell a carnival and stuff. Yeah. And, and the, there is like hundreds of

260
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:35,520
thousands of dollars. They re they bring in a forensic accountant and realize there's hundreds

261
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,840
of thousand dollars missing from the books and like looking around the office. There's just like

262
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:47,280
loose stacks of cash and stuff. And like there's the person is clearly trying to pull a fast one

263
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:51,200
on him because like they go to like a couple storefronts and he's like, I think this would

264
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,960
be a great storefront sell popcorn. She's like, I don't know. It's a little chintzy. This is

265
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,680
storefront I picked out. He's like, this area is no foot traffic. And she goes, and this is where I

266
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:05,040
tell you, I didn't mean this isn't for popcorn. I want this to be a crepery. And he's like,

267
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:10,400
we're back on the crepes thing. Like this is a thing in the whole episode where it's a popcorn

268
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:15,840
company that also, and the woman also wants to sell crepes. And he's like, okay, we're not doing

269
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:22,080
crepes because it's not making any money. And she's just like, well, what if we kept selling crepes?

270
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:29,600
And it takes place in orange County too, in California. So we have to do that side podcast.

271
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,280
We'll do it. Well, yeah, we do the broadcast. Jason, do you like the show? Cause it sounds like

272
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:40,080
all he does is rescue businesses that have treats. I mean, there's a heavy treat presence and I do

273
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,800
like it, but there's clothes. And the treat ones tend to be the best ones. And do I just think that because it's

274
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:50,240
fun to look at treats? Yeah, I don't know. Also, Farrell's was a lot of fun and the sweet Pete's was a

275
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:56,720
lot of sweet Pete, a recurring character now in many episodes of fan favorite. The great success stories.

276
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:02,720
Yeah. What about the one where it was that 11 year old kid making cookies? That was like Mr.

277
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:08,720
Theos or something. Mr. Corey's cookies. Mr. Corey's. Yeah. Jason was moved by an episode about cookies.

278
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:15,440
Surprise, surprise. Surprise, surprise. About a little boy achieving his cookie dreams. The only way Jason can show

279
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:24,560
him emotion. Anyway, I think the point is that Marcus Lemonas would have some things to say about

280
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:32,640
planet Hollywood. He would. Six restaurants, none of them look the same. Is it a hotel chain or is it a restaurant?

281
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:39,440
Or do you sell board games because there was a planet Hollywood board game which looks like the little globe.

282
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:46,640
Oh, that's actually pretty cool. I kind of like that. I have that. Really? Yeah, I have that. Did this come up in an episode before?

283
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:53,040
I didn't realize that's what it was, but I do have that game back in Illinois. That splits apart. Yep. You take off the cards in it, right?

284
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:58,480
Yes. And the cards have like name as many Bruce Willis movies as you can. Yes, I have that game.

285
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:06,080
It's only about the actors that invested in planet Hollywood. I think so. Yeah, yeah. Name as many Cindy Crawford movies as you can.

286
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:18,560
Okay. Fair game. Uh, uh, uh, ding, time's up. Yeah, it's a confusing brand at this point. I'm mainly confused as to how it's still around

287
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:24,160
and how is it, yes, the first thing that you see as you walk into the. By the way, what was your, okay, so

288
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:32,400
to say the lay of the land of Disneyland Paris, there are the two parks which are kind of side by side next door to each other,

289
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:40,400
Disneyland and Disney Studios Paris. There's a beautiful hotel in front of Disneyland Paris. Yes, legitimately beautiful.

290
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:48,000
That Disneyland hotel which is like one of the most lavish. Kind of like in the park. Yeah, it's essentially, it replaces the Disneyland train station there

291
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:55,760
in the Magic Kingdom type park. And then there's a bunch of other hotels, but connecting the hotels to the two parks is this little shopping district

292
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:03,440
that's like their city walk or like their downtown Disney. Only incredibly worse. Much, much, much less charming.

293
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:14,000
But how did you, were you staying on site or did you come in from Paris? No, we were because of the last minute-ness of the trip in general.

294
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,240
So many hotels were sold out in that area because also we were like days away from Parisian spring break.

295
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,760
So that played a factor in it too. We were like, oh shit, what are we going to do? So we actually stayed in,

296
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:36,320
I want to say Val d'Europe. That's the best French accent I can do. But it was like about, it was just down,

297
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:41,840
there's like one main road that takes you to Disneyland Paris and it was just like the shopping area that was

298
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,960
down that road and there's all these hotels and the hotel was actually pretty nice and had a shuttle, whatever.

299
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:56,240
But I would have loved to have stayed. There's one, I want to say it's like a Santa Fe Springs hotel that's kind of like Cars Land-esque.

300
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:01,840
Yeah, I think they've peppered the Cars characters around there. I thought that looked really cool. There's a lot of really cool resorts in that area.

301
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:08,640
Yeah, yeah. And I wandered around those hotels, although some of those also kind of suffer from the chinsiness.

302
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:16,480
There's the Hotel New York, which is soon getting replaced by, it's going to be called, it's going to be a Marvel hotel.

303
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:24,400
Oh cool. Like an art gallery Marvel hotel. Yeah, the confusing name Disney's Hotel New York, the Art of Marvel.

304
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:31,920
One of these Guardians of the Galaxy mission breakout type, not catchy, not roll off the tongue,

305
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:39,440
too many qualifiers and parts to the name. They're just going to call it the Marvel hotel.

306
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,560
Yeah, but it's like Art of Marvel, so it's like don't expect to meet any of the characters, but expect to see pictures of them.

307
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:48,480
Is that sort of what it's about? Like we're not going to go all the way. I don't know actually.

308
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:56,160
Like a quote unquote New York art gallery is like part of the pitch because it's like, look it's a framed print of Iron Man.

309
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,080
Why? Why would that be a hotel though? This is a very tortured.

310
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:07,440
Well, I will say that like the Marvel presence is already felt within, especially the Disney Studios park now.

311
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,720
Oh, okay. And so like a new thing that I didn't quite anticipate, but of course should have considered is

312
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:20,960
that they would have Marvel characters kind of walking around. Oh yeah. As well as the, because that's what they have now and they're putting a bunch of attractions too.

313
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:26,560
Yeah, so there's one corner around what you dubbed Aerosmith Alley, right by the Aerosmith Rock and Roller Coaster,

314
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:34,560
which is great and I really want to talk about it, but there's a corner where it was just a big sign that said rendezvous with Spider-Man.

315
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,560
Uh huh, uh huh.

316
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:42,560
So there's Spider-Man just standing waiting for your photos, waiting for rendezvous.

317
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:52,560
There's a sign that I saw that was like whatever, some modification of rendezvous, like rendezvous l'aie or something, and then the English translation of it was meet him.

318
00:31:52,560 --> 00:32:00,560
A photo of him throwing a web at your face. I just thought that, what a bizarre phrase.

319
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:10,560
The English translation, the American English translation at least of rendezvous with Spider-Man to me screams, you and Spider-Man had this, all right, we're going to meet here.

320
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:14,560
Like you planned it ahead of time. It's like, oh yes, I have to rendezvous with Spider-Man.

321
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,560
Sounds romantic to me.

322
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,560
It does sound romantic. Yeah, I'm expecting him to be hanging upside down, going to pull the mask down, he's going to give me a little kiss.

323
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,560
Yeah, wouldn't that be nice?

324
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,560
That would be nice.

325
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,560
That tracks for the whole Frenchness of it.

326
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:34,560
A swarthy Euro Spider-Man hanging upside down all day, ready to kiss anyone who comes into his alley.

327
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:49,560
Now, speaking of the Frenchness of it, okay, so Mike and I have not been to Disney Paris, but I did, you know, I looked up a lot of pictures and I went back and listened to part of one of the season pass podcast, Tony Baxter interviews,

328
00:32:49,560 --> 00:33:06,560
specifically they were talking about Disneyland Paris stuff and it seemed like they made a real effort to not be seen as like cultural invaders when designing the parks, like to not just be like Americans storming the beaches of Europe, of Normandy once again.

329
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:21,560
To be graceful, you try to be as graceful as they consider French tastes and interests and a lot of the park, I think, like from pictures and what I've read about, it seems to reflect that. Disney Village, less so.

330
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,560
Yes.

331
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:34,560
Except, and this is the leap I'm going to make, one of the hotels they didn't build was a Vegas hotel designed by an American architect named Robert Venturi.

332
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:44,560
And this never got built because they needed the money and they used it to build the hotel at the park entrance instead.

333
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,560
Okay.

334
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:54,560
And Tony Baxter tells the story about he had to be the one to tell Robert Venturi and piss off Robert Venturi, which Michael Iser thought was hilarious and put in his book.

335
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,560
Fantastic.

336
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,560
But what a great guy.

337
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,560
Yeah.

338
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:07,560
But what he said, I'm so glad he tucked in America every Saturday night and was all of our uncles for a brief period of time.

339
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,560
Hey, people can take multitudes, right?

340
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,560
America's absent uncle.

341
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,560
I don't really know anything about him.

342
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,560
He seems okay, I guess.

343
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:34,560
But what they said, he said in this interview was that the French love like the exuberance of Vegas, like the neon, they love the kind of gaudiness of Vegas, and that is the benefit of the doubt I'm going to give them in designing Disney Village, formerly Festival Disney.

344
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,560
Okay.

345
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,560
I see that. I see that connection.

346
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,560
Sure.

347
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,560
Still a leap.

348
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:57,560
Well, and there is a lot of I think what disappointed me, by the way, my big thesis about this area and why it has continued to fascinate me since being there, is that I think it's the only large stretch of property on Disney property that I felt had no Disney magic.

349
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,560
Absolutely.

350
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:09,560
It has none of what the charm you come to expect and just the basic. Now, why is there magic at the Disney Springs with the Bongo's Club and the Virgin Megastore?

351
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,560
But there is.

352
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,560
I love it.

353
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,560
I'm not being funny, but I meant it.

354
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:23,560
Yeah, you still kind of, even though it's just chain stores and stuff, there's still, there's little things here and there and a quality upkeep that makes it feel Disney.

355
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,560
Yeah, this zone is just like this weird, you're a trash mall.

356
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:35,560
Wikipedia calls this a festival of 90s contemporary American entertainment, which is quite a sentence.

357
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,560
90s as fuck.

358
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:54,560
This was the first time that I truly experienced that lack of Disney magic and also like the lack of attention to detail and the pageantry that I really love and appreciate from Disneyland stuff, like why I defend it, like the argument that I make to people that are detractors of Disneyland and like all the parks.

359
00:35:54,560 --> 00:36:00,560
It's like, no, no, you don't get it like that. They're trying so hard. They want to do.

360
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:08,560
Listen, I know them. They're not like that. No, it's like they're just trying to make a good thing happen. And you see that in all of the parks, except for this.

361
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:18,560
And, you know, I had heard the joke, of course, for years, and you see it on The Simpsons too with the Gene Scratchyland that like nobody cares about Euro Disney, that like nobody goes to Euro Disney.

362
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,560
The Parisians have kind of rejected it.

363
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,560
The phrase cultural Chernobyl.

364
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,560
Yes.

365
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:34,560
Lived large in a lot of press and like helped really hurt. I mean, there was up until like 1995 or so, I think there was a real question about is this place even going to survive or will they just kill it all together?

366
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:49,560
Yeah. And so I had heard all of that, but still like was like, no, I mean, it's a Disney park. How bad could it be? And the Disney parks themselves in Disney Paris are not technically bad, but this Disney Village is like the first thing you see that welcomes you.

367
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,560
Kind of sets the tone for being the redheaded stepchild.

368
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,560
Yeah.

369
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,560
Do you get dropped off in an area where like the point there's the planet Hollywood?

370
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,560
It's just right there.

371
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,560
Yeah. Yeah.

372
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,560
It's the first thing you can't avoid it.

373
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:19,560
Stucko in the Florida Project, the excellent film, there's like a, they really capture something about the sadness of the weird area surrounding Disney World and how it's all very low rent, but it all looks like a big orange or a big ice cream cone.

374
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:34,560
And that's how the planet Hollywood feels like a sad place where you'd watch an oddly hopeful, but still melancholy scene between the poor Florida Project children, except they present that as like the grand entrance to the whole.

375
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,560
Absolutely. Yeah.

376
00:37:35,560 --> 00:38:01,560
Also the train station, which is how I arrived. Right. It is not a magical Parisian or Disney style train station. It's just some train station and it's real like dirty and cruddy and there's street peddlers out there with weird like glowing toys that are like weird little neon helicopters or something that they're shooting up into the air.

377
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:12,560
It's the same kind of crap that you have to get. You have to go through many, many blocks of this to get to the Eiffel Tower or anywhere else, you know, super touristy in Paris.

378
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:17,560
And I was so surprised like on Disney property. There's just this kind of like Times Square bullshit.

379
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,560
I know.

380
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:36,560
It feels like there's such a strange lack of joy and a judgment for you having joy and anticipation for that experience. I remember being in the shuttle from our hotel going to Disneyland and like striking up a conversation with another dad that was like on on their way.

381
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:50,560
And I think they may have been French. I'm not sure. But we mentioned like, oh yeah, well, we're from California and you know, we're so excited. We've never been to Disney Paris before. And just getting such judgment from that dad for wanting to visit Disney Paris.

382
00:38:50,560 --> 00:39:06,560
A, when we had Disneyland proper at our hometown and also and also just why we were two childless adults there in the first place. And the judgment didn't stop there. I got judged left and right all day, every day.

383
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:26,560
The most French moment I experienced was waiting in line to buy like a cute little ratatouille doll for my sister with like a little chef's hat and like an Eiffel Tower thing. And this French guy behind me telling me my choice was shit and that I needed to go to the regular ratatouille area of the park to get the real dolls.

384
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,560
You have to get the real ratatouille.

385
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,560
You have to get shit ratatouille.

386
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,560
No, you gotta, yeah.

387
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,560
Was it, was there, were there better ratatouille dolls though somewhere?

388
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:45,560
There were that looked more like it, but I liked the cuteness of this more cartoonish looking one. And I made the case. I was like, no, this is the one that I want. And they were like, you gotta, what are you doing?

389
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,560
Wow.

390
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,560
This is not photorealistic.

391
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,560
Exactly.

392
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,560
This is not ratatouille perfection.

393
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,560
Brad Bird would be upset with you.

394
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,560
He's not on model.

395
00:39:52,560 --> 00:40:01,560
That's like when, when we wait in line, we go out to people buying like the Disneyland 2018 shirts and we're like, go buy an attraction specific t-shirt.

396
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,560
Buy an original something.

397
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:08,560
Do something a little bit more nuanced that can, you know, be presented in real life and not screened.

398
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:14,560
The family is never going to wear all this matching ones. They're going to wear it all once together. And then everyone's going to wear it as pajamas.

399
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,560
You're doing the Lord's work, I think.

400
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:22,560
The thick Hanes beefy tee with the screen print that's like, it's two pounds, weighs two pounds. It's so thick.

401
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,560
Please make it look a little soft and make it soft and a little beat up.

402
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,560
Soft, yes. Make the shirt soft.

403
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,560
We have a lot of demands about merch.

404
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:43,560
Well, Mike, my question then, I wonder if you had a similar feeling to me on this is that in Paris proper where we spent like four or five nights, I did not encounter such rudeness.

405
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:49,560
I didn't get that stereotypical the French are jerks, but I did in the Disney Paris area.

406
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,560
Yeah, yeah. I did a little bit more in Disney Paris.

407
00:40:51,560 --> 00:41:01,560
However, I didn't experience rudeness in Paris proper, but I did have my birthday and our one year marriage anniversary over the course of that trip.

408
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:06,560
And on either day, no one gave a shit.

409
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,560
I tried to get little like restaurant treats or something.

410
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:15,560
Well, we went on a we stayed in Montmartre, which is where Amelie the movie is based. It just so happened.

411
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:20,560
And so you saw the cafe is real.

412
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,560
OK, yeah. And our hotel was like right around by the Moulin Rouge.

413
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,560
So we were, you know, hanging around that area.

414
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:33,560
But I went on a walking tour on the day of my birthday and I remember turning to the tour guide and being like, it's my birthday today.

415
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:38,560
So, you know, just curious, like, what would you suggest I do today?

416
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:44,560
You know, thinking that there was some sort of special treat the way we have in America, like free Grand Slam, whatever.

417
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:51,560
And all he said was, I don't know, go eat a nice meal.

418
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,560
I don't know what you do in your free time.

419
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,560
It's the anniversary of you being brought into this painful hell.

420
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,560
We call the world. Congratulations.

421
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,560
You are one more year to dying. Good for you.

422
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,560
I wish I could die.

423
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:10,560
And my dirty cousin said you bought a shit ratatouille.

424
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,560
That's a fuck you. We're on to you.

425
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:20,560
Yeah. And then on our anniversary, like we ducked into this little wine shop and we're buying this bottle of wine.

426
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:25,560
And as we were, you know, paying for it, I turned to the woman and was like, it's our marriage.

427
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:30,560
It's our anniversary today. And, you know, that's why we're buying this bottle of wine.

428
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:39,560
We're going to go celebrate. And she just like looked at us and was like, OK, card.

429
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:43,560
So that's that's what that is. But, you know, whatever.

430
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:47,560
Then it's hot. It's Bastille Day and that's it. Yeah.

431
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,560
And then they take off for all of August. That's what I know for France.

432
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,560
Really? Robert DeBardue's birthday.

433
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,560
Just all of Europe checks out for all of August.

434
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:59,560
Was there was there an employee at any part of the resort that was like, you know,

435
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:06,560
maybe embodied the spirit of Disneyland or Disney World where it's like the idea of those employees are they're supposed to be like, hello.

436
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,560
Great to see you. So they're going to make you feel so welcome and everything.

437
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,560
Was there anyone in the whole resort that was like that?

438
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:21,560
I'm going to say no. But but but also so off of that, we kind of got not quite the opposite experience.

439
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:28,560
But when we went to Tower of Terror, the tower that they have is pretty identical to the one that they had in California

440
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:32,560
up until recently since it's been Guardians of the Galaxy.

441
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,560
And there was we were waiting in line in the lobby part.

442
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:41,560
And you know how like they have the two waiting areas for the loading zones, whatever. Of course.

443
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:47,560
I'm like right by of course, right by that banister from one of the loading areas.

444
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:57,560
And all of a sudden, one of the employees in like the bellhop uniform, like darts into my face and goes, ha ha ha and startles me.

445
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:03,560
And I scream, fuck, full volume in the whole area.

446
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:07,560
And he recoiled and went to Mademoiselle such language.

447
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:14,560
But I don't like it when people startle me. And I saw him do that to three other women.

448
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:19,560
And I was just like fuming. And you can't go to the manager and complain at Disneyland Paris.

449
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:24,560
You can't do that. That shit would never fly in California, I don't think.

450
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:29,560
Well, yeah, it would. The scare has to be a much Disney here would be a much gentler scare.

451
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:34,560
Yeah. Like like when the door opens on Tower of Terror, people go, oh, like but you're far from the person.

452
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:40,560
You're in a seatbelt. In my business. Yeah, that would be that's like a Halloween Horror Night type of a situation.

453
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:46,560
You just avoid those things or you don't go in the maze if you don't want the characters bugging you.

454
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:50,560
Yeah, he would never get in your space like that out here. Yeah.

455
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,560
He was taking his job very seriously. Boy, it's rough and tumble out there.

456
00:44:54,560 --> 00:45:00,560
Yeah. Wow. Well, in Disneyville, I enjoy the more the more and more I read about Disney Village,

457
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:08,560
I was glad you were the guest because everything I would stumble upon something and a Simpsons joke would come into my like this.

458
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:14,560
Great books. So so many of these places look like Uncle Mo's family bag.

459
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:20,560
America is America town where they eat in Japan, where every table is a different state.

460
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,560
It's pretty much America town. It is very much America town. Yeah, they have.

461
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:28,560
So there's a lot of like weird Chicago fixation. Oh, yeah.

462
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:40,560
Not only in Disney Paris, but like in Paris proper. Got to come across like some anything that was like this weird Anglophile Americanized sort of thing and be like Chicago meat diner.

463
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:54,560
Yeah, got to make sure to post this picture of the steakhouse, which says Chicago beef warehouse and then has another sign that says Chicago looks very similar, very similar to the Portillo's restaurant in Buena Park.

464
00:45:54,560 --> 00:46:06,560
Yes, it does. It is a very Portillo's is a restaurant that's mostly in the Midwest from where I grew up and it's beef, it's hot dogs and they have one in Buena Park, which is right by the parks and right by knots.

465
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:14,560
And it's got a like a prohibition theme. I see how fun. And yeah, it's like there's like mannequins of gangsters up.

466
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:24,560
Like if you look up and it's like very similar in aesthetics. So there is like a like a romanticization of like these like old Chicago gangsters for whatever reason.

467
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:38,560
You're pretending you're in a world where hot dogs have been outlawed and only in raucous underground party settings can everyone unleash their bad with our appetizers. The general tone there.

468
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:48,560
What's fun about it if I can just eat it and there's no rules stopping me. That's a beef warehouse and that's that's on the outside of the building too. But I don't think it's the name of the steakhouse.

469
00:46:48,560 --> 00:47:01,560
The steakhouse. But there there was like a font is so big. There's a bevy of like America town ass. Oh, you're looking at the one I saw. But rock and roll America. Yeah.

470
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:12,560
Yeah. Well, rock and roll America. I found that they also do these festivals. I don't know if I'm getting too off track here. There's also a few read the bread about the festivals they do not really.

471
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:23,560
There's a village. Yeah, there's different music festivals and they have like a like a Brazilian music festival and they do have rock and roll festival and they have a bunch of like it's all rock with them.

472
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:33,560
When they say rock and roll, they mean fifties rock and roll. Amazing. So they just drive like old cars out and they put old cars out and like have a little sign that says what kind of car they are.

473
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:46,560
And they just have a couple different like fifties tribute bands like T-Bow and the B Boppers or Miss Marianne rag time and the ragtime Wranglers. Amazing. Or the rockin' lilies.

474
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:54,560
Again, this is so much like the American town waiter shirt that says UCLA Yankee Cola.

475
00:47:54,560 --> 00:48:06,560
Well, and I was going to say on the floor of the New York Hotel, there's a there's a part I have a photo of my wife Erin on a on a giant Yankees logo. Oh, yeah.

476
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:20,560
And that the entire New York thing is kind of like that just like sort of like a level of art design. That's like if a high if a high school play a good healthy high school play budget was portraying Manhattan.

477
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:25,560
Does that carry over to a restaurant called New York style sandwich?

478
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:31,560
Oh, boy. Maybe the I mean, I we'd have to debate and I did not go to all the restaurants.

479
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:39,560
But if I had to guess which one of the many Disney village restaurants is the worst, I think this New York style sandwiches might be in the running.

480
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:50,560
I got to read the description. I'm not going to do this for any others. But this one drop into the deli straight out of the streets of Manhattan for some hot and cold sandwiches and refreshing salads.

481
00:48:50,560 --> 00:49:05,560
Choose from pasta, hot dogs, fish and chips, pizzas, a salad bar and sandwiches to eat on the go or seated inside whilst admiring the Broadway souvenirs that line the mirrored covered walls of this New York sandwich bar.

482
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:14,560
Now, I don't know how many New York delis you guys have been to, but pasta and fish and chips are the first thing that come to mind for me.

483
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,560
Why is sandwiches at the end of the list? Yeah.

484
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:35,560
The restaurant called Sandwiches. Also, then I looked up like I looked at the menu of it and the first sample item they show you for New York style sandwiches is the Frenchiest baguette. Is it is it ham bone? How do you say ham?

485
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:42,560
And not that anyone would know your guess is as good as my ham bone that, you know, spelled with a J. J.

486
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:47,560
J. M. B. O. N. I'm butchering this. I took high school French. Okay.

487
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:52,560
Did you retain any names of foods or treats?

488
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:56,560
Orangina. Yeah, very nice.

489
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:08,560
But yeah, oh, croque monsieur, which is like cheese and cheese. And then there's croque madame. One is ham and one is tomato. See, I know my treats.

490
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:18,560
That's right. This is the thing I would like to if there was a lot of French specific if it was a Disney version of French food all over this resort, that'd be something.

491
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:29,560
But it's all this odd fake America food that satisfies seemingly neither the French or the other Europeans who go there regularly or me an American.

492
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:41,560
It's they found a middle that no one likes. Yeah. Well, they I found also I mean outside of Disney Paris, there's an affinity for burgers that's happening over there where they are really loving.

493
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:48,560
Like we've we've mastered it in a different kind of way. I'm going to do a shitty French accent for the rest of this episode.

494
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:54,560
But there's a lot of burgers here. But I did find that there were like a couple items that would pop up that seemed a little Frenchy there.

495
00:50:54,560 --> 00:51:05,560
Like I think that a croque monsieur, which just looked like the way they did it. I've never seen it this way, where it was it looked like a grilled cheese that was inverted like a sandwich that had like melted cheese.

496
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:09,560
Oh, I think that is one of the ways is prepared. Yeah.

497
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:14,560
But that would be at like the sit down, not sit down, but the grab and go restaurants.

498
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:24,560
There was an article recently I read where hamburgers have now outsold ham baguettes French.

499
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:31,560
These colors don't run. What it was something. What publication are you reading? I think it was Conde Nast Traveler.

500
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:35,560
I get a lot of train or a plane. I get Conde Nast Traveler emails.

501
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:47,560
It's alternates between the bougiest thing I've ever seen and like, oh, that looks like a very interesting place. You just have a Google News alert for ham.

502
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:58,560
It was something of like, yeah, but the numbers were like, oh, it was 2.4 billion sold as opposed to 2.2 billion.

503
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:05,560
Right. Right. Even though we're number one. That's all I can say. Yeah. Hamburgers are topped. What is the first time?

504
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:13,560
Do you know like the top selling like sandwich in America? No, but I know McDonald's the country after America.

505
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:21,560
McDonald's is like most popular in France. That makes the next country is France. Yeah. Oh, interesting.

506
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:24,560
Quite a few. The most popular sandwich in America.

507
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:30,560
I believe I learned in elementary school our national food is like a hamburger fries and a soft drink.

508
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:35,560
You learned in elementary. Yeah. Weird, sincere. Yeah.

509
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:40,560
I don't think you've retained from elementary. I love it. Like little oddly enough facts.

510
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:46,560
Was that the day that the McDonald rep came into the classroom and explained that to you?

511
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:52,560
He would be wise to. He took over for the rest of the year.

512
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:57,560
And in fact, you're not a real American unless you eat a hamburger every day.

513
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:13,560
So became hamburger elementary. I do remember having a health teacher in high school try to make the claim that like the most balanced meal was a double double cheeseburger from in and out because it had all the food groups.

514
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:22,560
It had the bread food group and at the meat food group that got that vegetable with that tomato dressing. She wasn't the healthiest person.

515
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:32,560
I want to say always reassuring. Yeah. I like the vegetable was just like a piece of iceberg lettuce, which is no nutritional value. Nothing. Yeah, nothing.

516
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:55,560
There's a lot of a lot of the food around this area seems to be of that ilk, the kind of like crinkly. Where is this? What what drawer has this been in kind of lettuce and then some horrible Dijon kind of some crazy heavy sauce squirted on way too much of it ruining the consistency of the bread.

517
00:53:55,560 --> 00:54:04,560
I found I just saw I I ate disgusting food and I saw a lot of disgusting food around. Did did either of you eat at the Disney Village?

518
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:07,560
Did you do? No. Okay.

519
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:21,560
Because we were talking about it. You warned me, Scott, before I went there and that it was garbage to plan accordingly. So we kind of avoided it. But we did like we ducked into all the restaurants just to see what it was.

520
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:32,560
So we peeked our head into Planet Hollywood and I got a sweet photo with a weird statue of Sylvester Stallone and that was great. Super packed. We couldn't even really walk into the restaurant proper.

521
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:56,560
So we just kind of like, you know, peeked around and off the side of Planet Hollywood is probably the worst mural I've ever seen, where it's like different stars of the day when you would imagine like in the 90s when Planet Hollywood first debuted at Disney Village. And then since they've added more recent stars as an afterthought.

522
00:54:56,560 --> 00:55:10,560
So maybe there's like a Nick Jonas wedged in there and there's like other the Twilight games. Yes. But they're all much smaller than the original celebrities and they don't sell it as if they're on different parts of a of a plane.

523
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:23,560
Yeah, it just seems like here's a hulking Stallone and then here's a very tiny anemic set of Jonas Brothers. Yeah, it's really bizarre. Yeah. And there's a giant blank spaces. It's not a space that's all celebrity cutouts.

524
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:33,560
Just like, you know, you feel like many feet, 20 feet go by and then there's Gina Davis. Yeah. And then I don't know Nick Cannon jam next to him or something.

525
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:44,560
That was where the Kevin Spacey was painted and they haven't painted the crystal plumber there. Good catch. Good catch. There were 10 different Spacey characters. Yeah. They love they love Spacey in France.

526
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:57,560
But then also even more bizarre is like a design point. They have, you know, the Grimmins type like handprints, but they have it like blasted on the side of the building. Yes. Kind of diagonal.

527
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:11,560
Chris, that's pretty that's pretty standard Planet Hollywood design. I can tell that's that's that's the way they, you know, they throw them up on the wall. So like Uncle Mo's Feed Bag style.

528
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:28,560
Yeah. Street signs and doors. Yeah. Well, okay. An alligator with sunglasses. Oh, now I've seen everything. Oh, that's my favorite. Marge. The suburban easily impressed flat life.

529
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:45,560
But the yeah. So there's all of those handprints and they all have little gold, not quite plaques because they're much cheaper and the little gold labels saying who the stars are. But like some of them have just been yanked out like Jimmy Stewart is gone and it feels not see you in hell.

530
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:56,560
Jim. It feels like lay hell. Oh, wow. You are fluent. Yeah. You know some words are French listeners are going to be pissed.

531
00:56:56,560 --> 00:57:15,560
So get yourself a ham bone. Make sure you go to the ham bone. Well, you could probably get a ham bone at Buffalo Bill's Wild West show with Mickey and friends. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Faithful recreation of the actual Buffalo Bill's Wild West show, which was a thing in the 1800s or 1900s.

532
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:28,560
That was probably like a traveling circus. Big old animal abusing mess using probably some not exactly tasteful things with Native Americans.

533
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:46,560
And then there was something where I was reading something and it said as of 2009 or whatever year, the show now stars Mickey and friends like so. Well, still there. But like Mickey and friends play a much bigger role. Did you watch any of this? No. Did you?

534
00:57:46,560 --> 00:58:02,560
No. Is there? I didn't even look bored. I watched almost the whole thing today. OK. Wow. What's your dinner theater show? We should say that. So look, theater show already kind of odd for Disney. So what happens is it is not unlike the Pirates Dinner Adventure or Medieval Times.

535
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:17,560
There's an area where you go in and there's like a pre show and there's like some some like Goofy's on stage with some like country music singers and they have a thing where they do. They say en deux trois, which is, of course, one, two, three in France, French.

536
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:33,560
And then they go on to talk. Yee haw. And that's the thing they do. And then they're like, all right, you're ready. And like Pirates of the Adventure or Medieval Times, everybody gets a different color and goes and sits in a different section. So you have a yellow like a car.

537
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:47,560
It is a perfect. Yeah, obviously they're using it because it works. They are tearing us apart from our fellow man with arbitrary labels. It really lets you know that in conflicts, you know, the sides are arbitrary. Yes, of course.

538
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:57,560
Why can't yellow and blue get along? We were the same 10 minutes ago. Yeah, it really. But now you're hungry for blood. Yeah. Like in the Wild West. Go to hell, blue.

539
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:09,560
So then they go in an arena that looks exactly like Medieval Times. It's that big. It has the same like section kind of thing. And the show is strikingly the same as like not the same.

540
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:20,560
But like there's a lot of filler. There's a lot of like horses just going around for like just like, hey, let's kill five minutes by looking at the horses like go around just like Medieval Times with that horse part.

541
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:29,560
There's a whole like with Medieval Times and we're again making Nick Weiger very upset because he loves all the pageantry of the horses and the bird flying around. That's legit.

542
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:37,560
But there's a lot of filler in the Medieval Times show. All you really want is that is them to joust and then to swing an axe at each other. That's what we're in Medieval Times for.

543
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:46,560
But that's only five minutes of the show, really five to 10 minutes of the show. So that's not quite like this here. But I want just pure blood and gore for. Yes.

544
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:57,560
90 straight minutes. That's what I want. You want teeth knocking out and eyeballs dislodged. And sparks. Shield, axe on shield sparks. That's what I want. That would be cool.

545
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:02,560
Does anywhere simulate that? Medieval Times does. There are sparks? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

546
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:10,560
It's been a minute since I've been there. Yeah, come on, Scott, you gotta go. But none of that conflict at the Mickey and Friends one. Well, they're not the same, not quite the same conflict.

547
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:20,560
I'll be honest, the story a little hard to follow here. Is it in French? Yeah, well, kind of. Some of it is, some of it isn't. The Disney characters all speak English.

548
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:27,560
Uh huh. But the Disney characters have clearly like kind of just shoehorned into the show. Of course. Manifest Destiny.

549
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:35,560
They're really, yeah, they're really just like kind of they show up and then they say hello and they just like talk like they talk a little bit.

550
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:46,560
There's a kind of a I don't know if this is a through line, but Minnie is like very sure Mickey's about to propose to her and then he doesn't. Oh, no. That's a whole part of the story.

551
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:55,560
Very muppety plot. I feel like there's a lot of Miss Piggy waiting for Kermit. Like Mickey goes Mickey's like there's always something there's there's something I've always wanted to say.

552
01:00:55,560 --> 01:01:02,560
And then Minnie's like, oh, and she's like getting ready like for him to say it. And then Mickey goes, we're burning daylight, fellas.

553
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:09,560
Mickey speaks in flowery language like Al Swearingen from The Rain of Hills.

554
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:14,560
That was a cock sucker. Like they start shooting a Buffalo Bill.

555
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:20,560
That was a perfect comedy misdirect though. Yeah, it was. Also, it doesn't really like to be fair to Mickey.

556
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:26,560
Like there's really Mickey didn't get down on one knee for this. He didn't really. She's reading into this.

557
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:32,560
I mean, obviously, maybe it's a problem in the relationship, but I mean, he wasn't saying like, Minnie, I want to tell you something.

558
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:35,560
I've always wanted like he didn't say it to her. He's not addressing her.

559
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:39,560
The moment we first met. I was like. For 85 years.

560
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:45,560
What this this vaguely reminds me of two things. Obviously, Dixie Stampede, which you guys have talked about on the podcast before.

561
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:50,560
And I'm not sure if I mentioned it to any of you guys before, but I did a whole standup tour where it was called.

562
01:01:50,560 --> 01:02:01,560
I just really wanted to go to Dollywood. Oh, I did. I did. I planned a whole standup tour that culminated with me going to Dollywood alone.

563
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:07,560
And it was just perfect to get amazing as you would ever hope it would be.

564
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:14,560
But then it also vaguely reminds me of I don't know if you guys have read much about the Sanrio theme park in Tokyo.

565
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:18,560
No. Well, a tiny bit. I'm hoping to go there later in the year.

566
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:21,560
And we talked about this place a little bit. Oh, with Doug Jones.

567
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:27,560
Probably. Yeah. Well, we talked on Twitter a little bit about Pure Land and the presence of that egg, that lazy egg.

568
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:29,560
Yeah. Gudetama. The best Sanrio character.

569
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:32,560
But they have like there it's a small world ride.

570
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:36,560
You know, we don't know Japanese, so we didn't know quite what was going on.

571
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:47,560
But there is apparently a storyline because it starts where you you're on like the little boat and you're going through the little Sanrio world and you go through like the Batsmaru land and you go through the Kurope land and whatever.

572
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:52,560
And there's we kept noticing like throughout the ride that there were these little envelopes that were kind of scattered throughout the lands.

573
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:55,560
We're like, oh, what are those envelopes say? I wonder.

574
01:02:55,560 --> 01:03:03,560
And eventually we realized that they were all spelling out that the ride would culminate in Hello Kitty's wedding.

575
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:09,560
And that was the only goal Hello Kitty had in her life.

576
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:13,560
And here we are. And everyone's waiting for Hello Kitty to get married.

577
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:19,560
And then to who? To another Hello Cat type person.

578
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:22,560
There's a male cat. Yeah. There's a Hello Kitty cat.

579
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:27,560
I said no gender qualifier. Is Kurope the frog? Am I right? Yeah.

580
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:31,560
Did Gudetama, the listless egg, make it to the wedding? No, he did not.

581
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:35,560
Noticeably absent. Jason's favorite character in fiction.

582
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:41,560
I love Gudetama. Gudetama's the best. He tried to slide into a tux and like, I can't deal with this.

583
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:48,560
Weird egg man. There's like a guy wearing a weird pervert suit that looks like an egg too.

584
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:53,560
It's the best. Did you see any of the, I don't know when you were there,

585
01:03:53,560 --> 01:04:00,560
but did you see any of the new character who's like a calm office worker who occasionally has nervous rage breakdowns?

586
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:07,560
No. I forget what that was. We were there last year, but I don't think that that was present in the park.

587
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:12,560
It's new in the last year. Sanrio introduces new characters every now and then.

588
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:17,560
Is that newsletter that you read? Is there a Sanrio part that you're so up on your Sanrio characters?

589
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:21,560
Is that in Conde Nast Traveler? Is that in the Ham Google Alerts?

590
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:26,560
No, I forget. I feel like Marissa, Passcast Marissa Strickland told me about this.

591
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:31,560
The office worker character who has rage issues.

592
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:35,560
You're thinking of the show Corporate on Comedy Central. This is all of their things.

593
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:39,560
This is not a... Matt Engelbretson. He's a real person.

594
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:42,560
I'm thinking of Matt Engelbretson. He's not an anime.

595
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:45,560
There, we figured it out. Good, I'm glad we solved it.

596
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:52,560
Hello Kitty's with a male equivalent of herself in a little powder blue tux.

597
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:56,560
Pretty much, from what I remember. And that's the ride in this place?

598
01:04:56,560 --> 01:05:02,560
That's the ride. And then we went on it twice. There's a great photo of us that we have on our fridge now.

599
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:09,560
They catch you at a really weird time in the ride. So in the photo, we just look really confused and angry.

600
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:13,560
And we're also alone in our boat. So that was the perfect photo we had to buy.

601
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:15,560
Because we're just looking around like, what is this?

602
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:22,560
This space for 30 people and it's just you two? Whoa. This is great. I'm very excited about Carol Land.

603
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:25,560
And it's all indoors, right? Which sounds kind of unsettling.

604
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:31,560
Yeah, yeah. It's really bizarre. It's especially bizarre because they constantly have parades.

605
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:39,560
So there's this little walkway area. It kind of vaguely reminded me of your conversation about the Sid and Marty Crofts land.

606
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:42,560
And the way that that seemed to be set up. But they have... People-y.

607
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:52,560
Yeah, yes. They have a really intense indoor parade with people from the ceiling on strings dancing around.

608
01:05:52,560 --> 01:06:00,560
And then Hello Kitty is floating on a boat waving to people in the sky. It's really intense. Yeah, you should go.

609
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:02,560
Oh, boy. Oh, yeah. We'll go.

610
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:06,560
Erin's going to lose her fucking mind. She's so excited for Pure Olymp.

611
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:10,560
But she sees that office character. Suicidal office.

612
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:16,560
The real quick back to the Wild West. So it's a dinner show.

613
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:23,560
Yes. And the YouTube video I watched had like a first person view of when they served you food and they serve you like chili.

614
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:25,560
So if you want to... We can post this YouTube video.

615
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:30,560
If you want just a shot of like a lazy French worker just slapping some chili in a bowl.

616
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:32,560
It's like the most gross looking.

617
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:40,560
Does it come out of a big pitcher like the soup that you liked, Jason, at Fire's Dinner and Dinner?

618
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:47,560
I liked the distribution method. I thought it was a very clever way to serve soup to so many people.

619
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:52,560
We have opinions come up that I end up baffled by. OK, clever. If you're just admiring...

620
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:56,560
Yeah, I'm just admiring that. But soup and mass out of pitchers.

621
01:06:56,560 --> 01:07:01,560
I don't know why you would have an affinity for this. Why this is a good thing.

622
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:09,560
Where I get roasted too much. I'm just trying to figure it out where you can be coming from.

623
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:12,560
I'm here for the ride. I enjoy your friendship very much.

624
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:16,560
Sure. This is a... I'm going to probably mispronounce it.

625
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:25,560
This is the character who is like a little... She is a 25... Specifically specify this 25 year old office worker character.

626
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:32,560
And then when she gets mad, she looks like... She looks like this.

627
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:37,560
Oh my God. She looks like a demon. Whoa. Amazing.

628
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:43,560
Sanrio does those little 20, 30 second cartoons that you can see on their YouTube channel and stuff.

629
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:48,560
I'll check it out. Yeah. So if the copier doesn't work or if she has to stay late, then she freaks out.

630
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:53,560
I love this so much. Wow. It's a Sanrio about mild office conflict.

631
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:58,560
It's universal, you know? The themes are universal. We've seen it so many different types of media.

632
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:02,560
So now it's time for Sanrio. Do you think Gudetama is her roommate?

633
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:05,560
And they have an odd couple dynamic? I think they've interacted before.

634
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:11,560
I think there's been cartoons with both of them before. Gudetama is not fazed by her. I know that.

635
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:15,560
He would never be. If I know my man Gudetama.

636
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:20,560
And you know what? This is reminding me. Universal. You got two Hello Kitty stores now on two different coasts.

637
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:25,560
Get some Gudetama in there. That's the only thing I look for. And they don't have it.

638
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:31,560
It's not. And easier to find in America. I remember a few years ago, like trying to find Gudetama stuff.

639
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:35,560
And it's like, no, maybe if you go to Tokyo. I think I'm just at the mall.

640
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:38,560
Now it's like in the Burbank mall I could find.

641
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:43,560
Can I tell you the Internet alerts I somehow get? I don't know what put like what this put me on this.

642
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:50,560
But around the holidays, I got an alert that said meet Gudetama in person at the Sanrio store in Little Tokyo.

643
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:56,560
And I like put it in my calendar. Completely forgot. But I was like, oh, fuck, like so excited.

644
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:00,560
Well, at Comic Con a few years ago. I don't think he would have been excited to meet you, unfortunately.

645
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:05,560
That's just his way. I know. But again, if I know my man Gudetama, I don't want him to change.

646
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:09,560
That's what you expect out of him. Yeah. I may have told this on the podcast before,

647
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:15,560
but they always have a big Sanrio booth at Comic Con. And a few years ago, there was like meet the creator of Gudetama.

648
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:23,560
Meet the artist who designed. And she was literally at a fold at a table behind velvet ropes just sitting there.

649
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:29,560
Because you couldn't just walk up and meet her. You had to spend like 40 to 50 dollars on Gudetama merchandise.

650
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:33,560
And then you could meet her. That's an easy task. And I guess so.

651
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:37,560
I was not looking to do that that day because they were also very large.

652
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:42,560
The main Gudetama options were very large, but she was just sitting there very quiet.

653
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:46,560
I was like, just kind of wait like, hi, I wish I could.

654
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:50,560
I thought you were going to say that it was pandemonium and that everybody wanted to shake her hand.

655
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,560
It should have been.

656
01:09:52,560 --> 01:10:01,560
Let's get let's get off of these beloved cute characters that we enjoy and start to get back to the pit where Buffalo are forced to perform

657
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:09,560
in France. I do have a review from I hate to keep going back to this hell hellish show,

658
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:14,560
but there's a review I found here. Honestly, I have no idea why anyone would give this five stars.

659
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:18,560
The tricks are clearly staged, which, yeah, of course, the tricks are staged.

660
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:23,560
There's a whole thing where Annie Oakley like pretends to shoot out lights and yeah, she's not shooting bullets at lights.

661
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:30,560
So, yeah, that should actually hit the light bulbs and shatter the glass and have it go into your into your chili.

662
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:36,560
There's a lot of interactions whilst you're trying to eat your awful dinner, which which felt odd.

663
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:38,560
The bite. Yeah.

664
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:41,560
So there's a little British review. The bison stink.

665
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:46,560
So eat before they come out. That actually is very helpful.

666
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:49,560
Yeah. Not suitable for people with allergies.

667
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:51,560
And then and then there's no story to it.

668
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:55,560
The only good thing was my daughter thinks many waved especially to her.

669
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:58,560
OK, so there's a happy. So at least the daughter liked it.

670
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:06,560
But this. Yeah, there's also there's a there's a contingent of people on the on these reviews that say this show is only for kids.

671
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:09,560
Then there's a couple of people that say this show is for adults.

672
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:15,560
So I don't know why. My interpretation was it's for no one.

673
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:18,560
Yeah, but I think you're the right one in this. Yeah.

674
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:21,560
I mean, it's for me, but it's not for like a normal human.

675
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:24,560
I don't know if you poked around in the zone.

676
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:31,560
I didn't go to the show, but I went into the lobby where the show where you wait before the show happens.

677
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:49,560
And I have a video of us just it's only my wife and I in a in a heavily lit fake indoor Western town that's covered in like warnings about how if you go to the show, you might get sand and trail dust in your eyes.

678
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:52,560
Oh, fuck. I wish we had poked our head and we didn't.

679
01:11:52,560 --> 01:12:03,560
Oh, man. I should have given you that tip to go go into this weird lobby and then and then, you know, so I have pictures of my wife looking very confused under a sign that says like a say office.

680
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:12,560
And then and according to our live narration, it smelled like horses in this alley, even though there was not a horse in sight.

681
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:23,560
And and the the Beverly Hills cop theme is playing very quietly and then right and then attached to it. It just it is connected to the movie theater lobby.

682
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:32,560
So a couple steps away from fake Western town is this very like really garish 1997 multiplex.

683
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:39,560
Gaumont is the or Garmont, I think, is the brand. Is it also by Billy Bob's Country Western Salute?

684
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:42,560
I'm not sure. I think oddly, no.

685
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:44,560
I love how delighted you are by all these restaurants.

686
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:49,560
So many of these things would be condescending if they weren't so clumsy.

687
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:50,560
Yeah.

688
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:53,560
There's one just called Sports Bar.

689
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:58,560
Yeah, I think that one's next to the New York Sandwich place.

690
01:12:58,560 --> 01:12:58,560
Yeah.

691
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:01,560
Which was next to the weird dilated Donald Duck.

692
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:05,560
That's that's the row. That's really that's the heart of this district.

693
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:11,560
Sports Bar has a big sign next to it that says snacks.

694
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:22,560
And then I took a picture of a banner that's kind of of the quality of like, you know, like announcing speakers who might be coming to your college soon.

695
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:24,560
It's very like it's very clip party.

696
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:31,560
And it says 100 percent sports free karaoke and DJ entertainment.

697
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:32,560
Well, OK.

698
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:36,560
It's not mistranslated. Some places would be fine with 97 percent sports.

699
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:40,560
Not the case with us. Not sufficient sports.

700
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:45,560
I mean, this is this is all bringing up so many things that I'm so curious about.

701
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:53,560
Like, for example, the what we haven't gotten to the McDonald's yet.

702
01:13:53,560 --> 01:14:04,560
But on the the Web site for Disney Village, there is Disney Village Web Radio where you can it's just a web music station.

703
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:08,560
But and it it took me a few tries to get it to work.

704
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:13,560
It just kind of opened like a browser window that looked like real player used to.

705
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:16,560
And it was just playing very quiet house music.

706
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:24,560
So I don't want. And then there but there's a Disney Village Web Radio spot on the map of like it's a location you can.

707
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:27,560
So I don't know if that's just where the DJ booth is.

708
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:32,560
And the like tune in and you'll find a host of hits.

709
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:35,560
The next best thing to being there.

710
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:38,560
Amazing. I don't recall seeing anything that.

711
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:45,560
Yeah. I mean, I would imagine that description makes it seem like the way radio Disney used to be a presence in Tomorrowland.

712
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:51,560
Oh, there was that little booth at the bottom of where the the rocket jets used to be.

713
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:58,560
Right. Yeah. They turned into that awful sculpture right next to where it's like the Star Wars zone in Club Buzz.

714
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:03,560
Yeah. If it is still called they jammed so many unpleasant things and all these places.

715
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:08,560
I'm going to try to pull up the radio, but I'm probably going to fail.

716
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:12,560
But maybe we'll get a nice little blast of house music.

717
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:18,560
So far failing so far white screen and I don't know how much time I'm willing to invest in this.

718
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:22,560
I thought maybe just like, oh, I'm using an older version of Safari because I have an update.

719
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:26,560
But and then like I think I go back to the 97 version.

720
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:29,560
Yeah. Yeah. Did you try your browser?

721
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:39,560
If we open it up on like maybe like an old gateway. Wait, I got it. Oh, sorry. It interrupts.

722
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:45,560
Yeah. It's like we're there. That's perfect.

723
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:50,560
I thought I was going to be like the din of guests walking around like that would have been a little bit more interesting.

724
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:56,560
That would have made sense. You know, like a live stream crying families, families coming apart.

725
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:01,560
I did see I mean, this is a delight anytime you go to a theme park.

726
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:16,560
So I did see a little girl full face of like fairy face paint just bawling her eyes out, crying, screaming with a mom who was yelling at her very sternly.

727
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:22,560
Also full face of face. Oh, wow. The mom too.

728
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:27,560
And I think that was like within the first five minutes of arrival.

729
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:34,560
We landed in Paris and like took the magic shuttle they have from the airport directly to the resort.

730
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:37,560
And that was the first thing we saw. And we're like, we're home.

731
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:44,560
I'm going to go ahead and say this is the worst thing to happen in France in a hundred years at least.

732
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:51,560
I think you're right. I don't want to correct you. Blaming crying pixies, having a meltdown.

733
01:16:51,560 --> 01:17:00,560
Well, this is also what I recall about when we poked our heads into the McDonald's is that like it's a two story McDonald's,

734
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:05,560
which gives you plenty of space for families to have complete and utter meltdowns.

735
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:12,560
I felt like every direction I looked, I could just like sense the seeds of divorce being planted.

736
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:15,560
Laid to board. Thank you so much.

737
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:20,560
The beloved movie, Francis favorite movie. They watch it every day.

738
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:25,560
Another area though, I mean, and this wasn't just specific to the McDonald's and Disney Village,

739
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:32,560
but McDonald's that we found all around Paris. But another point where they're kind of obsessed with Chicago beef.

740
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:38,560
They had like a burger that was like the Chicago beef quarter pounder burger there.

741
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:40,560
Wow. Is that exclusive to France?

742
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:44,560
Exclusive. I was trying to find other things that were specific to that, but that was the one that stood out.

743
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:51,560
Well, that is another story that our daddy, Tony Baxter tells.

744
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:58,560
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Our spiritual father terminology.

745
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:03,560
What did T back say?

746
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:10,560
That they they they were the French love like the 20 they love like the American roaring 20s and gangsters and stuff.

747
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:14,560
And there was concept art for like a 20s themed Main Street USA.

748
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:24,560
And then the Untouchables came out and Michael Eisner came in and was like, yeah, we can't we can't do because this is the most recent 20s thing.

749
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:32,560
It was such a big hit. And they're like, we can't have an Al Capone themed Main Street because Robert DeJor just beat someone to death with a baseball bat.

750
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:36,560
And a kid got blown up in that movie. He had a speakeasy.

751
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:42,560
Probably wise. Yeah. Until that movie, though, of course, people had such they didn't think gangsters ever did anything bad.

752
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:48,560
Why would you ever? There's a reason they call the Daly family the Saints of Chicago. Right.

753
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:53,560
Of course. Oh, yes. We love the Daly's. They all had a work ethic that was unrivaled.

754
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:57,560
Sure. Continued by the great Rahm Emanuel. Oh my God.

755
01:18:57,560 --> 01:19:01,560
A political figure who's done nothing wrong ever. Great history of mayors in Chicago.

756
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:08,560
Now to take a big sip of water and look up Rahm Emanuel last five years.

757
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:27,560
He's been on track, I assume. Well, a theme that they were OK with on the resort was Comedie del Arte, which apparently this McDonald's professes itself to be themed after the Comedie del Arte in a Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip move.

758
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:38,560
Made the very relatable reference. That's what I was going to say. Comedie del Arte was mentioned in the making of this McDonald's and then not again until Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip.

759
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:41,560
No pop culture acknowledgement. No one gives a shit.

760
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:45,560
Well, I don't really know what it is and I don't know why this is themed to that.

761
01:19:45,560 --> 01:20:00,560
I guess because there are tiny old timey feeling statues of Bertie and Mayor McChese and that captain who I cannot retain the name of. The police chief? Yeah, the kind of like constable guy.

762
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:05,560
Yeah, what is his name? The Constable of McDonaldland. I've thought about him. Not Mayor McChese.

763
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:12,560
Officer McChese. Officer Big Mac? Did you just say? He said Officer Big Mac. I think you just made a character up. Officer Big Mac.

764
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:17,560
I'm just going to look up, you know, I'm not going to look up that character. I'm going to look up Officer Big Mac and see what comes up.

765
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:28,560
Either you get lucky or. We're about to get a virus. Jason is correct. Yeah. The character's name is Officer Big Mac. Wait, spin it around. We're thinking of the same guy. Officer Big Mac.

766
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:36,560
Oh, yes. The guy actually though, I'm thinking of the more. You're thinking of a different police officer in McDonaldland? I've been calling that guy Mayor McChese this whole time. That's not Mayor McChese.

767
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:43,560
Oh, I feel like he looks like a mayor. He's got a police. I don't know. He's a ruthless, corrupt cop.

768
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:51,560
He is the bad lieutenant of the McDonaldland gang. It's a legacy of corruption like the Emanuel family, like like. Yes.

769
01:20:51,560 --> 01:21:01,560
Did you ever have this? Sorry, the sidetrack. This play place where you get to play an officer Big Mac's mouth and it looks like a jail and it looks like jail.

770
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:09,560
I think one of my first memories on this earth may be blissing out inside Officer Big Mac's mouth.

771
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:16,560
I love that. And if I could buy any giant McDonald's implement, that would probably be the good one for like a backyard.

772
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:23,560
Well, we've all spent time in Officer Big Mac's mouth. Got it. And yet didn't know his name until now. Yeah, I didn't know his name either. We got up close and personal.

773
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:31,560
Kudos to Jason. Great unifier. You're looking for a different police officer? There's like a more of a there's a sailor kind of guy. Oh, OK.

774
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:42,560
With a big the kind of hat that Captain Crunch has the tall hat with the little rivets. Probably not a good description.

775
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:47,560
You guys talk amongst yourselves while I look this up. Yeah. Look at the nautical McDonald's guy.

776
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:55,560
Anyway, there's statues of all of those people meant to distract from the pure misery that the families of five are all having.

777
01:21:55,560 --> 01:22:00,560
But they seem to fail to do so. And those statues that you because you've sent us these before.

778
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:05,560
These statues are very tiny. Yeah. Yeah.

779
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:14,560
Yeah. And when we're used to in McDonald's giant depictions of the McDonald's land gang, these are very tiny and easy to miss.

780
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:20,560
I found it. His name is Captain Crook. Hmm. This is him, right? That's not a food word.

781
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:27,560
That is who I'm thinking. Yeah. And there is a Captain Crook statue. I love how half ass all these characters are. Oh, yeah.

782
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:34,560
Universe description. Well, because they're all as we covered a little bit with the Crofts, they're all stolen from. Yeah. Right. Right.

783
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:40,560
The Crofts original. It seems like they struck gold with Ronald McDonald. They like invested all of their creative energy into that.

784
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:46,560
And then afterward, everything was just an afterthought. It was like first draft written on a napkin. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

785
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:56,560
Not nearly as the Hamburglar is good. Yeah. I will defend Mr. His motivation is clear. Such thought and consideration.

786
01:22:56,560 --> 01:23:02,560
Well, he's one of my he's my favorite character in fiction. What did everyone think about that attractive Hamburglar a few years ago?

787
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:12,560
Oh, yes. Sexy. Sexy. Yeah. I didn't care for him. Yeah. That seemed like an odd attempt to reconcile like McDonald's needing to be cool and right.

788
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:19,560
It seems kind of similar to what KFC is doing now with all of the different kernels of like a way to kind of get back into the spotlight.

789
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:40,560
The idea that they got any like feminist like wave of publicity off of having Reba be the first female Colonel. If you are giving KFC credit for this, if you think this is helping the world in any way, especially because she's frightening.

790
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:51,560
That is the most hideous image. The commercial too doesn't make sense at all. So it kind of alludes to the fact that she's been the Colonel this whole time and is in fact wearing a Reba mask. Right.

791
01:23:51,560 --> 01:24:04,560
Is that sort of that every time you've seen Reba in the world, right, that she's wearing a wig and is truly the Colonel. This is awful plotty for an ad for a chicken restaurant.

792
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:16,560
And the blowback I saw from it was people going like, well, well, KFC has entered the gender war now. More social justice warriors trying to shove their gender fluidity down our throats.

793
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:19,560
Oh my God. They're not wrong. They're not wrong.

794
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:24,560
Which again, I'm here for it. I'm here for it. So they won. I'm aboard.

795
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:41,560
Other McDonaldland characters, just because I'm here. Sure. That we may not be familiar with the professor. Do we know the professor? This guy with the yeah, I remember as a kid was seeing these characters in the periphery and feeling like their heyday must have come five years earlier.

796
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:52,560
Yeah, they are not continuing to like fill us in on the mythology of who they are. How about Cosmack? Cosmack. I have no idea. Cosmack's a big boy. Cosmack's a thick boy.

797
01:24:52,560 --> 01:25:10,560
But this was right around the time that Burger King was also like pushing the cool kids club down our throats. And there was like this weird need for having this like universe of different characters, Avengers like in their storylines.

798
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:14,560
We just want to eat fries. We don't care about that.

799
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:33,560
I liked the idea that you could run into one of the one of these characters might be making an appearance. Yes, I would. I'll say I was obsessed with the McDonaldland gang. Yeah. And I love the universe as I did the Burger King kids club. The kids club would mail you stuff, right? You would sign up and they would mail your magazine and puzzles and stuff. Wonderful. Yeah, it was wonderful.

800
01:25:33,560 --> 01:26:02,560
The last character I'll bring up in case you didn't know. Oh, I know this one. Of course. We've talked about him before many times, Jason and I alone. This is Grimace's uncle, Uncle O'Grimacey. No! And he's a Shamrock Shake Man. And he is a Shamrock Shake Man. Alright, now I'm back on board. He's sort of the McDonald's equivalent. I take back everything that I've said. So he's like neighbors with Cookie Opus, the Carvel Cookie. They don't share that universe. Why do you say that? Because they're certain. I'm shipping them right now.

801
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:32,560
Similar and fat and smiley. Well, Cookie Puss is the normal Carvel Ice Cream Cake and then Cookie Opus is the St. Patrick's Day version. Oh, I see what you're saying. Alright, I'll let you have that. Is it just green or where are the ingredients? It's green and he's got a little hat. Are you making this up? No. Cookie Opus is very real. This is not like a new 90s character either. If you'll see, this is a screenshot from an old commercial with Uncle O'Grimacey. So he's been around for a long time. He's so funny. I don't think he gets rolled out. He's fatter than Grimacey.

802
01:26:32,560 --> 01:27:02,560
He is double the size of Grimacey. There are two men in that suit. There must be. There's one man and then five kids surrounding him in the belly area. It's like part of the Nutcracker when that one... I'm going to break down the Nutcracker plot for you guys. That one woman lifts her skirt and then five kids come out. You guys know. I experience culture. Really? Okay. Whatever dance that is. That's what O'Grimacey is doing. Uncle O'Grimacey. We'll see that in that Disney Nutcracker that's coming out that I have no idea about.

803
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:13,560
No desire. No, you mean Nutcracker and the Curse of the Four Realms? Is it a live action? It's a live action. It's not Curse. It's like Nutcracker and something of the Four Realms.

804
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:24,560
There needs to be a name for that area between animated and live action that these Disney movies are. The Bergen movies. Lion King is not live action because it can't be. Jungle Book isn't live action.

805
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:35,560
It's referred to as a tax write off. It is a write off and it doesn't do well. The Nutcracker and the Four Realms is the name of this upcoming Nutcracker film. Who's in the film?

806
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:43,560
Well, thank you for asking. It is starring Mackenzie Foy, Keira Knightley, Helen Mirren, and Morgan Freeman.

807
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:56,560
Okay. This is why we don't... We are so much more strongly Theme Park fans than we are Disney fans. And if we were Disney fans, we would have to care about Nutcracker and the Curse of the Forbidden Realm.

808
01:27:56,560 --> 01:28:02,560
I will tell you this. I was at D23 when they announced a lot of these movies last year.

809
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:16,560
The crowd screaming, Four Realms! Four Realms! Everything they showed. I mean, whatever it was, Wrinkle in Time or if it was a clip of Lin-Manuel Miranda in Mary Poppins.

810
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:32,560
People losing their shit. This weird Wreck-It Ralph 2 scene that I didn't personally care for. People loved it. Then they played the trailer for Nutcracker and the Four Realms and it ate shit in there.

811
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:33,560
Amazing!

812
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:45,560
And it was not... These are the biggest nerds in this room that will just throw them red meat and they love it. The Nutcracker and the Four Realms, not that psyched about it as a whole audience.

813
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:54,560
It's kind of like how almost... It's almost a guarantee if you go to Comic-Con, whatever has the biggest building wrap or poster is going to be a failure.

814
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:55,560
Yes, that's true.

815
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:58,560
What was the one a few years ago? Sky Realm or Sky...

816
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:01,560
I don't even remember. I hadn't heard of it until the billboards were like...

817
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:02,560
Valerian and the four...

818
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:03,560
Oh yeah.

819
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:04,560
And the Four Realms.

820
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:06,560
And the Planet of Four Realms.

821
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:09,560
I think it's like the clunkier title though, because that's a pretty clunky title.

822
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:10,560
Yes.

823
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:11,560
I mean, that also too.

824
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:13,560
If you can't recall it offhand, then you're not going to see it.

825
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:17,560
If you can't recall anything where it's like, beloved European comic, it's like, oh, Americans don't care. Americans...

826
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:18,560
Yeah.

827
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:21,560
If that was the case, Osterix and Obelisk would be all over America.

828
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:27,560
Rex's girlfriend in France would be here by now.

829
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:28,560
Yeah.

830
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:29,560
Did you see Rex's girlfriend?

831
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:30,560
No.

832
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:31,560
Maybe they took that out.

833
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:32,560
No, I didn't.

834
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:38,560
There's this odd... I think I talked about it on the show once before that at the end, because when I went, they had not changed over Star Tours yet.

835
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:46,560
So on the way out, there was this odd silent robot that was clanking around, but not speaking and vaguely seemed female.

836
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:50,560
And then I looked it up and there is video where you can't see her in action.

837
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:56,560
And she was like gushing with praise about Rex, the Star Tours pilot and his bravery.

838
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:57,560
Oh yeah.

839
01:29:57,560 --> 01:30:02,560
And I guess it's defined as Rex's girlfriend, although I don't think her dialogue explicitly explains that.

840
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:07,560
But they're going to get married just like Kitty and Kitty Boy.

841
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:16,560
I would love to see Rex's wedding and Rex and Rex's girlfriend in little bow ties that are maybe still made out of gears or whatever.

842
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:27,560
I think maybe... I know in your career, you don't want to do a lot of stuff with IP, but if there was a movie about Rex and Rex's girlfriend getting married, I think maybe you would write that.

843
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:36,560
There's only one IP that I would care to get super invested in, which is the world of Rex.

844
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:41,560
And I could not have been more disappointed that Rex appeared in one of those cartoons.

845
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:48,560
He was just boring. He just said some fucking Star Wars boring ass transit kind of dialogue.

846
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:53,560
Rex is funny. He's the best. He's the coolest. He's my hero.

847
01:30:53,560 --> 01:31:05,560
I want to make the movie that's about him not flying or doing Star Wars stuff, but just meeting that girlfriend and then planning the wedding and having a lot of problems planning the wedding.

848
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:09,560
Sure. They're like sucking all the meat off of the bone.

849
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:18,560
Like, listen, it's like the hangover except the wedding is between droids and then all the calamity happens.

850
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:21,560
It's Father of the Bride meets the Star Wars universe.

851
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:25,560
And there can be another can be a Frank-esque robot as well.

852
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:27,560
A fuss budget.

853
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:30,560
America's favorite fictional character, Frank.

854
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:36,560
Frank. Why isn't Frank anywhere in Disneyland Paris? Martin Short's Father of the Bride wedding.

855
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:40,560
Well, that's what the wedding pavilion is named after in Florida.

856
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:41,560
We talked about it before.

857
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:42,560
Oh, you're right.

858
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:50,560
The wedding pavilion by the Grand Floridian of Florida is named after Martin Short's character.

859
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:51,560
That's incredible.

860
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:53,560
I didn't know that. That's amazing.

861
01:31:53,560 --> 01:32:00,560
Similarly, Annette's Diner in Disney Village is named after Annette Funicello.

862
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:01,560
So that's a little touch.

863
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:02,560
That was my question.

864
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:03,560
I liked that.

865
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:06,560
Annette's, by the way, Annette's is like a diner.

866
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:11,560
Yeah, it's a massive two story diner. All of these restaurants are gigantic.

867
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:12,560
Huge, yes.

868
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:13,560
It's like a 50s diner.

869
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:16,560
But it's like an airplane hangar. It's so huge.

870
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:20,560
That famous 50 diner style, elevators and staircases.

871
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:27,560
Which apparently they have waitresses on roller skates and they go up the stairs on them.

872
01:32:27,560 --> 01:32:28,560
Oh, wow.

873
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:30,560
I was trying to find video of like, is it a thing?

874
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:35,560
Is it a trick that they know how to do it gracefully going up and down stairs?

875
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:41,560
Or do these people have to just sadly skate by skate, go up and down stairs carrying food all day?

876
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:43,560
I'm going to say a little column A, a little column B.

877
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:47,560
Yeah, it's between interesting and depressing.

878
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:54,560
There's also a two story Earl of Sandwich and got to be the funniest restaurant that I came across.

879
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:56,560
Five Guys. There's a Five Guys.

880
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:58,560
There are Five Guys everywhere.

881
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:03,560
Also, Five Guys is the first thing that you see when you walk into Disneyland, that whole area.

882
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:04,560
Oh, really?

883
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:11,560
That's the entrance and then there's like a little bit like the pre Disney Village kind of restaurants and businesses.

884
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:15,560
The first thing is Five Guys and then maybe the back of the movie theater.

885
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:18,560
So that's the icon of the land is the Five Guys.

886
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:19,560
Really?

887
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:21,560
The castle is the icon of Disneyland Paris.

888
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:34,560
But in France, the Five Guys are America, Great Britain, Russia, China and the Five Victor, the ally powers.

889
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:36,560
Oh, now we got where you were going with that.

890
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:38,560
They changed the mythology.

891
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:39,560
The permanent security council.

892
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:45,560
I thought you were going to give like like it's Gerard de Pardue.

893
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:48,560
The guy from the artist.

894
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:50,560
The dog?

895
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:51,560
Yeah, the dog.

896
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:52,560
Augie.

897
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:53,560
Augie, thank you.

898
01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:54,560
Rest in peace, Augie.

899
01:33:54,560 --> 01:34:04,560
By the way, I was looking up things that had happened at I was like, are there any big official events happen at the Planet Hollywood in Disneyland Paris?

900
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:09,560
And it did host a premiere of a film that John Dujardin from the artist is currently in.

901
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:12,560
And the movie is called Hell Phone.

902
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:14,560
And let me show you guys a photo of this.

903
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:17,560
It is a movie about a demonic cell phone.

904
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:23,560
And I'm looking at the director and the star of the movie, seeming super cocky and proud about Hell Phone.

905
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:24,560
This is in 2007.

906
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:27,560
And the phone is like a little little devil guy.

907
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:31,560
It has little little like double ear antennas.

908
01:34:31,560 --> 01:34:39,560
Yeah, it seems to be like a I can't think of an equivalent like fucked up horror comedy.

909
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:42,560
What's the John dies at the end or something?

910
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:43,560
Idol fans.

911
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:44,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

912
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:45,560
Kind of.

913
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:48,560
Yeah, like a raunchy high school.

914
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:55,560
So yeah, when you're at Disneyland Planet Hollywood, remember that's part of history.

915
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:57,560
It was the premiere of Hell Phone.

916
01:34:57,560 --> 01:35:01,560
I've also got a photo of what is a few.

917
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:05,560
One is Stallone and Depardieu looking.

918
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:07,560
Oh, yeah.

919
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:11,560
And those giant planet Hollywood Jackets.

920
01:35:11,560 --> 01:35:12,560
Yeah.

921
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:14,560
Oh, but they're real like they're so cool.

922
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:21,560
Crispy looking real like shiny leather jackets because these are jackets that are meant to be worn once and never again.

923
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:22,560
Yeah, that's true.

924
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:29,560
They're brand new and they never shoved into Depardieu's closet forever unless maybe puked on it or something.

925
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:36,560
I will say also that I was going to say like so all of the restaurants in Disney Village are two stories and huge.

926
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:39,560
They all have incredible gift shops.

927
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:44,560
So they're surrounded by all the Disney stores and you can get all the Disney merch there.

928
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:49,560
But the gift shops within the restaurants, it's like the gaudiest, like most disconnected,

929
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:55,560
Disney like stuff you can get by playing skeeball at Chuck E. Cheese kind of bullshit.

930
01:35:55,560 --> 01:35:59,560
So it's like a lot of weird baseball caps and like things that have nothing to do with anything.

931
01:35:59,560 --> 01:36:09,560
I found a sign that is similar like kind of big, big obnoxious letterman jackets and the poster.

932
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:12,560
I couldn't even I don't know where it was advertising.

933
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:16,560
You would get these, I guess some store in Disney Village had these letterman jackets.

934
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:19,560
I just saw an outdoor poster for it that says be preppy.

935
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:24,560
And then under that NYC and then forty nine ninety euro.

936
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:26,560
What more is there to say?

937
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:28,560
You get it. You don't even know where to go. Find them.

938
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:30,560
We did enough for you.

939
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:35,560
Yeah, there's a lack of respect that's universally acknowledged throughout all these merch stations.

940
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:37,560
Yeah, yeah. They're rushing you through.

941
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:39,560
They're they're leaving you up to dry.

942
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:44,560
Eat this crepe and take this letterman jacket, you dumb bitch.

943
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:47,560
Did you guys go to the Rainforest Cafe at all?

944
01:36:47,560 --> 01:36:49,560
I did not. We dipped in.

945
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:54,560
I have weird connections to the Rainforest Cafe because I actually used to work in college.

946
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:57,560
I went to Chapman right by Disneyland. Oh, no kidding.

947
01:36:57,560 --> 01:37:01,560
Yeah. And worked in the gift shop at Rainforest Cafe in downtown Disney.

948
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:07,560
So it's weird every time, even though no one would remember me and like it doesn't matter.

949
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:12,560
But I feel like I'm crossing this like haunted threshold every time I walk into a Rainforest Cafe.

950
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:18,560
There's a real issue there, which is that I was thinking about going to Chapman.

951
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:22,560
And then I went down with a with a friends to check out the area.

952
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:25,560
And we went to that Rainforest Cafe after.

953
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:35,560
And I got way too stoned and had just like a like really freaked out, upsetting dinner where like I was actually frightened of all the gorillas and stuff.

954
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:37,560
And it made me decide to not go to Chapman.

955
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:44,560
For some reason, I tied those things together. I can't go to Chapman. Too many gorillas jumping out at you.

956
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:51,560
I think it did give me this. It made me feel like it might be depressing to hang out in Orange County for four years, which I don't.

957
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:57,560
But that was unfair of me because I was an idiot who took a drug that he doesn't like.

958
01:37:57,560 --> 01:38:01,560
So I don't know how was being in Orange County for.

959
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:08,560
It was interesting because so I grew up in North Hollywood and grew up as a ska kid when I was in high school.

960
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:15,560
So I spent all of my youth taking the Disneyland bus from downtown to go to ska shows on the weekend.

961
01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:17,560
Where? The House of Blues?

962
01:38:17,560 --> 01:38:22,560
Yeah, like sort of all around. I had friends that would pick me up from like the Disneyland bus station.

963
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:27,560
And then we would like go see like the Aquabats at like, yeah, House of Blues or Chain Reaction or something.

964
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:31,560
So it's very OC. Just every weekend. Every weekend. Yeah.

965
01:38:31,560 --> 01:38:38,560
I mean, chances are. Yeah. So I spent all that time like kind of escaping to Orange County.

966
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:44,560
And then by the time I went to Chapman, I started doing standup in college and spent the weekends escaping to L.A.

967
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:47,560
So I never it was like this sort of flip flop.

968
01:38:47,560 --> 01:38:54,560
But it was nice working at downtown Disney for that brief period, because then, of course, you get to go to Disneyland on top of that.

969
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:59,560
So I would constantly like wake up early and like go on one ride before my first college class.

970
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:03,560
Then like walk into my class and be like, I've already been to Disneyland today.

971
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:08,560
And no one cared. And, you know, I was the weirdo riding like pirates by myself.

972
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:12,560
It was fantastic. Yeah. But actually working. Yeah.

973
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:17,560
It was it was hard to be so close to that temptation, too.

974
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:23,560
But then working there helped that. But my job at the Rainforest Cafe was very demeaning.

975
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:30,560
I basically was the person that interrupts your dinner and asks if you want a photo to commemorate your time at the Rainforest Cafe.

976
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:33,560
Yeah. Oh, it is the worst job. Yeah. It's the worst.

977
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:36,560
Yeah. People probably brush you off real hard. Yeah.

978
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:41,560
Yeah. I feel like I've been rude to those people. And you're not like. Rightfully so.

979
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:45,560
I shouldn't be mad at the person. You're mad at the idea that why would I?

980
01:39:45,560 --> 01:39:49,560
And I know that's going to be nineteen dollars for no reason. It's so dumb. Yeah.

981
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:54,560
And I was just like this meek little 19 year old interrupting like 21st birthdays and other bullshit.

982
01:39:54,560 --> 01:40:01,560
And then without fail, like the memory card would jumble and I would never get a photo out and then get yelled at by my manager.

983
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:14,560
So it's like I already have the unpleasant experience of interrupting so many birthdays and so many, you know, like grad nights and then like cut to later that night when the one person wanted to buy a twenty dollar photo.

984
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:20,560
I'd be like, I don't know what happened. Like I had it on the file and it just was the worst.

985
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:29,560
So, yeah. The Rainforest Cafe, the picture of it from the outside, like the one in Anaheim, even though the food inside might be horrible. Yeah.

986
01:40:29,560 --> 01:40:36,560
Is cool looking. Yeah. It's nice to look at. It's nice to look at. It's got a lot of water. It's Disney levelish theming. Yeah.

987
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:46,560
The one here and maybe I'm wrong. I know exactly what you're going to say. It's like it's a tiny little entrance way that's kind of themed and then there are just a bunch like two tall mushrooms outside.

988
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:57,560
Yeah. Yeah. What are those? Bizarre mushrooms. Also, it's like the view I saw was only themed halfway up the building and the rest was like corrugated metal. It's big and blocky. Yeah.

989
01:40:57,560 --> 01:41:11,560
It's bad. Yeah. And the mushrooms, I don't understand, like the rainforest, like you could just put some fake trees, a couple of fake trees there maybe if you don't have that much money. Instead, like mushroom, like fungus, like where fungus is outside of this restaurant.

990
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:22,560
There's also, I don't know if you guys saw in your research, but there is like this little cage just like right off of the entrance and it looks like this little like fake creaky lagoon-y kind of thing.

991
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:35,560
But it's just like this really shitty rubber robot of an alligator that like every five minutes, just long enough for you to go, is this going to move? It's not going to move. It'll open its mouth and that's it.

992
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:47,560
Make a sound or just open its mouth? Maybe, but like we kind of like just sort of peered in and had that moment of like ehh and it moved a little bit. I think maybe made a small sound, but it was nothing spectacular.

993
01:41:47,560 --> 01:42:02,560
But people all around it were reacting. There's no aesthetic plan here. It's all over the, the Disney Village logo by the way is hideous. Oh my god, yeah, the logo, gee. It's every color and every font all at once. You couldn't like memorize it and draw it.

994
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:18,560
The Cafe Mickey stuff too. Yeah, I wrote down that that's an aesthetic barf. An Italian restaurant, but seems more like what an Italian American, like it seems very. And there's no way to tell what cuisine it is until you're like right up close.

995
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:33,560
You can't even see from afar, like there was, because that was something that we were like, oh, maybe that could be where we have our meal here because we haven't even touched on like the weird King Arthur themed restaurant. King Ludwig's.

996
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:55,560
Yes, but that was like the one I was like, maybe it's maybe it's just like sort of nice, like basic American cuisine and then it's Italian and but it's also connected to the New York Hotel in a weird way, isn't it? It's like right around the corner from it. Yeah, I think so. I saw a video that was listing the top five restaurants in Disney Village, Paris and the Cafe Mickey was one of them.

997
01:42:55,560 --> 01:43:11,560
But but in the video, it's like the food is nothing much to speak of, but it's where you get to meet Mickey or whatever. And that was the second or maybe third time he had said the food isn't much to speak of and like, but this is a you're made a video about restaurants and your top five.

998
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:40,560
You three of them, you think the food is bad. That is really what you're dealing with there. I mean, they should just clone Disney. Disney Springs is so great. Like, yes, I think that's all anybody want is like a like an act. How about just an actual type of restaurant? That's my plus it up is just like not some bizarre hybrid of French and hot dog or Italian, but not committed to how crazy is it to you're in a city you're 45 minutes away from a restaurant.

999
01:43:40,560 --> 01:44:04,560
You're 45 minutes away from a city that is full of wonderful restaurants. Just one would make all the difference. Put a pret amazure in there. Exactly the confidence of just one kind of cuisine. The fact that it has like the same kind of like self consciousness of like a cheesecake factory scattered menu, you know, just throwing pasta and sandwiches and like all of that stuff.

1000
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:25,560
But you I would dream of a cheesecake factory. Yeah, well, if only there were anything of that level of consistency, something you could trust. We did. Where did you didn't eat anywhere on the in this? No, no, I didn't. We just sort of poked around and like sort of ate it because they have a lot of stands that are just like crepe stands and different sort of sweet treats.

1001
01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:44,560
So we kind of poked around there and did things that we considered safe in that. But we did eat inside the park in the Disney Studios, like the Aerosmith Alley area. Oh, all right. Got sandwiches at like one of those shitty like you're on the studio lot, like whatever it's called to kind of grab and go.

1002
01:44:44,560 --> 01:45:02,560
Love to eat at a big commissary. Exactly. Yeah, just, you know, so outside of my normal life, I wanted to really dip my toe in. Lights camera dinner. Yeah, pretty much. Lazily named. You know, you know where I am, I would be remiss if we didn't if we finished this episode before I

1003
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:18,560
scolded the California Grill, the single worst meal experience I've had in a Disney park. It was the first meal of the of our honeymoon in two weeks. Maybe the worst meal experience I've ever had.

1004
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:33,560
And where is this? This is in that that beautiful ornate Disneyland hotel at the entrance of that because we this a lot of our frustration is we like went up and down that Disney Village zone, trying to find something edible, didn't didn't seem like anything was going to work.

1005
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:44,560
We didn't want to settle for Earl of Sandwich. We started going to the hotels. Those places were all either booked up or closed and that same kind of attitude of like we have been booked for months.

1006
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:58,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Why wouldn't you know this? Exactly. So we ended up going to the Disney to the California Grill. There's a very great restaurant called the California Grill at the top of the contemporary. Wonderful. Yes. One of the best Disney restaurants. So we assumed it might be in the same family as that.

1007
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:25,560
So we went and put our name in and then went to this like DMV waiting room equivalent, not decor wise, like decor wise. It looks it's kind of like Main Street wallpaper and it's called the Main Street Grill. But it's just, you know, like 17 children jammed into every chair and people spilling out and screaming and chaos and like whatever the, you know, the French equivalent of rednecks are.

1008
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:40,560
There's a lot of those around just shitty, shitty t shirts and shitty attitudes. You could order a drink in the Main Street Grill and Erin ordered a Chardonnay and the waitress was like, oh, Chardonnay.

1009
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:59,560
What the fuck? How my wife said Chardonnay. What? Amazing. Which I've watched her order a lot of Chardonnays in this marriage and let me tell you, she says it perfectly. I don't know what she could have done differently. Is there some French way of saying it? Do you pronounce it ham bone?

1010
01:46:59,560 --> 01:47:14,560
What about Le Chardonnay? There you go. You know your French. Orangina? Orangina as well? That's what they were there for not ordering an Orangina. I think there's also regions of France where they say croque monsieur.

1011
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:34,560
Yes. Yeah. Anyway, then you get after a two hour wait where we're scolded for pronunciation of not French words. Then we then we end up in this in the restaurant, which is like it's like patterns that are like it's like what American girl dolls wear.

1012
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:49,560
It's just this kind of like doily Easter dress kind of environment. Like a less charming version of Mrs. Knott's chicken dinner. And then just like endless wait for all the food. It's cold by the time it comes.

1013
01:47:49,560 --> 01:48:10,560
She got this vegetable medley that was there was a squash that was impossible to cut. Like she made a lot of goes at it. Didn't make barely a divot. Bailed on it. All told 250 euro like competitive to the fanciest meal we had the entire time on our.

1014
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:25,560
Like on our nice honey moon. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I believe so. Something like that's like a Michelin tasting menu. Yeah. Jesus. Fuck prices you would pay for multiple Michelin stars for three hours of waiting for attitude for doilies.

1015
01:48:25,560 --> 01:48:41,560
There's we found video that we took of it where we're all we're we're having meltdowns where and then we scheduled this where this was the end of our honeymoon. We just been in Florence, one of the greatest cities in the world. And then we're like, do we do the planet Hollywood? No. You want to try the California grill.

1016
01:48:41,560 --> 01:48:55,560
I wonder how that is. Oh, the worst dining experience we ever had. You had that experience. Hey, that's all right. Look, I've clearly gotten over it. I didn't. I mean, to our podcast complaining about the experience or not. I feel in a good place about it. Yeah.

1017
01:48:55,560 --> 01:49:12,560
I mean, it's fun. It is very funny to think about, like, the safest options in this area are probably five guys, McDonald's, Earl of Sandwich and Starbucks. Yeah. Yeah. Like, which which you wouldn't be. I mean, that'd be like, I guess everything's close. That'd be like if I was at downtown Disney in Anaheim.

1018
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:33,560
It's like, oh, it's late. Most places are. All right. I'll do. You know, you know what I went and ordered at the Earl of Sandwich was a banana because a banana, you know what you are getting. You can see that there is, you know, nothing is nobody has cut into the peel and added salt or cheese or grease.

1019
01:49:33,560 --> 01:50:01,560
It has its own wrapper that I know has not been befouled. So I appreciated the simple banana. That was the best food I had in Disney Village. It was a banana. Yeah. That's just which is saying something that and this all basically I think it taught me something about my capacity for Kitsch and going and experiencing insane places that you know are a little bad and hokey.

1020
01:50:01,560 --> 01:50:18,560
But you'll have a good time. Food is my hard line. Yeah. If there's if there's one solid meal I can have, I can do endless hours of Kitsch. But I just we felt like trapped. Like, what are we going to do? This does feel like the evil version of your aesthetic.

1021
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:41,560
This feels like what you like of what I know you like. This feels like the pervert like the cartoon Satan, you know, your shoulder with the go to the phone on my shoulder. Right. Like you get the one thing you love in the world, but you know, it's going to burn every time you take a bite of your sandwich or something. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1022
01:50:41,560 --> 01:50:56,560
Because I think that like our capacity for the Kitsch over the quality of food, it's great if it's I mean, not great, but like it's it's palatable if it's just one restaurant out of the whole collection of restaurants. I feel like you kind of get that with downtown Disney regular.

1023
01:50:56,560 --> 01:51:11,560
But then there are so many other restaurants in that area that kind of like elevated and make up for it where, you know, you have like the New Orleans style cage and stuff that's like pretty good in comparison to the shit show that is a rainforest cafe. Sure. Sure. Yeah.

1024
01:51:11,560 --> 01:51:27,560
Kind of be like, well, that's a given a take, but the fact that all of this is a strikeout. Yeah. It just speaks. All they need is one and five guys at least is that is oddly a step in the right direction unless there's some weird overthought way.

1025
01:51:27,560 --> 01:51:41,560
Like some Renaissance themed five guys. You know, yeah, you don't have peanuts that are free. They have what's the French? They have weird frog legs. That's my weird. You throw the frog legs on the ground.

1026
01:51:41,560 --> 01:51:58,560
Are there the bones on the floor? I would actually enjoy that. Yeah, that would be even being a vegan. I would enjoy that. Yeah, it's entire frogs. You break off the legs yourself and then spit out the frog skeletons onto the ground. Have you ever eaten tried to eat a frog leg? No, have you?

1027
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:15,560
Well, a friend friend, you're really dissing Grissom. We have not. He'll eventually be on the show. He we went somewhere downtown and he ordered them. He's like, yeah, I just got them for the table. What? And like, I eat meat, but it was a full fraud.

1028
01:52:15,560 --> 01:52:32,560
I was going to break them off the body and I didn't. I couldn't do it. I could not do it. I haven't had them presented like that. Have you had turtle soup? No turtle. I've had turtle before. Neither of these turtle. I've had kangaroo to that one was not a hell. Yeah.

1029
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:57,560
List the animals you've eaten. Boar, kangaroo, buffalo. Keep going. Venison, crocodile, gator, pepperoni. I think I've had gator. Pepperoni. Pepperoni. Muskrat. I've never had muskrat, but I've had like game. I guess I guess it was just someone had made gate like something they just call the game into jerky. I guess it was venison deer.

1030
01:52:57,560 --> 01:53:17,560
Disneyland cat. Yeah. Disneyland cat. Caught one and fried it up just for fun. Sure. Yeah. I mean, I think the kitsch that I will agree. I when I go into the kitsch sort of setting, my aspect, I manage my expectations and it's like, well, at least I can get like a burger and fries. Yeah. Fine.

1031
01:53:17,560 --> 01:53:35,560
Like a veggie burger, something like that. Fine. Like, you know, it's not going to be like the best thing in the world, but I do have to agree. Like five guys. It reminds me of the way that downtown Disney and Disney Springs are like kind of changing where there's more fast, casual sort of like as tastes have changed.

1032
01:53:35,560 --> 01:53:51,560
TGI Friday more like whatever Panera or Chipotle's. Right. Yeah. I think the I think parks in general are evolving and I think the idea that theme park food is bad is starting to go by the wayside a little bit. Yeah. Yeah.

1033
01:53:51,560 --> 01:54:07,560
And I think the sense of yeah, there's decent restaurants in downtown Disney seems like Disney Springs has a lot and even like universal Hollywood, which has always been horrible. That Harry Potter. I didn't need it. The Harry Potter restaurant seems to get great. It's good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And their beers and stuff are good.

1034
01:54:07,560 --> 01:54:21,560
I just want I hope that we keep going down this path because some theme park restaurants are legitimately some of my favorite restaurants anywhere. It's like there's nothing dictating that theme park food has to be a joke or stupid or bad.

1035
01:54:21,560 --> 01:54:33,560
And boy, Disney Studios Paris or Disney Village Paris offers a Jurassic Park esque lesson and what happens if you aren't careful in your in your design and your plotting.

1036
01:54:33,560 --> 01:54:49,560
I think that's just like a case of mismanaged fun too because when you go into like those rainforest cafe type restaurants and you're looking around at all the decor and you're going well that costs a lot of money to get like a robot gorilla that like swats around every couple minutes.

1037
01:54:49,560 --> 01:55:10,560
And literally they're going to skimp on like you know this quarter pounder burger I'm about to enjoy or this you know fettuccine. But the fact that it's all of that all the time. Another thing that was kind of bizarre that I'd never experienced at another theme park where inside the theme parks like I think the Disney Studios Park closed at like I want to say 8 p.m.

1038
01:55:10,560 --> 01:55:24,560
or Disneyland closed at 10 the restaurants would close an hour before the theme park actually closed. So at one point we were just walking around going what the fuck do we do. Like what if we were planning to eat at the end of the day.

1039
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:41,560
I had that experience like in the in the like slower times in Florida maybe like in off seasons where it's just like yeah we're closing early. Right. Right. But yeah I don't know. We were there in the dead of winter we were there in December and you could tell it was like a less staffed time.

1040
01:55:41,560 --> 01:55:57,560
So a ton of restaurants just not open at all. They had a pizza planet that wasn't open. They had like decent sounding places. Right. So and and they're just like just kind of funneling people into like the four restaurants that are open. So they're all super crowded lines out the door.

1041
01:55:57,560 --> 01:56:16,560
It was a it was such a food crisis. Yeah. Did you enjoy your your Disney Paris experience overall or was it. I did I did. I'm glad I did it. I mean I feel like if you're going to do the international parks you should probably do Disney Paris before Tokyo because Tokyo was such an amazing experience.

1042
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:31,560
OK. Yeah. Like I kept being like oh but it's not you know and I haven't been to any of the China ones and I plan to knock them all off my list. But yeah I'm glad I did do it. I will say the Ratatouille ride is one of the best rides I've ever been on in my life.

1043
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:47,560
Oh wow. Yeah. It's so good. And that restaurant supposedly is. Yeah. Yeah. We didn't get a chance to eat there but that whole area is kind of bizarre because it's like a mini Paris in Paris. Yeah. And and so that was kind of interesting.

1044
01:56:47,560 --> 01:57:03,560
But like the ride though. Well what great ride. Oh it's such a great ride. I mean as far as like a ride story goes like my husband Mike and I we were sort of riffing on the fact that especially at Universal like ride stories can be so chaotic. Like I don't know what's happening on the Transformers ride.

1045
01:57:03,560 --> 01:57:18,560
I'm just talking about that. Yeah. Yeah. I couldn't pass a quiz about that. I don't know. But most rides that are that style it's like go go go. All right. Now we got to go over here. Oh now here's this. What are you guys doing. You know it's just like a lot of those kind of soundbites.

1046
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:28,560
And then by the end without fail it's always one character being like thank you for your bravery. I didn't do anything. I'm just sitting here. You saved the minions. You saved the players. You saved the minions.

1047
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:45,560
But then the ride story for Ratatouille like you get it. It's a dark ride. You're going to shrink down to I did air quotes like people could hear them. You can quote shrink down to a mouse's size and then you're kind of scattering around.

1048
01:57:45,560 --> 01:58:00,560
And it was like such a great parallel to the experience of the movie. And it just was done really well. It's in 3D and there are all these really great screens. We did. We almost had a walk out which my husband was very excited about because he's heard about it through your podcast.

1049
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:14,560
So every time we got on a ride he's like do you think we're going to do a walk out. And we did not because he kept saying it. But he cursed it. He cursed it. But we went as far as sitting on the ride and then it stopped and we had to go and they gave us fast food.

1050
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:24,560
And then we had to go and they gave us fast passes. And my joke for the day was oh they kept having to stop the ride to fetch a child cigarettes. That was my Disney Paris joke that no one else appreciated.

1051
01:58:24,560 --> 01:58:29,560
That's right. Children love to smoke in France and the age of consent is 12.

1052
01:58:29,560 --> 01:58:34,560
I said that I actually did a stand up show when I was in France. It was an English speaking show.

1053
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:47,560
And yeah I was dreading it all day. I thought that it was going to be a real shit show but it actually was pretty great. And I opened with like my Disneyland Paris riffs which were not appreciated.

1054
01:58:47,560 --> 01:58:58,560
So maybe Parisian people don't go to Disneyland Paris. I think that must be it. Surely they were hilarious so that must not be a factor.

1055
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:05,560
They worked here. They work with a deep theme partner audience which is the only audience you should care about I feel.

1056
01:59:05,560 --> 01:59:15,560
Yeah. Yeah. But thank you. And I do. But yeah that was a real highlight. And unfortunately Phantom Manor was closed so we didn't enjoy sharing that.

1057
01:59:15,560 --> 01:59:29,560
I know. I know. But we did our first ride was going on the Space Mountain out there and that was great because they've got fucking loops and like little corkscrew twirls.

1058
01:59:29,560 --> 01:59:40,560
It's Jules Verne. Yeah. It shoots you like a bullet in a gun and you're just like zipping through and they outfitted it to be Star Wars like so. Oh right. They had that going for it too.

1059
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:50,560
Yeah. I heard it was good for my wife who went while I waited outside. Oh no. That launch starts there boy. Got the quick launch. Yeah. I get it. I get it.

1060
01:59:50,560 --> 02:00:04,560
It seems like an amazing ride though. Yeah. It was super fun. I wasn't scared. Yeah. One thing that I realized quickly is that there isn't a similar sense of like waking up early and camping out culture there.

1061
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:17,560
Oh no which is huge in Tokyo. Huge in Tokyo. Yeah. And huge out here. But we got there. I was surprised to learn that the parks didn't open until 10 a.m. I was like it's about to be spring break guys.

1062
02:00:17,560 --> 02:00:28,560
Like up your game. So we got there especially early and like ran to Space Mountain and almost the first people in line like nobody. Nobody came. The ride operator was finishing their cigarette.

1063
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:43,560
I had the same experience when I went to Dollywood where I approached it in the same way. I'm like surely people are going to be lined up. No not at all. And like I beat the actual employee. I ran to like tour Dolly's tour bus and I beat the employee.

1064
02:00:43,560 --> 02:00:59,560
Like she actually called after me and was like wait ma'am ma'am ma'am what are you doing? And then she like ran behind me. She screamed and then like quickly reset herself and went welcome Dolly Parton's tour bus. This is our tour bus from 1991 to 1997. Do you want to look at our wigs?

1065
02:00:59,560 --> 02:01:09,560
And I was like yes I do. Oh boy. We got to see those wigs. We got to talk. We got to talk Dollywood at some point. Yeah. You guys got to go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1066
02:01:09,560 --> 02:01:24,560
I want to try to go to Paris. I've always wanted to see Paris and I've always been like well I got to see Disneyland Paris. You got to go to Disneyland Paris. Yeah. Yeah. I got to see Disneyland Paris. I looked up. I could see you coming back from Disneyland Paris and going guys you were wrong. I love you.

1067
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:53,560
I will probably love it. I will probably love it. I looked up. There's a lot of great candy if you're into candy stuff. No he loves candy. I looked up a blog. The Disney tourist blog which is a husband wife who write about like they do trip reports and they go to the parks all over the world and they I just searched on Google search the blog name and Disney Village and their reaction seemed to be like we walked through it.

1068
02:01:53,560 --> 02:02:23,560
It was confusing but like they had like a hundred tips for like Disney Paris and stuff and I was like searched food and they're like there is a grocery store close by and many hotels have full kitchens and we recommend you take advantage of that. Yes. That's what we had. We had like a full kitchen in our hotel bizarrely. Yeah. Oh. But yeah that was that was weird. We haven't even gotten into the weird princess versus pirates thing. Oh yeah. Oh my god. Over there like the French

1069
02:02:23,560 --> 02:02:52,720
people have a weird affinity for pirates and probably specifically Jack Sparrow. I think they like personally relate to him on like a deeper level. He's a sleaze bag. Yeah. Like this is the only area where like the Johnny Depp wine video didn't shock anyone. And they do spend like a great bit of real estate on the property to Pirates of the Caribbean. There's like a whole Pirates of the Caribbean sort of area like a little island.

1070
02:02:52,720 --> 02:03:22,200
It's sort of instead of Tom Sawyer Island is like all pirates. It's a pirate thing. OK. OK. Yeah. Well some pirate restaurant or something if there's so pirate crazy to plus that up. Yeah. That's that Disney Village job. Try to figure out what Jack Sparrow's favorite meals are. He's probably he's probably a gourmand. He probably eats crazy. And all you crazy. I know a I know a prefix pirate themed menu available that they would like.

1071
02:03:23,720 --> 02:03:43,680
You mean the dinner. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just the soup that you love so much. Yeah. It's just the pitcher soup. All right. Good. So maybe the idea of a restaurant that'll save this whole thing is like a giant pitcher of soup and you can like release a spigot and then fill up a smaller pitcher of soup.

1072
02:03:43,680 --> 02:04:08,880
I have a new category for the podcast The Ride for our patented scale. You know we usually have plus it up. I'm suggesting maybe plus it down maybe just go all the way with it and add like a pet store and a check cashing business to do like let's just if it's already there let's just make it far removed from Disney and don't even maybe don't even call it just called the village.

1073
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:22,480
And then like you can go down there and there's a ninety nine cents store or something. Absolutely. So happens to be within the vicinity of Disney Paris. We are not associated with the sure they import pick pockets. Yes of course. They don't need to.

1074
02:04:22,480 --> 02:04:41,480
Okay. This is pretty abundant. So you're suggesting that the way to improve Disney Village Paris is for it to have any purpose whatsoever. Well I guess yes I'm sort of saying abandon cut it off from the rest of the resort and then maybe it'll really only be a better greater contrast of the magic of the actual park itself.

1075
02:04:41,480 --> 02:05:02,080
I have one more tiny plus it up idea which is don't have a giant creepy tent rusting away with no labels and empty marquees and a green fabric staircase that leads to an empty mound. These are also things you can go just walk up to in this place or the damn balloon.

1076
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:18,680
Oh yeah. Well that's in this that's that's in the spring. Oh that's the thing. The balloon is called Panorama Zeke and in Disney Studios Paris there's already a thing. There's a show called Cinemagique and Ani Magique. There's so much fucking magic.

1077
02:05:18,680 --> 02:05:40,480
We can check out the Ani Magique or any of that. Like it kind of felt like I forget what it's called. Oh the Philhar Magic. It kind of felt like in that sort of neighborhood. Yeah. Of show if only though just a little bit still our magic is I mean I was going to say my be a bueno in the wrong country.

1078
02:05:40,480 --> 02:06:10,280
Tray Tray many. Yeah. Yeah. I mean your feet. It makes me say our pirate. Oh boy. Well I was going to say that if there was anything though that could save the Disney Village I would say like why don't you just like double down on one restaurant like maybe just sort of demolish all of the non Disney store areas and just make it if you love pirate so much French people just make a giant pirate restaurant.

1079
02:06:10,280 --> 02:06:39,680
Combine all of the elements combine the Wild West show into it so you can use that arena. You walk into maybe like a huge skull similar to Pirates of the Caribbean and you're like in this you know cool waiting area with all of these you know different skeletons and so maybe a little bit like the catacombs too. Oh sure. And there could be the cut off the catacombs at the leg in terms of tourism. Yeah. No one needs to go there again. That was actually the best thing that we did our entire trip.

1080
02:06:39,680 --> 02:06:59,800
It was also the most metal thing I've ever seen in my entire. Yeah. But yeah just do a little bit of that you know get people excited for going to the real catacombs and then have Jack Sparrow's rum bar. You can get some appetizers. You could take all of the planet Hollywood merch and make it look like loot that the pirates stole.

1081
02:06:59,800 --> 02:07:27,800
Oh yeah. Just keep adding dreadlocks to things and then you can just sort of even the score with that. Yeah matey's you want to see the meteor from meteor man. We haven't even talked about the Armageddon thing. Oh my god. That's a whole other. We'll have to. We're easy dipping our toe into Paris. We knew there was a lot to cover. Yeah. The whole park. Right. Right. Right. For many hours and many hours but I'm glad we devoted so much time to Disney Village.

1082
02:07:27,800 --> 02:07:47,800
A like what quarter mile bad mall we've talked about. We've committed so much time to scolding this place and hey I thank you for helping us. Julie Prescott you survived podcast the ride. Thanks for. Yeah thanks for helping us make this mall feel bad.

1083
02:07:47,800 --> 02:08:10,800
It's my pleasure. As a lover of malls I do. I mean when I'm excited for the city walk thing I do love city walk sincerely. It was my middle school hangout. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I'm a valley kid. Yeah. Were you a Wizards fan. Yes. Yeah. I forget which birthday but I had I've had a birthday in pretty much every restaurant at city walk. Wow.

1084
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:26,800
Well then I think you will. You could probably factor into our city walk master plan. So perhaps we'll have to have to have you back around to talk about. I would love to. It's the sector of the. I don't want to spoil anything.

1085
02:08:26,800 --> 02:08:44,800
But but anything you'd like to plug or alert people to. Oh a couple things I have that Simpsons podcast. We're on a maximum fun so everything's coming up Simpsons and we have a collection of comedian type guests and then also occasionally we'll have people that
