00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Greetings fellow outdoorsmen!

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Getting nice and rustic here.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Talk about, you know, angling.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
There'll be a lot of angling talk from me, Scott Garner, and Mike Carlson.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm here. One of my friends in the backyard wrestling days in high school,

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
his gimmick name was the angler.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
He would come out and cast.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Just with his hand?

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
No, with his hand, yeah, mime type of a thing.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I was going to say, look, wrestling gets dangerous,

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
but you bring a fishing line and a hook up on the stage,

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
that's not what it is in wrestling.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Well, there's a stage.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But the ring, you could say, into the ring is generally what you mean, probably.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Okay, well now I've learned that, and now it's been officially confirmed what angling is.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I would have guessed it was about fishing, but I wasn't sure.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Jason, share it, and we aren't leaving you out.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yeah, I was going to say, with some hardcore matches,

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I feel like you could cast a fishing hook and line into someone.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yeah, I've seen in GCW, I've seen a spike go through somebody's cheek.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Pretty gross.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So you could do like a fish hook or something, or yeah, I'm sure.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I think they have. If you look it up, I'm sure.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm not going to look it up, but I'm sure.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Is angling just when you're...

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Here's the answer. I don't know the answer to that.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Casting is throwing it out, and then I think angling is...

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I don't know if it's associated more with fly fishing or traditional fishing.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I have no further information other than we knew it had something to do with fishing,

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
and somebody thought it was funny. I don't even want to take credit.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I don't remember if I came up with the angling.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Angling is just it, and again, I had to look it up to know for sure.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Again, my guess would have been angling is like it's it in general.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I think you could just call fishing...

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Oh, wait, no, it's fishing with a rod and a line, as opposed to with your bare hands.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Or a net, or what a grizzly bear does.

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Swatting, or a spear.

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Going in with your mouth. Yeah, that wouldn't be...

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Grizzly bears are not anglers.

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Or what Jason used to do is fish for pond eels.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Fish for pond eels.

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
If you recall, this is one of the famous Jason stories I learned when we first became friends,

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
that I was like, I don't know what you're talking about.

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That sounds like the little rascals did that.

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You're telling the listeners that the history of Jason bringing up something as if, of course,

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
and you saying, what the hell are you talking about, goes back to before the podcast.

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
This is no podcast pose that you or I are putting on.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
This is Herald Team era, I think.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
This is like 2010, 2011.

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Jason presented this to the friends on the Herald Team as if,

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
you know when you go and fish for pond eels?

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And we went, no, no one knows what you're talking about.

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
But how did you remind me how you angled for pond eels?

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So in the little neighborhood down the shore when my family had a little beach trailer,

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
there was a small lake that was connected to the marshes outside of Ocean City.

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And the lake kind of gave way to a little creek, crick, as we say.

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Of course.

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Back east.

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And then there was a little pond behind the bath houses where the washers and dryers were and stuff.

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So you'd ignore the loud sex sounds from the bath houses, the absolutely rapturous sex.

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Sex banging on the walls of the bath houses.

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
No, this is like a bath house next to us.

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's not that kind of bath house.

66
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
A swimming pool.

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Like this is like, it's like where you use the restroom.

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That could be anything you want it to be.

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's up to the imagination what kind of bath house it is.

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So, yeah, so we got fishing rods at some point.

71
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And people would just go out there or go like next to the pool and just like fish.

72
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And you would catch guppies or these little yellow fish that everyone just called sunnies.

73
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The one time we went to...

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Sunnies?

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Sunnies.

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
We haven't heard of sunnies.

77
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Sunnies.

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So, but then the one time we went to it, I think like we caught one guppy or something.

79
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's just catch and release.

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And then we just started catching eels.

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So I just always called them pond eels.

82
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
How long were they?

83
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Wow, they were long.

84
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yeah, they were a little long.

85
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Like 10 inches?

86
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yeah.

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So, I mean, you're just trying not to catch every now and then there'd be a snapper turtle back there.

88
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So you didn't want to catch one of those.

89
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And he wasn't on a hook.

90
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You had a hook at the end of the line or no?

91
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yeah, I had a hook at the end of the line.

92
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Oh, you did.

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So you were injuring these.

94
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And we were...

95
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You were injuring them.

96
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Well, but we were also giving them hot dogs.

97
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And then sharp cheddar cheese we found to be the thing they most liked.

98
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So you were way out of that park and left out.

99
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Sharp cheddar.

100
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You used hot dogs to fish for pond eels?

101
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Sharp cheddar.

102
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Sharp cheddar.

103
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I know one thing at a time.

104
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
But here's the thing.

105
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
If you cut up hot dogs, they fall apart really quickly.

106
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Like the fish, the fish just grab them and swim away.

107
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Sharp cheddar cheese.

108
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Or the young boys named Jason just grab them and run away.

109
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Well, I think we tried that as an alternate.

110
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The sharp cheddar cheese were like, oh, this is really sturdy on the end of the hook.

111
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And then the creatures in the pond just went wild for the sharp cheddar cheese.

112
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
They loved the sharp cheddar.

113
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
We kept catching things.

114
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So did the sunnies like the sharp cheddar?

115
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Did you feed sharp cheddar to the sunnies?

116
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I think it was kind of like 50-50 eels and sunnies.

117
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
But we just kept...

118
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Every time we would catch, we would just keep getting eels very quickly.

119
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And then you try mild cheddar and nothing.

120
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
They need a little more bite to it.

121
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's got to be sharp, extra sharp, and who knows?

122
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I don't know.

123
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You got more eels than you could deal with.

124
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I specifically remember sharp cheddar cheese

125
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
because we would just always have cheese and crackers around, you know.

126
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And was your preference sharp or was that the family's preference?

127
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I think my family's preference, usually Triscuits and sharp cheddar.

128
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Are they mad at you that you're taking their sharp cheddar,

129
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
their fine sharp cheddar they paid for out of their own pockets,

130
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
and you're giving it to eels?

131
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I was doing this with my dad and brother.

132
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
This is not a pilfering story.

133
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Okay, I'm still picturing a little rascals gang

134
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
that is in defiance of the parents.

135
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I didn't realize that parents were part of this.

136
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
No, I was terrified.

137
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And I was terrified when we caught anything.

138
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I was like, oh, we got to get it.

139
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
We got to send it back.

140
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
We don't want to kill it.

141
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
We got to get it off the hook.

142
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Good humanity to the...

143
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So never an eel fry.

144
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And then at the end of the day,

145
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
your reward with inherent sharp cheddar lining.

146
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Like, ooh, I can taste the cheddar in these eels.

147
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
That's their marinated cheddar.

148
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I was initially terrified because cartoons had taught me

149
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
eels are usually electrified,

150
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
and that I think it had to be explained to me

151
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
that those aren't very common, period,

152
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
let alone in this part of the world.

153
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Don't.

154
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Mom, dad, if I catch one of these eels,

155
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
am I not going to flash on and off, regular and then negative,

156
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
and you'll be able to see my skeleton on the inside

157
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
from the outside?

158
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm picturing you frying up an eel

159
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
and then putting it on a hot dog bun.

160
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Well, that is naturally like...

161
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Fits the shape.

162
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Hot dog bun or Kaiser roll, you know.

163
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Eel-wrapped hot dog, yeah.

164
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Ooh.

165
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I also just...

166
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Because this is only in the last so many years I realized

167
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
that if you're fishing with a hook, generally you are...

168
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Like, there's a good chance you're killing the fish,

169
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
even if you throw it back.

170
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Because the wound that the fish or sea life will have

171
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
after a, you know, metal thing goes through their cheek.

172
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The Jason's eel pals are not with us anymore.

173
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So, chances are you were killing all those.

174
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Oh.

175
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You killed all those sunnies.

176
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Oh, thanks, Mike.

177
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm just wanting to let you know,

178
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
in case you are going back to get sunnies,

179
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
don't use the hook if you want to just throw them back.

180
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Sometimes crabs would end up in those waterways, too,

181
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
every now and then you'd see a little blue claw crab.

182
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Did you ever catch one?

183
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I never caught a crab, no.

184
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That seems harder.

185
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Yeah.

186
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Yeah.

187
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
They can run away.

188
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yeah.

189
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
They scurry.

190
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
They scurry, really.

191
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yeah.

192
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You got to surround...

193
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You got to, like, build a fort of sharp cheddar

194
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
around them, distract them,

195
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
and they got to eat their way out.

196
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Do you have any sharp cheddar in the house?

197
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I use string cheese.

198
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
That's pretty firm.

199
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
But not sharp.

200
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But I don't have sharp cheddar, no.

201
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Okay.

202
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I don't exactly think string cheese qualifies as sharp cheddar.

203
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I don't believe so.

204
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
No.

205
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It is in theory mozzarella, but I didn't know mozzarella

206
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
could be shelf staple for so long.

207
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Oh, yeah.

208
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You mean it lasts longer, then?

209
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Well, I'm just saying I can't...

210
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Are you eating unrefrigerated mozzarella?

211
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
No.

212
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I've got the string cheese in the fridge,

213
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
but I feel like that keeps for a while.

214
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Hmm.

215
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Maybe.

216
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Individually wrapped, you know?

217
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Kind of.

218
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I just want to know if your preference is

219
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
regular mild cheddar or sharp.

220
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
If you have to go with the cheddar.

221
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I usually like it pretty sharp.

222
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Okay.

223
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You know what?

224
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I do have a brick of sharp cheddar from Pennsylvania.

225
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
This one dairy farm run by Mennonites.

226
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
They make this amazing different types of cheddar cheese.

227
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
How long have you had that?

228
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It's sealed in wax.

229
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I think I've had it for a year.

230
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I haven't opened it yet.

231
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Well, that keeps a long time, then.

232
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Yeah.

233
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I looked this up once.

234
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Wax.

235
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You have a year-old block of sharp cheddar cheese

236
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
in your fridge.

237
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You haven't cracked it?

238
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You didn't do that in the first week?

239
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It lasts for like three years if it's perfectly sealed in wax.

240
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Wow.

241
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Wow.

242
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So you could seal a lot of food in wax, I suppose,

243
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
and it could maintain its freshness?

244
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Maybe.

245
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Well, Jason loves sharp cheddar.

246
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
He's a regular eel.

247
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Yeah, I'm a real eel.

248
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
He's a real eel.

249
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
The new nickname.

250
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
We finally have a new one.

251
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Jason, the real eel.

252
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
The real eel.

253
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
There are only 100 nicknames.

254
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Watch out.

255
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
The real eel.

256
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Get a steal of a deal with the real eel.

257
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
OK.

258
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Sorry.

259
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Let's get to the title.

260
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
No, no, no.

261
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
That was worth an exploration.

262
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Here's what's happening here.

263
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
So I have had this queue of stuff that I've been wanting

264
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
to talk about for a while.

265
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Just other things have gotten in the way,

266
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
and especially the city walk saga and the prep for that.

267
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
That just sort of was an override of a lot of fun stuff

268
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I've been doing with my family and fun little trips

269
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
that I've been taking.

270
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And I've had this mental queue of like, OK,

271
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
some of these have got to start turning into episodes.

272
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Like I did Legoland finally.

273
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I posted a picture of that.

274
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
That's got to happen at some point.

275
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Really fun trip with Disneyland that probably could splinter

276
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
and do a couple things.

277
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Mike, you did it.

278
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You just this week, very successful second trip

279
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
to Disneyland for your daughter.

280
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Second trip to Disneyland with the daughter, and yes.

281
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Much better than the first one.

282
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
That's great news.

283
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
That seems like you had a little magical one.

284
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Yeah, and I had one that's got stories and stuff to talk about.

285
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:22,000
This isn't the one, but Erin, birthday present,

286
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I got her tickets to Kenny G. We saw Kenny G together.

287
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
This is absolutely a podcast worthy.

288
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
There's at least like a five minute tangent on what happened

289
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
at this Kenny G concert, but this isn't the time.

290
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Let me just whet the appetite.

291
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
This was without a doubt the most interesting concert

292
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I've been to in a very long time.

293
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Yes, there's much to it.

294
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Now is not the time.

295
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'll just put it up.

296
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
When we see one that feels a little bit light,

297
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
although you never know because you end up

298
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
at 10 minutes of cheddar angling.

299
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Any episode can be a packed full episode if you want to be.

300
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm so sorry.

301
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I don't mean to bring the mood down.

302
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I just got a news alert.

303
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Dabney Coleman passed away.

304
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
There was no reason for you to say that.

305
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Why?

306
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
What possibly?

307
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You know, so a lot of fun with my family.

308
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I must tell everybody we must break.

309
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm hearing this for the first time.

310
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I didn't know he was still with us.

311
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
That's so funny that you said that.

312
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I saw it at 10 a.m. today that Dabney Coleman died.

313
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Wait a minute.

314
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
So it didn't just happen?

315
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
No, I just got the Los Angeles Times Apple News

316
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
notification one minute ago.

317
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And I think he's been dead for at least 12 hours.

318
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Like, I think.

319
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And this will come out in, what, four or five days.

320
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
This must be said.

321
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Sorry to interrupt.

322
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Oh, my whole thing is to name the old character actors

323
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
from Gilead's Island.

324
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
But I can't pay tribute to the wonderful Dabney.

325
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I know the best way to do it.

326
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
This will be the most somber tribute.

327
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
This will be so beautiful.

328
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
People will get so misty when I say Dabney Coleman died.

329
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It was so funny, though, because you interrupted.

330
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It wasn't even like, well.

331
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Didn't even get to the end of a sentence.

332
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Shut the fuck up.

333
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
A man is pressing away.

334
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
The Muggle Martin's boss is dead.

335
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I knew it would be kind of funny if that's how I went about it.

336
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Well, it was, by the way.

337
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
We're having fun with it.

338
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Thank you so much.

339
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Anyway, back to the topic at hand.

340
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
How are we going to go on?

341
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
He was 92 years old.

342
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Jason, was that two seconds from brain to mouth,

343
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
or were you sitting on that for three minutes?

344
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I need to get in.

345
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I need to get in there.

346
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It was kind of a minute.

347
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I mean, this news alert was two minutes ago,

348
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
so it wasn't cooking for that long.

349
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
OK.

350
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
The detail that you got the alert now,

351
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
but this has been news for many hours.

352
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Yeah, yeah.

353
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I saw it very clearly.

354
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Not even worth mentioning on the way in the door to record.

355
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Not even like, oh, Dabney Coleman died.

356
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Because it actually was news to me.

357
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I didn't know about this.

358
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
If you need to take, the listener won't notice,

359
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
but Jason may need to take a couple hours.

360
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Yeah, if you need to take a personal hour.

361
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Sure.

362
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Stay here.

363
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Don't leave.

364
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
But we can't pay you unless you're physically here.

365
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
But feel free to not talk.

366
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
The other reason it credited him as the boss from 9 to 5

367
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
and Yellowstone guest star.

368
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
OK.

369
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Well, if I had ever seen it, I would have known.

370
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Yeah, yeah.

371
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm going to get to it, though.

372
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Yeah.

373
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You didn't know.

374
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You could have been enjoying one of the final Dabney

375
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
performances.

376
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
He was great.

377
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Mm-hmm.

378
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Yes.

379
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
We loved Dabney Coleman.

380
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I mean, I wish I had more time to prepare, but yes, of course.

381
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Hearing this for the first time.

382
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Very good Colombo villain and one of the greats.

383
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Yeah.

384
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Anyways.

385
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Anyway, back to your lovely adventures with family.

386
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
What I was basically, I've had a little queue of things

387
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I've wanted to get out.

388
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Things got in the way, still getting in the way,

389
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
such as the death of Dabney Coleman.

390
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
And I was like, what do I get to?

391
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Because some of them are more rides proper.

392
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
But when I was thinking about it, what is the one I most

393
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
want to get out of recent travels with the kiddo?

394
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Absolutely Bass Pro Shops.

395
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Wow.

396
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
There was no question that this is the one I was

397
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
the most dying to talk about.

398
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
So for people not in Southern California,

399
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
you were probably well aware of this chain.

400
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
You were probably like, Scott, how is this new to you?

401
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
This has been a thriving thing for a long time,

402
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
and it's a mega, mega success.

403
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
But I'm in Southern California.

404
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
If I didn't show my cards already, I'm no angler.

405
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I guess I knew some of the stuff.

406
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I knew that these stores are massive.

407
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
And I think I've passed by, until very, very recently,

408
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
the closest one to us was Rancho Cucamonga.

409
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
And that's pretty far away from us.

410
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
That's not a place I'm at very often.

411
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And even then just passing by, I think I've clocked one

412
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
of these outside of Vegas, but never gone in one.

413
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And then somehow I get algorithmed a video of local news

414
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
that one of these is opening in Irvine in Orange County,

415
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
not too far from Disneyland.

416
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I don't know why this showed up in the YouTube

417
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
and why I clicked on opening of Bass Pro Shops,

418
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
but I'm like three seconds in the video.

419
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Like, what?

420
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
That's what's happening in there?

421
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I got to go.

422
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I have to go.

423
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I had no idea the scope of these places, the level of theming.

424
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I want to declare that I think, just pure theming-wise,

425
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
they're different types of businesses.

426
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
But I think that Bass Pro Shops is the heir to the Fry's

427
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,000
electronics store, unnecessary store theming throne.

428
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And I don't know.

429
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
So this is where I'm coming at it from.

430
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And then I got to take a trip down to Irvine.

431
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I went out of my way on the way to go see the grandparents

432
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
in Newport Beach.

433
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm like, I'm going to do a little sidetrack.

434
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I'm going to take a trip, just do Bass Pro Shops.

435
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
And obviously, I'm coming in with a lot of enthusiasm

436
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,500
about that.

437
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,000
That's what I'm bringing in here.

438
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
When I bring in Bass Pro Shops to you guys,

439
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
did you look around some videos?

440
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It doesn't seem like you've been in one, unless you have,

441
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
that I don't know about.

442
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
No, I haven't.

443
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Does it read in video photo form?

444
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Does my enthusiasm make sense from what you've seen?

445
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Oh, yeah.

446
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Yeah, there is some elaborate stuff

447
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
that I am blown away by just on video.

448
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It's crazy.

449
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's crazy.

450
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
The themed entertainment, aesthetics, and certainly

451
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
scale, I mean, these places are massive.

452
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
There's different varieties of them,

453
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
which they helpfully put on the giant sign,

454
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
whether it's an outdoor world.

455
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Outdoor world or outboost.

456
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
OK, OK.

457
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Probably what I'm mostly talking about here are outdoor world.

458
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
And what I went to was an outdoor world.

459
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
But I forget the delineations exactly.

460
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I figured, keep the umbrella loose.

461
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
What with Bass Pro Shops at all.

462
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Well, at some point, too, I only learned about this chain

463
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
in the last few years, Cabela's, which they bought at some point.

464
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
OK, yeah.

465
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
And is another massive kind of.

466
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
They seem to be either merging the brands or keeping them.

467
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It's one of these.

468
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Well, it's like Fry's and was the other brand, Incredible

469
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Universe, or a pizza time theater, showbiz pizza situation.

470
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Yeah.

471
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
And you never know.

472
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Is this a friendly merger?

473
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Is this best for everyone?

474
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Or is this a hostile takeover?

475
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Right.

476
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
No way to know.

477
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
All I know is that this brand is ginormous at this point.

478
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
There are so many of these.

479
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And again, if I lived anywhere else in the country,

480
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I think I'd know this better.

481
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
But it finally made it our way to Irvine.

482
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It was a little bit of a long car ride with the kid.

483
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You're like, well, that's got to really be a payoff once you get there.

484
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
And I am really happy to say this went over so huge.

485
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Oh, that's good.

486
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Four-year-old boys, what I have now.

487
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And from the get-go.

488
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,000
So basically, what I saw on the news was just this live footage

489
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
and it's in this atrium, which is sky high.

490
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
It is like not even that miniature of a version of the Grand

491
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Californian lobby.

492
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Right.

493
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It's crazy.

494
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
And it's so ornate, clearly.

495
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
And lamps are incredible.

496
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
And animal silhouettes on everything.

497
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,000
And everything's custom-made and just full of antlers and so many animals

498
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
all around, like hundreds and hundreds of them.

499
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
And then a big tank and waterfall all the way in the back.

500
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Yeah, the big tank and stuff.

501
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It's wild.

502
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's crazy.

503
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It's crazy.

504
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
So I knew all this going in.

505
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
And I was watching opening day footage.

506
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
So I'm like, OK, this is jam-packed.

507
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
And how recently was this?

508
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Like eight days ago.

509
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And I'm going on a Saturday morning.

510
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
This could be a little nuts.

511
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I was kind of prepping for, is this going to be a little bit of a clusterfuck?

512
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And I get down there.

513
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
And it's not.

514
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It never felt like chaos or disorganized.

515
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
But I pulled up to very familiar theme park feelings.

516
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Because there's light-up road signs directing where to go.

517
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
There's big paths of cones.

518
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
There's people pointing with orange flashers, whatever.

519
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It is more coordinated than I have seen Universal Studios on some days.

520
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Absolutely.

521
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I believe that.

522
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Yes.

523
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Clear paths.

524
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
And OK.

525
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And I got to go over here.

526
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
And I parked far.

527
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:08,000
They sent me really far away, off several stores over, over to the also massive golf store

528
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
wherever I was.

529
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I don't know what neck of the woods this is.

530
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Have you been in Irvine a little bit?

531
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
A little bit.

532
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Lindsay went to college there.

533
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I don't know if she fondly recalls her Irvine days.

534
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
She does.

535
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
But I don't know that she has anything about this neck of the woods.

536
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I don't know if it's the Spectrum.

537
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Wait, no, no, no.

538
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
The Spectrum is near the Spectrum.

539
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
The Spectrum is a crazy mall with a Ferris wheel and stuff.

540
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
It's around there.

541
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It might even be off Spectrum Way or something.

542
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
But the amount of hubbub as I come in, it's like, geez, OK.

543
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Now we got a long walk ahead of us.

544
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
And boy, I hope I can muster up my four-year-old's enthusiasm.

545
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
And thank God the approach has, first of all, so many boats.

546
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Big line of boats outside.

547
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
So that's exciting.

548
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
And then I'm getting excited by fake rocks.

549
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
We have fake rocks before we go in the store.

550
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Lamps, incredible.

551
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Doorknobs, amazing.

552
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Just like, you know, it is really theme park-y.

553
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Right.

554
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Style of wood.

555
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And like, honestly, truly up to par with like Disney's lodges

556
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
with Wilderness Lodge and whatever the one in France is called,

557
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
which I get to go in.

558
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Oh, yeah.

559
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And then in Grand Californian.

560
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
And then we're walking up to the door.

561
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
And just the sign, he's like, Dad, there's a big fish.

562
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
There's a huge fish.

563
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Yes, I know, son.

564
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Isn't it wonderful?

565
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And then he's making a fish face.

566
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
So let's do a selfie.

567
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Let's do a selfie with fish faces.

568
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Hooray, Dad, I'm so happy.

569
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Like, we haven't even gotten in the door.

570
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Wow.

571
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
This is working.

572
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It's so great.

573
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Wow.

574
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
And then we get in the door, experience everything

575
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
that I saw on the news broadcast.

576
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
And like, oh my god, if I just like turn my head,

577
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I think I'm looking at like possibly 300 animal facsimiles.

578
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
There's giant shacks that look like the out,

579
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
the exteriors of like the best margaritavilles,

580
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
like the most well-themed margaritavilles.

581
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And fonts are in a similar neck of the woods.

582
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Yes, they are.

583
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Which I've started to have some, you know,

584
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I had some issues with the food during the Sauget that we did.

585
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I remain fond of the vibe of everybody

586
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
on the design front of these places.

587
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
And they totally got it at Best Pro Shops.

588
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
And I'm like pretty blown back by what I'm looking at

589
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
and realizing like, oh, we got a bunch of fun in store.

590
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
This place has everything.

591
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Now, because it was a long car ride to the bathroom,

592
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
turn, bathroom's both broken out.

593
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
What?

594
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Yes.

595
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
And after all this just like paper sign and guy outside,

596
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
no bathrooms.

597
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Oh, so there are other bathrooms?

598
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
No.

599
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
There are only two bathrooms.

600
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
There are like 300 models of fish,

601
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
but there is only one set of bathrooms and they are not working.

602
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
And I ask, what do I do?

603
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And they're like, gas station or Del Taco.

604
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And I go outside and those are both so far away.

605
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
And again, in the most crowded parking lot

606
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
where there's traffic being directed

607
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
and cars are coming in and out.

608
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I'm like, oh, this is a walk.

609
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Oh, my God, which ended up being fine.

610
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I'm not complete.

611
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
It was just so funny that like the reveal, ah,

612
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
it was honestly like a theme park level entrance

613
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
only to see a badly printed out bathroom's broken sign.

614
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And there are only two bathrooms?

615
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
There are only two bathrooms in the whole place?

616
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Yeah, yeah, right in the front.

617
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Yes.

618
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And with that amount of size,

619
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
how is there not at least one more?

620
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Again, I'm looking like three separate shacks.

621
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
This is a back lot's worth of little buildings.

622
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Yeah, I know.

623
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
And there is not even one stall

624
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
anywhere in the back of these.

625
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
It is very funny you say that

626
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
because I watched some of the video of a couple

627
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
who were going to the pyramid in Memphis

628
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
with the giant Bass Pro shop.

629
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Which is the giant Bass Pro shops, yes.

630
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
With a hotel inside in multiple restaurants,

631
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
including something called Wall Burger's Wild.

632
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Yes, yes.

633
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
They immediately were greeted by

634
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
a water main break bathroom's closed sign.

635
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
What?

636
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
And they're like,

637
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
we don't know what this means

638
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
for our hotel room bathroom.

639
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Oh, right.

640
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
If it's the entire facility,

641
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
yes, it's a hotel inside this big pyramid structure.

642
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Yeah.

643
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Whoa.

644
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
That's exactly what happened

645
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
because if it's both men's and women's restrooms,

646
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
that means the entire thing is gone.

647
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
That's just a line down.

648
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
How is it happening?

649
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
What's going on?

650
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Are there eels and sunnies getting into the pipes?

651
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
At the giant pyramid,

652
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
which is famously terrible for live events.

653
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
It was a sports venue.

654
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
They tried to have concerts there.

655
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Acoustics in a pyramid are dog shit.

656
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
So that got wrapped up.

657
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Bound trapped, yes.

658
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
But they were, you know,

659
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
theme park can do this,

660
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
and they were just same way delighted to discover,

661
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
like, we thought this would be a gag.

662
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
We thought this would be, like, a lark.

663
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Yeah.

664
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
And they're like,

665
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
this is, like, nicer than parts of the wilderness lodge.

666
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Wow.

667
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
And they thought that about the hotel.

668
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Wow.

669
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
About the hotel.

670
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
And very funny, an indoor balcony,

671
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
which I think we've talked about before.

672
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I love an indoor balcony.

673
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Looks down on a massive, vast pro shop.

674
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
You get a view of the store.

675
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
You get a view of the store.

676
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
You're in the store.

677
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
And America's largest freestanding elevator,

678
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
which I believe goes up 28 stories to the restaurant,

679
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
and look out at the top of the pyramid.

680
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
It's so bonkers.

681
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I don't, yeah, yeah.

682
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I don't know.

683
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I mean, I knew some of this,

684
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
and the pyramid was in my head a little bit.

685
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
But I've, like, never, sometimes you just,

686
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
you see these things fleeting.

687
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
You don't do the dive.

688
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
But it being in my, not quite my backyard,

689
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
but several black backyards away from me.

690
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Like, I'm going to do it finally.

691
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And I, really, what it is is, like,

692
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
this is 2024, something like this is happening,

693
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
where, like, does, I mean, on some level,

694
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
it's got to help their bottom line,

695
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
because it creates this fun hub,

696
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
this theme parky environment,

697
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
where it's fun for families to go hang out for a little while.

698
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
That helps them on some level.

699
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
But also, I feel like we're in such an era

700
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
of any extra frill, we don't need that, get rid of it.

701
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
And, you know, and in the wake of the very, like,

702
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
depressing end of the fries chain,

703
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
it is kind of amazing that there's this, like,

704
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,000
one of the most successful cross-America brands

705
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
does so much crazy theming

706
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
and fucking waterfalls and bears and fake rocks.

707
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
And keeps, yeah, keeps it up.

708
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I mean, like, because it's been around.

709
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Yeah. I don't, yeah, I don't know

710
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
when they started opening exactly.

711
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
But it's certainly, the pyramid came in 2015,

712
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
which is, like, the real sign

713
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
that it's, like, a behemoth of a brand.

714
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
So let me just, like, shout out some other stuff.

715
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Okay, we're imitating the bass on the way in.

716
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
There are, you immediately, like, as soon as you walk in,

717
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
like, really homey fireplace with giant comfortable chairs.

718
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,000
And then, like, many, many deer and buck heads

719
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
mounted to the wall.

720
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I don't know if we're dealing with taxidermy or real here,

721
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
if it's all fake, but...

722
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Well, you mean taxidermy would be real?

723
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Yeah, yeah. I just don't know if they're real

724
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
or if they're very good simulations.

725
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
But either way, it's such a forest in there.

726
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
And then you've also got a ton of recreations

727
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
of what are the biggest, like, you know, species ever created.

728
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Like, if you're caught, it's like, you know,

729
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
the biggest swordfish or whatever.

730
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Right.

731
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
With 16 feet.

732
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
And here is a 16-foot swordfish.

733
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
And then here's a big shark hanging up,

734
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
which feels like the Jaws photo op at Universal.

735
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:17,000
And my son gets to touch a shark tooth, and that's all fun.

736
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
He's just so lit up.

737
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
So once we make our way back from the Del Taco bathroom

738
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
from very far away, we get back in.

739
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Absolutely, yes, absolutely.

740
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Especially because there's, like, toys, stuff to play with.

741
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
He's putting on a cowboy hat. He's laughing.

742
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
He sees a row of little guns, little toy guns.

743
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
And he asks, what's a gun?

744
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
And I'm like, oh, there's a big question in the life of a child.

745
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Ah, I'm not prepared to tell you the whole deal here.

746
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
And in fact, yeah, you know, put that down.

747
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Don't worry about that right now. Let's not think about that.

748
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Did you have any questions about just the sort of mounted animal heads?

749
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
No.

750
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
OK.

751
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I have wondered that we haven't gotten into death yet.

752
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
He can deal with the notion that an insect is dead.

753
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
And he's never asked, what is dead?

754
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
He's never said, will I be dead?

755
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
So I think about that, though, of like, oh, boy, we're like really...

756
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
We got places to go here.

757
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I'm glad that a bee being dead is OK to him.

758
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
But when we start asking further than that line of questioning,

759
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
there's a lot to deal with.

760
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Have we talked about this on the show? Did we all ask our parents about this?

761
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I have a very vivid memory of asking.

762
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I don't remember mine. What happened with you?

763
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I just said, wait a minute.

764
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I just remember going to bed one night and going, Mom, am I going to die?

765
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
And she just like sat there.

766
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I mean, that's probably dramatizing the more she sat there for a second.

767
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:57,000
And it was just like, yes, but not for a long, long time.

768
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Not a long time.

769
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
And I go, oh, OK. OK.

770
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
And then I kind of like, it disturbed me,

771
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
but that was enough to at least put it in the back of my mind and not the front.

772
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
OK. OK.

773
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
As long as you keep those Kleenex bedsheets away from your Ghostbusters

774
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
and don't start a fire, you'll stay alive as long as you want to.

775
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
As long as you have no posters above your bed

776
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
that will suffocate you in the middle of the night.

777
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
No, you will not.

778
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
You will. Long may you reign, sir, my child.

779
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Jason, do you have any memory of this?

780
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I'm wondering if I learned in a roundabout way

781
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
that lined up with the real Ghostbusters cartoon.

782
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Yours does involve Ghostbusters? What are the odds of that?

783
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
That's weird.

784
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Well, I think I would have been.

785
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I remember liking it in preschool and kindergarten.

786
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,000
So I think the concept of you die and become a ghost.

787
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
That show taught you?

788
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
The real Ghostbusters taught you.

789
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
What is a ghost?

790
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Yeah.

791
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
It started, it was kind of roundabout.

792
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
You started with mommy, what was Slimer's profession when he was alive?

793
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
What kind of man was Slimer?

794
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Did he file joint taxes or was he an individual?

795
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Did he date?

796
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I think I was more obsessed at the time with why is there,

797
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,000
mom, why is there a real Ghostbusters and then the original Ghostbusters?

798
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
That was more of a pressing issue for you as a child.

799
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I liked it, but I was confused by it.

800
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
This is even heavier than what happens after you die.

801
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I didn't know probably until a few years ago about the Sid and Marty Croft

802
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,000
live-action Ghostbusters that inspired the original Ghostbusters cartoon.

803
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Yes, the wall, because they had already a Filmation-owned,

804
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
we can't talk about Ghostbusters right now.

805
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:05,000
So I think, of course I was worried about dying.

806
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
You were worried about it, I just wondered if you remembered a moment.

807
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I don't remember a moment, I was not concerned about my own death.

808
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
The children's media convinced me that if my parents out on a date alone,

809
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
there is a very good chance they will die and you will be an orphan.

810
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I don't want to bring things down, but Larry Storch died in July 2022.

811
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I just got the alert two years later.

812
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
To be fair to Jason, if Larry Storch had died,

813
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I would have interrupted any sort of speech either of you were making

814
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
to talk about Larry Storch dying.

815
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
It's more recent than I thought, he almost made it to 100.

816
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
We might have been recording that day,

817
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
we might have been making our jokes and not even realizing that we had lost an F-troop.

818
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I think I announced Larry Storch's death on this show, I thought.

819
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Didn't I? Or at the very least I had mentioned that he was still alive on this show.

820
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I said, I know Larry Storch is still alive, he's in his 90s.

821
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Wait, I'm remembering that one a couple of years ago.

822
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I remember it was weird that you insisted on starting it with

823
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:17,000
it's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday.

824
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Larry!

825
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
That was on the Dippin' Dots episode.

826
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
It really, we never recovered.

827
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I never thought we had as much fun with Dippin' Dots as we could have.

828
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
It tainted the whole thing.

829
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Okay, what have I missed about...

830
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Shocked I haven't forced us to do a Dippin' Dots episode.

831
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
That's a good idea.

832
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Alright, well that's soon.

833
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
No Minnie Melts talk.

834
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Get the fuck out of here, Minnie Melts.

835
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
You set the rules, man.

836
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Out of bounds.

837
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Anyway, so many things.

838
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,000
This big main display, oh my god, big fish tank that's so high

839
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
that can fit so many children at a time to all look at fish together.

840
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
There's so many real fish, there's so many fake animals,

841
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
there's elk and there's bears and big towering rocks.

842
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
And then we start exploring details.

843
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:17,000
And while I come in focused on like, wow, a big moose and a big fox

844
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
and I swear hundreds of these things, it's so crazy.

845
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
And that all maybe kind of takes my eyes off of details.

846
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Such as, well one thing I'm looking at like, toys.

847
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
What's going on toy-wise?

848
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
And I notice that there are a number of trucks, or my son does,

849
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
he goes right for those.

850
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
And there's like big racks where all of the kind of truck are available

851
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
and it's like kids' names, Thomas.

852
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
And then there's like a bunch of trucks that say Thomas.

853
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
And then the only one that's fully sold out

854
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
are the kind of truck that say I love Jesus.

855
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
In eight days they are out of I love Jesus trucks.

856
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
That sort of answered my question overall about the store, I think, right there.

857
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Yeah.

858
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Because that is what I was assuming.

859
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I'm not even trying to put the store down necessarily.

860
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I'm just saying I would assume more of a certain type of folk

861
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
are going to these places.

862
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I mean, yes.

863
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I think so.

864
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
And yeah, some things have to be acknowledged.

865
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I mean, that starts to give you the vibe.

866
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
And then as I go further back into the store, I notice another thing,

867
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:29,000
which is another shitty, just like for all the immaculate theming,

868
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,000
suddenly really shitty sign on green printed paper, ammo line starts here.

869
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Yeah, there we go.

870
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
And the ammo line is so long.

871
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
There are so many people waiting to get ammo.

872
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Some of these have shooting ranges.

873
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Do this one have a shooting range?

874
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I don't believe so.

875
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Some of you saw that, right?

876
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I think that if they were building from the,

877
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
because I think they tend to put them on the bottom level.

878
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
So I think, and this might have been like a modded out space

879
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
that existed from something.

880
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I don't know, this might have been a Costco and a Best Buy,

881
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
and it took over full of them.

882
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
It was so big.

883
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
But I think if they're building one from the ground up,

884
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
they're digging a basement and they're putting either a shooting range

885
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
or an archery range down there.

886
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,000
And a shooting gallery like the UV, like at Disneyland.

887
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Oh, they had a video game one.

888
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Yeah, a video game one.

889
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I think that was at the pyramid though.

890
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Yeah, no, I think a few of them have that.

891
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Oh, okay.

892
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Yeah, yeah.

893
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
So again, we got a store.

894
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
You know, I'm torn here.

895
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Is it a place that's selling a lot of ammunition?

896
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Yes.

897
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
However, they also have-

898
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
With the fake rocks!

899
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Yes, yes, amazing rocks.

900
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
And you know, all these bad places, all these terrible stores,

901
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
and most of them don't have fake rocks.

902
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville,

903
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
none of the restaurants have a shooting range in it.

904
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
That's true.

905
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
No.

906
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
They don't have certain things.

907
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
But it's interesting, because on one hand, you're like,

908
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
it's sort of celebrating the outdoors.

909
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
That's really what we're getting at here.

910
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,000
And I think the three of us aren't maybe avid outdoorsmen, I would say.

911
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
No.

912
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Maybe some of the listeners are.

913
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
You might say that our son asked if we would go camping ever,

914
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
and Aaron straight up said no.

915
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I shudder at that thought.

916
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Yeah.

917
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I do not want to camp.

918
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:17,000
And granted, I went camping with a group in a very comfortable way in 2008,

919
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
and that is the last that I've done.

920
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
So it's not my...

921
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I can't pretend it's my field.

922
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Not interested, says me.

923
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Jason, would you ever go camping again?

924
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I have camped a ton.

925
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Yeah, I was in the Cub Scouts and the Boy Scouts.

926
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
So I've camped in hot weather, fall weather, winter.

927
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
So were you the most outdoorsy of the three of us?

928
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I think I am.

929
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
By a technicality.

930
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
By a technicality.

931
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I know how to put up a tent and such.

932
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I know you need to put a tarp down to put the tent on top of,

933
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
otherwise groundwater will make you very cold.

934
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
We'll get into the tent.

935
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Okay.

936
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
That's the real thing he knows.

937
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
He knows how to fish for eels, too.

938
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
He would catch us so many delicious eels

939
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
if we hadn't eaten in days.

940
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I know how to hang a bear bag.

941
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Do you know about a bear bag?

942
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Oh, you've talked about bear bags on this show many times.

943
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Here is one when we went to...

944
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Real quick, you hang your food up in a tree

945
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
so a bear can't get...

946
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Or you put your garbage or your food in a bag,

947
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
and yeah, you hang it up with rope

948
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
so that bears can't climb up and get it.

949
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
This is the one I remember coming up a lot.

950
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
You don't remember anything about a bear bag?

951
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Oh, yeah.

952
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Bear bags, sometimes there's bear...

953
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I think they would call them bear boxes,

954
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
which were like strong plywood boxes, padlocks.

955
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
It's not bear back.

956
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Don't get confused.

957
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Well, no.

958
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
He's talking about that, too, though, but not on Mike.

959
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
The other big thing we would do,

960
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I was thinking about this, that it's a trick.

961
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
When we went to Boy Scouts summer camp,

962
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
you got breakfast, lunch, and dinner

963
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
at the dining hall, mess hall.

964
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
But if you wanted to pack snacks or candy and stuff,

965
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
they're like, well, don't pack chocolate, it'll melt.

966
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
But hard candy and gummy candy is okay.

967
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
And then what they told everyone to do

968
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
is get a Country Time lemonade, those plastic...

969
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Yeah, canisters?

970
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Canisters, you put hard candy in that

971
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
and powdered sugar so it doesn't stick together,

972
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
and those seal really airtight.

973
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
And the bear won't smell it.

974
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
And the bear won't smell it. That's very important.

975
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
But you take the Country Time lemonade out of the canister?

976
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Yeah, you take it out.

977
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Okay, it's an empty canister.

978
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Yes, but I'm wondering nowadays,

979
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
are they still making those canisters,

980
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
and are that many people drinking

981
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
powdered Country Time lemonade anymore?

982
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Well, the real question is, are you?

983
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I'm not right now, but I was drinking glass of water

984
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
the other day, and I was like,

985
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I only have water and seltzer, really, in the house.

986
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I don't feel like coffee.

987
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
But I was like, I should get some crystal light packets.

988
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
You were trying to drink more soda in the new year.

989
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I do, I have a lot of beverages, right?

990
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I stocked up on soda and seltzers.

991
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Do you have a 10-year aged Country Time canister?

992
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Sort of like a...

993
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Oh, yeah, perfectly waxed.

994
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
You can drink it 10 years later.

995
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
So, these stores are interesting,

996
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
because, yeah, they are like, on one hand,

997
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
you go, oh, this is just outdoorsy stuff.

998
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
This is sort of just general stuff, nice and woozy.

999
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
No, they're conservation funds.

1000
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Conservation funds.

1001
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
On the other hand, it's a right-wing haven.

1002
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Yeah.

1003
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
It's a religious right-wing haven.

1004
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Yes, why does it end up in Orange County?

1005
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Well, yeah, that's, no, no, no, uh-huh.

1006
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Yeah, and you don't feel it that much.

1007
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I think in other ones, I do think that, like,

1008
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
as I read articles of people kind of being charmed by all of it

1009
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,000
and then finding some blue lives or some MAGA or something

1010
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
and like, okay, well, sure.

1011
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
When you look up Bass Pro Shops, the first on Yelp,

1012
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
the first picture you see is a person with a gun in their hand.

1013
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
That is just a close-up of a hand and a gun.

1014
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Just a picture of a hand and a gun.

1015
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Which location are we?

1016
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
This one is, sorry, one sec.

1017
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Is there a caption of that?

1018
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Is that like, is it in this?

1019
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
This is in Rancho.

1020
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Okay.

1021
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
You mean like, oh, when we click on the actual photo?

1022
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Yeah, let me find it.

1023
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
It says, testing my Glock 34.

1024
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Ha!

1025
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Three likes on it.

1026
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
And then there's a picture of like two smiling children

1027
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
sitting in a big rocking chair in front of a Christmas tree.

1028
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Isn't that, that's the dichotomy.

1029
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Doesn't that say it all?

1030
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Of the place, yeah, yeah.

1031
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
It's an interesting just the position.

1032
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
That's what you want to make it, isn't it?

1033
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I hate to bring it down,

1034
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
because obviously I love the pictures here.

1035
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Well, look, I've been down since Dabney Coleman's.

1036
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
You can't bring me any further down.

1037
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I know you're shining down on me from heaven.

1038
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I've been down at thinking all the sunnies that Jason injured.

1039
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Yeah, well, it's okay.

1040
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Dabney's with the sunnies now.

1041
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Just, if someone could make that art of a puffy cloud

1042
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
and Dabney Coleman surrounded by eels and guppies and sunnies.

1043
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
A very joyous, under-the-sea type scenario of like,

1044
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
they're whisking him up to his mustache hairs

1045
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
or twirling in the bubbles.

1046
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
All eels go to heaven.

1047
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,000
All Dabney's go to heaven.

1048
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Anyways, I mean, what this becomes,

1049
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I don't have too many more stories,

1050
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
because really just, it all unveils like,

1051
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
crazy atrium, okay, gun quarter, uh-oh.

1052
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
But then like, you know, now we're just like playing in tents.

1053
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
We're playing in the tents that we'll never buy

1054
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
because we aren't going to go camping.

1055
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
But like, there's one that has like a little like,

1056
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
porch that's still enclosed, right?

1057
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Like, here's the main tent.

1058
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
But then there's a one that's just,

1059
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
that has just like some sheer coverage.

1060
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
And we're just like sitting in these little chairs

1061
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
and just having some good little patio time.

1062
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,000
And then he goes and stacks up firewood

1063
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
and the little firewood display and then knocks it down.

1064
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
And then he's climbing up on boats and climbing up on ATVs

1065
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
and testing them out and vroom, vroom.

1066
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
And it is, it's just the most like, idyllic fun.

1067
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Just like, you know, I mean, you know,

1068
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
you're starting to like branch out in terms of what you do

1069
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
with your daughter a little more.

1070
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
And it's just like, you know, sometimes you take a swing.

1071
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
It's not a place we've been.

1072
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I really hope it's a hit.

1073
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
When it's a hit and then they're talking about it later

1074
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
and like, all right, we got a winner on our hands.

1075
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Hell yes.

1076
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
It just, it feels so great.

1077
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Fill the slot.

1078
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
You just want to fill the slot

1079
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
with something that makes him smile

1080
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
and eats up a lot of time.

1081
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
And yeah, this did it.

1082
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I loved it.

1083
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Yes.

1084
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
That's what we're going through for sure right now.

1085
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
And especially like we just did Disneyland.

1086
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Not only, yes, do you get the thrill from like,

1087
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
oh, thank God she likes this.

1088
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
And then the stuff she really likes is very exciting.

1089
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
And then at the end of the day, and I said,

1090
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
also like, thank you.

1091
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I thanked her.

1092
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
I think you gave us what we wanted today.

1093
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Like your smiles and laughter are why we took you.

1094
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Yeah.

1095
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Like she delivered is what I kept saying.

1096
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I go, you delivered today.

1097
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Oh, hey.

1098
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Yeah, absolutely.

1099
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Well, it's, you know, hey.

1100
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
That's the selfish way to look at it.

1101
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
It's all mirrors, right?

1102
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
You've got to bounce those smiles and that energy

1103
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
back and forth and you know, because it's infectious

1104
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
and they start happy and you get happier

1105
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
and they get happier and that's what you want.

1106
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I really like, and I don't, I can't like compare

1107
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
and contrast Bass Pro Shops and Disneyland.

1108
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
We've had like just glorious, joyous times

1109
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
at Disneyland with him.

1110
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
But like he likes it I think as much

1111
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
as he liked Bass Pro Shops.

1112
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Yeah, sure.

1113
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
And we don't have an annual pass right now.

1114
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
And I'm like, yeah, that's because like we can have

1115
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
that much fun at like with him just running back

1116
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
and forth between two trash cans.

1117
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Well, yeah.

1118
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I don't know, we're like pointing out the sign

1119
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
that where an animal is pooping

1120
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
and making me make poop sounds or fart sounds.

1121
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
And like that's, it's just like all a big tie.

1122
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Disneyland, great, but it's tied with 30 other things.

1123
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Yeah.

1124
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
That are closer and more convenient.

1125
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I'm really glad your Disney time is good.

1126
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Sure.

1127
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
And I will keep having wonderful Disney times.

1128
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Well, the year, yeah, he's maybe a little,

1129
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
a couple of years away from realizing like, oh,

1130
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
the quality of one experience is different

1131
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
than the quality of another.

1132
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
These will start separating.

1133
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Yeah.

1134
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
And I enjoyed especially the like two to three year old run

1135
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
where like it's all the same and it's all new.

1136
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Yeah.

1137
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
If it lights them up, then it's great.

1138
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
And especially if it lights them up for zero dollars

1139
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
instead of 150.

1140
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Yeah, that's a nice bonus too.

1141
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
My daughter loved Mater's junkyard jamboree,

1142
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
but would she have also loved it if we just put her

1143
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
in like a red wagon and like just like,

1144
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
just like zipped her around the driveway.

1145
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Pretty much the same, really.

1146
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Yeah, yeah.

1147
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
But we took her to Disneyland for us

1148
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
to see her get happy in the place we like.

1149
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
And it's elevated.

1150
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
It's for sure elevated.

1151
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Of course, it's elevated.

1152
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
And she likes the music and she like dances in line

1153
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
and stuff, so like all that stuff is great.

1154
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Well, you know what you have in Disneyland is like,

1155
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
OK, here's a place with like 20 of those opportunities

1156
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
all next to each other as opposed to, you know,

1157
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
there's a cutoff right after Best Pro Shops, you know.

1158
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
He's not going to have that much fun at the golf store.

1159
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Right.

1160
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
The Del Taco was only so entertaining.

1161
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
So that's the look.

1162
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
I'm not putting down.

1163
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
It's just funny that at this age, like it's all,

1164
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
it's all kind of a tie.

1165
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
It's a lot of fun.

1166
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Yeah, the flattening.

1167
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1168
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
But the flattening is so high up.

1169
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
It's a high, because they're having a lot of fun.

1170
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
But anyway, it just became this like,

1171
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I was reminded of something I think about

1172
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
from one of my favorite movies, The Brady Bunch Movie,

1173
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,000
where Gary Cole, Mike says,

1174
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
all right, kids, put on your Sunday best.

1175
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
We're going to Sears.

1176
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
And then you do, it's a sunshine day,

1177
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
as the family has the most fun in Sears,

1178
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
just testing out cameras, and we'll go out,

1179
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
dance on the escalator.

1180
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Like, we had one of those Brady Bunch Sears days.

1181
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
We had it at Best Pro Shops.

1182
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
It was pretty killer.

1183
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
And yeah, I don't know.

1184
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
And if, you know, if we're feeling iffy at all

1185
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
about some of the things that they supply and sell,

1186
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
I did spend $0.

1187
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
We bought nothing.

1188
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Smart.

1189
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
No, yes.

1190
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
And I'm OK with that.

1191
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
In a little establishment, if we come in,

1192
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
and we tear it up and we play with their toys or whatever,

1193
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
like, I'll buy something.

1194
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
But they're fine.

1195
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Best Pro Shops will be fine.

1196
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Well, you say that, but your whole family

1197
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
has been wearing a lot of wood print,

1198
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
like UV-protected long-sleeve shirts recently.

1199
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Are you accusing me of stealing?

1200
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Oh, yeah, Scott.

1201
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Scott, I realize you recently started

1202
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
wearing Wrangler retro jeans that they sell

1203
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
at the Rancho Cucamonga location.

1204
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
You're cool.

1205
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I could have gotten those from anywhere.

1206
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Oh, that's true.

1207
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
I suppose.

1208
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
What do you say?

1209
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Are you saying that I went inside the tent,

1210
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
wrapped my little son in several pairs of jeans,

1211
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
and then I out the door?

1212
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Wrangler retro jeans.

1213
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
We call it Jean Day.

1214
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
He loves them.

1215
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
So anyways, that's my personal experience.

1216
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
And now I'm like, what else is going on with this brand?

1217
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
And I'm looking into the other ones.

1218
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
So it starts in Springfield, Missouri.

1219
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
OK, it starts in 71, but this is not the mega store

1220
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
that we know today.

1221
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
It's related to another.

1222
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,000
It's the guy's dad had a kind of a Brown Derby liquor store.

1223
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
That store was the Brown Derby liquor store.

1224
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
It's a chain of Missouri liquor stores,

1225
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
and he started selling to tackle out

1226
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
of the back of this liquor store.

1227
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Wow.

1228
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
There you go.

1229
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
OK, OK.

1230
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
And OK, so it starts in this very homespun way.

1231
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Grows and grows.

1232
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Springfield, Missouri remains the, well,

1233
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I guess not the biggest because of the pyramid,

1234
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
but like a un-incredible, well, I think

1235
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
they call it the granddaddy.

1236
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Where's that in my notes?

1237
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
It's the granddaddy of all outdoor stores.

1238
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
There it is.

1239
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Is that one maybe 500,000 square feet?

1240
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
I'm mixing up some of my notes.

1241
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
I mean, they all have incredible water features.

1242
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
That one has a separate aquarium,

1243
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
and so they're called the Wonders of Wildlife National

1244
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Museum and Aquarium.

1245
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
That one has a shooting range under the store.

1246
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
It has a time capsule, very optimistically

1247
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,000
to be opened in 2102.

1248
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
There is something called Hemingway's Blue Water

1249
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Cafe, which exists to attribute the travels of Ernest Hemingway.

1250
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
And on the website, it says, from your first step

1251
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
into Hemingway's Blue Water Cafe,

1252
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
you feel like you are in Ernest Hemingway's library.

1253
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
And then from the Underwood typewriter

1254
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
to the antiques book, and I'm like, oh, OK, cool.

1255
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
And then I'm looking at photos, and I'm like,

1256
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I don't think Hemingway's library had

1257
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
a bar with a fish tank in it.

1258
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Unless I'm really mistaken about how Hemingway lived.

1259
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Let's ask the guy who reads books.

1260
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
That's the book where the bookie will over here.

1261
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,000
The Hemingway Mansion, I believe in Cuba, I think

1262
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
is filled with wild cats.

1263
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Weirdly?

1264
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Yeah.

1265
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
You can tour it, and there's like.

1266
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
What is it?

1267
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
It's a place he lived?

1268
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Yeah, I think it was where he lived.

1269
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
It's Cuba or Florida.

1270
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
But it's much like the Disneyland cats.

1271
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
There's just cats that live on the property,

1272
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
and they feed them, and they're always there.

1273
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
I'm seeing Havana.

1274
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Havana, yeah.

1275
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
He was cat guy.

1276
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I'm seeing Key West.

1277
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
So he would have had a cat tank, not a fish tank.

1278
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Yeah.

1279
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Learn his Hemingway home and museum.

1280
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Walk the path of the legend.

1281
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
And it does say the cats on here.

1282
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
And is it Key West or is it Cuba?

1283
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Both, well, I think both.

1284
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Oh, OK.

1285
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Yes.

1286
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Well, now we know that.

1287
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Now we know facts about a writer.

1288
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Wow.

1289
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
And I don't want to bring things down,

1290
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
but he died in 1961.

1291
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:10,000
And I know you're shining down on me.

1292
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
A song that would come on at middle school dances

1293
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
and it would make me tear.

1294
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
I'm like, why are they playing this song?

1295
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
It's about someone who died.

1296
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
That is really strange.

1297
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
OK, the one I'm going to mention is not as uncharacteristic,

1298
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,000
but as I'm saying nice memories of my son recently,

1299
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
the current thing, again, just fun out in the world.

1300
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
He's just in a regular Target.

1301
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000
And all of a sudden he's like, Mommy, what is this song?

1302
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
And just really fixates on it.

1303
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,000
And the song is All My Life by Casey and Jojo.

1304
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Here's, Scott, this is so fucking weird.

1305
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
What?

1306
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
I've had a bunch of weird things with this.

1307
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
What's yours?

1308
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Because Jason just said that about like tearing up.

1309
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,000
And I will never forget hearing Casey and Jojo's song

1310
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
in like eighth grade on like a boat at like a dance,

1311
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
whatever dance.

1312
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Like as soon as Jason said that, I went, oh, Casey and Jojo.

1313
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
You were already thinking it.

1314
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
I was already thinking it.

1315
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Yeah.

1316
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Whoa, whoa.

1317
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Yes.

1318
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,000
For whatever reason, like it felt just so like it was intrusive

1319
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
in a way.

1320
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
It got in my brain and felt like emotional or weird.

1321
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
It just gives me.

1322
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Everybody's just been harboring a lot of feelings.

1323
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Because as we tell this story to people, everyone is like,

1324
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I learned how to play that on the piano.

1325
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
It's been really like soothing to me.

1326
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
And like I was just talking about that song.

1327
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Boy, I feel like it's making a comeback or something.

1328
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Yeah.

1329
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
I didn't know how much was tied into this song.

1330
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
It isn't a song.

1331
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I don't know.

1332
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Not that I'm not listening to it lately because of this,

1333
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
like it's too raw, the emotions or anything.

1334
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,000
But it is weird because it is one of those songs that just like hit

1335
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:46,000
at the right time when I was like nervous about girls and like dancing.

1336
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
And it felt like this is the most emotional song.

1337
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
The epitome of slow dance for our era.

1338
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Yeah.

1339
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Right.

1340
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
I was a very, I had some wires crossed.

1341
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
I guess I was just too much of a morose child.

1342
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Because thinking back to being emotional when that song came on,

1343
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
I'm like, oh,

1344
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
all my peers were like slow dancing or making out with each other.

1345
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
And I was just like, I wonder who this song is about.

1346
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Who passed?

1347
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Like, you know,

1348
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
I should be mourning right now, not dancing.

1349
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I should be.

1350
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
My Pepsi has gone flat.

1351
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
I'm not enjoying it.

1352
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Did Casey and Jojo have another hit?

1353
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
I don't think so.

1354
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I don't think so.

1355
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I've been thinking, well,

1356
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
they were part of Jodeci, which I did,

1357
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
but I'm not sure that the separate Casey and Jojo.

1358
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Here's the two then sub-stories about that,

1359
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
is that he has been,

1360
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
so like just around the house,

1361
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
he was here in the other room all the time.

1362
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Oh,

1363
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
just singing it to himself.

1364
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
It's so funny.

1365
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Of all the funny,

1366
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
and it's on a little playlist of his favorite songs,

1367
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,000
which are otherwise Thomas the Tank Engine theme songs, Beach Boys,

1368
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Bird, and now Casey and Jojo.

1369
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
It's so inexplicable.

1370
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
And he, at preschool, asked,

1371
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
like, can you play my favorite song?

1372
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
What's that?

1373
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
All my life.

1374
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
And they're like, what do you mean?

1375
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
And he says, by PP and Jojo.

1376
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Oh, really good.

1377
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Really good.

1378
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
That's been some of the best kid stuff.

1379
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
So good.

1380
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
I love it all.

1381
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Anyway, I'll suggest, and now I'm like, who is,

1382
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
this is about a friend and collaborator.

1383
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
One Sweet Day is about Mariah's close friend and collaborator,

1384
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
David Cole,

1385
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
who died of spinal meningitis brought on by AIDS.

1386
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
That's a very sad one.

1387
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
So now you know.

1388
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Mariah Carey and Boys to Men is One Sweet Day.

1389
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Yes.

1390
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,000
And then Casey and Jojo is All My Life.

1391
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Not PP and Jojo.

1392
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
So I don't have the heart to tell my son that.

1393
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Anyways.

1394
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
All right.

1395
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Well, I'm getting all these nice things out.

1396
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Okay.

1397
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
What else about Springfield, Missouri?

1398
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Obviously sells guns also.

1399
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Let's get bad again.

1400
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:01,000
And they have a section called Fine Guns that caused six figures.

1401
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,000
You could go in, you could spend 200 grand on a gun,

1402
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
one gun in the Springfield, Missouri store.

1403
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
This one has exhibits that are so big,

1404
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
they had to cut a hole in the roof to install them.

1405
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
They have things that, I'm not sure what those are,

1406
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
but like animal displays or rock work or something.

1407
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Like, all right, got to cut the roof off.

1408
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Weird things in all of them.

1409
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Oklahoma City is a bowling alley.

1410
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
I think the pyramid does too.

1411
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Vegas has an aquarium or tank, as a lot of them do,

1412
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
but that one does mermaid shows.

1413
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,000
And I think one where Santa goes down during Christmas.

1414
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Silverton Casino, I think that is located adjacent to his Vegas.

1415
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Oh, okay.

1416
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
I saw some video that said Silverton on it.

1417
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Okay, okay.

1418
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
I'm going to go next.

1419
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
I like these now.

1420
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
I'm going to go.

1421
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
A number of them, Jason, get ready for this.

1422
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
A number of them, fudge stores.

1423
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
That is a common thing.

1424
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:02,000
And a lot of these, apparently, people like the Pespro fudge.

1425
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
The one, yeah, Big Cypress Lodge, I was on the website,

1426
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
and it says D-licious fudge in general store.

1427
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
And that's like one of the main, other than the archery range,

1428
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,000
aquarium, and pistol range.

1429
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
They spell it out D-licious?

1430
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:21,000
D-e-e-licious fudge in general store.

1431
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:26,000
They do operate a number of resorts, restaurants,

1432
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
tied to this sort of outdoor aesthetic.

1433
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Did you see that picture, too?

1434
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
That's just nuts.

1435
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Looking down on the pyramid, yes, from above a little bit.

1436
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Oh, that's a view from the hotel.

1437
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Yeah, and there's man-made crick.

1438
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
There's a crick there.

1439
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
There's a crick.

1440
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
There's a crick that runs through the store.

1441
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Not a crick of fudge, but that's something they should get in there

1442
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
at some point.

1443
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
So a fudge-full crick.

1444
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
That's a dream, right?

1445
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
You're Willy Wonka's outdoors.

1446
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Jason's going to need a minute.

1447
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Well, let's, okay, I think we could switch over to the pyramid.

1448
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
And I don't even want to call this, this is one of those,

1449
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
it's similar to when we're talking about Rainforest Cafe,

1450
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
and I'm like, I don't know if I'm emotionally ready to talk about

1451
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
the Galveston Ride, the River Ride, yet.

1452
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,000
I'm like, there's still a part of me that thinks I might try to go,

1453
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
because I am knocking out things of this nature,

1454
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
and a little tease of something to come.

1455
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:27,000
But, so the pyramid, I mean, there's a whole history of stuff

1456
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
beyond the Pro Shop.

1457
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
And Jason, it seems like you looked into a lot of this, too.

1458
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
I know this came up when we talked to Jesse Farrar

1459
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
about Opryland a long time ago,

1460
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
and I don't think I really knew it until he was bringing it up,

1461
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
and it sounds so crazy.

1462
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
For a long time, Memphis had a plan to build something called

1463
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
the Great American Pyramid,

1464
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
which is maybe going to be three of them,

1465
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
and they were going to, like, let's just start,

1466
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
let's go straight to three, why not?

1467
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
It was somebody's dream that didn't happen

1468
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
as a way to set Memphis apart,

1469
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
give them something crazy for the skyline,

1470
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
and it didn't come to pass,

1471
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
but then the guy's son started it later,

1472
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
and so, like, pyramid, it started with pyramids.

1473
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Second thought, what is in it?

1474
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
And it slowly becomes, all right, well, I guess an event space

1475
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,000
of some kind that makes sense,

1476
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
but then there are all these other plans of, like,

1477
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
they are building it.

1478
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Let's just start building it,

1479
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
and then we'll decide what's inside.

1480
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
So, all right, well, pyramids go up really high.

1481
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
What's going to be at the top?

1482
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Well, let's just make sure there is a lot of room

1483
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,000
so that if we wanted to have a hard rock cafe,

1484
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,000
we could do that, which would tie in nicely

1485
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,000
to what we're going to do on the island next door,

1486
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,000
which is a rock and roll theme park called...

1487
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Oh, no, where is it?

1488
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Music Island? Is it just Music Island?

1489
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Yes, Music Island.

1490
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
They were going to build Music Island.

1491
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:53,000
That today remains with the name that it's always had

1492
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,000
since they were building this, which is Mud Island.

1493
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
They didn't get the theme park,

1494
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
but Mud Island does seem to have some big letters

1495
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,000
that say Memphis on it, and that's it, I think.

1496
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,000
If I'm missing something on Mud Island, I apologize.

1497
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Good place to buy your mud.

1498
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Yeah, you can't overlook a great source of mud.

1499
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
So anyway, they have all these crazy plans

1500
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
of what they're going to do,

1501
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
but they'll just start with being like an arena,

1502
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,000
and it's where the University of Memphis Tigers play.

1503
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,000
In 91, they start there, and then the Memphis Grizzlies

1504
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,000
move in there after they moved in from Vancouver.

1505
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Both of those teams left in 2004.

1506
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Some of what you said, Jason, it's kind of a, it's,

1507
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,000
look, the place, the pyramid is like, it's black inside.

1508
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
It's muddy, it's depressing.

1509
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
All the sound goes up to the top.

1510
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
I think that it put the Grizzlies at an advantage,

1511
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,000
because other teams would come in and be like,

1512
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:55,000
this is, this is depressing to be in here.

1513
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,000
And wait, what's the term? It was like, do they call it like,

1514
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
oh, why don't I have it at the ready?

1515
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
They call it like the, you know, something,

1516
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
something about a tomb.

1517
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
I'm not thinking of it.

1518
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
The sarcophagus, I don't know.

1519
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Oh, yeah.

1520
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Nonetheless, I mean, they did a lot of stuff in there,

1521
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,000
but NBA, basketball, not profitable,

1522
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
so that's a big one down.

1523
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,000
They did do gigantic fight,

1524
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Lennox Lewis versus Mike Tyson, in 2002,

1525
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:29,000
which means that this pyramid, due to attendees of that event,

1526
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
this pyramid, at least for one night,

1527
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
in the same night in that building,

1528
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Samuel L. Jackson, Denzel Washington, Tom Cruise,

1529
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Britney Spears, Clint Eastwood, Ben Affleck, Hugh Hefner,

1530
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Dwayne The Rock Johnson, Vince McMahon, The Undertaker,

1531
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Wesley Snipes, Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson,

1532
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Alec Baldwin, and Donald Trump,

1533
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:57,000
all in the greatest assembly of all the great, great people,

1534
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
and one has there ever been.

1535
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,000
That's a real Sergeant Pepper cover, isn't it?

1536
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Yeah.

1537
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
You know, there were some designated survivors,

1538
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,000
you know, just in case, Nathan Lane,

1539
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Matthew Proderick, and of course, Dabney Coleman.

1540
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Oh, okay.

1541
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Ironically, thank God.

1542
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Two producers and the star of 9 to 5.

1543
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Yeah, some of our greats had to remain.

1544
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Oh, if Baldwin and Trump only knew

1545
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
what was coming for both of them,

1546
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,000
the dance that they would do for so many years,

1547
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:37,000
and how America would be so entertained.

1548
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Anyways, but then it's like, what do we do here?

1549
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
They filmed some of the movie Black Snake Moan in there.

1550
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Really? Oh, I missed that.

1551
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
I don't know.

1552
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Really?

1553
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Yeah.

1554
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Which part of it?

1555
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
I think they just built, it was a soundstage.

1556
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Any of it could have been in there.

1557
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
I don't know, a scene in a room.

1558
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Might have been filmed in the pyramid.

1559
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Yeah.

1560
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:03,000
I learned the site of the WWE pay-per-view,

1561
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
the Valentine's Day massacre.

1562
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
St. Valentine's Day massacre.

1563
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
St. Valentine's Day massacre.

1564
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Steel cage match between Steve Austin and Vince McMahon.

1565
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Someone they should have left in a tomb under the pyramid.

1566
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Vince took a really ugly bump there.

1567
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
He fell off the top of the cage, and he landed,

1568
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,000
so this is his belly facing up or whatever.

1569
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
He fell off the top of the cage,

1570
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,000
and he lands on the corner of the announce table like this.

1571
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
One of the ugliest looking bumps.

1572
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
And it's such a shame it didn't fall twice.

1573
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
He would go on fall many more times.

1574
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
If only it had taken place at the top of the pyramid.

1575
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Yeah, I know.

1576
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
It's true.

1577
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Whoa.

1578
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,000
And it's the debut of the big show Paul White,

1579
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
who was originally being called the Big Nasty.

1580
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Whoa.

1581
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,000
His original name was the Big Nasty.

1582
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Sounds like an Austin Powers villain or something.

1583
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Yes.

1584
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Then they changed him to the Big Show.

1585
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Similar to the fun of me,

1586
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,000
I already had the trademark for the Big Nasty,

1587
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
so we had to change it.

1588
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
They didn't want to pay me.

1589
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
You were 14.

1590
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Yeah, I was 14.

1591
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,000
An industrious copyright getter as well as an outdoorsman.

1592
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
It didn't work.

1593
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
It didn't work at all.

1594
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
It didn't make me cool.

1595
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Kids just beat the shit out of me.

1596
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,000
I own the copyright to the phrase Big Nasty.

1597
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,000
You're the little nasty piece of garbage.

1598
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
They would shout.

1599
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
We'll make you nastier.

1600
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
You're the real eel now.

1601
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Now, yes.

1602
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
That's all in the past, and now you're the real eel.

1603
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Oh, will that make me cool in the high school 21 years?

1604
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
It's a time machine.

1605
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,000
You've got to go to a reunion and find that out.

1606
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
No, I already skipped that.

1607
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
That's correct.

1608
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Good move.

1609
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Anyway, it never turns into anything.

1610
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Do we visit it?

1611
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Do we make it a church?

1612
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Do we make a Smithsonian, a middle of the country Smithsonian

1613
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
to fill a pyramid?

1614
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
None of it.

1615
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,000
And by the way, the 10th biggest pyramid in the world,

1616
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,000
bigger than Luxor, bumped Luxor from the top 10.

1617
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
So this thing is massive.

1618
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
And then suddenly Bass Pro Shops ends up in it.

1619
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,000
There's some lore, which assuredly is fake,

1620
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,000
and which went better in terms of fake lore, fishing stories.

1621
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:15,000
That's what it's made for.

1622
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
But supposedly, the owners of Bass Pro Shops

1623
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,000
were fishing in the shadow of the pyramid,

1624
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:25,000
and there was a bet, like, if you catch a 30-pound catfish,

1625
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
you've got to build a store in there.

1626
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
And then they did it.

1627
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Johnny Morris is taking that bet.

1628
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
That's what happened.

1629
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:39,000
His friend did, almost in the shop, a 34-pound catfish.

1630
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,000
And sure enough, they bought it, and they moved in there in 2015.

1631
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
And they built this.

1632
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,000
I mean, I just feel like I got to go here.

1633
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
There's nothing else.

1634
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Well, look, I want to go to the Sun Sphere.

1635
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,000
I want to go to the site of the 1982 World's Fair in Knoxville.

1636
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
And I know these things are close to each other.

1637
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
But maybe I just got to figure out some kind of Tennessee loop.

1638
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Yeah.

1639
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
I'll also include .look.

1640
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Just Tennessee.

1641
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
That's just going to have to be a block.

1642
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
I'm going to have to go to the Memphis pyramid.

1643
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Because this seems, yeah, that photo you were showing,

1644
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,000
you look at it from above, it's unreal.

1645
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
You put some fish eye on there.

1646
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:15,000
This is one of the strangest environments that's ever existed.

1647
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Yeah.

1648
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
No, there has to be all Tennessee thing.

1649
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
I would like to do a Tennessee thing.

1650
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,000
If I've only driven through Tennessee, I've never really hung.

1651
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Yeah, I went to Bonnaroo.

1652
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
That's right.

1653
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
No, I did go-karts there.

1654
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
And I saw the Beach Boys there.

1655
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
So there's some on-brand things.

1656
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Right, right.

1657
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
But still not.

1658
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:37,000
And I didn't get to experience all the things.

1659
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Oh, and that's where I stayed and what I determined

1660
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
was a holiday in Holodome.

1661
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
So I got some of the, I got some good Tennessee stuff.

1662
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
But yeah, there's always room for more.

1663
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Yeah, yeah.

1664
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,000
And there's room for so much in this place.

1665
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Wait, there's live alligators live in that pyramid.

1666
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
There's alligators in the pyramid.

1667
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Theming-wise, you've got a cave and a swamp.

1668
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
It's all real swampy.

1669
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Tallest freestanding elevator in the world, like you said,

1670
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,000
which takes you up to a bar that was never built out at the height of,

1671
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,000
never when they were hosting NBA basketball.

1672
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,000
They never developed the top as a bar.

1673
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,000
And now it took Bass Pro Shops to do it.

1674
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,000
And now it's got an incredible view of the Mississippi River,

1675
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
which is, I don't know, incredible.

1676
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
It's a muddy view.

1677
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Yeah, yeah, yes.

1678
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,000
But it's a view of Mud Island.

1679
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:31,000
The narration in that elevator, they say that freestanding elevator

1680
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,000
is taller than the Statue of Liberty.

1681
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Wow, really?

1682
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Jesus, that's nuts.

1683
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
The scale, how do you build that?

1684
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
That being said, Statue of Liberty is shorter than I thought it was.

1685
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Yeah.

1686
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
There's a lot of calibration to do here.

1687
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
But nonetheless, that's crazy.

1688
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:52,000
There's also a whole crazy thing about this place that Alex Jones

1689
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:57,000
started yelling about that there's a crystal skull up at the top of it.

1690
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Oh, really?

1691
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
The Illuminati planted a crystal skull.

1692
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Yes, the same thing from the Indiana Jones title.

1693
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
And that inspired the Danic Red Vodka.

1694
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
And there's a crystal skull up at the top of it.

1695
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,000
You take away some of the plants, and then you'll find that.

1696
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:18,000
And Alex Jones, of course, as he often is, was completely right,

1697
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
100% right.

1698
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Oh, right.

1699
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:26,000
There is a, and it actually was, a crystal skull was put up there

1700
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:32,000
by the founder of Hard Rock Cafe, Isaac something or other,

1701
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Isaac Tigret, Tigret, who, because they were thinking about putting one up

1702
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,000
there, and then they didn't, but somehow he still fit in a crystal skull.

1703
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
So this has to, this has to, you know, if this, then what?

1704
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
What else is Alex Jones?

1705
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
So it's an aspirational crystal skull.

1706
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:53,000
I think, yeah, to like just put some good rock and roll mojo.

1707
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Just lurking above the bar where you can now get like mozzarella sticks

1708
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,000
on top of a Bayes Pro Shop.

1709
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Yeah, yeah.

1710
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Wishing you a good, wishing you that you don't fall off the glass bottom bar.

1711
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Is it like an old crystal skull, or is it a new crystal skull?

1712
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Like is it a, he had it like commissioned or something,

1713
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,000
or is it like something from olden days?

1714
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
I really don't know.

1715
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:22,000
And I'm also now going, did Isaac Tigret move to House of Blues

1716
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
and then work with Dan Aykroyd?

1717
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
And yes, the answer is yes.

1718
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Is that, okay, did they become friends because of crystal skulls?

1719
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Yeah, good question.

1720
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Did he, was he already friends of them?

1721
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,000
So he was like, like, traveling to Memphis, huh?

1722
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:40,000
You're going to want to have a bag of crystal skulls with you at all times.

1723
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:44,000
I got in a close call with a plane crash one time,

1724
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:50,000
and ever since, I've always got the power of crystal in my pocket.

1725
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Do you want to check that bag, they say.

1726
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,000
I say, absolutely not.

1727
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
That stays on my person.

1728
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,000
I got to say, if I was in a plane crash,

1729
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,000
the last thing I would want floating around the cabin

1730
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,000
would be a giant crystal skull coming right for me.

1731
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
No, but you're wrong.

1732
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Oh, okay.

1733
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Crystal skull will protect you.

1734
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
What you want to do is buy another seat.

1735
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Put them in the seat belt.

1736
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Lock them up.

1737
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Make sure they can't go flying around.

1738
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Put an oxygen mask on one.

1739
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
That's good luck, too.

1740
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
A crystal skull.

1741
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,000
I'll put a crystal shield of armor around you.

1742
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Just check in for my flight.

1743
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Here's my passport.

1744
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,000
And then I have a ticket for my skull.

1745
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Put the skull on your head.

1746
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
My acroid turned into a little McGruff there.

1747
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
I've listened to a lot of acroid lately.

1748
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
I don't know why.

1749
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
There's just been a string of acroid interviews

1750
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
I've been listening to recently.

1751
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Are you saying that as if I'm supposed to be surprised

1752
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
that you are listening to lots of Danica?

1753
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
No, no, no.

1754
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,000
I just wish that the people would let him go farther.

1755
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
I don't care about Ghostbusters.

1756
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
I don't want to hear about Blues Brothers.

1757
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,000
I don't want to hear about any of it.

1758
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,000
I want to hear him get to the really alienating weird stuff

1759
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
about ghosts and aliens.

1760
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
All right.

1761
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
So you're saying that there's a guy on a podcast,

1762
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,000
and he starts to kind of want to talk about ghosts

1763
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
and aliens and stuff.

1764
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:06,000
And then the other people doing the podcast

1765
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,000
are sort of giving clues that they don't really

1766
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
want to hear about that stuff.

1767
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,000
And then maybe we should stay on the topics,

1768
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,000
like Bass Pro- I mean, Blues Brothers.

1769
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Right, yes.

1770
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Yeah, yeah.

1771
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
That's interesting.

1772
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Yes, sure.

1773
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Or if it's like if, for instance,

1774
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,000
if he wanted to talk about Wayland Flowers and Madam,

1775
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
they should let him go.

1776
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Let him talk.

1777
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Let him go.

1778
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
If hypothetically, one of the things that Matt Crud

1779
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,000
wanted to, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1780
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1781
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:37,000
So I'm just saying, I want even more alien content

1782
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
and ghost content.

1783
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,000
You relate to somebody who's being passive

1784
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
aggressively censored.

1785
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Yes, I do.

1786
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
I do feel that.

1787
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,000
You're a truth teller.

1788
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,000
A fellow truth teller.

1789
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Yeah, like me and Danny.

1790
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:53,000
And Mikey Carlson been hanging out trading skulls.

1791
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Yours went to McGruff now, too.

1792
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Yeah, that was extremely.

1793
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,000
I put it in your head now that it's McGruff.

1794
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
I'm also losing my voice a little slightly,

1795
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,000
which might be, I think, so high as my best Pro Shops

1796
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
enthusiasm.

1797
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:08,000
So I'll try to wind it down and take a little break there.

1798
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,000
But got to get a little time to, OK, well,

1799
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
just really quick.

1800
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
What's really confusing is you're

1801
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,000
looking at a, if you don't know any of this history,

1802
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
and you're just like, we're also like,

1803
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:22,000
it's not exactly in downtown Memphis, but close.

1804
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,000
It's part of the skyline.

1805
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
It's very close.

1806
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:29,000
And so if you don't know what's going on in the city,

1807
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,000
you're looking at one of the biggest pyramids on Earth.

1808
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
You go, what is it, though?

1809
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,000
And then you drive up, and you see Bass Pro Shops.

1810
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Huh?

1811
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,000
And then under that, separate sign on the outside,

1812
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,000
the Ducks Unlimited Water Fowling Heritage

1813
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Center.

1814
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,000
This only gets us further into the weeds,

1815
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,000
which apparently is just a very nice museum about ducks.

1816
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
I don't think there's anything to fear.

1817
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
The word heritage makes me worry that something weird

1818
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,000
is going on.

1819
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
But I don't think so.

1820
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
It's just a further, like, OK, maybe

1821
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
I've heard of Bass Pro Shops, but you're

1822
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
throwing a lot of words at me.

1823
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:07,000
You asked Ducks Unlimited as a brand I should be familiar with.

1824
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Ducks Unlimited is one of the conservation charities

1825
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
they work with.

1826
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Oh.

1827
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,000
OK.

1828
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Well, and that's what I've read, too, is that, like, sure,

1829
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:19,000
yeah, does this all, like, you know, yeah, it's hunting.

1830
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,000
You know, will animals die because of this place?

1831
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Of course.

1832
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:27,000
But there's also conservation involved in the, you know,

1833
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
where there's hunting, there's conservation,

1834
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
said something I read.

1835
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Somebody please point to me in a lot of ways why that's wrong.

1836
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,000
I'm just trying to make heads or tails out of this.

1837
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
We're not outdoor guys.

1838
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,000
For Jason, kind of.

1839
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,000
The logic, I think, with, like, in Pennsylvania and Jersey,

1840
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:49,000
when they would give out hunting licenses, some seasons

1841
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:53,000
I think they would give out more, cut the prices,

1842
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:57,000
if there was too much of a certain species,

1843
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:01,000
if it was overrunning the area and upsetting the ecosystem.

1844
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Oh, OK.

1845
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,000
So there's, like, there's some sense of balance.

1846
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Well, and also, like, there's, like,

1847
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:12,000
hunters probably create the need to, like,

1848
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,000
preserve big areas of land as nature,

1849
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
which is a good thing.

1850
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Yeah.

1851
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
And that leads me to one odd thing that I didn't know

1852
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:28,000
was in the Best Pro Shops story, which is they bought,

1853
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
sorry, I'm looking for the...

1854
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,000
The shotgun pellets that Dick Janey blasted in the

1855
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:38,000
The shotgun pellets that Dick Janey blasted into that guy.

1856
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Yes, yeah, yeah.

1857
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Preserved in the Bush Janey Heritage Museum,

1858
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:48,000
which is the very, very tip-top of the pyramid.

1859
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Yeah.

1860
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Never forget the best presidency.

1861
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Next to the crystal skull.

1862
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,000
They should put that in the pavilion in Epcot.

1863
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
The skull.

1864
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
They're doing this.

1865
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Well, they're doing this George W. Bush painting.

1866
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Oh, the paintings, yeah.

1867
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Let's get the shotgun blast when Janey hit that guy

1868
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,000
when he was hunting.

1869
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Was it punk shot?

1870
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Was it salt pellet?

1871
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Maybe it all melted.

1872
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Yeah, that's true.

1873
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Maybe it's not there, but still, they should have

1874
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
something to honor the moment.

1875
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Yeah.

1876
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Sure.

1877
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
In the American pavilion.

1878
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Yeah, one of the great moments of American history.

1879
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
It should really be portrayed in the...

1880
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,000
They should cut one of those American adventure scenes

1881
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,000
and then just put in a big scene where Dick Janey's

1882
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,000
just going on and on, waving a gun around

1883
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:34,000
next to a friend animatronic who just nods, looks around.

1884
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,000
And then, I don't know, imagine your technology.

1885
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Maybe it's a projection mapping thing, but all of a sudden,

1886
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
blam, shot in the face.

1887
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Well, you know what it should be.

1888
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Actually, you know what it should be.

1889
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,000
They just take, at the end of the Disneyland Pirates,

1890
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
the two pirates hanging on the cannon with the guns,

1891
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,000
just take their heads off, put Janey head on one of them,

1892
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,000
and put the other guy, the senator or whatever,

1893
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,000
on the other, like, and then...

1894
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,000
The other guy who I believe apologized to Dick Janey.

1895
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
He said he got in the way, right?

1896
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Yeah, something like that.

1897
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Yeah.

1898
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Wow.

1899
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Well, maybe it was his fault.

1900
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,000
I don't know.

1901
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,000
It's like when Superman apologized to Lex Luthor.

1902
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

1903
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Really, good boy.

1904
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,000
To be fair, I'm sure the other guy was a bad guy, too.

1905
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
There's no way.

1906
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Well, if he's on a hunting trip with Dick Janey,

1907
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
he's absolutely a bad guy.

1908
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Harry Whittington, longtime Texas GOP supporter.

1909
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Yeah, I think I found my answer.

1910
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Well, which allow me to say that Johnny Morris,

1911
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:37,000
the CEO of this chain, who is now worth $9.6 billion,

1912
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
big Trump donor.

1913
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
What?

1914
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Yeah, I'm sorry to say.

1915
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Look, I'm trying to say these things.

1916
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
I don't know.

1917
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
It's tough.

1918
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Again, fake rocks.

1919
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,000
What do you want me to do?

1920
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
I'm excited.

1921
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Kid had fun.

1922
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,000
He doesn't know.

1923
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,000
He's not following the donations of Johnny Morris.

1924
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Yeah, and plus, if you go in there,

1925
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,000
and you shed a few liberal tears in there,

1926
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,000
that's sticking it to them.

1927
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Yeah, and the coffee mugs that say that.

1928
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
My mere presence is defiance.

1929
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,000
If Casey and JoJo was playing in a Bass Pro Shop,

1930
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
you would shed some of your liberal tears on the floor,

1931
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
and it would contaminate that space.

1932
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
That's getting back at them.

1933
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
I think I have a fun note to end on.

1934
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
I have several things, but feel free to end.

1935
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Oh, please.

1936
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
No, I thought you were reaching for the end.

1937
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
I mean, I sort of am, but yeah.

1938
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:31,000
I got shopping results looking up Bass Pro Shops,

1939
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:40,000
and I didn't know that Fishing Rods, Fishing Poles had unique names.

1940
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
You sound like you're setting up a talk show.

1941
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Johnny Carson.

1942
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,000
These fishing poles have some very unique names.

1943
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
In the segment we call Weird Fishing Poles.

1944
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Bass Pro Shops, Johnny Morris, we've established the founder.

1945
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Johnny Morris Signature Series, Made in USA, spinning rod.

1946
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Okay, pretty normal.

1947
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Then we get Bass Pro Shops Crappy Max Quick Tip, spinning combo.

1948
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Crappy Max?

1949
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,000
That's C-R-A-P-P-I-E.

1950
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Crappy Max?

1951
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Crappy Max, M-A-X-X.

1952
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:20,000
So I don't know what a Crappy Max is, but I think my favorite name I came across,

1953
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Bass Pro Shops Crank and Stick, crank bait casting rod.

1954
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Crank and?

1955
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,000
An or N, like an N in place of an N.

1956
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:36,000
C-R-A-N-K-I-N apostrophe crank and stick.

1957
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Crank and stick.

1958
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
That's a little bit of a...

1959
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Pretty nasty.

1960
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Innuendo, is it not?

1961
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,000
That's a big nasty.

1962
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Is it a place that stands up for values and yet sells a crank and stick in a place where

1963
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
children can go?

1964
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Yeah, what about that?

1965
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Sickos.

1966
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Yeah, we should make a TikTok about it.

1967
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Jason, you do it.

1968
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Crappy Max, crank and stick.

1969
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,000
First of all, they're swearing in front of our kids.

1970
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Secondly, they're teaching them what cranking with a stick is.

1971
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:08,000
I had to explain to my son what a gun is or run away like a coward from explaining what

1972
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,000
it is.

1973
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,000
And then I almost had to...

1974
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:14,000
If I'd taken one wrong turn and I had to tell him about a crank and stick.

1975
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Daddy, what's a crank and stick?

1976
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
I'm not prepared for that.

1977
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
God, I hate this place.

1978
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
So much work.

1979
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Not until you're a teenager and we never discuss it.

1980
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Okay, just quick other things.

1981
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Actually, just before I leave the pyramid, Wall Burger's Wild, you mentioned.

1982
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:40,000
There was a full other restaurant called Uncle Buck's something or other, and it became

1983
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:45,000
a Wall Burger's, but a sub-Wall Burger's brand called Wall Burger's Wild.

1984
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
What does Wall Burger's Wild mean?

1985
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:52,000
I went to find out and I started looking at a menu and I saw almost nothing different.

1986
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,000
I got confused.

1987
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:59,000
And yeah, it's in kind of a tin check sort of vibe, art direction, fantastic.

1988
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:04,000
But it's still like the green logo, which is just very urban, kind of doesn't tell you

1989
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,000
anything.

1990
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,000
So what's Wall Burger's Wild?

1991
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:10,000
According to the initial press release, it's that they're going to have Gator Bites and

1992
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Venison Chili and a Bison Burger.

1993
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,000
And that makes it a separate restaurant, Wall Burger's Wild.

1994
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
So you can eat Gator at a...

1995
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:24,000
When it's designated wild, it means that they have Gator and Venison.

1996
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Well, let me now correct you and say it meant that they had that because according to someone

1997
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:35,000
who wrote an article recently, they still have the Venison and the Bison and they do

1998
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
not have Gator Bites anymore.

1999
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
No Gator Bites.

2000
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,000
And they were Gator.

2001
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,000
That wasn't just a cute little thing to call French fries.

2002
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
They were Gator and that's the thing you can...

2003
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:49,000
I remember having that on a Disney World trip one time, but I think it didn't make sense

2004
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,000
to keep...

2005
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:55,000
They were starting to eye the Gators who live in the store and maybe realizing there's a

2006
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
conflict of interest there.

2007
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Do you think Mark Wahlberg himself had to test the Gator Bites before they were approved

2008
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,000
for Wall Burger's Wild?

2009
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:08,000
If I'm to believe what I learned from his reality show, Wall Street, in which he was

2010
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:13,000
like ushered at all times, he's on a motorcycle filming a movie, then he's ushered to a tent

2011
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,000
where he's trying a burger and then going like, it's a little dry.

2012
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,000
I think we got to work on that.

2013
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
We got to prey on that.

2014
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Let's hollow up and figure out how we can get a little more juice in that burger.

2015
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
All right, but that's fine.

2016
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
You keep at it, bro.

2017
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,000
And then he's like calling the boring gym he works for.

2018
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,000
So I don't know.

2019
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:35,000
I actually kind of do think that Wahlberg at least performatively had to try the Gator

2020
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Bites.

2021
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Yeah, yeah.

2022
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,000
No, but taking Gator Bites off the menu, if he had been there, it wouldn't have gone

2023
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,000
down like that.

2024
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2025
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Why didn't you lube me in on this?

2026
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Donnie.

2027
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Why are we calling a Wall Burger's Wild if we don't...

2028
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Donnie.

2029
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Two things doesn't make it wild.

2030
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
It doesn't make any sense.

2031
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:58,000
And then they punch each other and then hug it out.

2032
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Yeah.

2033
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
I made you bleed because I love you.

2034
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Donnie dances it out, though, not punching.

2035
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Donnie, did you download the Catholic app?

2036
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
You got to download the prey app.

2037
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Are you preyed up?

2038
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Are you staying preyed up?

2039
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,000
I looked at your phone.

2040
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
You don't have Hallow on there.

2041
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,000
That hurts me.

2042
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:19,000
If I can't trust my brother to have Hallow?

2043
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:22,000
All right, anyway, confusing thing.

2044
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:25,000
But where I was starting to go with it all is in talking about,

2045
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
well, at least there's land conservation as a part of it.

2046
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:32,000
And here is one of the big things that Bass Pro Shops is doing

2047
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:38,000
that they have in Arkansas bought 400 acres of land,

2048
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:42,000
which they are turning into a private nature reserve.

2049
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,000
That's kind of boring, what I'm telling you, right?

2050
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Ultimately, they're building an eight.

2051
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Because I'm like, oh, they're buying a bunch of land.

2052
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
What's that for?

2053
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,000
And then Parker said, no, it's just going to be a nice looking place.

2054
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:57,000
What they have purchased is the land on which existed,

2055
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
a place called Dogpatch USA.

2056
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Whoa.

2057
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,000
They bought it.

2058
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,000
They own that now.

2059
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Wow.

2060
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Yes.

2061
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,000
From that guy?

2062
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Or was it too removed?

2063
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,000
I forget.

2064
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
I'd have to go back and remember the history.

2065
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:12,000
In my head, and I know this is wrong, in my head,

2066
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:17,000
it was all given as a settlement to that guy who almost got decapitated,

2067
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:21,000
a teen who almost got decapitated by a taut wire on an ATV.

2068
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:26,000
And he owned it like when Cartman owned the water park or whatever.

2069
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Yeah.

2070
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:32,000
And they gave him like 5,000 bucks.

2071
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Yeah, sure.

2072
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:36,000
I don't want this shitty place.

2073
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:41,000
But no, I don't know who they bought it from.

2074
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:46,000
I know that, I did some math, 400 acres is Magic Kingdom plus Epcot.

2075
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
That's how much land that is.

2076
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:53,000
And they bought it for $1.2 million.

2077
01:23:53,000 --> 01:24:00,000
$1.2 million in Los Angeles is like, well, you get the one bathroom for that.

2078
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:05,000
You might get a second bedroom maybe for the $1.2 million.

2079
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:09,000
They bought 400 acres of all of Dogpatch USA.

2080
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:14,000
And they also probably have the phone number of someone who can comb through

2081
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:20,000
all those acres and find all the tripwires and garret ropes

2082
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
and all this stuff that would kill you.

2083
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,000
And bear traps.

2084
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,000
And bear bags.

2085
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Bear bags, bear traps.

2086
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Bear bags full of explosives.

2087
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Electric eels.

2088
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:34,000
They know the wilderness survival experts who can de-weaponize.

2089
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Yeah, of course.

2090
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Yes.

2091
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Land mines filled with paint for particularly violent,

2092
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:45,000
totally off-the-grid paintball games that could actually blow your arm off,

2093
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,000
beat or no.

2094
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Right.

2095
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:50,000
They were packed enough.

2096
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Have you heard from your friend that owned Dogpatch,

2097
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
that was getting Dogpatch off the ground?

2098
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,000
What's the guy's name again?

2099
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,000
My friend?

2100
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
I'm forgetting that I had a friend.

2101
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Sorry, he's not your friend.

2102
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,000
He's not your friend.

2103
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,000
But what's the guy's name that owned the place and was losing his mind?

2104
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Oh, that guy.

2105
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Oh, my God.

2106
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,000
It's been so long, I don't remember, who did the little variety shows.

2107
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Yeah, yeah.

2108
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Oh, man, I loved him.

2109
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,000
What is his name?

2110
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,000
I know, I can't think of his name.

2111
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Oh, right.

2112
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,000
The Puppet Man?

2113
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Well, yeah, he did the Puppets.

2114
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,000
The Down and Dogpatch.

2115
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
The Down and Dogpatch was a song I liked.

2116
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Yes.

2117
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,000
I thought that was pretty good.

2118
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Yeah.

2119
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
But he had like sort of, he had like...

2120
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,000
From Heritage USA.

2121
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Wait, we said it earlier.

2122
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
That's why I had a weird feeling about the word heritage.

2123
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Right.

2124
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,000
These are ancient episodes of this place.

2125
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
I know, and I can't think of the name of people anymore.

2126
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,000
What's his name?

2127
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,000
God, what a psycho.

2128
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,000
I love that guy.

2129
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
He would pop up here and there.

2130
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Hubble.

2131
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,000
No, David Hare.

2132
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,000
David Hare, because...

2133
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
He named the character Hubble Hare.

2134
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Right, Hubble Hare was a rabbit character.

2135
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Well, wasn't he...

2136
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,000
I haven't looked into him in a while.

2137
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Wasn't he like on the run?

2138
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,000
He was like...

2139
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Yes, right, right.

2140
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Last I heard, he was on the lamb.

2141
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Yes.

2142
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
But that was a long time ago.

2143
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:57,000
And there were these long YouTube videos of him like rambling about like problems with

2144
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:02,000
things, and like he was really like, oh, just like really strung out and stressed.

2145
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:06,000
He might have just like changed identity, moved to Ecuador.

2146
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Just like a god on a boat didn't ask where it was going.

2147
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,000
Yes.

2148
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,000
It's very possible.

2149
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
How do I search for him?

2150
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
David Hare, con man.

2151
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,000
David Hare.

2152
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Last I remind you, I believe he was also very litigious.

2153
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Oh, yes, that's right.

2154
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Very litigious man.

2155
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Well, we did a main feed years ago.

2156
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Yeah, that's true.

2157
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Yeah, yeah, that was behind the page.

2158
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Yeah, I'm sure we said way worse things there.

2159
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Anyway, incredible just way that that all ties together.

2160
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,000
It's great.

2161
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,000
And you know what?

2162
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,000
I trust them more to.

2163
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:41,000
And I think what they're going to do is just like make it a nice looking.

2164
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
They're calling it Marble Falls Nature Park.

2165
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
And it is just a place with like caverns.

2166
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,000
And I think they're going to do I think they're going to do a great job.

2167
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Johnny Morris, who I am simultaneously praising and noting that he is a big donor to the Trump

2168
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,000
campaign.

2169
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
I can't speak to that.

2170
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:02,000
But I know all I want is that among all of the nice rocks, real rocks there, you put

2171
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:08,000
some fake ones and maybe all maybe we'll all be back down in dog patch.

2172
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
I'm upset by this plan.

2173
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
I thought he should reopen dog patch.

2174
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Yeah, I think we need more little Abner stuff.

2175
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
You need more little Abner.

2176
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
You need to meet the shmoo.

2177
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,000
He has enough money.

2178
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
He could generically engineer a shmoo.

2179
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:25,000
He should genetically engineer the actual shmoo into reality.

2180
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Jason's correct.

2181
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,000
He could do it.

2182
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2183
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Yes.

2184
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Yeah, they can 3D print species.

2185
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,000
That's right.

2186
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,000
So I'm mad.

2187
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
I'm upset that dog patch is dead forever.

2188
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Yeah.

2189
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
So we can go shmoo hunting.

2190
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Right.

2191
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,000
Yeah, yeah.

2192
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Well, I hope, you know, I really would like to make it to Tennessee and maybe that can

2193
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:48,000
be in my future family travels.

2194
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:51,000
But just on the way out the door, I know it's a long one, but I did want to tease this because

2195
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:54,000
there are these there's other little things that I want to talk about the fun stuff I've

2196
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,000
got to do with the family.

2197
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,000
But there's going to be a big one.

2198
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:02,000
So on the topic of family travels that will spin into future episodes, this is a little

2199
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,000
thing that was brought up in an episode a couple of months ago.

2200
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:12,000
And I just just to cut to the chase, I'm thrilled to announce that after some amazing intervention

2201
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:17,000
from my pal Joe Carnegie, the Gerdner's are going to Casa Benita.

2202
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Wow, it's happening.

2203
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:21,000
We've got a date and it's soon.

2204
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,000
And we are due.

2205
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:26,000
I complained about it in an episode because I realized it's like a yearlong waitlist.

2206
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Right.

2207
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:31,000
And my friend Joe realized that he he's like, oh, yes, of course.

2208
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,000
And I'm on the waitlist.

2209
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,000
What?

2210
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Oh, God, I wish I knew.

2211
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,000
And suddenly he's like, you know what?

2212
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,000
I don't think I'm going to be able to go.

2213
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,000
I can't just drop everything.

2214
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Whoa.

2215
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:41,000
And I never canceled my flight.

2216
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,000
So I like I just like, I don't know, I just got a feeling.

2217
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,000
I think.

2218
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:49,000
And so suddenly I didn't fully pull out or lose hope.

2219
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
And I get to take his flight.

2220
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,000
You mean even?

2221
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
No, not not taking his flight.

2222
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,000
No.

2223
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,000
OK.

2224
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
That's what I had booked a flight and then gone.

2225
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
All right now to get my Casa Benita reservations.

2226
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Oh, God.

2227
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Wow.

2228
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,000
It is an incredible process.

2229
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:11,000
You know, you know, and our our friend Landon was was trying to work some angles for me,

2230
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,000
which kept hope going for me.

2231
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,000
It was a whole crazy thing.

2232
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Wow.

2233
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
But anyway, that's we're now we're on the way.

2234
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,000
That's exciting.

2235
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Soon.

2236
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:23,000
So I will soon be able to come back to the PTR audience and report on Casa Benita.

2237
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Whoa.

2238
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Legendary Denver restaurant.

2239
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,000
Whoa.

2240
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Jason is sneezing up a storm.

2241
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Violent sneezes.

2242
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:34,000
So excited.

2243
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,000
And yeah.

2244
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:42,000
So that episode to come and we can only hope that no character actors die earlier in the

2245
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,000
day.

2246
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,000
We might overtake.

2247
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Of that being recorded.

2248
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Gene Ackman better stay alive.

2249
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Oh, God.

2250
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,000
I guess he's more of a leading man.

2251
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
The epitome of PTR curse there.

2252
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,000
Why?

2253
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Because he's in his mid 90s.

2254
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Yeah.

2255
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Yeah.

2256
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,000
It is because he's we say like he's fine.

2257
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,000

I'll also I'll just try to like be on the hunt for David Hare, too, unless he's untrackable,

2264
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:28,000
unless he has unless he adopted a new name and a new backstory, found the most shady

2265
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Arkansas relocation program.

2266
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Maybe he got he got Ria say he's living as an animal.

2267
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
He's that's possible.

2268
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,000
He's in a bear suit.

2269
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:40,000
They're going to find him when they're clearing the area.

2270
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Wait a minute.

2271
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,000
What's that?

2272
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Oh, is that a bear?

2273
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Watch out, everybody.

2274
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Wait, hang on.

2275
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,000
I think I see a zipper.

2276
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:50,000
He's like that a man who's been posing as a bear for five years to avoid the feds.

2277
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Wasn't there someone in Japan doing that is like living like a dog or something like

2278
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:56,000
for like permit.

2279
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:00,000
I don't know if it's permanent, but like for a while living as a dog in a dog suit.

2280
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:04,000
So maybe he's doing the same thing or maybe he's he's assumed the identity of Hubble

2281
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,000
hair.

2282
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Yes.

2283
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Now he's just a big rabbit.

2284
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
And it's not even it's not even a disguise to him.

2285
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,000
He has become him.

2286
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:13,000
This is my I am become Hubble hair.

2287
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:16,000
This is my skin, he says, when somebody like pulls at it.

2288
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Oh, he says, oh, please don't pull my skin.

2289
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Right.

2290
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Well, good luck finding him.

2291
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
World record breaking rabbit.

2292
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:28,000
The biggest rabbit there ever was worthy of best pressure.
