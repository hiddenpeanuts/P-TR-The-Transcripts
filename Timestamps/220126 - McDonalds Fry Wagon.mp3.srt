1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Westward ho everyone.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The fry wagon is pulled up here to the second gate.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm Scott Gardiner, Jason Sheridan's here, hi.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Hi.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And Mike Carlson as well.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Yes, I'm here.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
If the Oregon Trail would have been a much lovelier time if there was a fry wagon that

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
followed the group, don't you think?

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Oh, fried potatoes, yeah.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
On demand, sure.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Oh yeah, what a lifted spirits for sure.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And solved the, they would have had food as well.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Assuming if they could get, it wouldn't have been spirit lifter if there weren't any potatoes

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
to put in it.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Okay, that's true.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
But the wagon itself wouldn't have helped anything.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So if you were playing the game, the Oregon Trail, then it would have been like the McDonald's

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
fry wagon has run out of potatoes.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And then you'd have to go find the potatoes or you'd have to like kill some.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Powdered beef seasoning, it's run out of powdered beef seasoning.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Run out of plastic Happy Meal toys.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So you will not be able to distribute toys to the children anymore.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So they'll rebel, start hitting you, you're weak already, like you're weak at the knees,

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
the kids hit your knees and you would keel over and die.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You have to invent cheaper plastic in order to make whatever IP they had during the Oregon Trail,

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
which it was what?

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I don't know.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What stories were they telling?

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Oh yeah, Paul Bunyan.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I guess it's a lot of it's like, oh, it's Paul Bunyan again.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Oh, it's Andy Oakley again.

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
They had three stories back then.

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yeah.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So I don't know, that would still be exciting to get if it was different versions of Paul and his different clothing.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That's true.

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yeah, all those different outfits.

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Babe, babe, the blue ox comes at different colors.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Oh yeah, maybe there's like Yoshi.

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yeah, like Yoshi.

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Babe is like Yoshi.

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Babe, the red ox.

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Babe, the yellow ox.

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yeah.

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Like them all.

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Geez.

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Well, kids had a lot to look forward to.

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yeah.

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
In this fictional, all you got to do is combine McDonald's with the Oregon Trail or anything, really.

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Right.

51
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And look how much better it makes it.

52
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I agree.

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Always.

54
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
McDonald's always improves any situation.

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We're talking about a wagon that sold fries in Frontierland.

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
A dusty old wagon that sold McDonald's fries that people love.

57
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yeah.

58
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
There's a lot of fondness for this, I feel.

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
A lot of affection, I feel, like I found online.

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Now, I never got to experience this because I believe it was, was it gone by the time?

61
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
No, I don't think so.

62
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
We might have gotten the tail end of it when we moved out here.

63
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I don't think I did it, though.

64
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I think I might have seen it, but I didn't experience it.

65
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yeah.

66
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
On the map, the official name of this place was Conestoga Fries, although on the top of

67
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
the Conestoga wagon building itself, it said Westward Ho in big letters.

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So that's confusing.

69
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yeah.

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Which was a callback to the, when Tizzyland actually had Conestoga wagons that you could

71
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
ride in that said Westward Ho on them.

72
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You know this is a bad ride if we've never even heard of it.

73
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Westward Ho wagons.

74
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Conestoga wagons.

75
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
We've kind of, we know that there were mules and we know nature's wonderland.

76
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
The wagons must have really stink.

77
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
All the practical stuff in Frontierland back in the day is just kind of like a blank slate

78
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
because it was 30 years before I was born.

79
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So.

80
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yeah, yeah.

81
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But it's also just like a big, you know, there's a dirt lot.

82
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Like there's one area of the park that we don't have to make not a dirt lot.

83
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
That's going to save us so much work.

84
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
But it really was, what is easier?

85
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
They had a dirt lot and they were like, just throw a wagon over there and just throw the

86
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
people in the wagon and just roll, go around in a circle.

87
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yeah.

88
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And then people didn't get to go in a wagon every day.

89
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
They had no expectations for what this theme park was.

90
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So the wagon worked.

91
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And they'd all been tricked into liking Western shit by Walt over the year of watching the

92
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
show.

93
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Wow, that was just like Davy Crockett.

94
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I was, it was exact recreation of what they told me the West was.

95
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Well, three months ago.

96
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Also all popular culture, like Westerns were the Marvel movies of their time.

97
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yes.

98
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The Len test of the sixties, like getting guest surveys after the wagons.

99
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Everyone, everyone's saying we love the wagon.

100
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's the highest rated thing.

101
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's just like the television shows.

102
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So, yeah, I don't, I, it wouldn't be like they do a wagon in knots still, right?

103
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You can still get in a wagon.

104
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Maybe the horse, I believe who wants to do, why would you choose to do this now?

105
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The wagon.

106
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
That's a good question.

107
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Jason, would you go in the way you would go in the wagon?

108
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I think I may be a little claustrophobic right now, but if given the option, yeah, I'd probably

109
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
try it.

110
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yeah.

111
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm sure I've ridden a wagon horse-drawn wagon at some point in the past.

112
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I've been in a wagon.

113
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I've been in a big wagon and I can't, I think maybe like at a pumpkin farm.

114
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
But the fact that you don't remember means it probably wasn't that good.

115
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
But I think I'm anti-wagon.

116
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
My wagon opportunities have been slim, I think.

117
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I don't think I've been offered a wagon very often.

118
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So that's why my memory might not be so strong, but I'm pretty sure as a kid, I mean, there's

119
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
a haunted hayride out here that's kind of wagon-esque.

120
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yeah, that's a look.

121
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
If it's showing you something, it depends, I guess, on what this wagon's taken me to

122
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
see.

123
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yeah.

124
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
If it's just like going in a loop around things I can walk up to, which is what I think the

125
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Disneyland one was.

126
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yeah.

127
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Yeah.

128
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So yeah, I guess Fry Wagon that stays in one place is an upgrade to wagon you get to go

129
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
in that just goes in a circle.

130
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Does something.

131
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Listen to, wow, this is how it was, this is from the site Yesterland.

132
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Here's what Conestoga Wagons did.

133
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Your Conestoga wagon is pulled by two strong horses.

134
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Good for them.

135
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm very impressed.

136
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
They're strong.

137
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
We didn't hire weak ones, so don't go accusing us of that.

138
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Taking you on a genuine dirt path along the rivers of America through the genuine dirt.

139
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So the horses are strong and the dirt is genuine.

140
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's not fake dirt.

141
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
There's rocks around, but the dirt is real.

142
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Dirt is not insincere.

143
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I mean, I like the horse-drawn trolley on Main Street.

144
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yes.

145
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You love being dragged by a horse somewhere.

146
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Well, that is a lot more violent.

147
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
No, you don't want to say dragged.

148
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Not like.

149
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And pulled.

150
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Yeah, you wouldn't want to be on a rope on the hitting pavement.

151
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
What if you were on like a sled or something and you just had a rope tied around your one

152
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
ankle and then you like, so you weren't getting like cut up on the ground, but the horse was

153
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
just pulling you.

154
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
That'd be awesome.

155
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It would be dangerous.

156
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Somebody would have to stop the horse eventually, but the ride up until that point would be

157
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
fun, I think.

158
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Sure.

159
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yeah.

160
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Wait, what are you on?

161
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Are we one leg?

162
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Legs?

163
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
This is really painful.

164
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I think it's simulating getting thrown off an old time before.

165
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
There's an old clip of the Undertaker wrapping Hulk Hogan's legs in chains and then dragging

166
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
him through the hallway on a motorcycle, through a motor, like he's on the ground and then the

167
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Undertaker is tied him to his motorcycle and takes off and then they drag Hogan through

168
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
the hallway.

169
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And this is sort of what I'm thinking, but with a horse, but with something where you're

170
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
like kind of on a sled.

171
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So imagine you're on a sled and then you have maybe both legs tied with a horse or

172
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
excuse me, a rope and the rope is then tied to the horse and the horse takes off and you're

173
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
on a sled on the ground.

174
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Well, the more you say that, I'm realizing like how many roots and rocks and just things

175
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
are in the ground.

176
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
That's true.

177
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You never stop to notice how much is on the ground until you're being dragged by a horse.

178
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Being dragged by a horse.

179
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Because you're describing a scenario where it's like a clean set, but you still don't

180
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
know where that horse is going to do.

181
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And the word drag is in there.

182
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
That's the key.

183
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Fine.

184
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Fine.

185
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Fine.

186
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Daredevil Mike wants to get dragged by a horse because he saw it happen to Hulk.

187
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
But if you, it's got to be the most sanitized version of this or else.

188
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Okay.

189
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I think you just need to massage the language.

190
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Like Conestoga fries sign, eat hearty, round them up, you know, make those McDonald's fries

191
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
sound exciting and eat hearty, round them up.

192
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Western-y.

193
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yeah.

194
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So they did this, which it's funny because this is a stretch.

195
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I feel like this would be, I'm sure there were people that were upset at the time of

196
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
like, this doesn't really make a lot of sense.

197
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
There definitely were more on that in a minute.

198
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Okay, good.

199
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You found something that's good.

200
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Because yeah, what I, on the reddits and stuff, people were just like, I loved this.

201
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yeah.

202
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm mainly very positive today.

203
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And I, yeah, I'm trying to remember.

204
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I think I probably was on the side.

205
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I was on the dorky side at the time of like, but this is a thing from the outside world.

206
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And I, and now that now just when we talked about doing an episode, like I've none of

207
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
that, none of those shackles are binding me down now.

208
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I, this seems pretty great to me.

209
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And I also like, I really, I started explaining this to Erin.

210
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What episode are you doing?

211
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
We're doing one.

212
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
There was like a wagon that sold them and she was like Westward.

213
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Oh, she was so positive about it, which I may have.

214
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Maybe a lot of people will be.

215
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I think so.

216
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Actually, I think we'll, I think we'll see.

217
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
We'll do a litmus test.

218
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I mean, I, I'm a few of a few minds about it.

219
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Cause nowadays I'm like, well, McDonald's fries are miles ahead of most Disneyland fries.

220
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Most Disney park fries.

221
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yeah.

222
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's not a very good area for them.

223
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
No, as a kid, I don't think it offended me.

224
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I just thought it was kind of fun.

225
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Like I was like, well, I don't need this.

226
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
We have McDonald's at home.

227
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
We eat McDonald's a lot.

228
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And I was also like, well, they only have fries and soda.

229
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Like it's like, well, I don't, I don't need that.

230
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Like, what am I going to do?

231
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
There's no burgers.

232
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Sure.

233
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Sure.

234
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
That's a good point that it's not a full on, but this was, I think them trying to navigate

235
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
this middle between the people who are like this, it's the outside world.

236
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
How dare you, even though there's been brands in Disneyland from, right?

237
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
David, you was probably in 1955 was way worse.

238
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
There's so many in an Aunt Jemima thing.

239
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And just some guy we found out named Don DeFour has a restaurant.

240
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It's me, Don DeFour.

241
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Are you a Disney character?

242
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
No, I'm not a man.

243
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Maxwell House, Coffee House, Carnation Ice Cream Parlor.

244
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Like there was so much.

245
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:34,000
But I guess maybe the caveat is and has been that you don't just do, it's not universal.

246
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You don't just put a Panda Express in and it's a regular Panda Express, but more expensive.

247
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You got to do something in the way Carnation did.

248
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And maybe that was the idea here is that it's a special McDonald's experience.

249
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And their definition of special in this case was doing less.

250
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Only the most minute fraction of what they typically do.

251
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Yeah.

252
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And it's like, I guess if I'm thinking about it, what is there like future fries in Tomorrowland?

253
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
What would be a better way to do it?

254
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I mean, I guess we should do that at the end.

255
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
We should think of like if we were in modern days, like how to apply.

256
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
We are tasked with incorporate McDonald's in the park.

257
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Like a ton of new McDonald's in the park.

258
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
So maybe we do that at the end.

259
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
But yeah, so I guess all right, fries, whatever.

260
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's old west, they had potatoes.

261
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Okay, that's good enough.

262
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's a basic thing.

263
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Well, is the tie together?

264
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I mean, this isn't why they thought of it, but they sure try to make it all work together with the phrase.

265
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
There's gold in them.

266
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
There are fries.

267
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I mean, that's pretty good.

268
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I think that's what makes it.

269
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I think it does.

270
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Were you if you're you're going like McDonald's in the West?

271
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Why doesn't make you see that phrase?

272
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Oh, got it.

273
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
That's all I got to do.

274
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Great. Thank you.

275
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Because the goal there, the McDonald's is the golden arches.

276
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
The fries are golden.

277
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Yep.

278
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
So gold is the gold rush from the olden days.

279
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Yep. Yeah.

280
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Done. Yeah.

281
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I like the hash marks that say forty nine served.

282
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Yes, that is a sign with.

283
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Yeah, they're like counting them up and not that many people have done it yet.

284
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:16,000
But I'm just only now seeing at the bottom, it says I'll feed you all, which sounds like a threat.

285
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It's that that Wu Tang torture sketch.

286
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm like, it's going to keep going and like they plug up your butt or something.

287
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I mean, a problem.

288
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You're getting fed so much.

289
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yeah.

290
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
The signs are doing a lot of work here.

291
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I think the signs are great.

292
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
But you're you're right.

293
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Just to back it up, that the combo is really funny.

294
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
McDonald's in the Old West.

295
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Why?

296
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Yes, it does.

297
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And there's nothing in here.

298
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And again, they tied it together.

299
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Great. But it's I don't know.

300
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's pretty good.

301
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Now I'm now I say, why not?

302
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I agree.

303
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Why not?

304
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm not mad about this in the least bit.

305
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Yeah.

306
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm burger invasion is worse to me than this.

307
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
This is why we said some bad things about burger invasion.

308
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Maybe we should back it up even further and talk about the general McDonald's Disney partnership,

309
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:18,000
because that's that's what happened here is that even today you kind of mentally tie together Disney and McDonald's because it even though they aren't always tied together.

310
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I do think of a Happy Meal toy and it's of Disney stuff.

311
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And it has been recently in this garage there.

312
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Mike, you gave me a 50th anniversary Disney World thing that was at McDonald's.

313
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
But the partnership went in and out.

314
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Right. Yes.

315
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And actually in the classic era, like when we were kids and we were going to McDonald's the most.

316
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And I remember having disappointment about this.

317
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:50,000
That the like the big four movies Little Mermaid, Beating the Beast, Aladdin, Blanking, the toys were not at McDonald's.

318
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Right.

319
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
The most severed the relationship was was like 89 to 97.

320
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
There's a good.

321
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Yeah.

322
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,000
If you watch the defunct land McDonald's Disney video, it's really it goes into detail and all the all of this and when it stopped.

323
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And yes, it was missing for the majority of the movies.

324
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm trying to think of.

325
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Yeah.

326
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Was Little Mermaid even didn't have one?

327
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I know the others didn't.

328
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I know we had a Christmas ornament of Bernard from the Rescuers that came from McDonald's.

329
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I know for a fact that came from McDonald's.

330
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Yeah.

331
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And I had a little.

332
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Yeah.

333
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
The little it was a little is that what you're saying?

334
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Camera thing.

335
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I had a little camera ref from rescuers from a little camera for sure.

336
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
But no, this was just Bernard in a little cute little Christmas sweater.

337
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I was wrong.

338
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I had that too.

339
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
So they were doing stuff.

340
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Little Mermaid is was McDonald's.

341
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Oh, OK.

342
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
OK.

343
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
But yes, I have that too.

344
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I have that Christmas sweater and they have I have Oliver and company.

345
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I still have.

346
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Yeah.

347
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Christmas stuff for sure.

348
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
So they have been doing stuff back then.

349
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
And then, yeah, they had like a falling out.

350
00:14:51,000 --> 00:15:00,000
The big agreement went 1997 to 2007, which multiple places online pointed out that that

351
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
meant McDonald's was legally obligated to promote Treasure Planet home on the range

352
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
and other less successful Brother Bear, other less successful slide into there.

353
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Do we got chicken little yet?

354
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Oh, yeah, probably.

355
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Yeah.

356
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Either way, it's a yeah, that's kind of right when things are getting rough, I'd say.

357
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Unfortunately, this is all from Kevin and Defunct land.

358
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
But there was also the relationship apparently got strained because of a Splash Mountain

359
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:36,000
promotion that McDonald's was doing where they had like a huge like was like splash

360
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
for cash or some some weird thing.

361
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I don't know.

362
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I forget exactly the name of it, but it was some sort of promotion with prizes.

363
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And then so like a bunch of people went to Disney with free tickets.

364
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
They won from McDonald's.

365
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Everyone was excited.

366
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
And then Splash Mountain was horribly delayed.

367
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
And apparently McDonald's now pleased.

368
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Oh, timing of this really as well.

369
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Gotcha.

370
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Yeah.

371
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Again, watch this McDonald's.

372
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Yeah, I'm not like super prepared to talk about the relationship in general.

373
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
And Jason, as you and I discuss, there's probably like five McDonald's episodes you can pull

374
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
out.

375
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
We have not even searched the surface of McDonald's.

376
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
So that's why I'm not, you know, don't quote me on any of this, but there is that.

377
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And this you guys might have stumbled upon this in research.

378
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
The connection really goes back to the war.

379
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Right.

380
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Walt Disney and the founder himself, Mr. Michael later played by Michael Keaton, really a real

381
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
man, Ray Kroc, the man that I found her.

382
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I mean, stealer of the idea of McDonald's that they weirdly were in World War One together.

383
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
They didn't fight, but they were like, yeah, yeah, they were in some what?

384
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Infantry.

385
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Yeah.

386
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Yeah.

387
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Yeah.

388
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Yeah.

389
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
No, they met.

390
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
They knew each other.

391
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Yeah.

392
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And yet still then they like wrote each other letters and tried to partner up in some way.

393
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And Kroc was like, no, doesn't meet my qualifications.

394
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
No.

395
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Like he was like, I think they were fond enough of each other.

396
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
But what are the odds that those two guys are together?

397
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It's pretty wild.

398
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Yeah.

399
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Yeah.

400
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
So yeah, it goes back.

401
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Yeah.

402
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It goes back to it goes back very far and then continues to this day in some capacity.

403
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
On and off.

404
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I don't understand the why it's exclusive or not, but it was exclusive for they were exclusive.

405
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:26,000
They were boyfriend girlfriend for 10 years and which started with there was a lot of

406
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
pomp and circumstance over this announced in May 96.

407
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Michael Eisner stoked.

408
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I'm sure you've run across.

409
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Oh yeah.

410
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Well, this is the most ambitious promotional effort ever developed between two of the world's

411
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
best known family friendly brands.

412
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
The agreement we announced today is a true McDisney production.

413
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Wonderful.

414
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I can shed some light on a very specific memory I have of when they got away from doing Happy

415
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Meal Toys Disney characters at Happy Meal Toys is during the I don't know looking back

416
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
what the when it began and when it technically ended, but the obesity epidemic, if you remember

417
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:20,000
the scares of the obesity epidemic and subway was like hot damn we are marginally more healthy

418
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
for you than a big Mac.

419
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Big Mac.

420
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Than like non food is.

421
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And so I think Disney showed up at Subway for a little while because Disney was getting

422
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:40,000
away from like, oh, we can't be associated with like feeding kids all this fat and sugar

423
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
and we need to be associated with this guy Jared.

424
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Yeah, we're a family friendly brand and this guy seems very family friendly as much as

425
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
we can when you look at this face.

426
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Think of Disney.

427
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
They went in there and they were like this Jared guy good.

428
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
This tuna real.

429
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
This tuna is good and real and healthy and then they looked up and down and they were

430
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
like all of this.

431
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
All this bread.

432
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
A foot of bread.

433
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Good.

434
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Good.

435
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
This yoga mat bread.

436
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Good.

437
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Cheese bread.

438
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Good.

439
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Cheese bread.

440
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Oh yeah right.

441
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Yeah.

442
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
People still do Subway ever.

443
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I kind of.

444
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I love Subway tuna.

445
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I absolutely love it.

446
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Uh oh.

447
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I haven't had it in a while in months but Subway tuna it was revealed I guess that it

448
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
was like they couldn't identify what fish it was.

449
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
They couldn't tell if it was actually tuna.

450
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I'm not exactly.

451
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I haven't really read too much into it and I didn't even almost didn't phase me.

452
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I went well it's good so I don't know.

453
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's got to be some fish.

454
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I guess it could be mayonnaise.

455
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You just want that tuna that's tuna-y like really fishy right?

456
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I don't want this at all.

457
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I can't relate to this at all.

458
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I have never liked that variety that sort of tuna so I don't that phrase is a foreign

459
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
language to me.

460
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Well.

461
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I don't want that one.

462
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I mean my mom always bought the chunk white tuna which is a little flakier a little nicer.

463
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Yeah.

464
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Even the fact that you can say chunk white.

465
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
We're talking about like.

466
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Chunk white versus chunk white.

467
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Yeah.

468
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
They were even saying chunk.

469
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Chunk white.

470
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Like that's going to make it more epic that you don't like.

471
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Are you.

472
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You want to gag a little bit when you're talking about chunks.

473
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Are you anti-tuna in general or just certain types of tuna?

474
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I don't like canned we're runny.

475
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm like you know.

476
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Any fish like salmon in a can.

477
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Oh yeah.

478
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Not really.

479
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
No no no.

480
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I like fish none of that.

481
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Indication crab meat.

482
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Yeah that's okay on a fish roll.

483
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Subway tuna is just like a big scooper and it's already like been like wetted down with

484
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
mayo and other stuff as well.

485
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Yikes.

486
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And it's not like it doesn't resemble canned tuna.

487
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It's just it's like a I'm trying to think it's almost like ice cream or something like

488
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
it's.

489
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Yeah.

490
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
It's easy.

491
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Like a deli.

492
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Like all deli's that's how they scoop out the tuna.

493
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Like tuna salad or something.

494
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Yeah.

495
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I don't do that though.

496
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I'd say the salad genre for me is a no.

497
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I love.

498
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Chicken.

499
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Tuna melts.

500
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Oh don't do it.

501
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Oh I like a tuna melt.

502
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Yeah sure.

503
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I love a tuna melt.

504
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
So the fact that there was the also talking about old Disneyland stuff that there was

505
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
the chicken of the sea that there was a tuna ship.

506
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It sounds awful.

507
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And in like early Disneyland where everything's like it's hot as hell.

508
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
There's no trees yet.

509
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Everything's baking.

510
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
So you just got hot tuna.

511
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
What about frying up.

512
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:29,000
What about like spicy tuna on a you know what I'm saying a bowl one of those bowls.

513
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
A poke bowl.

514
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Yeah I'm down with that.

515
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
But I feel like I need to see real I need pieces.

516
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I don't want to mush.

517
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I don't want to mush or a mayo.

518
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I want a solid solid ground.

519
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
All right.

520
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Now one of the things about the fry cart in Disneyland at least Frontierland fries was

521
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
the name of the cart in the Magic Kingdom.

522
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
But in Disneyland it became so popular they're like we need another one of these.

523
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,000
So they converted the Harbor Galley which was serving like quote unquote healthier fare

524
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
which seemed to mostly be tuna salad.

525
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
They converted it to.

526
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Yeah no it was it did it said in the what yesterlain article it was like they sold tuna

527
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
there tuna and like fruit salad.

528
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
And so and then they they turned it into the French fries and then they turned it back

529
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
to serving like I would call it because I've eaten there once or twice.

530
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I would call it like a hospital cafeteria level see.

531
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Yeah it's what you want.

532
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It's like the worst lobster roll you've ever had.

533
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I was wondering I'm like I've never heard I've never been to that.

534
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I didn't know there were lobster rolls at Disneyland.

535
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I've never heard anyone talk about it like this can't be good.

536
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
You can get a chowder there can't you?

537
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Clam chowder and a bread ball is fine if you if you want to commit to eating.

538
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And you can get that much.

539
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
You can get like a hospital salad there.

540
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Yeah yeah yeah.

541
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
But like a chowder is okay I feel like I've had once.

542
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I think yeah I think the chowder is okay.

543
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I mean you end up eating like a loaf of bread or like half a loaf of bread.

544
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Yes that's true.

545
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Depending on how much of the bread you're going to eat.

546
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
This is also what's so fun I guess we're I'm getting ahead of myself but like what's so

547
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
funny about them going like we got to get the McDonald's out of the park as if all the

548
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
food was elevated immediately.

549
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Right like as if they were like well we got to get rid of french fries in our park.

550
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Their french fries are probably just as bad.

551
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
But they didn't get rid of french fries.

552
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
It's not worse I don't know.

553
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
But it's a PR thing because there's no stink on their specific french fries.

554
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Nobody made a documentary about those.

555
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Exactly.

556
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Amazing how much damage that documentary did.

557
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Like probably not really to their bottom line.

558
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
But in terms of it just probably at McDonald's caused a lot of like okay we got to figure

559
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
out apple slices now god damn it.

560
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
A tiny little thing of fries and a plastic thing of apple slices.

561
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Yeah.

562
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
And let's I want to be clear those apple slices are disgusting.

563
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Skinless vacuum sealed plastic bag apple like.

564
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Yeah.

565
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Yeah.

566
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I only had them for the first time really because I donated to a documentary on Kickstarter

567
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
that I'm excited about which is the non-standard McDonald's documentary that I believe Kevin

568
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Perger and Defunctland are involved in.

569
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
So I'm excited to see where this thing goes.

570
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
But if you don't follow that on Twitter.

571
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Yeah.

572
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
They may have addressed some of these things.

573
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I know they've talked about burger invasion.

574
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
It's a Twitter account that tracks weird McDonald's that are not the standard boxes

575
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
which are you know a dying species.

576
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Unfortunately they have the one way they like to do them that's so boring.

577
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
But the reward and this really this was a very enticing reward to donate to the Kickstarter

578
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
was you'll get the the non-standard meal.

579
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
They will.

580
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
They're going to curate McDonald's meal for you.

581
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
It's going to show up at your house because you don't know.

582
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I'm like wow that's crazy.

583
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
And then I was so interested in what it was going to be.

584
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
And then it was like it was just very bizarre.

585
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
They basically took what technically was a regular hamburger but did every possible

586
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:03,000
add on which is like three times salt three to like as much lead it to where that you could probably

587
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
anyone who donated to this at all these McDonald's everywhere people are getting this customization

588
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,000
order that's like OK they roll up their sleeves like the poor people at the like they had to

589
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
put it in a Big Mac box.

590
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
It didn't fit no anymore in the little and then mixed with like I think there were two

591
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
giant coffees with it.

592
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
It was so bizarre on every level.

593
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
So every add on on to what is technically still a plain hamburger and then yes little apple slices

594
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
with like to add to the unpleasantness.

595
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I was very thankful for it.

596
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Once I scraped a ton of stuff off became a very good little McDonald's meal.

597
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
What was the sandwich just a regular hamburger OK but with extra salt.

598
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I think they just went through the list every add on and did three times that a mess.

599
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
So so much cheese so much lead so much onions so much salt.

600
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,000
That was the most offensive thing to add a ton of salt isn't I like getting extra everything on it.

601
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
But salt is not one of the things I added more.

602
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:08,000
This is a delightful experience though and I just I want to say I'm my support of the film is only grown.

603
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
What a fun thing.

604
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Yeah that was a trick I heard growing up of like well if you want really fresh McDonald's french fries you ask for a light salt and then they have to make that batch fresh.

605
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
And I'm like what do you talk what like what do you mean.

606
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I'm like it's going to be cold by the time we get to the booth like it's going to be.

607
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Yeah they don't they don't stay particularly warm these customizations.

608
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I don't know but you know what I just did it in and out a couple of weeks ago.

609
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I don't go to I don't think I went to Internet through the entire pandemic.

610
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I've been a little off fast food in general not making a point of it.

611
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
It just has is not in my general day to day.

612
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:59,000
So I think I'm I often find that I am not used to what I am about to get like my body has trouble processing sure and fill in the blanks of what that means.

613
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Yeah it's always my body's always like huh what I'm freaking out here.

614
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
But I asked for the well done fries because you got about in and out a lot of not in L.A.

615
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
That like the fries are all soggy asked for them well done.

616
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I did it. They were very well done.

617
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I took over. It's like I guess so.

618
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I don't know. I wish I just had the regular still ate all of them and the burger the next day.

619
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I had so much sodium coat on my throat to where it was like I felt like I needed to cough.

620
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I was like having it hurt to talk and things being the way they are.

621
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I was like what if this isn't from the sodium of the fries.

622
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Is this a sign of Omicron.

623
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Do I have Omicron and I determined that I did not.

624
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
But the salt from the fucking fries was so bad.

625
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
So bad. I'm just so not like coded and ready for it.

626
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Genuinely the fries made me think that I had the fucking virus.

627
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
You're worried. Yeah.

628
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Yeah. I got to be prepared for an in and out meal.

629
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I feel like you'll understand. I love in and out burger but I got like three different meals I can get there.

630
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Depending on how much food I've had that day how I'm feeling like.

631
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Yeah you eliminate a lot of things.

632
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I can't do the sauce. I can't add like less cheese.

633
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
There's just a lot of my body is not to do anymore.

634
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:22,000
You need to Scott you need to buy fries and just have a couple every day to keep your body producing enzymes that can break this stuff down.

635
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
OK. So just like a couple of day.

636
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
We'll love to hear your stomach gut balance.

637
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I don't even mean to sound like some pretentious food.

638
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I have tater tots so often but they're at home and they're just treated differently.

639
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
It's not from the fry. I assure you that I eat terribly.

640
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
You have the enzyme for tater tots but not the in and out fries.

641
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I get well done fries with the cheese on it.

642
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Yeah I was going to say the well done fries are really good at holding like animal style toppings or cheese or whatever.

643
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
You thicken them up so the softening that happens.

644
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,000
You get a piece of cheese on it and it melts and that's what I do and then you go in with a fork which is fun.

645
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:07,000
One of the best hacks ever a little bug told me McDonald's you get a double cheeseburger but with the Mac sauce on it.

646
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Yeah but you can't do that if you mobile order.

647
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
No if you have to ask for it there.

648
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
That is a good deal.

649
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
You have to vocalize what you want.

650
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
It's not like it's not even an app hack.

651
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
That's an out loud hack only.

652
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
McDonald's app is not as flexible as a Taco Bell app.

653
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Taco Bell app lets you play God and do almost anything you could possibly dream of.

654
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:35,000
McDonald's app there are limitations on it and that's that's the only failing of it is that it doesn't like Taco Bell.

655
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Taco Bell you can any sauce they have you can put on anything McDonald's doesn't like you have to request the Mac sauce on a double cheeseburger.

656
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Yeah Taco Bell and in and out both in separate ways have embraced the like customize our shit.

657
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
You know no crazy sink.

658
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:56,000
We only have so many things to do whatever you want with the yeah the 20 things something.

659
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Something interesting a little bug told me also about McDonald's.

660
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Go ahead.

661
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:17,000
This is a weird thing the because he was watching the classic Paul Reiser film Bye Bye Love which he never seen and was a surprise to everyone to realize this like a half hour of that movie set in a McDonald's.

662
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Really is the it's the perfect McDonald's it's the McDonald's you know from commercials it's the McDonald's from Mac and me the weird McDonald's sponsored movie I'm sure listeners know about Mac and me but it's the way that's not just some McDonald's.

663
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:38,000
That's like a giant sprawling like idyllic garden sun twinkling in from the wind from the giant window.

664
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,000
There's a party going on so like you're like wow this it feels so much like the commercials.

665
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Bye Bye Love is Mac and me is the commercials.

666
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
He looked up filming locations city of industry.

667
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
What is this place?

668
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,000
There is this McDonald's that is only for commercials in an industrial park in the city of industry.

669
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Less than a mile away from the back to the future mall the point that Hills where time travel is first made possible or I end up there every once in a while just to pay my respects.

670
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:17,000
But yes so you could you'll be walking down like kind of like a cruddy industrial row and then see a McDonald's sign that's facing the street because they go film on the street a lot.

671
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
So anyway there's many people there might even be a listener who's like worked on a commercial or even been in a commercial.

672
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Have you guys been in a mix?

673
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I feel like we know somebody who's been in a McDonald's commercial.

674
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I have not or filmed one or something.

675
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I just if anyone has any more information about the camera only city of industry McDonald's.

676
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
This was fascinating to me.

677
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I really want to go if I could get a tour.

678
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,000


679
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Be exhilarated.

680
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I've done chilies.

681
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I've done Taco Bell.

682
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I've done Wendy's.

683
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Wow.

684
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
And the Wendy's they just built half a Wendy's in a parking lot somewhere.

685
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Whoa.

686
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
And it was open.

687
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
So it was open.

688
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:58,000
So like the other side like at the universal back lot literally like cut a Wendy's in half like a full Synecdoche New York.

689
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Like you're seeing yes half of the building.

690
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
The chilies the chilies they built the chilies inside on the Sony lot.

691
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Wow.

692
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Interesting.

693
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
We were just in a big sound stage and they built part of a chilies in there.

694
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
So that's what we shot in there.

695
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
The Taco Bell one I was just in a bowling alley and then the Wendy's.

696
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Yeah they built a Wendy's.

697
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Wow.

698
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
And then we shot another exterior part outside of a real Wendy's that was closed for the day.

699
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
OK.

700
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
OK.

701
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
So sometimes this is I'm interested in this approach and why yes have one around or not.

702
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
The McDonald's one apparently came from that they would ask locations.

703
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Can we use this?

704
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
It was initially like a cool thing.

705
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Oh and then mine will be in the ad but then you're losing all that business.

706
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Yeah.

707
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,000
So when Ray Kroc was still around if you've seen the founder you know that he is about he doesn't want to lose a cent.

708
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
It is efficiency.

709
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
It is the speedy system.

710
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Of course.

711
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
This has to run like clockwork.

712
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:57,000
So they had to figure out we just need a campus we can go to so we're never interrupting business whatsoever.

713
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
And then I was reading this article about all this from decades ago and they say how you don't.

714
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
The only thing is that this doesn't work for like more like urban locations.

715
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
This doesn't look like a city McDonald's.

716
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Turns out now they have one of those.

717
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
There's two McDonald's on this property.

718
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
This is like this is like a theme park.

719
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
This is great.

720
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:21,000
It's like a literal McDonald's land where the attractions are simulations of McDonald's.

721
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Do they have like a play place on that?

722
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I bet or like it's probably like detachable.

723
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
You could probably go in and out with that.

724
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Like if you don't want it you don't have to have it.

725
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Could we like rent that for a party?

726
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Oh my God.

727
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Yeah.

728
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
God they're missing out on opportunities.

729
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
It's probably just sitting around a lot of the time.

730
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Exactly.

731
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
You can't be making that many commercials.

732
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
There has to be a day a couple days a week where you could go in and have some adult fun.

733
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Oh man.

734
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
With your friends.

735
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Not sexual.

736
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Adult fun in the sense that we're adults in McDonald's.

737
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Yeah just pleasant yeah small talk conversation.

738
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
That's right.

739
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
That sort of thing.

740
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
No let's do stuff in it.

741
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Let's orgy in it.

742
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
We got it.

743
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
We're going to want it.

744
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
It's going to happen naturally.

745
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I'm just going to hose it out anyway.

746
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I would like to orgy an officer Big Mac's mouth.

747
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
In the play place.

748
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
You'd climb the ladder?

749
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Yeah.

750
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Yeah okay.

751
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Yeah.

752
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Oddly that you know what's funny here I threw out the word orgy but something about that

753
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
was a little offensive to me.

754
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I'm like I think that's too sacrosanct.

755
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
That's like so from our childhood.

756
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
That's so from being three years old.

757
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I should be all for it but I feel like I have to admit that it's like.

758
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
You are uncomfortable by it.

759
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
That's like coming into my childhood bedroom having sex on the floor.

760
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
That's what I wanted to be my bedroom when I was a child.

761
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Oh wow.

762
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
So yeah you wanted to sleep in officer Big Mac's mouth.

763
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Oh my god.

764
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Maybe I still do.

765
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
And again not.

766
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
My rules are clear.

767
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I want to have an orgy in the fake McDonald's but the officer head is off limits.

768
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
That's all.

769
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
We looked.

770
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
We looked this up on the Chuck E. Cheese episode with Jamie Loftus because we found that somebody

771
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,000
was selling all of the McDonald land like play place stuff.

772
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Like a full playgrounds where.

773
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Yeah so you could have bought all of that stuff for.

774
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I feel like it wasn't it was very expensive but not as expensive as I might imagine.

775
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
So still I mean there's a house here Scott.

776
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I don't know why you don't have it yet.

777
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Yeah I don't know either.

778
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Look I'm as embarrassed about it as you are.

779
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I'm going to look it up again.

780
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
The fake McDonald's sets to simulate real McDonald's.

781
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Like there there is a weird connection there.

782
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
There's a weird unease of like Disneyland used to have real covered wetlands.

783
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
They had real covered wagons.

784
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Now they have the simulation of a covered wagon that they sell french fries out of that they sell like only a cart.

785
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:52,000
There's only for only a cart and there's items a fisherman's shed a dock fisherman's shed at the end of the dock which no longer sells French sells seafood.

786
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
It no longer sells catch of the day.

787
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,000
It sells french fries and to sunny water or french fries and coffee.

788
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
That was the thing about Harbor Galley is that they sold french fries.

789
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
They did a bottle of water and then they sold coffee and hot cocoa.

790
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Yeah but no soda.

791
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Weird weird.

792
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Yeah.

793
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I was in coffee.

794
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I don't know.

795
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Yeah.

796
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
This happened in my nonstandard meal and like I don't know.

797
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Do people do this.

798
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
They don't.

799
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I don't know.

800
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I guess that's not so bizarre but yeah I think you can.

801
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Like if you get a value meal you can select coffee as an option.

802
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I just find like coffee is like with a with a burger and fries like that.

803
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
That feels very like this is what an old person would do.

804
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
That would be their order at McDonald's to go along with their cigarettes.

805
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:48,000
You know you could smoke inside and do you have the McDonald's with the little tin foil ashtrays or the gold or ceramic ashtrays.

806
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,000
If I had to be up at all night and then take a lunch at 1 a.m.

807
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Then burger and fries and coffee sounds great.

808
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
But I think like not in the middle of the day.

809
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
It's only if I have some weird you know all night existence there.

810
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I'm like what's that Scorsese movie where the guys run around.

811
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
After hours.

812
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Yeah yeah yeah.

813
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
If I'm in an after hours experience then yes I would love to stop for fries and coffee.

814
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Yeah.

815
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I'm having a try.

816
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I can't find a for sale officer Big Mac.

817
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
So we missed our opportunity.

818
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I think for now we missed our opportunity but maybe there'll be a sale.

819
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Maybe it'll come back.

820
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
It'll come back around.

821
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Yeah well we'll achieve this.

822
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
We'll have our own McDonald's one day.

823
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Some of the McDonald's offerings like in Orlando every park had their McDonald's outposts and some of them just had fries and soda.

824
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:46,000
But like restaurantasaurus next to the dinosaur ride had like it's a dinosaur size like big big burgers.

825
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:57,000
They had the hot dog the source and that would come with McDonald's fries like a rare McDonald's hot dog weird which I feel like they do test every now and then or they have tested in the past.

826
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Yeah they would test that places like Woodfield Mall.

827
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Sure.

828
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
The pizza in there they would test a hot dog in there.

829
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Yeah.

830
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Wow.

831
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
The rare the pizza was there.

832
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Yep.

833
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Geez.

834
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Did I have it.

835
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I don't think I did.

836
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
The dream I remember being excited to hear they had it.

837
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Unbelievable.

838
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
The hot dog a source.

839
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I don't know.

840
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Did you ever see a picture of a hot dog source.

841
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I haven't seen a picture.

842
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
No.

843
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I mean I still say that like there are times in California Adventure where it's you know the counter service burgers also kind of hit and miss like we would get one every now and then in Florida at Cosmic Rays because they had the big toppings bar.

844
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:45,000
But like I'd love to just have a Big Mac in California Adventure have a beer and a Big Mac or like a McFlurry walking around eating McFlurry.

845
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
That does sound nice.

846
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
You know what you're getting a little more.

847
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:56,000
But now you got that now you got to pop at you pop at the Denton Disney and you get a burger at you know what's the crazy shake.

848
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Oh Black Tap.

849
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:04,000
You can get decent but you got but there's no way in between it's either like the crappiest burger or elevated expensive burger.

850
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:10,000
If tomorrow and that tomorrow and Terrace just had like McDonald's food it would just be so much better.

851
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:18,000
And I don't think it's because like we've been like slowly like group not groomed by McDonald's to like love that food.

852
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I think it is better tasting than all the food at Tomorrowland Terrace.

853
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Yeah I mean I think one of the things about the Disney McDonald's relationship is like yeah it was a fun special treat when we were younger and they had to play places and the toys were good.

854
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:39,000
And then there was a point where like McDonald's was going downhill and like I don't know as I was getting older I was like I don't want to eat that crap anymore.

855
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:45,000
And then like I got older McDonald's like I don't know that they up the quality at all.

856
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I think it just became very consistent like I find it very consistent.

857
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Because there's like Burger King is still wild with their consistency.

858
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
McDonald's is consistent.

859
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
McDonald's is kind of consistent everywhere.

860
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
That's 100% correct.

861
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
McDonald's that's their biggest that's their ace in the hole I feel.

862
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Is that like yeah Burger King.

863
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:17,000
There's a Burger King on Sunset by the old the now shuttered UCB Sunset that I feel like it's in like a little strip mall but you can still drive through it that I don't think I feel like I had like the burger was chilled when I got it once.

864
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Like I touched the whopper and it was like cold like it had been in a freezer.

865
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
It's distinctly possible.

866
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Yeah.

867
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Right.

868
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
And so like there's some Burger Kings where you're like I don't know what's going on here.

869
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
And I'm not I also am not picky.

870
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
That's a hard job to do.

871
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
As long as you give me like kind of a money amount of food I ordered.

872
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I don't care.

873
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
You can get an order way wrong.

874
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
It's fine.

875
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Yeah.

876
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
But if I touch it and it's like an ice cube or something.

877
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
You go.

878
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
That's disturbing.

879
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
What's going on here?

880
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Because they're keeping maybe McDonald's is keeping Ray's spirit alive.

881
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I think that is maybe what's happening.

882
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Yeah.

883
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
They finally remembered their core values.

884
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:07,000
A great phrase that you hear on undercover boss and such their core values and the spirit of like Disney is better when they remember the spirit of Walton McDonald's is better than the spirit of Ray Ray of weird shyster Ray.

885
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I read and I don't know if this wasn't backed up by any fact but it makes sense that like the reason I think people like these fries in this specific cart was because it was such a small place that there was constant traffic constantly.

886
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Everything had to be made fresh.

887
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Turn everything.

888
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
That's turnover.

889
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
People would get that.

890
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:37,000
There was no way you wouldn't get the freshest possible fries and every all the stock coming in was like because they had to continually move it in because it was not much room back there.

891
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
And that's all they do.

892
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Maybe something about limiting the stuff means that we do one thing and we get it right.

893
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Yes.

894
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Yeah.

895
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:55,000
That's that's I'm most curious of that because I have to admit I didn't eat at the fry wagon ever but I'd be curious for respond wherever you respond to us.

896
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:03,000
If you if you remember this being especially this good it's not just that you think the thing is funny that the food was actually superior.

897
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I'm curious.

898
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:12,000
That's what I propose is a micro like hyper specific item in places in Disney.

899
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
That's what I like.

900
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I like the idea of when we talk at the end here about what we would do now.

901
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I think we should focus on where would you put just chicken nugget chicken McNuggets.

902
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
That's interesting.

903
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I mean one thing because this is because the deconstructed McDonald's is an interesting premise.

904
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Yeah.

905
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
That's what I think.

906
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Which they could go further with.

907
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
OK.

908
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
This is great.

909
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Well let's let's hit everything we can about the wagon itself.

910
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Is there anything we haven't read off of the signs because it is.

911
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
They're also like OK.

912
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:51,000
So the other thing with this the partnership there was like the audience was not and people were like OK with McDonald's coming into the parks but we don't want it to be good.

913
00:42:51,000 --> 00:43:02,000
What you don't want is the Golden Arches huge in the theme park and it's why the California Adventure Burger Invasion seemed a little like grosser because it was space ships that look like hamburgers.

914
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Yeah.

915
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
The static aside looked at it again today.

916
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
So on plea like this.

917
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Yeah.

918
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Yeah.

919
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Pretty pretty indefensible.

920
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Yeah.

921
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Some funny kitschy 2000s is works and this I would say it looks awful.

922
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Yeah.

923
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:31,000
So that's why one little detail when you look at that that menu that the Golden Arches are just little and tilted next to the word that the word McDonald the term McDonald's french fries is in the middle of the sign.

924
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
It's not the first thing up top.

925
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:40,000
The first thing up top is potato food which is also a great like what we're really like breaking down.

926
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Yeah.

927
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
It's all very deconstructed and strange.

928
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:58,000
But potato food original look here eat hearty round them up seven days a week in that and they captured the way that old fonts and like I'm sorry old posters and old movie trailers was just like how many fonts can we cycle it.

929
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:13,000
How do we get people's attention with like seven different fonts in a row all with odd declarations but then right in the middle grub and then the Golden Arches but small that now that's not the race spirit I feel is the Golden Arches but small.

930
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
So it's it's kind of airing of Disney to recontextualize like that.

931
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Yeah, I'm sure that was a common that was, I'm sure that went back and forth between lawyers for approval on the can we do this with the arch, so you don't want to.

932
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:42,000
They're still trying to make the sign look somewhat period appropriate, even though they have the logos for all the first right and the other side is very much like a traveling like, you know, medicine man like snake oil salesman.

933
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Prize are always good hungry folks treats manly enough for his hunger and delicate enough for her taste that's weird very weird.

934
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Oh, hurry in for in town for a limited time, which they were right about that eventually they would turn out of here.

935
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:06,000
It'll give you super strength. Yeah, but it's very much like yeah, but the spark back in the love life.

936
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Vitamin A Benjamin.

937
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Eat the fries in your bed. You'll know why you did you'll be because you're you're gonna want to be there about 20 minutes later.

938
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:30,000
They really should have added a character to like step right up step right up. Oh my god, that would have been really good. Yeah, it's genuine McDonald's fries right here. It's good for what else you sir what are you worried about.

939
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Daniel Blaine view style Huckster. Yeah, Mac Mac D.

940
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Arnold's the name and he's got a he looks like Mac tonight. He's like Mac tonight but in kind of an older outfit like an older steam punk Mac tonight.

941
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Yeah, Mac tonight. Whoa. So with a top hat over so you can't be he hides his pointy part on top of his head with a top hat with a gear on it.

942
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Brass goggles you sir you and your wife still making love on a regular basis. No.

943
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:18,000
It sounds like you're not having your recommended daily dose of canola oil or peanut oil, whatever they fry this crap in. Yeah, should have in trouble conceiving well the canola oil might be the key to that too.

944
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Powdered beef supplements. How to deliver in the old bloodstream.

945
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Fried potatoes. Old timer. What's your problem? I'm having problems walking. Well, come right up here. This will put the spring back in your step.

946
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Guy eats fries immediately is able to do a big complicated dance and then conspicuously walks away back into the back of the fry wagon. Yeah, right.

947
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Now we've never met before in our entire lives. Is that correct? Why? Yes, that is correct.

948
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Well funny that we talk similar but otherwise total stranger to me anyway. He looks just like Mr. Six.

949
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Kind of like his suspicious looking face. Is that really a little too old? I'd say.

950
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I think one of the things why people, you know, the Disneyland of Disney is Disneyland is sacred kind of credit defense league was like a McDonald's in Disneyland.

951
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:29,000
That was just for a long time and probably still is like cultural criticism like a lazy cultural criticism of like, oh, McDonald's like I don't have a television, you know, that sort of like exhausting nonsense.

952
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:38,000
But at Disneyland, you need to walk like six feet to get a Coca Cola place in your hand. So I don't. Yeah, it seems like it's a lateral move.

953
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Yeah. If like Disney was just serving like high quality like fruits and vegetables and they had all this like classy food and there were no sponsors anywhere.

954
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:57,000
And it was a it was a nonprofit park. Like, OK, McDonald's rolls in and you go, well, this doesn't make any sense. But the most commercial shit ever. Yeah.

955
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Always has been. Well, and people are like in this era, people are like this. This ruins the immersive theming of the park.

956
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Like the recent incredible Indiana Jones adventure where you walk out and there's like a AT&T ad right after I forget what the ad was for invasive sponsor.

957
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Uh huh. Yeah. Everything had annoying sponsorship and, you know, Kodak was around everywhere.

958
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:33,000
There's a sprite droid now in the Galaxy's Edge, which I love. I think people really like.

959
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:44,000
There's no problem there. Now, let me admit this and we can cover the animal kingdom because the animal restaurants were the first burger invasion that happened in the.

960
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:53,000
That's where they started doing McDonald's in the place. I will admit that it did make that park seem like cheaper and more unpleasant to me that there was so so much McDonald's.

961
00:48:53,000 --> 00:49:01,000
And we talked about like I don't have the best feelings about dinosaur, the ride or the or the baby, a lot of it and the weird.

962
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Remember we talked about the pipes are supposed to be ketchup and mustard and I don't like any of this.

963
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I gotta say, well, Dino Land USA, which has been just changed over the that's also in the perjurer video.

964
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:20,000
We're entirely sponsored by McDonald's. I think so, but also like that used to be even like worse. I know kids like that and bad.

965
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:27,000
It would be if you went there with your kid, we fun, but like compared to the rest of animal kingdom, you go, what is this? Yeah, this doesn't fit at all.

966
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Yeah. Um, and the heights of animal kingdom are and have always been like high, like very, very high as with it with Avatar and, um, and the theming and immersiveness has always been great.

967
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:55,000
But then like when something's bad in animal kingdom and so bad. Yeah, it's in hindsight, it's it's it's kind of shocking that they got animal kingdom through the animal kingdom really feels like if we start comparing things to like albums, music albums, it does feel like a experimental Joe roadie piece.

968
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Mm hmm. That slowly has gotten more like commercially, you know, Everest is a thrill ride and like Avatar and stuff. But yeah, especially early on, it's like this weird. I'm trying to think of a good example of like what's a whatever albums after American Idiot.

969
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:25,000
I was saying it's been deployed in a fucking metaphor. I said if I was going to do a 21st century breakdown would have already come out of my mouth. There it is. White album like compared to like.

970
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Well, I just mean like it's a little bit less like a structured thing. It's a little more like somebody's put out like a experimental jazz album.

971
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Mm hmm. And they normally don't. They normally have like pop songs or something. Yeah, that's sort of what I'm getting at. And then like all of Prince's crappy jazz. Oh yeah, there you go.

972
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:56,000
All those crappy jazz albums that we overlook now because we like them anytime. I don't like to think about it. Yeah, that's not like Herbie Hancock got a lot more experimental as time went on or Miles Davis even.

973
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Sure, you know, but those are even I would say like they didn't. I guess they had some songs that are a little more pop. Yeah, they were always jazzed though. But like for Disney to do it like it, you would go and you would be like this feels like a classy animal kingdom.

974
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:24,000
It's like so authentic in places and and all about conservation, right? Environment and then all and McDonald's. You're the main things you're going to pull out of it, protect the environment and enjoy delicious McDonald's. Yeah, that doesn't make any sense. Yeah.

975
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:39,000
So I do get why somebody would be like, well, what the hell? McDonald aggressive McDonald's presence in the preachiest park is funny. I've kind of never thought about it. Yes, it is. And I wonder, we got to get roadie now that he's going. We got to get really easy.

976
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Yeah, this might be busy making us preparing for us. He's busy preparing like the pre show for space flight. He's late. Sorry, I can't do the fake space hotel you're working on. I am doing space. I'm doing the space hotel. He brought. What's that gentleman's name in the Avatar pre show?

977
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:24,400
Dr. Stevens, Wallace Langham, Wallace. Yeah, or an avatar. Oh, wait, oh, Dr. Yeah, whatever. The waiver arms around David Dan, for his real name. Yeah, well, yeah, I think it's Stevens and that's a real. Yeah. But yeah, you're gonna have to waver. I'm around waiting for like a real shuttle space shuttle. Oh, then he's going to be the genuine procedure. That's what I'm wondering. Yeah. Like you'll have to go in a room. They'll have to scan you for bugs. They'll have to scan you for like, like, like a

978
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:24,460
way of, you know, of when you're locked in a space capsule with people, because he's not the only one they picked up, right. There's multiple. Imagine you're people that I think he worked with. Wow. So yeah, he's creating stuff like that. Like, I think that is part of what he's doing. He is like, he is making sure all the little things around the actual experience, yes, are even like, you know, as long as you're in a room. Yeah. Yeah. We're going to try to figure out some way to work with people to do a space capsule. Yeah, I know. I love it. You got to be able to imagine yourself. And that's what you're going to do. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're going to have to figure out a way to work with people to be able to work with people to be able to work with people to be able to work with people to be able to work with

979
00:52:54,400 --> 00:53:24,400
pumped up in a way that like Disney has a pre show and waiting for Virgin, correct? I believe. Yeah. Yeah. I liked those planes. I miss. I miss Richard Branson. Come on. Sold it to Alaska. And he's the least hateful of the hateful billionaires. Now he's still bad, but you know what I'm saying? He had good taste in like purple light. I was gonna say he had purple lighting, so I can't hate him completely. Therefore I forgive. But he's not, you know, he's he's annoying and that he'd like go be I'm on 30

980
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:54,400
rock today. Ha, he's not as annoying as you on on Twitter. I will say Google Richard Branson picking up women and there's just he's holding. He's holding women like he's holding them like you're escaping a burning building. He's like, looks like he just like has a compulsion to like a pick a woman up. There's like a very strange find over 20 photos of different women. He's picking up in like press events and stuff. Okay. He likes to pick up a woman. Literally literally pick up a woman. I'll say this. His company, I think, affected further airline

981
00:53:54,400 --> 00:54:24,400
choices because I was on an American flight recently and I dozed off and when I woke up like there was red lights everywhere and I was like, oh no, what the fuck is happening? And then when I looked, there was white light and then on the other aisle there was blue light. And I was like, are you out of your fucking minds? You had to do red, white and blue lighting. Did you not? You know, red lighting means bad. Like, why would you make this decision? No, I thought you were in a notice dive.

982
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:31,560
I thought you were having, you were about to have a very important decision to make red or white go to hell or go to heaven.

983
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:51,960
Pick a side. The devil had like a big thing of fries though. And he's like, Jason, no, they'd split the lighting with like white, blue and red. I was like, guys, don't skip the red. Okay. Blue and white. Like that's enough. Or like just make it blue.

984
00:54:52,400 --> 00:55:05,480
Oh, American Airlines. I, I, it would be so cathartic for me to like an empty American Airlines flight to just take like a sledgehammer to the, I hate American Airlines flights so much. So many bad flights with them.

985
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:09,640
That's where, oh my my, they're, they're the main airline that serves LA to Philadelphia.

986
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:25,000
I hate it. We took them back. We took them back from Tokyo and they may as well, but she put me in a trunk. They stuffed me in a trunk for 12 hours. I was assuming on a flight, like a flight, that international flight, that there would be a little bit more leg room in the regular cabin.

987
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:38,880
No, no, not crammed for 12 hours. Most miserable on the way there. We took Tokyo, LA, oh, delightful. I'm repeating myself. Delightful. Everyone worked there was nice. We got like a great meals.

988
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:44,640
American Airlines on the way back, the American staff were hostile. They were upset to be on the flight too.

989
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:50,640
US Airways, this didn't happen. They bought US Airways and US Airways was always a much more pleasant experience.

990
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:50,920
Yeah.

991
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:51,360
I feel like.

992
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:52,080
Oh, it sucks.

993
00:55:52,080 --> 00:56:03,560
Started yelling about them on Twitter. That's the best thing. You know, you got more followers now because of the pod and people love when somebody that you, somebody you're a fan of on your Twitter feed starts yelling at an airline.

994
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:03,840
Yes.

995
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:08,120
What a happy day. The people's champion is standing up.

996
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:14,840
Everyone like finally speaking. Can you hear the people singing? Complaining about airlines on Twitter.

997
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:24,200
Yes, that's true. So let me do it right now. Several years ago. Your leg room left something to be desired.

998
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:39,760
Yeah, um, fry wagon. So I, well, I guess I think I brought up animal kingdom to say like, I guess I, you know, I'm not, I'm not entirely, I'm not all for blatant McDonald's and any brand all over the park, but I think this was fun.

999
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:40,080
Yes.

1000
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:51,880
I think that I think the wagon was fun. Seeing a big Westward hoe was fun. The idea that we're only going to do a single thing is fun. So fun that they did it in Disney worlds. Did that come up already? I don't remember.

1001
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:58,680
I mentioned it in passing, but yeah, each park had some sort of McDonald's thing like Epcot's refreshment port had McNuggets and fries.

1002
00:56:58,680 --> 00:56:59,360
Okay. Okay.

1003
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:02,880
Fairfax fries at MGM studios had the fries and soda.

1004
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:17,360
Yeah. Oh, gotcha. Right. Right. Um, they did, but they did the same thing in Magic Kingdom. It's old West and it wasn't a wagon. The thing's not nearly as cool, but at least they stuck with the theming and they stuck with the best. They went even bigger. The phrase is much bigger now.

1005
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:26,760
There's gold in them. Their fries. Uh, it's a great, I love it. Uh, a perfect melding, a true McDisney production.

1006
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:41,200
Beautiful. Yeah. Um, but if I could say maybe this is the place to say that not everybody was so happy. As you were saying, this is going to puncture the perfect little oasis that is never punctured by anything that is Disneyland.

1007
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:56,880
And this was in the late nineties, Paul Pressler era, which was a bummer era. They were cutting a lot of corners. Things were getting grosser. There was a lot more focus on the merchandise and less on rides. It was not, not a lot of attractions we all love came from that era.

1008
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:09,480
And this also coincidentally was the internet era and websites were not what they are. And there was not Twitter yet, but there were news groups and there was something called alt.disney.disneyland.

1009
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:25,640
Place where you could go and yell and complain and be very unhappy, including a 13 year old me. I did this posted on this place. Um, so I have memories of this time and I probably would have been this kind of thing did inform me. What is it?

1010
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:44,520
Disney fans supposed to do is supposed to hate stuff like this. So I don't quite remember this controversy and it actually took a Reddit user who I want to credit named Max Mouse who said, Hey, does anyone remember this thing that happened? And let me consolidate the thing that happened.

1011
00:58:44,760 --> 00:59:09,360
So he, he reminded just, there was a thread about the fry wagon. Mostly people like, yeah, that was great. The fries were awesome. But he said, boy, people were not happy on this message board. People would post stuff like quote, is there anything that reminds you of the chaotic world we live in more than McDonald's? Something we see on nearly every corner to which I say person posting that in 1998 buckle up with your chaotic world.

1012
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:17,800
Yeah, re mad about then the president got a blowjob and there's a McDonald's and then things will never get worse than this.

1013
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:33,160
Yeah, but anyways, uh, so people are mad about it. And this one guy is like, Hey, if you're mad, why don't you do something about it? And this was a user on this site named Ebola man.

1014
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:52,400
Uh, man was a poster and he started getting mad about this. Like, Hey, I hear your anger about this cart and Ebola man was already known because he was kind of a little Disneyland rebel rouser, right? He had a site called Disneyland underground intelligence or DUI.

1015
00:59:52,880 --> 01:00:09,160
And on the site, he would do bad boy things like how you could not wear a seatbelt on star tours. I'm sure which now you couldn't do because they check and there's a little light. Yeah, but you know, you try to surf it basically. Like, can you ride it like a surfboard?

1016
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:19,600
Uh, or he snuck in, uh, he snuck backstage at Adventureland and stole a phantasmic cast member jacket. This guy's the ultimate thief and villain.

1017
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:20,320
Wow.

1018
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:35,920
So he was already known. People were already like tiske tiske Ebola man. This I don't approve of this. This is merry pranksterism. But this thing was the last straw and he's posting crazy stuff like I swear if they build that cart, I will burn it down.

1019
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:40,480
Or if I'm too pussy to do that, I'll commit suicide in front of the car.

1020
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:44,440
Geez, Louise, man.

1021
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,840
This is some Limp Bizkit break stuff energy.

1022
01:00:48,640 --> 01:01:05,880
If not that, then I'll break into it when it's closed and ransack spelled bizarrely the insides or I'll tip it over into the rivers of America. Any other ideas? And nobody responded because that's not mostly this is like 13 year olds like me or angry 60 year old.

1023
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:34,560
Uh, people who would never do such a thing, but he eventually posted in October 98 and he said, God, you guys are lame. Oh no, stop it. Stop it. This McDonald's. I'm so upset. Well, hello. There's gallons. Okay. The door to the construction site is never locked. There's gallons of paint in there. Do what I did. Open up one of the paint buckets, stand in the middle and spin as fast as you can.

1024
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:50,880
Seriously, guys, go look at the McDonald's construction site and go in it. You will see a big splatter of black paint and a few more buckets that were spilled. Thanks to yours truly and and jizz M monk who I assume was some compatriot of of a bowl of man.

1025
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:54,160
Anyways, I'm going to post pics soon and blah.

1026
01:01:54,600 --> 01:02:12,880
Um, so he went in and defiled the McDonald's fry cart when it was just being prepared. He went in, spun around with a paint can and then apparently several days later posted photos of it and people were grumbling about this. This is not Disneyland behavior. We don't like this.

1027
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:23,680
And it went all the way up to the top. The guy who was responsible, I guess the mod you would say of the message board. Do you know the name of the mod of the message board? It's a name you might know from Disneyland.

1028
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:51,800
Internet lore. I actually think I know. Is it six letters? Al Lutz is the name of the person who was supervising all of this. And he said, not only is this not good behavior for this message board or for Disneyland, but for the world, I am calling the Anaheim police because he left evidence. He took photos of what he did of defiling the fry cart. And soon enough, this guy was taken into police custody.

1029
01:02:52,040 --> 01:03:02,760
And this was written about in the OC register and the LA Times. This actually made it a little far. And upon his arrest, what was determined is that he was 16 years old.

1030
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:07,480
That's sent the 16 year old to jail.

1031
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:13,200
Al Lutz ratted out a 16 year old and then was quoted in the article.

1032
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:29,440
He after his little victory, he said the fact that he would show the stuff that he stole. This might be a different thing. He also stole stuff. He would show the stuff that he stole was stupidity incarnate. It was just insane. But I guess he's just a kid.

1033
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:41,400
So this is this Disneyland Internet legend, narked out 16 year old Ebola man because he splashed brown paint on the McDonald's fry. I mean, everyone kind of sucks in this story.

1034
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:55,080
There's no winner. Yeah, there's no winners because it's like, well, man, that paint like workers like regular worker like people have to clean that shit up. But also they're probably like, yeah, okay, whatever. I guess some paint's building. I guess we'll just paint over it.

1035
01:03:55,400 --> 01:04:03,320
Like, but then it's just like, oh, yes, you're narking out. It's just ban them from the message board. That would probably annoy him more.

1036
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:23,160
Yeah, yeah. And well, and just like, you lose your D platform. That's what happens to the process here. And then but then you can really create a monster because then though, you know, your weird little YouTube channel, suddenly we might be getting our election conspiracy news from DUI Disneyland Internet.

1037
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:45,360
I accept that apparently in the wake of this, his parents shut down the website because I tried to find that on archive.org and I couldn't do it. No DUIs. But anyway, wild story. Shame on you. Ebola man. Oh, he also like story. He found blueprints. He stole blueprints of it. I think he thought like now they can't build it.

1038
01:04:46,080 --> 01:05:01,320
There's no plan. It can't get done. I think he really thought he was going to bring the thing down, which again, I'm not on Ebola man's side, but I admire the spirit that these other people are just complaining and Walt would never run blah. And this guy did something. He snuck in somewhere. He stole the plants.

1039
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:01,880
Yeah.

1040
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:19,400
I don't know. Yeah, I follow a couple of accounts like a couple of accounts that repost screen grab like bad comics takes or cringy theme park. And but like, and it's funny to laugh at most of them. And then every now and then there's one where it's like, okay, this person might be a spree killer one day.

1041
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:30,360
Like it's like you shouldn't be getting this mad about like professional wrestling or like television shows. Like I don't I don't think this is worth this effort. So someone should watch this guy.

1042
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:43,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. The level of rage about a thing that does not deserve rage. Yeah. I mean, it depends though, as the age gets older and the anger still there. That's I think even more. I think is the thing. Yeah. Like, 16 year olds. Yeah.

1043
01:05:44,360 --> 01:06:01,320
Dream for a 16 year old what you're describing. But yeah, if it was like a 37 year old, I would say that's more alarming to me. Sure. Well, then let's all kid the next time we're mad about something. Let's all be civil. I like that you can just create that you can just grab paint and twirl.

1044
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:17,280
I like the plan he gave us. He prescribed a little plan. Just take an open paint can spin around. It's a little Bart Simpson hygiene. It's not that bad really. But you're right that ultimately it's not like, you know, Eisner didn't have to go clean it up. Right? Some guy did.

1045
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:46,240
Like I just painted, oh, God, I'm making like $10 an hour. Yeah. And but it did delay the opening of the fry cart and the Fry Car ultimately was taken away because the official McDisney partnership ended. So there was a finite amount of time that that car was going to be open. And he did Rob precious weeks of that time. Yeah. Press weeks, although it stuck around. I it's stuck around till like 2008. I don't know that was still serving McDonald's food. Oh, seven and oh, wait, okay. But it was still serving McDonald's food.

1046
01:06:47,280 --> 01:07:14,240
Was there's nothing there now. It's kind of like if we haven't said it was sort of like around the exit of Big Thunder and people would say when you got off the ride around that time, like, oh, I just had a great time on Big Thunder and now I can smell the sweet aroma of golden them their fries walking through the air. Yeah, look, I mean, if you're at a theme park for a day and you're having fun, you're cutting loose. What are French fries and a Coca Cola? That's not a bad like little treat. You know, I get it. You're cutting cut loose.

1047
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:21,240
I would be much more likely to cut loose with some fries than the big pretzel. I like the big pretzel once in a while, but I would be much more likely to cut loose that way with the fries. Well, if we want to cut loose again, if we want to find ways to make McDonald's organically in a classy manner, fit back in the

1048
01:07:51,240 --> 01:08:21,200
fries. How about fortune fries? Fortune teller kind of a booth, very small that like is you could make it a machine maybe with an animatronic that probably seems more difficult, but just make it look like a fortune teller booth over in the New Orleans square area. And it just sells fries and you get a fortune on the box on the low. Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So good. And then you that encourages you to keep going back because you get a different thing every time you can get collect all the boxes or there's a new.

1049
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:36,200
Or they're just handwritten scrolls every morning. A bunch of people just write like somebody's got to go custom right. I will do well and an upcoming test of your moral character and we can go anywhere in the anywhere. It doesn't have to be Disneyland. We can think of we can think of. Go ahead and go ahead.

1050
01:08:36,200 --> 01:09:05,160
How about this Star Wars long time ago, Galaxy far, far away, far, far away fries. You know, you make the box look stuffed up a little dinged up. You know, what's the where do you get it though? That's sort of like, yeah, so just make it look. That's that's what I think we should focus on is like making it seamlessly blend into the scenery. Well, is it the quarter Porsche? Is it on car plots is on car?

1051
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:26,680
I mean, you could switch out some of those stalls in the suck in the marketplace in Galaxy's Edge. If they want to. Oh, I'm so sorry. I got so excited. It's not a quarter portion. It's a quarter pound with cheese. Oh, our plot is going to sell you. He just has quarter pounders with cheese.

1052
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:44,040
One quarter pounder. Yeah, but it's a good thing. Yes, it's a poor reward for Ray for finalized junk, but that's like you found a lot of great junk if you're getting quarter pounder for it. Quarter pound. Wow. Wow. Yeah, that's pretty great.

1053
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:47,800
Where else do you want to like?

1054
01:09:49,400 --> 01:10:13,400
I mean, fantasy land I'm trying to think of. I mean, I would it would it's not practical, but if there was a drive through in the Autopia, suddenly I feel a lot more excited. You get stalled at the end. Yeah, there's like a land that you dedicate a lane to that. You if you go, you pay it's an add on. You pay a little more. But you do get you get frightened. You pull up to a tiny McDonald's.

1055
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:33,640
That now you're that's a dream. Yeah, yeah, it gets the chance to like they like they pay or they then your your kids like I got you, Dad. Thanks, son. I bet you probably have to pay before you pay for the special lane. That's that's could be a lightning lane. Yeah. And then yeah, kid gets to pick up the lunch lane. Wow.

1056
01:10:33,640 --> 01:11:03,560
They should add more lanes to the new genie app. Yeah, a lot more lanes. How about this? Laning lane and lunch lane. They're they're redoing to town. Yeah. So I remember you getting a very sad hot dog back there once. And I think they they will need some sort of food thing back there. You got Mickey's house. Maybe there should be a little dinery like 50s looking diner. You got a classic movie theater look to the facade that's coming down.

1057
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:33,560
To Mickey Mickey's Runaway Railway. And you get a box. You get the big you get a Big Mac. But the box is not a regular Big Mac box. It looks like Mickey's gloved hand grabbing it. Well, and they call it the Big Mac. Wow. You're gonna have to massage relations with the Irish community. But I think though, I think you let it slide. How did they do the partnership and not do the Big Mac? Yeah, big. Yeah, that's good.

1058
01:11:33,640 --> 01:12:03,560
You could have the signage say like Mickey D's. Oh, that's good. Oh, yeah, it's been Mickey. All this Mickey D's. They were that was the nickname. Yeah. Donald's. I don't know if people say it as much anymore. Wow. But it's not Mickey D's. It's Mickey D's. Yeah. Mickey's. Mickey's. Mickey's. Shout down on Mickey's D. But then you could have Mickey's flurries. What? The McFlurry Mickey's Flurry.

1059
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:08,120
Oh, so anything. Well, Mickey's nuggets. I guess I don't like Mickey's nuggets.

1060
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:14,120
Mickey's nuggets. Grab two of Mickey's nuggets.

1061
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:17,240
Fit them between your cheeks.

1062
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:27,600
It's been 30 years so far. It has. The month has been real. Yeah. All of it. Somebody pointed that out the other day. I'm like, it is true. I don't know what's going on.

1063
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:41,280
The well, speaking of McNuggets, yeah, because if we're piecing off elements, I mean, maybe we haven't cracked like space exactly. Yeah. Why not? Why wasn't why weren't fries in space?

1064
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:48,720
I final fry tier front fry. No, that doesn't.

1065
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:52,160
They don't have Star Trek yet.

1066
01:12:54,400 --> 01:13:06,400
I wish. I'm so upset that no one's doing most Star Trek. Yeah, that's yeah. Space has to have something. Is it fries? What's the most space like food at McDonald's?

1067
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:16,480
This one. Well, like fries are I mean, no nuggets kind of look like meteors like you're in a meteor. I mean, I did meteor showers. Right. Burger invasion.

1068
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:29,680
A McGriddle to me is a very spacey like futuristic item to eat because McGriddle has the syrup infused into the pancake, which is the bun essentially on a sausage and bacon cheese sandwich.

1069
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:33,360
Was that their last big innovation? Like scientific, like food wise?

1070
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:44,080
That was the biggest breakthrough as far as science is concerned is the McGriddle. I think if I don't think there was anybody they've had new chicken sandwiches. They've had like tiny Big Macs. Remember they had the three sizes.

1071
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:57,120
I well, yeah, the mini the what were they called? The Big Mac, the King Mac, something like that. The regular Big Mac was the middle size. I love the small Big Mac. Yeah. The mini Mac, I think it was what we're called.

1072
01:13:57,200 --> 01:14:08,480
Well, then the you know, Tomorrowland used to have demonstrations, the Hall of Chemistry and all that kind of thing. So it's and it's they're always trying to keep that relevant.

1073
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:16,880
I feel like there's still empty space in Tomorrowland. So it's that you do kind of the 50s, 60s kind of exhibits, but it's a but it's the McGriddle lab. It's a McGriddle.

1074
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:32,080
Watch the creation of a McGriddle. Yeah, it's it's and it's in that sourdough bakery kind of thing where there's people in lab coats. It's not it's not treated like a food preparation place. These are our brightest scientific minds.

1075
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:36,800
It's like the baby raptors at the Jurassic Park. Oh, yeah.

1076
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:58,800
Center and Islands of Adventure, the fake hatchlings. Yeah. But they're making McGriddles. And then you pick one like a lobster. That one's mine. Oh, that's good, too. I was going to say do it like inner space and have it be you start with a big pancake and then they shrink it down and you see it go through like a like a like some sort of a machine. And then that's when you eat it.

1077
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:13,200
You could do it like that. Like they have to get it. They have to start to be able to inject the syrup properly. Starts picking. There's a giant like a giant robot has to pour like syrup on a pancake and then he puts it in a machine and it shrinks it down.

1078
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:28,160
Is there anyone we haven't talked about characters in the McDonald and characters never really been in the parks? Is there something where that's either like a a fight or a team up or even a Daffy Donald style dueling piano?

1079
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:40,320
Is there a Disney character who would pair well with a grimace or a birdie? I feel like I'm not I'm not coming up with it. I feel like Eeyore and Grimace are buddies. Oh, sure. Two depressed characters.

1080
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:55,280
What if they believe it's that implies that you'd be back in in the critter country where Winnie the Pooh is and that's where the our beloved country bears were in Big Al. Let's get him back too.

1081
01:15:55,280 --> 01:16:15,120
And it's like a really depressing. It's like a like one of those like jazz piano bars. That's the blue note where it's all dimly lit and like the blue part of an American Airlines plane and big boy season all year round.

1082
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:16,880
Get yourself a big boy.

1083
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:30,080
Yeah, like a really seedy sad jazz club where you go here. Standards depressing standards by Eeyore, Grimace and Big Al.

1084
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:31,040
That's good.

1085
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:35,040
Can you put like Mack tonight with Sonny Eclipse?

1086
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:53,760
Oh my God. Yes, dueling piano. Yeah, right. Oh my God. That's the way to make both of them relevant. Right. Take both of their crumbling kitsch appeal and shove them together. There's an image. There's a at least a long time ago. There was a non functioning Mack tonight.

1087
01:16:54,160 --> 01:17:18,960
Not playing a piano in a crazy McDonald's in a non standard McDonald's in Orlando. If that guy is still rotten away, replace his hands, make him go again and they duel piano of an alien and a moon. They'd be they'd have so much to talk about and so many puns to say that really it's like Godzilla versus Kong where it's like rising tide lifts all ships. You're you're bringing you're making both these guys look good.

1088
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:32,000
You know, broken franchises a little bit, but you combine their might and now they're bigger and better than ever. Yeah. And cosmic rays is awful. The food. Yes. So change it to best improvement. Change it to full McDonald's.

1089
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:45,200
All right. Wait there was that topping bar does so much for you. The toppings bar is frozen. I just had chicken fingers and fries because I had not had like, aren't they the same as like Tomorrowland fries? Like there's something that special about them.

1090
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:54,640
No, they're not that. Yeah, they weren't that special. I mean, my dad and brother like they had burgers. They like them. You're gonna tell me you've had it recently and you think it's like better than McDonald's.

1091
01:17:54,640 --> 01:18:10,480
Uh, well, I think the chicken that there sometimes you want a chicken finger. Sometimes you want a chicken nugget. And I know you know what I'm talking about, Scott. I don't know that you know what I know. But I know what you're talking about, but I've never had a good meal.

1092
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:29,920
The place right. I don't really know you've you're more than you have a chicken sandwich there and it was fine. I didn't throw it up, but it wasn't better than the McDonald's chicken sandwich. Yeah, I think I think people really like that topics more though. So you talk about it.

1093
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:59,920
So I think it's doing all the work. The topics are free in a Disney park. You're taking the tongs and you're taking another piece of lettuce. You're thinking like it's an extra couple cents and you're taking an extra. You're like thinking of the value. You're gaining your sense back now. See that. And they used to sell for years and years. They had cheese steaks there that were pretty good. And that was better than a standard fraud. You're not signing off on cosmic

1094
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:29,880
rays becoming McDonald's. Well, I don't see. But then they're not going to give your not eclipse. They're not going to give sunny eclipse. But if they shine tonight with him. Yeah, that's part of the day. That's step one of the deal. Okay, that's the priority. Step two is all right. Maybe we get your McDonald's food in there if we can. I if you're going to do that, I think you have to then have the hits. You have to have Big Mac's McFlurries. You have to add the and I stand by. I think the regular McDonald's cheeseburgers better than the quarter pounder.

1095
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:52,480
But I think you need both of them in there. You get a more you get more of the ketchup on a regular cheeseburger. Yeah, I think the texture is better, too. But I honestly I think the double the double cheeseburger, though, is different. I think if you get the right double cheeseburger, especially with the Mac sauce, I think that might be the ultimate taste.

1096
01:19:53,200 --> 01:20:20,840
I think you might be right. I don't like that quarter pounder meat. That fresh quarter quarter frozen meat, double cheeseburger meat, I think is different than the quarter pounder meat. And I but I think it is. I think in the Big Mac meat is different. Is it like different meat? Really? It is. I don't know if it's just a preparation. I'm not exactly sure what it is, but there is how much raccoon is in it. Yes. Is it 80% or 95% is really I think the big Mac patties are just the cheeseburger patties.

1097
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:48,800
So you like those patties? I like those patties. You're getting Yeah, they're thinner patties. Yes. And I think the thicker ones are better. I can think of the double cheeseburger ones are better. They feel like more meat to me. Okay, they feel more real. This is too testy in here. You guys are both going to go do some shootings or something. This is these are bowl of mans waiting to happen. Yeah, when you the hot the only way we're gonna relieve the tension is driving through McDonald's right now.

1098
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:59,880
Which I have eaten McDonald's a number of times in my car outside of your house. Oh, I love waiting. Really? Well, I'm listening to my my stories listening to my podcast.

1099
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:10,480
Wait out front and eat McDonald's. I want to listen to my show. I've done it. Yeah. I've done it too. I'll see the Dorsey Brothers.

1100
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:25,840
I eat an impossible burro big whopper a couple weeks ago out in front here. Jeez. Yeah. Yeah. You can come in though. I love you. I know you like I know it's I love eating fast food in the car. Yeah, I

1101
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:39,280
That's kind of part of it. Yeah, part of it for me. So there is something fun about it. I don't know what it is. But is it better or worse than eating fast food that came from a wagon and probably you don't have like a table to sit at.

1102
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:59,200
As might be a deficiency of it. But knowing that your fries came from a wagon has to be the best way to get fries that there. I bet that's true. And I'm sad that I missed it. Yeah, I'm sad that I didn't do it. I mean, I do. I had no excuse. There's that's one of the many things like the Star Trek experience in Vegas where I was like right there. I think I think you're right.

1103
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:16,640
We didn't do it. And I regret it. I stayed at the hotel when it was open and I didn't do it. We were fools. We're all fools for so many years, but we're no fools now because we get together and we talk about these things. We talk about the fry cart for a while. You survive.

1104
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:35,600
I guess the ride that makes sense. That adds up that if you if you delivered that it'd be interesting to predict the times before we do them. 90 seems right. Yeah. McDonald's wise, we really haven't even though we talk about McDonald's all the time, we haven't done enough and we haven't gotten close to the real juice.

1105
01:22:35,600 --> 01:23:03,760
The characters, the 70s versions versus 90s. We just learned about Burger King knockoff. Some of these knockoff characters. Yeah, on the George Lucas talk show, which in the in the plug pile, if you didn't see us on there, that was a ton of fun. And that's up on their YouTube. But yeah, so much McDonald's to come and so much restaurant stuff to come. Maybe McDonald's might eat in there. I'm not totally sure. We will see. But this is maybe we could do a slightly bigger one.

1106
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:26,160
So here's your plug here for what's coming up next week. Might bear mentioning. Look at your calendars. What is it next week? Well, that's the start of February. But it's not just that. It's so much more than that. February is celebrity podcast. The rides celebrity restaurant month.

1107
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:42,320
This is something we have been talking about for a while. We've delayed a bunch. I feel like we delayed it because we kept the parks are back open and we got to talk about that and diseases and blah. But it landed exactly where it needed to land because celebrity and February go together like fries and wagons.

1108
01:23:42,320 --> 01:24:10,480
What I am saying is that we are back on the theme bus. We are doing an entire theme month that is both main feed and second gate where we are covering the many great restaurants owned by various celebrities, themed restaurants owned by celebrities. Would you say? Well, not always. This is kind of an interesting thing to part. I think a lot of the time. Yes, I'd say. But I don't really know some of these that we're going to learn about. I don't know how heavy they are.

1109
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:40,480
I don't know how heavy the theming was, but I think a celebrity in and of themselves lends some theming to it, especially because they're bringing like their persona and what you know him from from their show or movie or whatever it is. I mean, there's there's restaurants owned by all manner of celebrities and we're going to talk about a ton of it. There's some I think big exciting topics that we're heading for. How you guys are you excited about celebrity? I am excited about it. This actually probably great warm up.

1110
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:54,400
I'm excited for it. Great food based warm up and I don't think we even consciously made that choice. It flows. I think very, very well. So stay hungry. We got a regular main feed. That's a lot of fun that is not.

1111
01:24:54,400 --> 01:25:07,600
Well, there's a little food in there, but but then and and again, you know, hey, look, we're not stepping on the doughboys territory. These are not exactly restaurant reviews. I'd say we're so much more about the theming and the culture surrounding the places.

1112
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:18,120
And, you know, and most of which probably weren't chains. Some of them, I don't know. You could I the listener could maybe guess some of these, but I can't imagine all of them.

1113
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:32,720
Yeah, some of these, especially on the second gate, will show up in your inbox and you'll go, I guess so. But I swear. But buckle up, because I there's not one thing that's in the in discussion for us talking about it that I'm not pleased about.

1114
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:40,320
Yeah, some of them are very bizarre and then some of them are theme park adjacent, both figuratively and literally.

1115
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:53,160
So, yes, absolutely. Yeah. And some are close to almost nothing on this or some are a real real journey to get to. I think you know what I'm talking about. I don't want to spoil anything.

1116
01:25:53,160 --> 01:26:03,280
It's all man. There's so much in here and but we'll get into it. That'll that'll take over the main feed next week, the first one of February.

1117
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:08,320
And then you can keep listening to those on the second gate as well. That's where we really go deep on these.

1118
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:20,760
The wonderful world of celebrity restaurants. So get excited, everybody. I am. So keep it tuned here, I guess, is the main instruction, because all your favorite stars will be popping up.

1119
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:26,200
Favorite doing some heavy lifting.

1120
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:31,840
Yeah, knowing what we know about who it is, especially on the second gate.

1121
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:37,880
I mean, I'd love to meet the people who would describe these people as their favorite stars. It might be you. It might be the listener.

1122
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:50,280
I hope it is. Like I said to my dad, describing him some of the restaurant of source menu, I was like that manor in orange Chinese chicken salad doing some heavy lifting on that menu board in terms of actual food.

1123
01:26:50,280 --> 01:27:03,440
Mm hmm. Yeah, well, heavy hitters doing heavy lifting all month long. Keep it tuned here and to the main feed. It's going to be a hell of a month. So long.
