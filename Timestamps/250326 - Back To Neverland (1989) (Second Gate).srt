00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,820
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the second gate, today focused on Back to Neverland, a phrase

2
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,160
I hear in my absolute darkest stress dreams.

3
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,440
I'm Scott Garrener, joined by Mike Carlson.

4
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,760
Uh, yes, I'm here.

5
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,720
Uh, I, when you, I'll be honest, you suggest, I mean, I'll be honest with the

6
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,260
listener, you suggested this.

7
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,640
And then when even just the phrase, I said, how is he even typing this in a text

8
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,800
chain, I thought like, oh my gosh, what's going on here?

9
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,080
I think I can explain why I'll go get Jason Sheridan in.

10
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:53,840
Yeah, I, I'd seen a couple of people suggest this when we asked and that's

11
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,120
why I'm doing it for them, for the people.

12
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,000
It's not for me.

13
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,240
It's podcasters for the people.

14
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,480
But this was one where I was like, what is, and then as soon as I started

15
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,400
watching, I was like, oh yeah, this is in my bones.

16
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,960
So yeah, absolutely.

17
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,280
That's why I like that phrase.

18
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,840
That's completely how I feel about this.

19
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:20,560
There's so many aspects of Disney MGM studios where you can't exactly conjure

20
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,280
where it was or when you saw it or what was the flow from this into that, or

21
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,440
sometimes even the name, but you just, you go as like, as soon as you experience

22
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,520
any of it or see a still from it, you're like, this is in me.

23
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,920
This is my DNA.

24
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,600
I like like primary core memory.

25
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,040
I am coming to life.

26
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,720
I'm alive on this earth.

27
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,240
I am in Florida watching Robin Williams goof around with Walter Cronkite.

28
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,000
Yeah.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,640
It's like, oh, I'm probably in Hollywood because of it.

30
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,400
This is probably one of the reasons.

31
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,120
Totally.

32
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,680
Yes.

33
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,000
Great movie ride.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,640
Exactly what I'm thinking.

35
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:55,920
Yeah.

36
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,600
Well, no, and I know that was a big one for you and it was a disappointment for

37
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,640
you to get here and realize that it's all like improv comedy and that you don't

38
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,240
get to like stand on a big cake with 70 people in unitards.

39
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:11,000
There's no Esther Williams numbers to participate in in today's Hollywood.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,320
I didn't have the cardio.

41
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,680
I just couldn't keep up.

42
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,080
Yeah.

43
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,840
Well, but even if you could, I mean, there's just not like, you know, like I

44
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:24,880
know I recall you saying in your talking to agents initially being like, you know,

45
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:31,000
I think I could see myself as swimmer number 56 in a group of 120 agents.

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,520
Love it.

47
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,520
When you're like, I just want to be a number.

48
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,720
Thank you so much.

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,760
Well, it takes pressure off as you're getting into the business, having to come

50
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,800
up with a name and like flesh out a character like that, as opposed to just

51
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,720
like, you know, like just being there to learn learning from swimmers one through

52
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,440
55.

53
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:54,560
Now I'm just holding on for like the return of like being lowered from a

54
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,080
ceiling, like a swinging Teddy Barra.

55
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:57,560
Yeah.

56
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,080
You know, I, I seats lowered from the ceiling on a swing.

57
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,680
Specifically on a swing.

58
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,240
Yeah.

59
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:10,040
We're like that, um, uh, uh, that show that was at the fantasy land stage.

60
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,400
We talked about, uh, was that just a TV special?

61
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,120
We talked about the TV special.

62
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,440
Someone on a swing nutcracker.

63
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,160
Oh, okay.

64
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,720
Oh, that's why I wasn't coming to me.

65
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,280
I wasn't here.

66
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:22,880
You weren't here.

67
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,040
Uh, I didn't realize it had a swing.

68
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,360
Didn't realize it had a swinger.

69
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,600
There was a swinger.

70
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:33,520
Jason's into swingers and swinging this.

71
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:38,200
We know I sign all my internet posts with an upside down pineapple.

72
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,880
Just so everyone knows that cruise ship symbol sign of swinging.

73
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,160
Well, that I think it's a universal sign.

74
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:46,920
Okay.

75
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,440
Not universal parks.

76
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,120
Universal is in all work.

77
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,240
If you left an upside down pineapple around at a, at a, you know, at Mel's

78
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,000
diner, it might read as something.

79
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,520
Maybe.

80
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,280
Yeah, we should try it.

81
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,080
Worth a shot.

82
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,360
Yeah.

83
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,040
See if you can do the siren song of the swinger there.

84
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,440
You kind of pocket it when you get the stomach ache that immediately hits

85
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,560
two bites into a Mel's diner meal.

86
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:10,880
Is that true?

87
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,320
Now I would assume I'm not surprised by this at all, but, uh, as, as Mel's a

88
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,880
particularly disappointing, and are we talking West Coast Mel's or East Coast Mel's?

89
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,720
Oh, I think West Coast Mel's look in my older age, I understand the phrase

90
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,520
theme park, chili dog is a no-go.

91
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,480
In my older, the wisdom that comes with the passage of time.

92
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:39,440
I, I, you know, I, I put away childhood things, you know, you put away childhood

93
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,960
chili, basically your childhood desire for theme park, chili now outside of

94
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,360
theme park, chili dog in a mall.

95
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,160
Now that's, that's fair game.

96
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,840
That's obviously fine and should be pursued at all times.

97
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,040
Yeah.

98
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,640
Well, at least it's not hurting your wallet.

99
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:59,440
If you're getting a tummy ache, the mall, the mall, I'm just saying the

100
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,080
mall food court, chili dog is usually more cost effective.

101
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,840
But at CityWalk, we, we always talk about the massive markup at CityWalk.

102
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,240
There's no way you're getting a chili dog for cheap.

103
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,520
Not a theme park.

104
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,880
Well, I mean like Burbank town center, Glendale Galleria.

105
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,600
No, that's no, I'm saying city.

106
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,640
I'm saying theme park, adjacent chili.

107
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,240
These are all different varieties of chili dog.

108
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,280
And just to be clear to the listener, you aren't swearing off all chili

109
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,600
dogs, not by a long shot.

110
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,480
No, I love, I do love a chili dog.

111
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,320
And this is probably a moment where I should bring up before we get into

112
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,680
this very fruitful topic, I, it's just for you, Patreon listeners, following

113
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:48,080
up on Mike's adventure with the Taco Bell Caliente Cantina menu.

114
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,400
Oh, I, Jane and I were ordering Taco Bell in the Taco Bell app.

115
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:59,000
And I saw you could get a side of the Caliente sauce for only 60 cents.

116
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:03,480
And just to refresh, this is that Mike took a swing at an item that he'd never

117
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:09,360
tried at the CityWalk Taco Bell, where once it came out, it seemed like some

118
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,680
kind of cleaning fluid.

119
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,040
It was covered in neon yellow and it was just so gross.

120
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,960
Now we believe that the neon yellow was meant to be the Caliente sauce.

121
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,120
That's the theory.

122
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,000
It's a working theory.

123
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,040
It's a working theory.

124
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:27,520
This one was more neon orange, you know, of the thing that assures us.

125
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,560
And I took two bites.

126
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,600
Wait, yes, a yellow alarmed you, but orange would have been no problem.

127
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,680
Orange means go, yellow means stop in Taco Bell language.

128
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,120
Yeah.

129
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,200
And red means go extra hard.

130
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,560
You need to eat there to know that.

131
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:49,200
But in the favor of being a theme park journalist, I was like, I am going to get

132
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:57,040
a side of this and dip like a chip in it and see if it was just the CityWalk

133
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,320
location that was a problem or a problem across the board.

134
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:11,880
And, um, I, after two bites, um, I, uh, gave up and I said, I don't want any more

135
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,600
of this and I'm not hungry anymore.

136
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,080
So, Whoa.

137
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,640
I were hungry.

138
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,200
Huh?

139
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,040
And then it zapped.

140
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,560
You're just zapped.

141
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,040
Yeah.

142
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,160
I, my mouth was numb and then my lips were numb for the rest.

143
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,000
Like I finished the last couple of bites of a burrito.

144
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,360
It's just like liquid ozempic.

145
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,040
What do you mean?

146
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,880
I, it was, it was awful.

147
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,680
It, it tasted like lemon heads rolled in cayenne pepper.

148
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:37,720
Okay.

149
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,120
So that is the same taste.

150
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,360
Yeah.

151
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,960
What is this fucking sauce?

152
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,520
What's going on?

153
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,040
I don't know.

154
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,200
I thought it was just going to be like, uh, uh, the fire sauce packets or like a

155
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,280
sriracha thing.

156
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,040
I'm going to, I'm just going to read, keep going.

157
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,080
I'm going to click on this, but the, like, there's a Reddit, Taco Bell Reddit, which

158
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,880
I assume that you're on, uh, fairly frequently.

159
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,880
He's more on the Wendy's.

160
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,960
More on the Wendy's.

161
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:04,920
But now what the, this thread is titled, what's the Caliente Cantina sauce made of?

162
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,880
But after hearing both of your trauma, I can't help but read it in more of a

163
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:12,120
Soylent Green kind of, what's the Caliente Cantina sauce made of?

164
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,920
What's it made of?

165
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:20,080
So like for the next couple of hours, my like lips and mouth were kind of like

166
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,040
numb hours of numbness.

167
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,480
Yeah, I had a bad time.

168
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,480
Like I had a really bad time.

169
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,280
It's a bad trip, man.

170
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,880
Just like, just lay down, let it wash over you.

171
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,960
You were numb for hours?

172
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,440
For like a couple of hours.

173
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,080
And Scott, I was reaching for my, Scott, you're going to hate this phrase.

174
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,760
Do you know what a dirty soda is?

175
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,320
Um, no, no, I don't.

176
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:45,960
Okay.

177
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:51,560
Well, apparently I always saw it like, oh, this thing in Utah, it's very popular.

178
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,960
And it's like Dr.

179
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,000
Pepper Coke with a million syrups and cream in it.

180
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,640
And now Sonic is doing it.

181
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,200
And I would hate this phrase, but I hate the idea.

182
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:03,640
Yeah.

183
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,880
So this was just a, a dirty Baja Blast Zero.

184
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,880
So it was just Baja Blast Zero, which is already an unnatural color, which is

185
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,920
like a pump of half and a half, I guess.

186
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,720
Heavy cream, heavy cream in your Baja Blast.

187
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,240
Yeah.

188
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,920
So think about it that way.

189
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,040
All right.

190
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:29,680
I'm just going to close my eyes and imagine heavy cream in your soda, your Mountain Dew.

191
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,080
So I was like, that sauce was so nasty.

192
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,480
I was like, it's going to be so heavy in cream.

193
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,160
I'm chugging my cream.

194
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,520
It does taste it like Baja Blast with cream soda.

195
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:46,960
Jason's lips went numb, so he chugged his cream to bring the feeling back.

196
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,400
Actually, it's funny because they do say dairy if you eat something too spicy.

197
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,240
You're not supposed to drink water, you drink like milk, like hot ones.

198
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,640
They've got the milk there and that's better.

199
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,640
They say, they say dairy or blast.

200
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,840
They say you're one of those food groups.

201
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,160
Yeah.

202
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,360
You're having your five daily blasts.

203
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,800
But yeah, Mike, I will back you up.

204
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,080
That collie and that sauce was nasty.

205
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,280
Well, you sound, your sounds way worse than mine.

206
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,360
I did not have a good time.

207
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,160
Like you were numb.

208
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:20,160
Something that is being distributed at a very common restaurant should not be

209
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,600
numbing people.

210
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,800
It's like the fuzzy tauntaun at Rex at the Cantina in Star Wars land.

211
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,920
Yeah, but that's supposed to do it.

212
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,440
That's like, that's a certain type of peppercorn.

213
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,600
Right. That's fun.

214
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
That's fun numbing.

215
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,080
What you're describing is not fun.

216
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,000
Could you talk? Was it like you had Novocaine?

217
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,040
Yeah, I could talk fine.

218
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,600
I was just like.

219
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,280
Here's what it is. It says it's part lemon, part Novocaine.

220
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,600
That's what Taco Bell puts into the sauce.

221
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,480
They struck a deal with a dental products distributor

222
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,520
who needed to move a lot of Novocaine.

223
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:49,880
Right.

224
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,960
Get it off the ship.

225
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,080
Expired. Maybe that's why it's not.

226
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,960
It's not strong enough to use during operations.

227
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,480
Right. So they have to get rid of it.

228
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,800
But it is strong enough to make you require dirty soda.

229
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,040
Right. Maybe this was all some weird backchannel deal with the dirty soda people, too.

230
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,240
This is to raise sales of dirty soda.

231
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,080
Yeah. Trump signed an executive order to to make Novocaine legal and fast food.

232
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,160
So that's also probably part of it.

233
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,640
Yeah, beef tallow and Novocaine.

234
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,800
Beef tallow and Novocaine.

235
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,800
We all grew up with this.

236
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,560
This is when food was great in 1988.

237
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,160
That's right.

238
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,560
OK. To go back to the Reddit,

239
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,960
somebody has written the ingredients, which are mostly obscure.

240
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,840
You know, the ingredients, if anything, sound bad.

241
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,960
But somebody has said the lemon oil is the culprit.

242
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,080
They believe that the lemon oil is either what makes it gross or what makes it

243
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,040
is that extra too much sting.

244
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,840
It might not be the right what does the numbing.

245
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,280
A quote, one Dr.

246
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,880
Doinkers, honestly, Dr.

247
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,320
Doinkers, Dr. Doinkers, a doctor is weighed in.

248
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,520
Dr. Doinkers.

249
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,760
And he has said, honestly, it's the worst colored sauce of all time.

250
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,000
It's like it was mad. It was made.

251
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,560
Taco Bell Reddit seems really upset.

252
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,200
OK, so they do. They agree with us.

253
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,520
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

254
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,520
No, everybody. And when the question is posed, what is in it?

255
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,320
All of the answers are, you know, people say like sour green skittles

256
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,560
or like, I can't, you know, Windex, whatever.

257
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,800
Like, yeah. All right.

258
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,680
So this is not uncommon with your guys experience.

259
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,240
And it's not a city walk problem.

260
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,360
I think now we can. Yeah.

261
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,560
So now we can. It's a rare lot.

262
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,520
Yeah. Thank God.

263
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,440
So because I was getting worried there that this would cause Mike

264
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,360
to stop going to the Taco Bell at City Walk.

265
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,800
Crisis averted. Thank God.

266
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,080
There's nothing now to get in your way of going there.

267
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,800
The crunch was good.

268
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,720
I had one other item that was good.

269
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,080
So it's obvious.

270
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,360
It's obviously a quality establishment.

271
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,600
Yeah. Yeah. And not even any nubs.

272
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,840
You didn't even get just a little nub in there.

273
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,840
No nubs to see. I didn't see any nubs.

274
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,280
Yeah. So plastic nubs.

275
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:57,440
No microplastics in all our normal microplastics.

276
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,920
Yeah. And my pickle didn't blow away

277
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,960
while I was up there or the chalupa didn't blow away

278
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,080
or whatever it was called.

279
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,880
You guys really do.

280
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,040
You did have a you went up there and you had a bunch of little rascal problems.

281
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,160
Yeah, that is true.

282
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,880
It was a real and then that was it was at the same day

283
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,200
that Jamie Loftus met us up there accidentally after recording with us.

284
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,560
Yeah. After we all talked about hot dogs and then we encountered her.

285
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,800
You know, we went to banks afterward.

286
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,200
Yeah. Oh, my God.

287
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,960
We're not the only ones.

288
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,200
We're not the only ones.

289
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,440
That was the the yeah.

290
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,280
Mills Hollywood Mills in the park

291
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,760
got a chili dog that made me feel bad.

292
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,600
And then a few years later, if you recall, briefly,

293
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,960
there was a pinks in the park.

294
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,840
And I'm like, well, surely this is a different kind of chili dog.

295
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,200
No, absolutely not.

296
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,680
It's like the Simpsons when they go to the pier

297
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,480
and they just get great slop and they they put it to every restaurant.

298
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,040
It's like you've all had to learn a hundred different variations of the lesson.

299
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,520
Fire is hot.

300
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,160
Fire will burn you.

301
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,560
It's probably a different kind of fire, though.

302
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,560
Like not all fire burns you, right? Yeah.

303
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,800
Not not all stoves get hot enough.

304
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,600
This scorpion going across the river is going to be cool on my back.

305
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,560
Yeah. Well, call fire is Caliente.

306
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,400
I think that's what I remember.

307
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,320
It's a lesson.

308
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,200
So when they introduce a new item, that's just a cup of fire.

309
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,240
And then you won't. So I and I had a free deal on the app.

310
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,000
I got this. So the fire was free.

311
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,360
So that I was excited about.

312
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,800
But then I tried to put the fire in my mouth. Right.

313
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,160
And now, if you notice, I don't have a tongue anymore.

314
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,720
Yeah. No, Mike, I understand.

315
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,880
Everything you just said didn't sound like anything.

316
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,760
It was really hard to understand.

317
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,760
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

318
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,520
If it was an app, it was an app deal.

319
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,320
I'll be interested.

320
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,800
These are some previews of podcasts that write hijinks in 2035.

321
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,640
But for now, let's go backwards.

322
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,040
Let's go back to our childhoods and to this nice thing.

323
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:00,800
I think that is nice enough to completely override any Neverland connotations in my head.

324
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,760
And the quick Cliff notes on this.

325
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,920
Jason essentially said it.

326
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:09,440
But what we're talking about here is a short called Back to Neverland.

327
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,240
It premiered in 1989, along with the Disney MGM Studios.

328
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,440
Brand new theme park at that time.

329
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,640
This was a short film that kicked off the animation tour,

330
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,800
which was called The Magic of Disney Animation.

331
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,880
It was a peek into the animation process that showed you

332
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,000
all of the steps of the process in a fun, enlightening,

333
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,640
funny way that probably made it stick with all of us forever.

334
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,760
Like it's, you know, you're showing this before you're cut loose

335
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,880
in the actual studio so that now you can go, oh, I see.

336
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,000
There's ink and paint.

337
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,600
There's people illustrating at desks.

338
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,440
And it's like it does a really great job of just like teaching you

339
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,480
that animation shorthand really quick and in a fun way.

340
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,200
And it, of course, brings together the classic comedy team of Robin Williams

341
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,240
and Walter Cronkite.

342
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,960
It's so fun.

343
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:00,400
I mean, like, could this be folded into a general animation tour episode,

344
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,560
something that we haven't done possibly?

345
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,920
But it's also I think there's enough to meditate on here.

346
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,800
And also, I've come to realize, like, if we need to flesh out a little bit

347
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,000
of time in an episode just to make sure we get it to time,

348
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,800
just say the word chili dog and then 15 minutes transpires.

349
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,160
Very, very good point.

350
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,320
It's always a way to flesh things out.

351
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,040
But I am very excited to to talk about this.

352
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,560
As we dive into this, it also makes me flesh too,

353
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,120
because this kind of came out of we're saying is there something like classic

354
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,360
Disney MGM Studios?

355
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,200
That'd be a nice vibe to tap into for a second gate.

356
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,200
And I was thinking about a couple things.

357
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,480
And these might all be things worth pursuing.

358
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:41,240
But when you obviously, you know, you go into classic films

359
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,200
like the, you know, like Hollywood magic is evident all across that

360
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,800
that initial park.

361
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,280
And there was like star wattage throughout.

362
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:54,760
But I think something that was especially special about when that park open

363
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:59,320
was like custom little short films and videos

364
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,360
made with very big stars of the time.

365
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,640
Like, it did not feel like some weird favor of a favor.

366
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,320
We owe this guy. This is somebody we could get.

367
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,840
Like, they really got the biggest and best, as did Universal, honestly, too.

368
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:18,640
Like in that little arms race of which is going to be the best movie,

369
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,960
movie studio park, everybody brought out the big guns.

370
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,520
And a couple that I think we need to get to at some point

371
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,320
just to like paint the picture of everything you could see at this time.

372
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,360
Remember the lottery with Bette Midler?

373
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,880
This is something we have not referred to ever on the show.

374
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,920
I am positive of it.

375
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,520
I I've I think I watched it.

376
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,000
This is another short, right? Yes.

377
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,920
Showing movie making techniques. Yes.

378
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:48,160
This was one of these like made to made to show you the process.

379
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:48,960
You know what I mean?

380
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,400
Like it existed so that here we'll make this thing,

381
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,520
but then we will show you the sets and we'll show you how we did the special effects

382
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,800
and we'll show you the costume.

383
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,000
It was like a like a thing meant to be a compelling little short film,

384
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,800
but then also that they could break into elements and like day one have like,

385
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,840
we'll take you behind the scenes. We have made something here.

386
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,640
We swear it's not a fake movie studio. We have made things.

387
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:16,200
We made the lottery with Bette Midler, a short film directed by Gary Marshall.

388
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,800
This thing is so charming.

389
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,680
Did you remember this? I don't really remember.

390
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,040
I don't think I remember it at all.

391
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,120
It was real. I mean, I think they might have changed it out.

392
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,040
And it wasn't always what you would see on the behind the scenes tour.

393
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,880
And it's I also never remember which is which I remember.

394
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,600
I feel like you would watch this in a theater and then go through some catwalks

395
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,120
to see like stages and props and stuff.

396
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,120
I think that was part of this.

397
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:42,000
The whatever step of the tour where you would ride the bee,

398
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,120
where you would end up riding the bee for money.

399
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,280
I shrunk the kids. Right. Yeah.

400
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,000
So the lottery is a fun one, I think, to explore at some point.

401
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,200
Speaking of funny, I shrunk the kids.

402
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,040
There was a Rick Moranis, Goldie Hawn, two hander

403
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,200
that I don't even remember what this was about.

404
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,920
And I think you can only watch it in real shit quality.

405
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,160
Unlike back to Neverland.

406
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,280
There's a pretty nice YouTube rip of it.

407
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,280
But like, you know, hey, those are great stars to see together.

408
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,840
There was a little thing that George Lucas did this.

409
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,680
This I have only the faintest flickering memory of.

410
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,800
I think that was called the editing story.

411
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,480
And George Lucas talked to you in it.

412
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,920
Custom Luke, custom Lucas acting.

413
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:28,440
Yeah, we know the like red hot charisma machine that is George Lucas.

414
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,200
Yeah, I really want to recall whatever the hell it was.

415
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,880
Yeah, learnings were really, really worth a phone call.

416
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,200
Yeah, we got to do that.

417
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,000
There's a lot. There's a lot to get through.

418
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,480
But just the star wattage just in these like behind the scenes things.

419
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:49,680
This is this is Eisner, like feeling himself using his powers,

420
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:54,480
making sure that Disney feels like a real big movie studio with a listeners

421
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,080
and not like, well, you know, Jodie Foster used to do movies with us

422
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,640
till she grew up.

423
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,160
Jodie Foster would return our calls till she was 16.

424
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,160
And now he can't get her anymore.

425
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,800
See, I say with Kurt Russell, he's just too he got old.

426
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,480
He got handsome. He doesn't call us back anymore.

427
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,040
That's basically where Disney was at in the early 80s.

428
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,760
This was late 80s.

429
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,080
It's Eisner, baby.

430
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,880
He's got everybody in the Rolodex.

431
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,440
This kind of lines up with in the Disney war book,

432
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:28,800
the section about touchstone pictures is really interesting

433
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,480
because they're like, we're going to make movies for adults

434
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,800
and they're going to be mid budget.

435
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:40,800
And they kept plucking people who were maybe in a career downturn

436
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,360
or in the case of Robin Williams, had just gotten out of rehab.

437
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,560
So they're striking the people were low.

438
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,320
Yeah, basically.

439
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,600
But then they looked at what a listeners are looking sad

440
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,960
while they walk to their cars.

441
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,080
But it's like recognizable people.

442
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,000
It's like Robin Williams, Bette Midler,

443
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,560
Richard Dreyfuss, I feel like.

444
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:12,320
And it pre-Disney animation, like second golden age,

445
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,160
like they hit on something of like, we'll make these solid movies.

446
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,960
They won't cost a ton of money.

447
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,800
They'll have a recognizable person.

448
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,680
And then they just

449
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,760
a batho box office, as they say out here in Hollywood.

450
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,040
As they definitely say, you hear a lot of batho every day.

451
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,520
Yeah.

452
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,360
There was definitely a clear at least one class in college

453
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,200
where they were trying to explain variety magazines,

454
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,960
annoying terminology like they felt like they had to teach you.

455
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,400
But before you go to Hollywood, here's something you need to learn.

456
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,400
Well, watch this Animaniacs song.

457
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,320
This book, there was multiple books

458
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,280
they encouraged us to buy in the early 2000s.

459
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,280
One was The Thomas Guy, the spiral bound book of maps of L.A.

460
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:05,000
And then another one was like, oh, God, I forget what it was called,

461
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,240
but it had all production companies and agencies, phone numbers and e-mails.

462
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,160
And it was like a phone book.

463
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,240
And then you took it upon yourself to get a third book, Pipe and Hot,

464
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,520
all the best chili dogs in the Hollywood.

465
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,280
Well, I didn't read that one.

466
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,320
I don't know what happened, you know.

467
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,960
They would have guided you away from, you know, go to the theme parks now.

468
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,880
Yeah, that's that's interesting.

469
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,800
I yeah, well, no, I think I think you're seeing the like

470
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,880
fruits of the labor and of the recent success.

471
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,320
They like plugged everybody in.

472
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,440
It just felt like you were like you were part of it.

473
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,920
It didn't feel like a fake movie studio, you know.

474
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,120
And Robin Williams, a huge get.

475
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,600
Is this the first Robin Williams?

476
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,000
It's not the first Robin Williams Disney, because he must.

477
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,080
I don't remember which was Touchstone, but was like

478
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,080
Dead Poets Society or Good Morning Vietnam.

479
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,280
Yeah, they use that clip all the time.

480
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,560
So much good.

481
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,480
I think every scene in the great movie ride

482
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,240
squeezes in a Good Morning Vietnam sting,

483
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,240
whether it's a Western or the Wizard of Oz.

484
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,480
Yeah, well, yeah, with anybody, anyone out there

485
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,160
who went to a little event called BugCon, Buzz Buzz, where we did a brief

486
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,600
pop up event called The Magic of Editing with Craig Healy, the star,

487
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,160
the auteur behind Complicated and Craigfix America and so many great shows.

488
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,640
That was but that was a choice we Craig and I made was that

489
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,760
making a montage like that, where every third clip was Good Morning Vietnam.

490
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,800
As a kid, almost no one, but it was effective.

491
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,520
The big movies, you know,

492
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,240
singing in the rain, Wizard of Oz, going with the wind.

493
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,520
Good morning, Vietnam. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.

494
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,160
And well, I also this wasn't right when the park opened,

495
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,040
but I think that you've definitely felt a sister act presence

496
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,760
as soon as they come, but absolutely, because it's not like they could make

497
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,720
they couldn't get a live show together that fast or like a certainly not a ride.

498
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,840
There was no spoiler. No, no sister act ride

499
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,880
where everybody where you everybody puts on like you get in the ride vehicle

500
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,160
and there's like there's habits in that you put you put the hat on.

501
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,080
Like it's Mario Kart. Yeah, yeah, exactly.

502
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,440
Yeah, you get to have none vision. Right.

503
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,840
Shows you who's who's good and who's a sinner.

504
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,400
Yeah, well, you're not launching shells.

505
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,080
You're clapping like whatever you see a sinner, you start clapping.

506
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:27,400
And when you feel the gospel rhythm or when you need to teach that

507
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:33,160
there's a symmetry between the music of the Supremes and gospel music.

508
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,520
Right. Well, that was a very like

509
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,840
barred it from the neighbor, got the VHS from the library.

510
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:43,280
Like, oh, I I'm watching a big boy movie.

511
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,800
I'm watching Sister Act, a big boy movie.

512
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,880
I'm watching an adult movie, but it's pretty fun.

513
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,120
Yeah, there's crime in it.

514
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,840
There's people who are implied criminals, right?

515
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,720
I don't know if there's guns, but they like say

516
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,600
that guy does crimes and she's got to stay away from him.

517
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,640
Stuff like that.

518
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:04,960
But I haven't seen it in years, but I have such warm memories of Sister Act.

519
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,040
I didn't really I don't know if that's come up on the show before.

520
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,040
I don't think so.

521
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,240
I think this was just unlocked.

522
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,440
Both both Sister Act or just the first one?

523
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,960
I think both. OK, because with the second one,

524
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,440
you're happy to see all your friends and Galveston sisters again.

525
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,880
Aren't we talking Sister Act three is in their talk of that?

526
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,040
I would imagine there is because that's the kind of thing

527
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,000
that there's always talk about. Yeah, right.

528
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,720
Uh-huh. No, probably.

529
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,880
But this show, animated show, anthology, passing the torch to new generation.

530
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,880
Fifteen people watch it.

531
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,560
Dolores is in it for eight minutes. Yeah.

532
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,760
This special, it is very I got confused.

533
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,120
I watched it and then I wanted to pull it up again.

534
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,120
I kept typing and returned to Neverland.

535
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,520
This is back to Neverland.

536
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:56,320
Return to Neverland is the direct to video Peter Pan's sequel.

537
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,320
Yes, yeah.

538
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:01,520
And I also got extremely concerned after we pulled the trigger on this

539
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,320
that Back to Neverland is also the name of the upcoming sequel

540
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,400
to Leaving Neverland, the very disturbing Michael Jackson.

541
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,640
I was like, what if we like we'll have to pull this

542
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,000
if that's the name of the movie? And it's not.

543
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,520
It's called Leaving Neverland to the phrase Back to Neverland is fine.

544
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,040
Other than it's not something I want to hear.

545
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,840
And other than this fact that it's going to be very easy to confuse all of these names.

546
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,480
No, I think people can keep it together.

547
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,760
Yeah. Back to Return to Leaving.

548
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,840
Yeah. It's all fine.

549
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,280
Some of them are different directions.

550
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,640
I mean, I guess that's technically true. You're right.

551
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,400
Oh, yeah. All set. No, no confusion whatsoever.

552
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,560
No. But this.

553
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,200
Yeah, this this thing is really delightful.

554
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,440
Little backstory of how it came together.

555
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,240
So this a big centerpiece of new

556
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,160
Disney and Dream Studios was an animation tour.

557
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,640
They made the effort to start a new facility down there in Florida.

558
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,840
Forgive me if I'm mixing things up, but I think where the initial things

559
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:06,160
animated in Florida, like those Roger Rabbit shorts, did they like?

560
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,920
That's what I make that like, let's let's have this Florida studio

561
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,640
fill the need and we'll start getting that.

562
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,920
And then features ended up starting to get made there as well.

563
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,680
That's what I recall. That's my one with the where you freeze frame.

564
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,240
And there's inappropriate stuff, big boy stuff. Yeah.

565
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,320
Rigid tools.

566
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,560
Well, I mentioned this to Jane and she's like, oh, is that the one

567
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,040
that would play before the Mulan tour?

568
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,120
And I was like, further, further back.

569
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,680
It probably was still playing then.

570
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,720
Well, but maybe. Yeah.

571
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,680
I don't know when they stopped showing this or if they did.

572
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,200
I'm not totally sure.

573
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,600
There might have been something where you went from this into Mulan.

574
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,640
I don't know.

575
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,440
But so it was kind of being set up and actually prepared.

576
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,280
But I think that the entire

577
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:52,480
experience of the animation tour was set up by a guy named Bob Rogers,

578
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,280
who made, you know, like themed entertainment,

579
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,560
but also things with a little bit more of an educational angle.

580
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,880
I'd run across this name before because he did the

581
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,480
it was for an expo or something, the show Spirit Lodge,

582
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,120
which later became not the not show Mystery Lodge,

583
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,800
which we all know for the Raven, the Raven.

584
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,280
Oh, what a prankster, the Raven.

585
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,720
But that's that's a show.

586
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,120
I think a lot, I think like you ever you guys get to see Mystery Lodge.

587
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,280
I think we saw the first time.

588
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:26,320
Yeah. First time I have never said, is it still on hiatus

589
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,840
because of very specific technology?

590
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,960
I don't know about specific technology.

591
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,840
What have you heard there?

592
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,920
I heard there was some sort of projection or were bold.

593
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,360
It was one of those theme park things where it's like,

594
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,520
well, the manufacturer of this went out of business

595
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,360
and it's hard to get a replacement.

596
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,600
I could definitely see that.

597
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,880
It could also be I maybe over time

598
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,800
you didn't want an employee wearing a weird rubber

599
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,800
Native American mask.

600
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,840
Or it's both.

601
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,520
Well, yes, that or the or the technology was that the weird

602
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,800
the weird old wig with the bald spot,

603
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,080
there was like a hole broke in it

604
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,400
and they couldn't find anybody to fix old weird toxic plastic.

605
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:15,440
It is very much like the Tracy bad guy kind of face, right?

606
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:15,680
Yeah.

607
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:19,040
It still says closed for refurbishment, but that's been since 2020.

608
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,600
It's a bit of a long refurbishment.

609
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,560
Yeah.

610
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,400
I'm beginning to have my doubts.

611
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,680
I would be thrilled to see Mystery Lodge again, though.

612
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:31,000
But I think like, well, everybody was happy with generally

613
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,200
what was being put together for the tour.

614
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,760
It was sort of being done in a little bit too dry of an educational way.

615
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:42,280
And the director, Jerry Rees, who we'll get into

616
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,640
was kind of assessing it in whatever movie they were starting to make.

617
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,440
And he was like, they're focusing too much on stuff like, you know,

618
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:54,000
how many drawings you do per second and not enough on the like emotional pull

619
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,320
and what we could like gives emotional weight to Disney's animation

620
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,480
and and to the storytelling.

621
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,240
It's got as classic Disney stuff.

622
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,920
It's got to be about story.

623
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,440
So this guy, Jerry Rees, kind of revamped it and felt like

624
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,800
was there a more palatable way to quickly teach this process

625
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,800
to kids coming on this tour?

626
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,280
Jerry Rees is one of these names we've said a zillion times

627
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,960
because this guy was the director of everything, everything that like

628
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,440
had an effect in a cool like a like a particularly filmic style

629
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,880
in Disney attractions in 80s, 90s and even beyond was this guy.

630
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,880
Disney MGM Studios alone and early stuff.

631
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,480
The editing story I mentioned with George Lucas.

632
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,840
Tourist from Hell is apparently the name of the Rick Moranis one.

633
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,960
I think that is familiar, though.

634
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,680
Yeah, I can't tell you any specifics about Tourist from Hell.

635
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:48,840
Yeah, again, I'd like to dig into these rock and roller coaster.

636
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,680
He was the director of the the Steven Tyler Lude gesture.

637
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,680
He was the one who didn't catch it.

638
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,080
First movie where I felt like an adult that I saw.

639
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:02,640
Big boy, big boy, big boy stuff, big boy, big boy, rock and rollers.

640
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:08,080
Yeah, this guy, also the director of something that you that was shown

641
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,440
at the end of the animation tour, I think

642
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:16,040
something that it's it's so improbable that we've never done an episode

643
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,840
about this, the short film where

644
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,720
Michael Eisner and Mickey meet and gather the troops to go watch a screening

645
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,520
on the Disney lot, a masterful work.

646
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,760
We've certainly talked about when Michael Eisner is wearing a Mickey watch

647
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,240
and Mickey is wearing a Michael Eisner watch.

648
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,960
But we haven't done 35 minutes about it.

649
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,400
So maybe the watch will have to be its own.

650
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,560
Just the watch joke will be its own thing. Yeah. Yeah.

651
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:44,680
But Jerry Reese, this big feature was Brave Little Toaster.

652
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:48,320
He is credited as director and then he's just,

653
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,280
let's say, as character animation for a million things.

654
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,880
Oh, yes. Kind of like earlier 80s Fox and the Hound.

655
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,960
Yeah. Ereth type stuff.

656
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,480
Pete's Dragon. Oh, OK. OK.

657
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:02,600
Yeah. I mean, he just did such a great job with all of these things.

658
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:06,840
And his website is full of great behind the scenes treasures, especially for this.

659
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:10,960
There's a number of wonderful photos of of putting this short together.

660
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,160
Another cool behind the scenes person person

661
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,680
credit is animation producer, a guy named Mark Kirkland.

662
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,080
Mark Kirkland is the most tenured director of Simpsons episodes.

663
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,520
He did 82. All told,

664
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,120
including, I think, a really primary one is he did.

665
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,320
He directed the one where the Germans take over the power plant

666
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,400
and thus directed the Land of Chocolate, right, which is very impressive,

667
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,400
because that to me is like, oh, it all cracks.

668
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,320
So there were probably weird Homer fantasies before the Land of Chocolate.

669
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,360
But I think without Land of Chocolate, you don't get like the rest of the Simpsons.

670
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,400
You don't get family guy.

671
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,600
You don't get like crazy side tracks to that degree. Right.

672
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,000
That is a wonderful, wonderful sequence.

673
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,680
Yeah. Good point. I never thought about that. I think so.

674
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,960
That opens it up.

675
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,640
Fundamental in like the prime time, adult animation in general.

676
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,360
Second season, third season, third, third season.

677
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,040
Then my Conan Monorail is when when for four,

678
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,400
because the nemoid beaming out also breaks something.

679
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,760
Oh, that's true. Yes, that is like starting to get into you.

680
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,480
Yeah, yeah. They were still nice and selective about it.

681
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,160
Yeah. Yeah. No, cartoon stuff.

682
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,640
All right. Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I?

683
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,800
Um, uh, yes.

684
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,560
Mark Hogan, also supervising director of a show called Housebroken that I wrote on.

685
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,080
I was on one zoom with him and I was like, wait, that's a Simpsons guy.

686
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,280
That's a big land of chocolate guy. That's a big deal.

687
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,200
But he did a great job with this.

688
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,640
So anyway, but the big talent to talk about in this, obviously,

689
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,800
Robin Williams, Walter Cronkite.

690
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,760
This is apparently Jerry Reeves idea specifically.

691
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,680
I think he pitched it almost more as a type.

692
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,840
Like, what if there was somebody with the childlike wonder of Robin Williams

693
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,600
blended with somebody more stern and official like Walter Cronkite?

694
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,840
And then it ended up being the real deal.

695
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:52,320
And this is this is Robin Williams pre genie.

696
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,360
Pre genie and pre hook.

697
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,720
Yeah. Pre genie and pre hook.

698
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,320
But he is seemingly it's at the height of his power.

699
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:05,200
Like he is giving you the 110 percent. Extremely.

700
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,800
And then Walter Cronkite is like a really solid straight man

701
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:14,040
and has some like Uncle Walt characteristics about it.

702
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:17,120
Yes, I always felt that way, too.

703
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,320
And are we just tricked because his name is Walt?

704
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,360
Possibly. Possibly.

705
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,000
Somebody says the word Walt.

706
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,880
But it does make you think like, yes, he has that gravity.

707
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,280
And it is. Yeah.

708
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,640
As much as I don't even want to say what I'm about to say.

709
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,800
Sometimes somebody might throw out the opinion

710
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,800
that Michael Eisner was a little bit stiff on camera,

711
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,160
a little bit stiffer than Walt Disney himself.

712
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,440
Sure. Right. That could be a fringe opinion right there.

713
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:47,800
But the warmth of Walter Cronkite is extremely like 50s

714
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,080
Walt Disneyland show vibe.

715
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:54,240
You know, what with Tinkerbell flying out of his pocket

716
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,760
and him kind of like weaving people now we're over here and now we do this

717
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,440
and here's and like letting in like, I don't know, being a very like

718
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,160
kindly guide through a kind of technical process.

719
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:07,160
And I think it's a good pair because like kids are like,

720
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,760
oh, that's a silly guy, Ron Williams.

721
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,200
And then whether they knew Walter Cronkite or not, he's kind of like

722
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:18,320
news like they have him doing man on the street at the beginning of it.

723
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,200
And then for the parents, it's like, oh, it's more from work.

724
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,800
And the man who told us President Kennedy was dead.

725
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,120
So something for the whole family.

726
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,800
You were excited about Cronkite more than Robin Williams.

727
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,640
Oh, yeah. I was pushing my little brother out of the way.

728
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,440
And I was like, it's America's news man. Yeah.

729
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:39,560
I'm going to do my alt opening joke now from Dallas, Texas.

730
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,840
The Flash, apparently official

731
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,920
Robin Williams cartoonified at 1 p.m.

732
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,960
Central Standard Time, 2 p.m.

733
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,600
Eastern Standard Time, some 38 minutes ago.

734
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,520
It was a little weird in the later in the short film

735
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,280
where he takes his glasses off and he's like crying as Captain Hook shows up.

736
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,440
And he's like, I can't do this again.

737
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,000
Captain Hook, not dead, apparently.

738
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,880
I assumed he was eaten by the eaten by the crocodile.

739
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,840
But we have learned that.

740
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:13,280
Jack Ruby has a wind fire on Mr. Smee.

741
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:18,440
All right, Smee, he did it with a sword.

742
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,840
Just imagine all of the Kennedy stuff happening, but with swords instead. Yeah.

743
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,640
It's a fun steampunk redo of the JFK tale.

744
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,920
That is that's fine. Yeah, that is fine.

745
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,160
I looked into this. I was like, why?

746
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,160
When did he retire?

747
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,520
And Walter Cronkite retired in like 1980 because there was a rule.

748
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:43,280
There's a rule that anchors had to retire at 65.

749
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,560
So he retired in 1980.

750
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,080
So that's why I've been like, why was he doing this?

751
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,000
Oh, I guess he was retired by then.

752
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,240
Me just doing Rolodex of every horrible politician and Supreme Court justice.

753
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,880
Like, oh, right, right. Who would be gone?

754
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:02,080
So you're saying there was a time when people were supposed to leave their job

755
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,600
because they weren't at the peak mental condition.

756
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,680
Yeah. Yeah. Interesting.

757
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,320
And that time was before we were born.

758
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,160
Right. When life expectancy was not as good.

759
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,520
So well, Reagan changed it all is what he did.

760
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,760
He proved that being a strange,

761
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,640
doddering shadow of your former self. Yeah.

762
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,240
No problem. A bunch of a bunch of weirdos push agenda through is what we want.

763
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,840
Yeah. Desired.

764
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:31,520
I love seeing the opposition party, the Democratic Party, every now and then.

765
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:35,280
We allowed a different dying man who's like, oh,

766
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,880
he's one of the most senior Congress party somebody just died on the job.

767
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,200
Who was it a couple of weeks ago?

768
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,640
I forget. You know what I'm talking about?

769
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,680
There was a was it a state rep or there was somebody who they were like,

770
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,680
he was like, you know, just maybe newly elected and then passed away.

771
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,880
Maybe I have this wrong, but I'm pretty sure when Pelosi and all of them

772
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,520
did that thing where they took a knee, it's incredible.

773
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,400
They all made it back up.

774
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,960
Very true. Yeah.

775
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,640
It's improbable that like 65 percent of them didn't just stay on the ground

776
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,400
forever. That's a very good point.

777
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,040
Anyway, hey, let's not go there. This is fun. This is 1989.

778
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,920
Oh, well, now that's when all the bad stuff started, started happening.

779
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,040
Flashes me back to Reagan, you see. But we didn't know that.

780
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,720
We were wide eyed kids taking an animation tour.

781
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,600
And absolutely, everybody's everybody's so charming.

782
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,120
The Robin Williams aspect that you bring up.

783
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,800
This is a very strange thing because I did this for the first time,

784
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,880
I think, in 1992.

785
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,920
And this was post Aladdin was very soon after Aladdin.

786
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,200
And I think I just thought, oh, of course, Robin Williams,

787
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,280
Disney cartoon voice makes all the sense in the world.

788
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:45,840
But apparently for Jerry Rees, it was a little bit of a sell.

789
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,880
And some of this info, by the way, I'm going to say coming from a great article

790
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:53,280
on Cartoon Research Dotcom written by the late Jim Corkus,

791
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,440
a great Disney and theme park historian.

792
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,600
So if I ever start quoting something word for word,

793
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,200
credit to that site and to Jim Corkus.

794
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,800
This is from Jerry Rees.

795
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,040
Casting Robin was considered a huge risk because he was considered

796
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:10,000
an adult comedian who grabbed his crotch when he performed.

797
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,080
Well, like Michael Jackson.

798
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,680
Yes. Neverland connection here.

799
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,080
But that's well, and they already done Captain EO by that point.

800
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,920
So they proved that they were open to crotch grabbers.

801
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,200
Yeah. Associated with the word Neverland.

802
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,320
So why why wouldn't this be a problem?

803
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,760
But Rees couldn't point didn't point to that precedent.

804
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,680
He instead pointed out Cliff Edwards, who had done the voice of Jiminy

805
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,080
Cricket, was an adult nightclub entertainer.

806
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,640
But Walt still picked him to get that edge.

807
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:45,720
I don't think I realized that, that the voice of Jiminy Cricket was edgy.

808
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,840
He was a real edgelord of the 19.

809
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,760
He was a ukulele edgelord. Wow.

810
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,920
Yeah, I did not know that.

811
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,720
Yeah, we're going to have to analyze that act, I think.

812
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:02,600
Yeah, we'll go find the forbidden Red Fox style tapes of Cliff Edwards.

813
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,960
Buddy Buddy Hackett style bodyness.

814
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:13,440
I yeah, Shabupi was banned in some states when the music band movie was released.

815
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:18,880
Yeah. Yeah, I'd be curious what that means.

816
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,720
Two House Democrats have died in office in the last month.

817
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,680
I was going to say, since we started recording, we started recording.

818
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,120
My God. And you mean literally in, were they like in the middle of a speech?

819
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,640
Yeah, I don't know where.

820
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,400
Yeah, I don't know what part of the process it was, but they were in.

821
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,840
I don't know what office they were in, but they were serving.

822
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,680
They were holding office.

823
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,680
That's all I know.

824
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,440
They're not holding space. They were holding office.

825
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,960
Holding space is what young people do.

826
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,440
Holding office is what ancient people do.

827
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:52,440
Nancy Pelosi holding Richie Torres' finger, single finger.

828
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,840
The person I was thinking about was there.

829
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:01,760
There was a very old man who caught a seat on like the oversight board

830
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,200
that did not go to AOC.

831
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:08,920
And he was very old, tenured man who is fighting cancer.

832
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,000
And he's in his late seventies.

833
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,600
Yes, yes. And they did not pick the person.

834
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,600
Pick the younger person.

835
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,440
Yeah, yeah. Yes.

836
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,320
Yes, there you go.

837
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,520
Good stuff. Good plan.

838
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,480
Who needs a bench in any field?

839
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,440
Well, and everyone else is out on a book tour.

840
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,960
They're all doing book tours, right?

841
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,800
The only older gentleman I would endorse for the next

842
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,520
Democratic president presidential ticket, Michael Eisner.

843
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,760
I was hoping I was going to say that if it wasn't what you said.

844
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,000
I knew it wasn't going to be a serious thing.

845
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,520
You were saying, although it wasn't very three.

846
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:46,440
Yeah, he's all compared to these and like me or me having not seen

847
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,960
any footage of him in the last three years or so easily

848
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,080
better shape than any of these people.

849
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:55,400
I check footage of Michael Eisner every couple of weeks,

850
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:59,080
maybe every six weeks via a drone camera that you send by his beach house.

851
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,920
I do a little Malibu complex.

852
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,840
I do a little YouTube search and I think there's an interview

853
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:09,560
from like two years ago and he's at a football match.

854
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,800
Yeah. And I think that's the most recent one.

855
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,400
But I there isn't a newer one.

856
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,240
I'm I want a newer one.

857
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,760
Yeah. But we haven't seen it.

858
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,280
So I'll keep checking.

859
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,200
Yes. Yes.

860
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,200
Need to know, because we have a lot of Eisner plans as we just brought up

861
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,800
a new one today for so many Eisner plans.

862
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,360
And we don't want this to be we don't want to be in PTR curse territory.

863
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,200
Did he sell his house? Do we know that?

864
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,920
That I'm not sure. Yeah, we don't know if he was on the market,

865
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,200
but it was very expensive.

866
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,680
I did not buy it.

867
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:41,440
I didn't buy the house premium trading card vending machine in Burbank.

868
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,440
And Steve, he goes like, hello, thank you for buying some baseball cards.

869
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,320
You know, there are there is a Michael Eisner rising in the world of politics.

870
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,360
That's incumbent commissioner Michael Eisner,

871
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:59,880
who just won a seat on the Tarpen Springs City Commission

872
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,240
just one week ago as we recorded.

873
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,480
I don't know what city that's in.

874
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,200
What's what where what am I looking at?

875
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,400
Pasco, Hernando, North Pinellas.

876
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:13,480
I don't know what what state what I want to know about this

877
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,640
because we got to talk about this Michael Eisner, too.

878
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,520
Doesn't he look nice? Hey, I like this Michael Eisner. Nice.

879
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,960
Yeah, I got it.

880
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:23,880
OK, I got an Eisner interview here from June 9th, 2023.

881
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,960
Like at CNBC.

882
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,480
It's it's some football thing.

883
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,200
He's here. He is.

884
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,120
This is a year and almost two years ago at this point.

885
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,840
Mm hmm. He looks all right. He looks pretty good football.

886
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,320
They mean soccer. I am.

887
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,720
I said football match, which I feel like conveyed it.

888
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,640
But maybe I mismatch.

889
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:43,360
OK, does they own partial ownership of one of the L.A.

890
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,120
football clubs?

891
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:48,240
All I know about it is that you're supposed to call it football.

892
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,040
That's the only thing I know about it.

893
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,080
You're supposed to make a really big deal.

894
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,640
I made a meal, a little meal out of it.

895
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,760
So that's all I know.

896
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,320
Other than that, I don't know who owns what.

897
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,120
I know he's involved. Yeah.

898
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,600
And now I know Tarpen Springs is in Florida.

899
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:03,320
So we could go to Florida next time we're in Florida.

900
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,160
We could meet this guy. Sure.

901
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:09,480
I would I it would it'd be fun, but would also really disappoint

902
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,160
people if we go the Michael Eisner interview and then it's

903
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,840
Tarpen Springs City Commissioner Michael Eisner.

904
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,960
Terrifying, terrifying to look up.

905
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:22,960
Michael Eisner, Florida politician positions.

906
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,640
Where does he stand on?

907
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:30,400
Oh, no, I have no desire to know that's that's none of our business.

908
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,200
Anyways, back on track.

909
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:38,160
Robin Williams doing this, I think, like is the first step

910
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,320
in sort of bringing him into the world of Disney animation.

911
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,560
It makes all the sense in the world.

912
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:47,200
He's always done cartoon voices, and it does, in fact, predate Aladdin.

913
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,600
I don't know if this is too much of like the end of the story thing, but why not?

914
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:56,880
In the first scene of this movie, he is

915
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,520
he's basically met as a tourist,

916
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,000
not even really identified as the movie star Robin Williams.

917
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:03,680
It's right.

918
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,120
Walter Crockett just says, we're going to take a tour

919
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,440
of animation, animation works you there.

920
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:12,560
And Robin Williams turns around and he is wearing a yellow Hawaiian shirt,

921
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:16,680
a goofy hat, big clunky camera, shorts and sandals.

922
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,880
This is his uniform.

923
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,720
This all goes so great.

924
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:25,200
And everybody gets so excited about Robin Williams being a Disney voice

925
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,480
that Jerry Reese's friends, Musker and Clements say

926
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,800
he might be great for Aladdin.

927
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,520
And I don't know if you know, and a little known fact,

928
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,760
he became the voice of the genie in.

929
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,040
OK, yeah.

930
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,480
I don't know if you know who that was.

931
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,560
I thought all the impressions were the people.

932
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,560
I didn't realize how did they do this?

933
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,400
They had to get Schwarzenegger, they had to get Nicholson's.

934
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,120
These are expensive people.

935
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:52,920
I turn it off after the first time and then the Ralph is eaten

936
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,960
because I am a scaredy cat.

937
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,800
It was very curious.

938
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,680
We put it on for my son the other day and he requested it to come off

939
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,320
when the genie came on.

940
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,240
So what are you doing now?

941
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,720
Yeah, you want to do you want to watch just a guy getting swallowed

942
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:10,400
by a cave and not the fun guy who does voices?

943
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,960
We'll see how round two of Aladdin viewing goes.

944
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:18,400
But anyway, the end of that story to nod to what gave them the idea

945
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,120
to cast Robin Williams at the end of Aladdin.

946
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,240
The genie is wearing a yellow Hawaiian shirt, a goofy hat,

947
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,560
a big, clunky camera, that is this.

948
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,960
And that is a nod to back to Neverland that inspired this whole thing.

949
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:35,640
There is some like self-deprecating stuff

950
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,080
that I feel like universal does it a lot more.

951
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,800
It kind of became a trademark.

952
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:45,920
But like he, in addition to being dressed like a stereotypical

953
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,440
tourist, at some point he is Mickey Mouse.

954
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,000
And he says, oh, I'm a corporate mascot.

955
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,520
Like, yes, that I feel like, yeah, that's fun.

956
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:59,200
People like it when the companies like tease themselves a little thousand percent.

957
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,200
That would destroy every viewing of this.

958
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:05,040
I remember this from being a child that that would kill.

959
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:05,920
I would kill with the parents.

960
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,240
I think it would kill with the kids, too.

961
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,560
And it's the kind of thing they would never do today.

962
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,480
How that came about.

963
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,760
There were storyboards made for that sequence specifically,

964
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,880
because that's the section where like now we learned about how voices work.

965
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:23,160
And now we're going to see sketches, like precolored sketches of animation.

966
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,000
And he's turning into this character and turning into that character.

967
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,280
And he turns into seven dwarves.

968
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,480
And then he turns into Mickey and he says, I'm a corporate symbol.

969
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:35,360
That was on that was written on storyboards done by a guy named Steve Moore.

970
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,760
That was just like that wasn't even the intended line.

971
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,640
It was just to be fun to make a Mickey.

972
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,120
And that was a little joke just for himself that the storyboard artists made.

973
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,960
But this is being shown to Robin.

974
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,920
And he said, that's great. We got to do that. I'm doing it.

975
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,880
And I think everybody went, oh, you can't actually do that.

976
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,680
And he's Robin Williams. He's going to do what he wants to do.

977
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:56,920
He's right, because that's like the hardest, funniest joke involved

978
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,160
out of a lot of theme park attractions, I would say.

979
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:03,360
And it is like a perfect proof of concept

980
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:07,440
for like Genie transforming into anything and everything.

981
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:12,400
It is. I mean, it's so obvious, the one to there that like, oh, I see.

982
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:16,840
Like utilizing his capacity to switch between a zillion voices.

983
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:20,600
Yeah, it's it's it's a kind of a rare little

984
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:25,320
example of, you know, these little theme park videos

985
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,200
that not everybody regards as important, but we do.

986
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,200
But this is like literally it becomes the setup to Aladdin.

987
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:36,560
It's like a promotion from theme park pre-show video to feature film.

988
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:37,800
And what a brilliant one.

989
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,920
It's very important, really.

990
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:44,200
Yes, like it was that leads to the genie, like the primary

991
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:48,600
character of our childhoods, one of the best animated characters of all time.

992
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,280
Certainly, yeah, the biggest non princess character

993
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:55,440
of those big four movies, I think, right?

994
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,720
Has to be, has to be.

995
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:00,520
And I think a big piece in like getting the boys in, you know?

996
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,920
I mean, they weren't really struggling with that because there was like, oh, yeah.

997
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:04,560
You know what I mean?

998
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:08,080
Like I think there was still a thing of Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast

999
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,320
or four girls in broad strokes.

1000
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:13,320
Yeah, yeah. But Aladdin was definitely the boy one

1001
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,760
because it's got chasing and action and swords.

1002
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,920
Big boy stuff. A lot of swords.

1003
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,520
And there are more swords in Aladdin

1004
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:25,640
video games and promotional material than in the actual movie, I feel like.

1005
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,800
Yeah, the video games. Yeah, for sure.

1006
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,840
Yes, it was a primary facet of that video game.

1007
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:33,440
Like swinging it around, like just in a house,

1008
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:37,400
my house growing up, so many plastic swords.

1009
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:41,800
Like any time we went to like Disney on ice or a theme park,

1010
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,440
like, well, I don't have that kind of light up sword.

1011
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,800
My parents are like, yeah, it's cheaper than a t-shirt.

1012
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,480
You know, like you didn't have swords.

1013
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:57,200
And then immediately my brother and I just wacky each other with plastic swords.

1014
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,600
It's like, OK, well, just avoid the head and face.

1015
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:04,120
My daughter, my daughter has a foam sword from her Halloween costume

1016
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,960
that she still will run around and play pirate.

1017
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:08,720
She was a pirate.

1018
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,680
So she will run around and be like, I'm going to steal your treasure.

1019
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,880
And then she'll wave her sword around.

1020
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:14,800
And I'm like, I don't know where she got.

1021
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,160
I don't know what pirate stuff she's been watching.

1022
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,040
I'm not sure where she got it.

1023
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,760
And sneaking pirate material, like she got the treasure

1024
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,640
came into play at a certain point.

1025
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,240
So she steals our treasure now.

1026
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,640
You know what I'm really proud of?

1027
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,800
Here's my kid sort of thing is that we've been playing.

1028
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:33,120
So his sword lately has been just a bunch of markers stuck together,

1029
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,720
like at the top, like you can extend that into five.

1030
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,600
We've been bashing markers all stuck together until they break,

1031
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,480
which is immediately.

1032
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,520
But the one because I've been trying to show him just like really silly

1033
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,640
physical things that's been making him laugh a lot.

1034
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,120
And let me I'll just cut cut to the chase, which is him saying,

1035
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:54,480
putting a sword together and then saying, I want to play body moving,

1036
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:58,520
body moving, referring to the Beastie Boys music video

1037
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,400
in which there's a decapitation,

1038
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,920
which is, I guess, a little too bloody for me to show my four year old.

1039
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:07,400
But it's a it's such a silly, funny MCA.

1040
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,760
And then he gets his head back on almost immediately.

1041
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,880
But it like it made it killed with it.

1042
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,720
It made him laugh so hard.

1043
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:16,880
They like this, this like funny, hokey sword fighting scene

1044
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,880
where MCA's head comes clean off.

1045
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,880
And then later they're in a plane and they leave a hatch of the plane open

1046
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:24,600
and a bird comes in and electrocutes the plane and the plane blows up.

1047
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,840
It's like, I think these are primary pieces of my sense of humor.

1048
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,720
And I think they're going to kill with my son.

1049
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:33,680
And they did. And now he says, now we'll play swords and he'll say,

1050
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,960
body moving, body move.

1051
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,400
All right.

1052
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,200
That's good, which I'm very excited about.

1053
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,560
But it also I feel like I should not be a hypocrite

1054
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,680
because this is also 25 year old music.

1055
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:47,640
And I should say, Mike, if you want to play your daughter, Third Eye Blinds,

1056
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,400
I do play your OK.

1057
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,520
All right. Well, don't feel don't have any weird feelings about it.

1058
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,640
I'll I'll do one more one more quick one.

1059
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:59,160
She she really laughs when the chorus the boys are back in town plays.

1060
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,200
My daughter laughs at the boys.

1061
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,920
She just and then she starts going, the boys are back in town.

1062
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,920
And then she'll start putting the boys are back in.

1063
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,240
And then she'll say like something like mommy diapers.

1064
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:11,400
She'll like put bananas and cackle and cackle.

1065
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:14,320
And then she really that's she just for whatever reason,

1066
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:15,720
the boys are back in town.

1067
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:16,760
She really thinks that's funny.

1068
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,640
Wow. Wow. Yeah, it's nice.

1069
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,400
Yeah. You don't appreciate the little thing.

1070
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,960
We've we've we've liked the song, but we forget that it's funny.

1071
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,040
We forget how funny boys are back in town.

1072
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:28,840
Boys are back in town is like in Lizzie.

1073
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:34,440
There's that great vice article by Tim's writer, Tim Faust,

1074
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:38,920
about how he played like in one of those digital jukeboxes.

1075
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:43,560
He set it up to play the boys are back in town.

1076
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,080
I think it was like 15 times. Oh, yeah.

1077
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,360
And then he went back up to feed it again.

1078
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:52,240
And a guy was like, you're not putting on the boys are back in town, are you?

1079
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,160
And he went, no, of course not.

1080
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,320
And of course, you put the boys are back in town.

1081
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,160
They go on again.

1082
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,320
Yeah. Any song.

1083
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,520
I would like that bunch of times in a row.

1084
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,160
But anyway, yeah, this sequence.

1085
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,280
Yeah, very important.

1086
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,960
He also did what he ended up doing on Aladdin,

1087
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:13,200
which is like doing way too much material and more than they could use.

1088
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,480
And, you know, Jerry Rees said that could have been a 10 minute

1089
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,080
sequence in and of itself, and they had to be brutal and only

1090
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,360
do the best of the best.

1091
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:23,320
He's wearing a Google.

1092
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:26,040
Robin Williams wearing that goofy hat, which I own still.

1093
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,840
I found it a couple of weeks ago.

1094
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:28,840
Big old teeth in the front.

1095
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,040
Yeah, with the teeth in the front.

1096
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:33,240
And there's a lot of pictures of me wearing that at Disney World around this time.

1097
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,080
I was a Donald heck.

1098
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:36,920
I like a big plastic Donald Bill.

1099
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,160
Oh, you had. So you had that one?

1100
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:38,840
Yeah. Yeah.

1101
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:41,200
Did you have a character that other than the Mickey ears?

1102
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,360
I don't know that I did.

1103
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:44,120
Or even like years.

1104
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:47,480
No, I didn't get Mickey ears until I was like 26.

1105
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:48,400
Oh, OK.

1106
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,920
I think I went on my birthday and someone bought me.

1107
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,040
Sure. Yeah.

1108
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,960
The ones with your name stitched.

1109
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,840
You can get your name. Yes.

1110
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,400
Yes. Yes. That's nice.

1111
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,880
But yeah, goofy Mickey Mickey Mickey Mickey ears.

1112
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,280
While fun are not really practical to wear, there's really nothing

1113
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,640
keeping that on your head.

1114
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:08,800
It is in a place with a lot of rides that easily blow hats.

1115
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,320
That's a difficult thing.

1116
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,840
I got to get a chin strap to go with it.

1117
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,800
Definitely. Yes.

1118
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,480
Yeah, that's really the only way I believe.

1119
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:16,480
You know what I had?

1120
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:21,520
I think I had a big bad wolf hat, the Busch Gardens Williamsburg

1121
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,760
roller coaster, and it was a cap.

1122
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:27,920
And then it had this safari flap on the back

1123
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:33,000
because I think my my mother was terrified of me getting a sunburn on my neck.

1124
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,360
So you had a you had a neck.

1125
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,840
I had a neck safari flap style.

1126
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:42,200
The safari like the I think you should leave like the hat.

1127
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:46,120
The I'm calling it safari flap because that's what they call it.

1128
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,560
You didn't just put on sunscreen.

1129
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,080
Oh, we slathered on sunscreen.

1130
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:52,680
Oh, OK. So really just a double double protection.

1131
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:54,120
Yeah, exactly.

1132
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,360
I burned occasionally.

1133
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:58,200
My brother was getting sunburns all the time.

1134
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,920
Like, I don't know what it was.

1135
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,240
He was just wasn't enough.

1136
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,960
Very fair skin. Yeah.

1137
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:06,440
Should have done a full beekeeper uniform. Yeah.

1138
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:10,080
Yeah. But I would go to the beach and put sunscreen on.

1139
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,600
We first got there and I would never reapply it.

1140
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,200
And I really burned.

1141
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,640
Oh, but my brother burned left and right.

1142
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,560
So it seemed like you didn't need that extra layer.

1143
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,600
Yeah. Just in case.

1144
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:23,080
But it was pretty cool graphics.

1145
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:26,520
There was a wolf of the roller coaster cars.

1146
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,680
And it was a cool fashion thing.

1147
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,720
It was in a protection thing. Yeah, it wasn't.

1148
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:33,000
I'm not. You just walk up to people and say,

1149
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:35,720
I'm not wearing this flap because my mommy made me.

1150
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,200
I'm wearing it because it's cool.

1151
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:42,240
Oh, please, Scott. I was be the child to go like, my mom bought me this hat,

1152
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:47,080
like unprovoked to shop keeps, like to shop keeps shop,

1153
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,440
which you would call them say their shop keep. Hello, shop keep.

1154
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,560
Do you have change for a penny for a thing?

1155
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,760
What is this kid talking about?

1156
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,520
That hasn't been the currency in this country, well, ever, frankly.

1157
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,600
Anyways, another part of putting this together is that they

1158
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:10,320
before they reached out to actual Robin and Cronkite,

1159
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:15,000
they brought in Cory Burton, voice of the Disneyland tram and a zillion things.

1160
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,920
One of the voices who does like, all right, this this actor

1161
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,120
who did all the voices in the 50s, he's the guy who does it today,

1162
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,760
including Captain Hook.

1163
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,440
Well, I think it's Hans Conrad.

1164
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,320
I think I'm not making that up.

1165
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:29,960
But yeah, he did a scratch track and imitated both Robin and Cronkite.

1166
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:32,720
Eisner thought it really was both of them

1167
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:36,280
so much so that, all right, well, it proved the effectiveness

1168
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:37,440
of these dynamics together.

1169
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:41,200
Let's get the real people and let's get Cory Burton to be Captain Hook.

1170
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:43,120
Would love to hear that.

1171
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:46,040
Would love to hear of how he got fooled.

1172
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,800
Maybe it was perfect.

1173
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,600
Now, why didn't you film them?

1174
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,640
If you were going to bring them in, you should have shot them with cameras, too.

1175
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:53,200
That was a waste of time.

1176
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:56,440
He was approving like seven other different of soon to be failed

1177
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:57,800
ventures in the middle of it.

1178
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:00,640
So maybe he was just distracted.

1179
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,800
I'm right. I got to rubber stamp the ESPN ride.

1180
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,240
Disney trampoline park.

1181
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,880
I'm working on that right now.

1182
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,440
Proving designs for the Craig Kilborn walk around character.

1183
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,560
Disney Cement Company.

1184
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:14,560
We're going to own all the cement America.

1185
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:15,440
Different colored cement.

1186
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,560
Think about it. Everywhere you walk, what's below you? Cement.

1187
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:19,320
Why isn't it Disney Cement?

1188
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,360
Could be.

1189
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,760
Anyway, I don't know how to like go.

1190
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:26,240
I mean, that's a lot of like how the thing came together.

1191
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,360
We're sort of starting to get into it in the beginning.

1192
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,080
And like, you know, we're like we're outside the studio.

1193
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:35,600
Right. And we're a Cronkite wants to bring in somebody to show them

1194
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,200
the process finds Robin Williams.

1195
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:42,600
One thing that I always wondered about this was how did they film this thing?

1196
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:45,840
If the park wasn't open yet, were there enough facilities

1197
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,680
that they could dress a small part of it?

1198
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:50,560
Did they have to film this really close to the opening?

1199
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:52,240
But they also had to animate it.

1200
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:53,240
So that doesn't make sense.

1201
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:57,080
Like, there's no way this thing could have been shot or they did just animation

1202
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:59,520
and then film the rest like four days before the park open.

1203
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:00,640
That doesn't make sense.

1204
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,600
And I realize this is a fake Disney MGM studios you're looking at.

1205
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:08,080
They film this at Raleigh Studios, which is across from Paramount.

1206
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:11,200
And there is an earful tower in the background.

1207
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:15,040
But that was like a large scale, maybe like a forest perspective thing.

1208
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,600
Or they only built one side of it or something.

1209
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:22,040
Or they put it on top of a roof so they don't have to build the entire water tower.

1210
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:25,480
But anyway, that's just one of those little things that because I feel like

1211
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,800
I clocked that when I was a kid.

1212
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,320
Like, now, how did they film this?

1213
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:31,000
Yeah, I was I already was going into like the technical things

1214
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:32,960
because I took you right out of it.

1215
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:33,800
Yeah, complete. Yeah.

1216
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:36,880
Well, that's a sign I needed to like make videos and stuff,

1217
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:37,880
because I was never in it.

1218
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:40,520
I was never I was always picking apart the behind the scenes,

1219
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,120
especially from this tour on.

1220
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,440
I mean, this had a huge.

1221
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:44,880
Oh, my God, this animation tour.

1222
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:48,200
Like, like I would the two the tour groups would pass and lap me

1223
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,320
and I would like stay back with.

1224
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:50,840
I recall that happening to us.

1225
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:51,880
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1226
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:53,720
Because I wanted to be an animator.

1227
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:57,320
I think I thought that too before I realized that's an insanely hard thing to do.

1228
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:59,880
Yep. I want to be a comic book artist or an animator.

1229
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:02,160
And then I was like, holy shit, this is hard.

1230
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:03,120
Yeah. Yeah.

1231
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,200
The hand drawn animation.

1232
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,440
One of the hardest things like a certain point, it's just like, I'll never.

1233
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:11,880
Now, maybe if I was I didn't think I could get better.

1234
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,680
Also, that was a problem.

1235
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,240
I was like, well, that's as good as I'm getting.

1236
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:16,360
I know as a child.

1237
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,320
This is not going anywhere.

1238
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,640
Yeah. And no, no one.

1239
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:19,640
I guess I never expressed that.

1240
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:22,040
No one ever was like, you know, you're little still.

1241
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,520
You know, you're not.

1242
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:24,400
You can dream.

1243
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,960
Yeah. You can go to advanced education to learn how to really do.

1244
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,280
Yeah. Yeah. I didn't know.

1245
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:34,200
You desire to be the least paying occupation and the second least paying.

1246
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:38,880
Yeah. No, I I feel like every few months now,

1247
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:43,560
there is like a news story about like a big Marvel comics artist.

1248
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:49,840
Will shit on the company on like paying low rates or being behind on royalties.

1249
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:54,240
And then like five or six other artists will be like, yeah, I'm right there with you.

1250
00:59:54,680 --> 01:00:00,120
And it's just like these great, wonderful artists just getting screwed left and right.

1251
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:03,160
Yeah. Well, luckily, Mike figured out some solid careers.

1252
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:06,840
Actor, pitcher of projects in Hollywood and podcast.

1253
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:09,320
Yeah. Three extremely dependable.

1254
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:11,440
It was easy. All of them are easy.

1255
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,240
You are not lucrative.

1256
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:17,360
You're not going to believe which is most dependable.

1257
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:20,840
The answer may surprise you. Yeah, yeah, really.

1258
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:24,360
OK, so, yeah, we get into it.

1259
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:27,200
Fake Disney. I also just liked it because I thought the same thing about

1260
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,000
Muppet Vision 3D.

1261
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,480
I was always like when the wall gets broken at the end

1262
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:36,720
and Kermit comes up on the fire ladder, I was like, what's back there?

1263
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:38,960
Did they go right there?

1264
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,480
But it also doesn't make sense that they would have done the entire product.

1265
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:44,560
So what you're seeing there, they they filmed

1266
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:48,920
Muppet Vision 3D at the Disney lot.

1267
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:52,040
And then I think that is some like old like town square kind of sets

1268
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:56,520
elsewhere on the lot that they dressed to look like a little bit theme parky.

1269
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:58,440
It's a little hazy.

1270
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:01,600
I feel like there's a lot in the background to kind of like.

1271
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:03,680
So you don't focus on anything.

1272
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:06,360
And then there's just a million of the Mickey Balloons.

1273
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:08,680
Mickey Balloons is what that's a perfect.

1274
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:12,200
Yeah, yeah, some some like no nonsense guy on set for sure.

1275
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:13,760
It's like just put Mickey Balloon, Mickey Balloons up.

1276
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,000
That'll do it. That'll sell it.

1277
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,400
This is the real magic of the movies is trickery.

1278
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,880
That's what we all learned at Disney MGM, it's all tricks.

1279
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:23,680
You see, we learned everything.

1280
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:27,120
It really sobered us up at, you know, seven to nine years old.

1281
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:28,480
Yeah, it's all fake.

1282
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:33,040
You mean sadly eating your meatloaf at 50s primetime diner?

1283
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,760
And like, I don't.

1284
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,560
Is there any like that's impressive?

1285
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:37,160
That's insane.

1286
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,680
There's no way Jason was ever sad eating meatloaf at 50s

1287
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,080
primetime cafe.

1288
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:44,920
Not one of my go tos was until a Boston chicken.

1289
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:48,680
Later, Boston Market opened up down the road from my house.

1290
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:52,080
The only reason I'm not going to ask you further about that is that this is

1291
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:53,960
that's going to take us to another 20 minutes.

1292
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,200
Yeah, you know, I got I got takes on it.

1293
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:59,360
It was next to the little league field where we play baseball.

1294
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:00,920
That's another 20 right there.

1295
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:02,320
Next to the little league field.

1296
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:05,960
These days at Hollywood studios, can you learn how shifting gears is made?

1297
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:07,880
Is there anything about shifting gears?

1298
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:09,280
Tim Allen's ABC sitcom?

1299
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:10,360
I don't think so.

1300
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:11,880
And that's a crime.

1301
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:14,360
That's what I believe is missing from Hollywood studios.

1302
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:16,760
There should be some new stuff.

1303
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:18,640
Is Doctor Odyssey ABC?

1304
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:19,560
It is on ABC.

1305
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:22,960
So there should be Doctor Odyssey learning how to make Doctor Odyssey

1306
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:25,280
and learning about the magic of TV.

1307
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:29,560
If any movie studio learn about attractions remain, it is learning about

1308
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:32,800
how to make things that stopped being made 37 years ago.

1309
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:33,760
Right.

1310
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:35,080
That is what that is.

1311
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:36,360
What these are now.

1312
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:38,160
But that's the thing. It was so current.

1313
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:42,240
It was so vibrant watching this as they are cresting the hill.

1314
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:46,400
Like this comes out in 89 Little Mermaid is like we're about to get

1315
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:47,760
into second golden age.

1316
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:51,080
So then you're seeing it in the subsequent years and we're in second golden age.

1317
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:53,480
And everybody wants to know how these things are made.

1318
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:55,280
Yeah, like like truly was magic.

1319
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:57,040
And the fact that they got him in before Aladdin.

1320
01:02:57,040 --> 01:03:00,840
So by the time Aladdin comes out, like, oh, my God, it's like a little extra Aladdin.

1321
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:02,920
It's more Robin Williams transforming.

1322
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:04,040
It's it's incredible.

1323
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,680
This thing was so fun.

1324
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:07,480
Do you want to just like call out moments?

1325
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:09,680
I don't think we have to like step by step it.

1326
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:12,640
But basically Tinkerbell.

1327
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:16,880
Well, one thing you get is a real like here's a joke for the parents is the

1328
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:20,480
like, you know, Cronkite asks, what's your favorite animated film?

1329
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,160
Or what animated film would you want to be in?

1330
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:25,520
And he does this joke about, well, I've always found Fantasia to be a bit

1331
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:28,120
Fellini ask, I don't know.

1332
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:29,240
I didn't get that then.

1333
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:31,920
It's a really good proof that like you just put in some word

1334
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:34,400
that like reads as a grown up thing.

1335
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:38,280
And it doesn't matter that a you should respect intelligence.

1336
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:39,840
Like you pull the room.

1337
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:41,840
No, no kids would know who Fellini is.

1338
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:43,440
Maybe little Jason.

1339
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:46,200
But besides that, I barely get the reference now.

1340
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:48,280
And I've watched a good amount of Fellini movies.

1341
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:51,360
I don't. Yeah, I don't necessarily understand why Fantasia in particular is

1342
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,960
Fellini ask.

1343
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,640
But I like the I like the snooty voice.

1344
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:58,240
Yeah, the joke works with the snooty voice and the reference.

1345
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:59,160
That's really great.

1346
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,240
But he sneaks that in and then it becomes about

1347
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:06,080
Peter Pan and the magic of Peter Pan and like, oh, getting to be in that world.

1348
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:08,320
And then I'm glad he said

1349
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:12,320
Peter Pan, because Tinkerbell happened to be in Walter Cronkite's pocket.

1350
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:15,080
So if he'd said another movie would have been screwed.

1351
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:17,160
Uh huh. Walter Cronkite.

1352
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,120
Sorry. No, no, no.

1353
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:22,200
Walter Cronkite picking up a cartoon, particularly I like.

1354
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:23,800
And that feels very Walt Disney.

1355
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:24,720
Yeah, sure. Yes.

1356
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:28,200
Having to like mind the space of the little that they made him

1357
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,120
like figure out cartoon space.

1358
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:33,000
They made him do a little bit of mocap avatar acting.

1359
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:35,400
He looks like Captain Kangaroo, too, to me.

1360
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:38,000
He does. Like very like kid show host.

1361
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,560
He's part Captain Kangaroo, part Walt.

1362
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:41,800
Of course, we like him.

1363
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:45,360
Yeah, like this is this in particular, like this image here.

1364
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:47,400
That's great. Well, you're showing that he's holding up

1365
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:50,840
not Tinkerbell, but holding up little lost boy Robin.

1366
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:53,800
Yeah, which is, I guess, a good way to transition into, you know,

1367
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:55,240
we go into this room.

1368
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:57,600
This is how Jerry reason wants to hammer home

1369
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:59,760
that animation is about stories.

1370
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,320
How better to do that than a room with giant books?

1371
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:04,600
And that should that which really just illustrates

1372
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,520
like how all animation starts with

1373
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:11,520
stealing the story of a book that's existed for a long time.

1374
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:13,960
That's the beginning of Disney innovation.

1375
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:17,120
That is now I felt like little Scott at that moment

1376
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:20,760
because I kept pausing and going like that green screen

1377
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:23,680
or just plywood they painted to look like big books.

1378
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:26,080
That's all. You know, I think the VHS quality

1379
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:28,000
that you're going to watch it in on YouTube masks that.

1380
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,320
But yeah, those are big old books.

1381
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:30,400
And that's your show.

1382
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:33,840
You the behind the scenes photos show that some of which are on

1383
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:37,400
Jerry Rees dot com and some of which are on the IMDb of the

1384
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:40,320
of this particular movie.

1385
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:42,240
So that's how a story is made.

1386
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:44,360
And then we go to the sound studio.

1387
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:47,800
Oh, wait is I think I skipped the storyboard step

1388
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:51,080
where the story is laid out and Robin doesn't really have any say in it.

1389
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:52,760
The story already exists.

1390
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:55,080
It's a story about a new lost boy

1391
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:58,960
who is planted on Captain Hook's ship alone

1392
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:02,280
without the help of anyone else in the Peter Pan of hers.

1393
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:06,640
This poor boy doesn't seem to know the other lost boys

1394
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:10,840
is just like plopped in his PJs

1395
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:14,520
onto the most terrifying location in in Neverland,

1396
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:16,720
which is saying something because it's all terrifying to me.

1397
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:18,040
Of course. Yeah.

1398
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:21,840
But you got to admit, Robin Williams lost boy is pretty cute.

1399
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:23,600
Yes, absolutely.

1400
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:25,040
Yeah. Well, that's the whole thing about this.

1401
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:29,480
Like, Mike, right off the bat, you mentioned my version to this world.

1402
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:32,240
I don't have any of that with this. I like his lost boy.

1403
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:36,880
I this is like it's a very palatable take on Neverland.

1404
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:39,560
I think mainly because you only go on the ship

1405
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:42,920
and you see Peter Pan for one shot only.

1406
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:45,200
Yeah. And none of that other crap.

1407
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:46,200
You like Neverland.

1408
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:47,760
None of the creepy crap.

1409
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,400
None of the racist crap.

1410
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:52,000
There's a ton that you don't have to go do.

1411
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,920
You see some pretty mermaids waving at that.

1412
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:56,120
Yes. Robin Williams.

1413
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:57,240
That's that's plenty.

1414
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:59,320
Tinkerbell. It's nice to see Tinkerbell.

1415
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:00,280
Absolutely.

1416
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:03,280
It is a little implication of an adventure to come,

1417
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:04,840
but I don't have to go on it.

1418
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:07,720
I get to go look at animators desks

1419
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:11,920
and not be stuck in this stupid world for 80 minutes.

1420
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:15,440
I was so excited to see it on the other side of plate glass

1421
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,720
and stare at animators desks.

1422
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:19,240
Even more.

1423
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:19,840
Huh?

1424
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:21,880
Sorry, I get distracted at looking at your iPad.

1425
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:25,400
That looks appears to be a screenshot of Walter Cronkite's giant face.

1426
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:27,000
Oh, yeah.

1427
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,120
Well, you know, what's what are you illustrating with that?

1428
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,520
That I we hadn't gotten to there.

1429
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:32,240
Sorry, sorry.

1430
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:34,240
I I force you to bring this up.

1431
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:36,760
He's like hyping up the tension.

1432
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:39,600
He's talking about editing and sound effects,

1433
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:43,840
and he gets a little scary and they light Walter Cronkite from underneath.

1434
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:45,080
I see what you're saying.

1435
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:46,800
He looks a little sinister.

1436
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:50,600
And I was like, that's such a good trick.

1437
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:55,160
And I think I don't know if we're giving Walter.

1438
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:58,800
I think Walter Cronkite is having fun with this.

1439
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:02,520
Oh, I think he's having a great time, like everything he has to do.

1440
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:04,600
And yeah, I think he's having fun.

1441
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:08,640
He's a nice counterbalance to Robin Williams talking a mile a minute.

1442
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:12,000
Will you make that the background of your iPad or the home screen?

1443
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:13,520
I would like that as well.

1444
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:15,080
I would also vote for that as well.

1445
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:17,400
Oh, that's a boy. You got nothing going on there.

1446
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:18,760
Oh, make Walter Cronkite.

1447
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:21,560
Both of them. Great, great, great. Yeah.

1448
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:23,040
Are you sure you want him to do this?

1449
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,120
We're going to lose him for a while.

1450
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:29,280
OK, OK. I mean, for the listener could take our word for it

1451
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:30,520
that he made it the backdrop.

1452
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:32,120
I want you want to know that it's true.

1453
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:35,160
I'll hear the joy in my voice for the rest of the show when he does it.

1454
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:38,840
It's a very I think you probably respond to that over on Jason's lap,

1455
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:41,840
because it was I think it was very Vincent pricey.

1456
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:44,840
Oh, I guess you light him from down low like that.

1457
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:46,560
And suddenly Cronkite is price.

1458
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,120
Yeah. Do you think I've said this before?

1459
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:52,720
I don't necessarily like it when news people, serious people

1460
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:56,120
in the media do like shows and movies.

1461
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:58,280
I don't anymore. I used to like it.

1462
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:02,600
I used to love when, you know, because growing up here,

1463
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:06,200
it was often like my local and the anchors are in things.

1464
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:10,320
I'd see Kent Brockman inspiration, Jerry Dunphy

1465
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:13,800
in like volcano or independence day or something.

1466
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:15,400
Local guys, I like. Yes.

1467
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:16,800
Yeah, I always like that.

1468
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:19,400
But I don't, you know, like, yeah.

1469
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:22,400
Who on this earth at this point is like, you're telling me that

1470
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:25,880
Jake Taffer is is a Taffer Taffer.

1471
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:27,360
I'm sorry. You got Taffer.

1472
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:28,800
I always have Taffer on the brain.

1473
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:30,360
That was guaranteed to happen.

1474
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:34,200
You're telling me that Jake Taffer is like a funny guy with a sense of.

1475
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:37,320
Yeah. Telling me Anderson Cooper goofs around a bit.

1476
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:40,960
Yeah, they all they all do so many cameos that there's no I know.

1477
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,520
That's what I feel. I don't like.

1478
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:43,240
I don't think I like it.

1479
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:45,760
The only one I like is the Wolf Blitzer Mission Impossible one.

1480
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:48,160
I was going to say it doesn't get better.

1481
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:50,280
That one is good.

1482
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:51,920
But the other ones, I don't love it.

1483
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:55,680
But like, I guess it was so like he was retired for a long time here.

1484
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:57,800
And what else is he going to do? He's going to host specials.

1485
01:09:58,440 --> 01:09:59,480
He's got a good voice.

1486
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:00,200
Yeah. Present.

1487
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:04,920
I'm trying to remember any other was I feel like I can't conjure it exactly,

1488
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:09,120
but I feel like there was a serious news guy who showed up on Sesame Street

1489
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:12,680
for some reason, that era, because they didn't used to goof around.

1490
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:14,040
Peter Jennings or something.

1491
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:17,320
Could have been Jennings, could have been Sam Donaldson, somebody.

1492
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:19,440
And it was on like a more like more of a special.

1493
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:20,920
Sesame Street did great specials.

1494
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:23,960
There's probably one that's rare right for us to talk about.

1495
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:27,200
Don't remember who that news person was.

1496
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:28,240
Yeah, I don't know.

1497
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:29,800
But Cronkite could have been Cronkite.

1498
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:31,560
I don't know. Cronkite, Sesame Street.

1499
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:33,360
I could see it. Don't know.

1500
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:35,480
It could be any of them. How's that iPad coming?

1501
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:38,200
I'm working on it. I'm working on it.

1502
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:40,320
You've got it. It's on there.

1503
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,080
He did it. His face is on there.

1504
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,480
I'm not sure what he's.

1505
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:46,200
He's not giving himself that he just wanted to be.

1506
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:50,040
That's really weird, because all your apps are covering his face.

1507
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:52,040
But he's got the home screen, too.

1508
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:53,160
It's the last.

1509
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:55,840
Oh, it's six o'clock, you see.

1510
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:59,040
That's good. Comforting present.

1511
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:01,520
Yeah, he did that on the mic.

1512
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,480
Oh, good. He rotates, too, whenever it's.

1513
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:05,320
Oh, yeah. Hey, look at that.

1514
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:07,320
Looks good. Horizontal and vertical.

1515
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:11,240
Hello, Jason. It's so complicated to do it nowadays.

1516
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:13,960
I feel like I haven't changed it a lot.

1517
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:15,640
I never changed it all to default.

1518
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:16,520
I'm sure glad you did.

1519
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:19,080
Soon, AI will have him talking to you every morning.

1520
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,840
Any alert, he'll be able to say,

1521
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:26,480
Wow, Jason, Mike just texted you about a new sandwich at Burger King.

1522
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:29,920
Like that. Oh, that's the future.

1523
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:33,480
You're on about target toys without Scott is blowing up.

1524
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:37,280
I and Apple started playing a slideshow with music.

1525
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:41,400
Of songs or of, excuse me, of photos of yours.

1526
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:42,960
Photos of this nice photo.

1527
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:46,040
Didn't start revealing your top five Apple songs, did it?

1528
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:47,480
In front of our.

1529
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:48,520
Oh, he's playing it again.

1530
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:51,120
Is it all your different Walter Cronkite photos on your iPad?

1531
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:53,960
No, is there a nice trip to Orlando in 2023?

1532
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:55,880
As you can see me in front of the incredible.

1533
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:59,880
Boy, if he just if you if we just said, here, one should play it for us.

1534
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:02,200
And then like a few photos in there were,

1535
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:04,840
let's just say, Jason being a sexual being.

1536
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:08,560
Whoops. Oh, boy.

1537
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,560
From the Orlando trip.

1538
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:14,080
Well, yeah, look, we all know how port of entry makes this guy feel.

1539
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:16,400
Port of it. Yeah.

1540
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:20,440
You get a Crescent Moon Bakery Club sandwich in me.

1541
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:22,640
My my. You get a cigarette and a crescent.

1542
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:26,560
You get a cigarette, a sleeve of mini cinnabons.

1543
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:28,400
Oh, the sleep. We forgot about the sleeve.

1544
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:30,160
Got about the sleeve.

1545
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:34,080
Get this guy's sleeved up and all of a sudden Ferro's Lighthouse is rising.

1546
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:38,800
Jane's spraying me with like the water bottle.

1547
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:43,160
You get to spray your cat at the lover's suite at Ferro's Lighthouse.

1548
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:49,240
All right. Let's get let's let's find our way.

1549
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:51,560
Let's weave our way out of this.

1550
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:55,680
You know, it's another thing that you love to see also is like those

1551
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:58,160
something that is obviously not part of the process today,

1552
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:01,000
but the big jars of paint, the bright.

1553
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:02,160
Oh, yeah.

1554
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:04,320
Paint are so pleasant.

1555
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:08,720
I did something like a like a class down there where I got to do what they do.

1556
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:11,120
I got to paint this a cell, but backwards.

1557
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:14,680
You paint it on the other side so that the lines still remain.

1558
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,040
Right. I still have that.

1559
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:18,920
You guys may have seen it in the garage where we haven't been recording in a while.

1560
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:23,520
But the yeah, I've held on to that forever as a Mickey that I painted.

1561
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:25,480
That's cool. From the back.

1562
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:27,200
Oh, man. I cherish it.

1563
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:30,320
My old neighbor in Studio City,

1564
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:34,200
she owned this house and she grew up in the house.

1565
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:39,080
And she's like, oh, yeah, my mom used to work in the ink and paint department at Disney.

1566
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:43,480
She'd walk a blocker to North, catch the red cart trolley.

1567
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:46,160
Wow. To the Disney lot.

1568
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:48,400
And I was like, man, what a time.

1569
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,360
Oh, boy.

1570
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:50,600
Now the red cart trolley.

1571
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:51,800
Don't even move them.

1572
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:53,120
Buena Vista Street.

1573
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:54,440
That's right. Yeah. Yeah.

1574
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:58,160
Stationary and to propose that as an app for I did a long time ago.

1575
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:00,760
And now in the subsequent, that's a PTR curse.

1576
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:02,480
Then it's it's gone away.

1577
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:03,800
Hey, Robert Downey Jr.

1578
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:07,440
said it's not going to run anymore because he was in Imagineering.

1579
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,200
They're working on Avengers. He did it.

1580
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,080
He did it. Sorry.

1581
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:12,440
86 at X.

1582
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:13,560
It's my acro it actually.

1583
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:14,520
No, I don't. Yeah.

1584
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:16,200
That's a that's a fine line.

1585
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:18,680
We only have we only have so many.

1586
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:19,800
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1587
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:21,760
It's going to fall into accurate.

1588
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:23,400
No, that's that's yeah.

1589
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,160
It's it's so nice. Those jars.

1590
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:27,160
You wish they still did it that way.

1591
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:29,840
Also, I forgot that that gender division.

1592
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:31,480
The girls do the ink and paint.

1593
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:32,080
Oh, right.

1594
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:34,320
I'd rather have them breathing in the fumes.

1595
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,960
Yeah, we're not allowed to animate for many years.

1596
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:40,080
That's right. Yeah.

1597
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:41,200
Yes. Very important.

1598
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:42,920
Divine state to keep up.

1599
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:44,160
But you go through all the steps.

1600
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:48,000
You see cells, you see like you see how color transforms a space.

1601
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,800
You see how we're on the happy pirate ship during the day.

1602
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,800
But then that's a world of difference from dark and foreboding at night.

1603
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:58,920
And then Robin Williams, new Lost Boy character is abandoned,

1604
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:03,080
left to deal with scary sound effects and Captain Hook.

1605
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:07,120
I think I think there is something to this where, like, I like that it's

1606
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:08,880
like this just hook.

1607
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:11,480
I just like I because none of my issues,

1608
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:14,960
none of my not wanting to go to Neverland or Captain Hook related. Right.

1609
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:19,240
Not that I want to hang out with Captain Hook, but I heard the same thing proposed.

1610
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:23,160
I was just at a thing like a mystery screening that some friends put together

1611
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:25,800
and somebody ended up putting it to the audience.

1612
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:28,040
And they said, here's three movies. What do you want?

1613
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:29,240
One of them was Hook.

1614
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:31,400
I watched not one hand go up.

1615
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:34,400
No one really voted for Hook.

1616
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:37,880
And I was like, is that something to this specific group of people?

1617
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:41,120
Or has there been some sort of anti hook turn?

1618
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:45,080
And in the same room, there was discussion of would we like hook more?

1619
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:49,960
If it was just supercut, Dustin Hoffman, Bob Hoskins together

1620
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:52,040
and nothing else.

1621
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:55,040
I know you're doing it, Peter.

1622
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,880
I think I'd like it more.

1623
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:00,320
I that's an early going movie.

1624
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:03,040
Memory is hook when it came out.

1625
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:07,680
Specifically, I remember an intermission.

1626
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:12,360
But the last official intermission, I looked this up.

1627
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:17,480
Um, the last movie with a built in intermission was Gandhi.

1628
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:21,080
But I think they stopped hook

1629
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:26,160
so kids could use the bathroom, probably when they were changing reels.

1630
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:28,120
OK, I think they made on hateful eight.

1631
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:29,800
I think hateful eight may have had an intermission.

1632
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:30,280
What's that?

1633
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:32,360
Didn't hateful eight have an intermission on like the longer?

1634
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:36,160
Oh, yeah, I think I think you're saying like the full all.

1635
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:38,520
I am, of course, the brutalist.

1636
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:41,080
Oh, right. Yeah, very necessary.

1637
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:41,920
I haven't seen it yet.

1638
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:47,080
But I looked it up and Hook's runtime is only two hours and 19 minutes.

1639
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:48,640
Wasn't even that long.

1640
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:52,240
Like all the Marvel movies I feel like are longer than that.

1641
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:53,000
Yeah, yeah.

1642
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,600
But I think they they built it in.

1643
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:59,640
And as we're talking about hook, I'm remembering how like I

1644
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:04,080
I loved Hoskins and Hoffman.

1645
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:07,880
I liked Robin Williams when he got in the silly outfit.

1646
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:11,200
I had a bunch of hook toys that Christmas,

1647
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:15,200
but I really did not care for Julia Roberts Tinkerbell.

1648
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:17,080
She really bummed me out.

1649
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:17,920
I don't know where this was going.

1650
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:19,840
She's a literal manic pixie dream girl.

1651
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,720
Well, yeah, she's like,

1652
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:24,480
does she go like you abandoned us or something?

1653
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:26,920
She becomes human sized at one point.

1654
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:29,560
So you better believe I don't like that part.

1655
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:30,160
Creepy.

1656
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:31,800
When she gets, yeah, it's Hulk.

1657
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:35,720
I love Julia Roberts, but I like and that unnerved me as a kid.

1658
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:37,960
Didn't we talk about like Spielberg didn't get along with her?

1659
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:39,280
Yes, we definitely had this conversation.

1660
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:40,160
We talked about that in the show.

1661
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:41,320
So maybe you're feeling that.

1662
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:42,000
Right.

1663
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,720
You're feeling hatred.

1664
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:44,840
Yes, it's true.

1665
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:46,960
Hey, I brought this up on the show before.

1666
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:49,560
I've never seen a minute of that live action.

1667
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:50,640
Peter Pan.

1668
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:53,400
I think they just dumped on Disney Plus during the pandemic.

1669
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:56,240
Did you know Smee is Jim Gaffigan?

1670
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:57,280
Oh, I didn't know that.

1671
01:17:57,280 --> 01:18:02,360
I've never seen like a picture even from Tim Walls himself.

1672
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:06,400
It's strange also that this predates Hulk.

1673
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:07,040
Is it weird?

1674
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:07,680
It is weird.

1675
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:09,840
It feels like I've been on the horizon for him.

1676
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:12,600
Yeah, I don't think this also inspired Hulk.

1677
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,400
Yeah, I don't think so.

1678
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,560
Yeah, because it's just it doesn't.

1679
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,360
I mean, he's in the family, though.

1680
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,320
So I'm sure I could have helped.

1681
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:21,640
He's the ultimate boy.

1682
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:23,640
You never do it.

1683
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:26,600
And what a run Williams had in the night.

1684
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:27,880
The Hulk.

1685
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:29,160
Goodwill hunting.

1686
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:34,120
Aladdin, like, yes, I think that's all over the place.

1687
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:35,680
And there are also some bombs in there, too.

1688
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:36,160
But yes.

1689
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:36,920
Oh, yeah.

1690
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:37,800
There was all. Yes.

1691
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:40,400
Well, I liked Pysontaniel Man when I was 10.

1692
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:41,400
Did you?

1693
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:42,400
Yeah, I did.

1694
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:43,240
What if you were 10?

1695
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:44,400
You were older than that.

1696
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:45,080
I don't think so.

1697
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:45,720
I swear.

1698
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:47,720
I swear it came out like 95.

1699
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:53,480
Pysontaniel Man was released in nineteen ninety nine ninety nine.

1700
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:54,840
You were 14.

1701
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:57,920
You were just dreaming of it.

1702
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:59,480
I swore it was there.

1703
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:02,280
I swore I went into you had a psychic vision of it.

1704
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:04,560
We saw Pysontaniel Man.

1705
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:06,400
I think you age yourself down in your memory

1706
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:09,080
because of how that's not thought of as a good movie anymore.

1707
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:10,040
So you're like, well, I was 10.

1708
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:12,680
That's why I was just I wasn't a sophisticated 14 year old.

1709
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:14,320
Maybe a silly 10 year old.

1710
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:16,560
Maybe I was just mashing up A.I.

1711
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:21,040
and Pysontaniel Man because of the unnerving elements in both those movies.

1712
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:22,360
A.I. is 99.

1713
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:23,440
Yeah, that is 90.

1714
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:24,640
That's what I'm saying.

1715
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:28,080
Like, well, they traumatized me, so they scrambled my brain.

1716
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:29,000
Oh, OK. All right.

1717
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,840
I guess in a general sense, I get what you're saying.

1718
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:34,840
I was annoying 14 year old going like, you know, Stanley Kubrick was he was.

1719
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:38,080
That's like I was just talking about how phenomenon Michael

1720
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:40,640
and powder are all a trilogy in my mind.

1721
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:41,480
Yes. Yeah.

1722
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:42,160
I don't know.

1723
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:45,320
Two of those aren't thematically or two of them are thematically similar.

1724
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:46,840
And then Michael is different.

1725
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:50,480
But because it felt that era of Travolta, the creepy trilogy. Yeah.

1726
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:54,280
Michael doesn't belong in those three, but it feels right to me.

1727
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:55,240
Yeah. Yeah.

1728
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:57,560
And they're all like they're for grownups and continued.

1729
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:58,600
Those are for grownups.

1730
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:02,680
I assume that grownups are big boy movies, big boys, big boys.

1731
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:06,440
Anyway, Cronkite, they look down.

1732
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:10,680
How long do you make it with that scary Cronkite?

1733
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:11,680
You seem forever.

1734
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:14,400
Anyways.

1735
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:16,400
Oh, by the way, that that movie screen,

1736
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:19,880
this might help explain why hook got zero votes is that one of the options

1737
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:23,440
for what movie we're going to watch here was Clifford.

1738
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:25,280
Clifford ended up being that.

1739
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:27,600
So it was kind of a boys who don't grow up.

1740
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:31,160
And I guess given the choice, at least this group went with Clifford,

1741
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:31,800
not with hook.

1742
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:35,640
And I I went with the third choice, the tingler would be Vincent Price.

1743
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:36,800
Oh, I've never seen that.

1744
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:37,760
I've never seen that either.

1745
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:38,680
I don't know about that.

1746
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:40,960
That's one of those like there was like the gimmick in the theater.

1747
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:43,560
With the seats. Yeah. Right.

1748
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:45,920
So I was curious anyway.

1749
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:48,280
Here's what I learned about Clifford on big screen.

1750
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:51,120
I continue to think there are some zones

1751
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:53,400
that movie that are some dead zones.

1752
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:57,040
There are some there are some stretches that are like, OK.

1753
01:20:57,240 --> 01:21:00,320
However, I think I've always been a little too hard on the priest wraparounds.

1754
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:02,360
There was a lot of laughs. Fine.

1755
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:04,440
At this priest, I guess.

1756
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:07,800
Him like trying to relate to the kids and then like stuff at them

1757
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:10,160
and kind of stiffly catching footballs.

1758
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:13,720
And I'm like, this is how you can tell the movie's a rewrite is all this priest stuff.

1759
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:16,040
And then I'm like, ah, pretty funny, pretty funny.

1760
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:18,280
Yeah. That's so updated.

1761
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:23,200
I'm working my way up to a Mount of Clifford that I will sign off on.

1762
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:25,840
I'm working my way up to Jason's one hundred.

1763
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:28,640
That's like the perfect film.

1764
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:30,760
You love Clifford. Oh, yeah, I do.

1765
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:32,000
That's what he's saying. Yeah.

1766
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,200
Do you think I'm crazy, though?

1767
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:34,640
There's some because there's zones.

1768
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:37,160
Yeah, there's some very dry set up.

1769
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:42,640
There's some long set up or like stuff about the office or sure.

1770
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:45,760
Sure. The girlfriend fiance.

1771
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:46,600
It's all it's all in.

1772
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,800
Yeah, there's some there's some Uncle Martin world stuff.

1773
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,560
That's a little a little brutal.

1774
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:55,280
But not as fantastic transportation plan.

1775
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:57,360
Those would have been a great, you know, been a public transit.

1776
01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:01,200
Hey, Richard Kahn, you know, he's a sidekick on the Blaney show.

1777
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:02,240
He's very funny on that.

1778
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:03,200
It's very fun.

1779
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:06,400
He's in Clifford for so little time, but he's so funny.

1780
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:08,360
And it was a big day. Yeah, yeah.

1781
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:10,840
Fantastic. Yeah, yeah.

1782
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:14,360
OK, so you get your you get your Peter Pan adventure.

1783
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:16,720
Captain Hook is foiled.

1784
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:19,320
I was like the crocodile rising up behind him.

1785
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:22,200
A flying like flying crocodile always fun.

1786
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:25,360
I think the making of this was really exciting for the animators

1787
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:29,920
because I think it was a rarity to like go back in the movies at this time.

1788
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:32,560
This is before all the weird knockoff sequels

1789
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:35,240
and things like Draining the IP.

1790
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:39,360
And they didn't really do this in like kind of TV style.

1791
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:43,360
Bang it out like this is like very quality animation.

1792
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:46,440
And I think if you were a Disney animator in 1989,

1793
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:49,480
you were really nerding out getting to like Captain

1794
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:52,680
draw these characters and draw film style.

1795
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:55,520
So I think everybody found this really cool.

1796
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:57,600
This is some it's like secret golden.

1797
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,240
I've seen it presented this way online

1798
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:02,200
that it's like a little secret morsel of Disney Golden Age.

1799
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:03,880
Oh, yeah, that's a good way to think of it. Yeah.

1800
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:05,240
Yeah, it's got that spirit.

1801
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:07,680
It's got the quality. It's got bonus Robin Williams.

1802
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:13,200
It's like extra Peter Pan that doesn't disrupt the original IP.

1803
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:15,360
Yeah. Like fun bonus.

1804
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:16,320
Great bonus.

1805
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:20,360
It is funny that the directed VHS stuff did differentiate it in my mind

1806
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:23,480
as a kid to some degree, even though I watch Return of Jafar

1807
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:25,720
and then the third one, which I can't remember what it's called.

1808
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:29,320
Well, they got away with Return of Jafar and then the rest are right.

1809
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:32,520
Horrible. But but I still I like the it was like, well, that's different.

1810
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:33,560
That's different than this.

1811
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:35,880
This is a different thing, even though they're same characters. Yeah.

1812
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:38,600
But this does feel like right.

1813
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,320
Yeah. It feels much more right.

1814
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:43,760
And what an intro like it gets you so hyped to go into the next room

1815
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:46,960
and see how the stuff's made and see the people who make it.

1816
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:50,160
Right. It's great that they I don't know, just that they put so much

1817
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:54,800
effort into that, like what a kickoff that they didn't just bang out somebody

1818
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:58,760
like animation is the art of bringing moving images to life.

1819
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:02,720
They just they said they didn't sit Roy Disney down in front of a teleprompter.

1820
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:04,400
Have him talk stiffly.

1821
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:07,280
It'd be funny to and interesting in some level.

1822
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:12,200
Yeah, I realized earlier I said how much I want to see George Lucas talking.

1823
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:13,880
Right. Right. Right. Editing.

1824
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:15,320
But there's a time and a place.

1825
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:18,480
But it's always a time and a place for a boring behind the scenes person

1826
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:20,920
to read off a teleprompter to me in a theme park.

1827
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:26,400
But a magical, really elevated piece like this, a magical time in the company.

1828
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:29,960
Yeah, it's really the perfect storm of a situation.

1829
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:35,720
The animation is catches fire again as Michael Eisner is just this body

1830
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:39,680
is so confident it's got just his body is so confident.

1831
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:41,720
You heard me.

1832
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:45,960
But I've always thought and said, yes, all of him, all of his pieces,

1833
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:49,360
all of his parts are confident at this moment.

1834
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:52,280
And it's reflecting that in the Disney company and the choice.

1835
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:53,600
Yeah, yeah.

1836
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:57,160
No matter how many serious sentences, the robbing with confidence.

1837
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:59,880
Michael Eisner was throbbing with too aware.

1838
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:01,360
Yeah, he's pushing it too far.

1839
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:04,960
No, before it was just one of those weird things.

1840
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:07,040
Mike says that he doesn't realize how weird it was.

1841
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:09,240
Are you talking about Eisner or Williams?

1842
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:11,520
Eisner. OK.

1843
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:12,760
Yeah. Well, Rob Williams.

1844
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:15,120
Fine. Great. But this is Eisner's doing OK.

1845
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:18,360
Yes. Eisner once in a lifetime talent. Right.

1846
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:21,560
Yes. Man of a thousand decisions.

1847
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:23,160
Yes. Today. Right.

1848
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:26,000
Yeah. A whirlwind of signoffs.

1849
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,720
Whatever. Yeah. I want to update.

1850
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:32,040
There is a newer Michael Eisner interview than the one from 2023.

1851
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:36,680
There is a February 16th, 2024 interview with Michael Eisner.

1852
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:40,000
Oh, good. So that's a year should go over a little over a year ago.

1853
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,760
What's it about? It's about football.

1854
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:44,520
It's about football again. OK. Yes. All right.

1855
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:45,400
And it's called it.

1856
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:47,760
The video is called It's Great to Be Back.

1857
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:49,520
Michael Eisner exclusive interview.

1858
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:52,320
Oh, boy. So is the interviewer.

1859
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:57,160
Is it like a channel or it's Portsmouth Football Club.

1860
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:58,560
Here's what we got to do.

1861
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:02,160
We got to learn everything about football real fast.

1862
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:04,200
Turn this into a fake sports podcast.

1863
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:07,360
And that's how that might be the way to do it on the show.

1864
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:10,640
That would be going to be a tough road.

1865
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,960
Imagine us fumbling through

1866
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:17,640
complete like the absolute basics of football. Right.

1867
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:21,360
The town just north of where I grew up.

1868
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:24,720
Town of Chester, Pennsylvania.

1869
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:28,240
It was always hard hit economically when it like

1870
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:33,120
department stores and local businesses started moving out of the area,

1871
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:35,240
moving, moving deeper in the suburbs.

1872
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:38,440
But in the last few years, Chester has a Harrah's

1873
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:45,280
the of Philadelphia's Football Club Stadium and a prison.

1874
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:51,320
So it's a lot going on there on the river.

1875
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:53,560
We should town. We should start our own Disney prisons.

1876
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:56,600
We should have different characters

1877
01:26:57,560 --> 01:26:58,960
drawn on the different cells.

1878
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:01,000
The villains, the scariest villains.

1879
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:05,080
One look at the face of Hades will remind you to never to commit crimes ever again.

1880
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:08,520
You will pay for what you did,

1881
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:13,240
just as Ursula will pay by suffering in the sea for her crime of voice stealing.

1882
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:17,080
Judge Doom has sentenced you to a life here.

1883
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:21,600
Who wouldn't sober up seeing the icy visage of scar

1884
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:26,440
mostly consumed by recent but mostly consumed by the hyenas?

1885
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:27,520
He once called friends.

1886
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:31,560
Judge Doom is taking a hiatus says no matter the crime,

1887
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:35,200
he just kept sentencing everyone to the dip.

1888
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:38,120
The prison menu will be very similar to Mickey's kitchen.

1889
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:42,240
The menu at the Disney store restaurant, basically the same.

1890
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:43,600
We're just going to reuse the recipes.

1891
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:47,240
We're making two dips, one to eat, one to burn people alive in.

1892
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:48,720
Don't mix them up.

1893
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:50,040
One will be bright yellow.

1894
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:51,160
One will be orange.

1895
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:53,120
And it will be Muy Caliente.

1896
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:57,000
Um, I think I think we're heading to the door here.

1897
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,880
One just one other thing to say is that this thing was great.

1898
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:02,080
Really like sign of the times.

1899
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:03,440
Cool, relevant, great.

1900
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:06,440
Nineteen eighty nine new theme park piece of material.

1901
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:10,560
Then the animation tour opens in DCA and they just throw this in there, too.

1902
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:14,360
Yeah, it's one of the I didn't realize till today that that was in there.

1903
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:17,240
And good like repurpose it.

1904
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:19,760
I always I would go to Florida as a kid.

1905
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:23,720
I'm like, bring all this stuff to me in California, please.

1906
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:24,960
And then they did.

1907
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:29,160
But so late and to the point where like now Muppet Vision's a little older.

1908
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:30,600
And now this is a little older.

1909
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:33,800
And it's like just feels like it's just repurposed and sitting on a shelf.

1910
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:35,280
Our magic is old.

1911
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:37,440
No, I got put that in the worst of all.

1912
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:40,640
Yes. Yeah. So that's just what happens there.

1913
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:42,000
Like, I don't know.

1914
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,320
And for and the other one was a setup to like seeing real animators animate this.

1915
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:48,160
But like now it's like going to the beast.

1916
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:51,440
The beast's den or whatever.

1917
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:52,400
Well, that was good.

1918
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:54,360
Was the Beast Den Library closed?

1919
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:55,560
That was actually cool.

1920
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:56,520
That wasn't. Yeah.

1921
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:58,320
I meant to go do it and then do an episode about it.

1922
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:00,200
But we didn't. I forgot.

1923
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:01,760
Yeah. But that was cool.

1924
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:03,840
Actually, the flowers or the roses in there.

1925
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:07,400
Well, I don't mean to slander the beast's den.

1926
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:10,240
Don't slander the beast's den early.

1927
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:14,160
The is kind of like 2000s, 2010s touchscreens

1928
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:17,720
where you're kind of like smacking it to register that.

1929
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:23,080
The Warner Brothers store, especially change into polka dot.

1930
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:28,080
Yeah. Hey, why isn't this Taz turning into zebra stripes?

1931
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:33,480
How's the future now with only some struggle and effort?

1932
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:39,440
Quickly touch screen changing the screen of your iPad.

1933
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:42,000
I got a very old man on my iPad now.

1934
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:44,120
Lock screen and home screen.

1935
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:49,920
I will sound like an old man going like, God, this took so many steps.

1936
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:52,000
IOS has gotten so complicated.

1937
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:57,120
But no, when we were kids, it was very fun to see this.

1938
01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:02,400
The Nickelodeon tour up the highway, where it's like you look out windows

1939
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:07,000
and see sets of game shows or sitcoms.

1940
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:10,200
And then you could see that orange schnick couch.

1941
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:14,280
That may have been the most starstruck I ever was as a kid.

1942
01:30:14,360 --> 01:30:16,520
I think we've talked about this couch.

1943
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:20,960
I feel like it maybe got under talked about in whenever we talked about

1944
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:22,040
Nickelodeon studios.

1945
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:25,680
But there was a runner on the show once about a famous couch

1946
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:27,040
that you wanted to sleep on.

1947
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:28,920
And was it a different famous couch?

1948
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:32,400
It seems very possible this runner could have existed and been.

1949
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:34,760
It could have been a different famous couch that you like.

1950
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:38,760
I mean, all TV sitcom family room couches looked very

1951
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:40,680
could have been married with children couch.

1952
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:44,840
Could have been a roundhouse recliner that the guy drove around.

1953
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:50,440
OK, right. There's no end of couches and recliners from famous media.

1954
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:53,080
I wouldn't like to see Jason Sheridan step by step.

1955
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:55,840
Full house, like great couch, friends couch.

1956
01:30:57,280 --> 01:30:59,360
Yeah, I wasn't a big friends guy.

1957
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:01,640
Yeah, I like friends as I get older.

1958
01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:05,600
But while do this mental exercise, take friends away, a picture of Jason there.

1959
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,600
Oh, I'm I'm on board. Great. No problem. Yeah.

1960
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:10,160
The problem is not with the couch.

1961
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:11,160
Problem is not the couch.

1962
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:13,800
You pop Jason in any couch, he makes the couch shine.

1963
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:18,040
I'm not going to be able to see those bowls of coffee they'd all be drinking.

1964
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:19,920
Oh, because they had a big mug.

1965
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:22,440
Yeah. How about just a regular diner mug?

1966
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:23,600
Eight to 10 ounces.

1967
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:25,640
That's more than enough for me.

1968
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:27,160
Really? Sixty.

1969
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:28,560
Just a good old cup of joe.

1970
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:31,840
How big was your dirty soda, though? Huh?

1971
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:34,040
What size was your dirty soda?

1972
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:36,240
I reasonably sized medium.

1973
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:42,240
We all medium, which would be like an extra large in much of the rest of the world.

1974
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:44,520
OK, Jason's getting on the road there.

1975
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:46,680
Just going to update a new new show.

1976
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:48,880
People don't hang out at coffee shops anymore.

1977
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:52,640
It's about a group of friends and they all gather at dirty soda shops.

1978
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:57,680
If you want to appeal to the current kids, extra syrupy, please.

1979
01:31:57,680 --> 01:31:59,280
Yeah, this is you joke.

1980
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:04,560
But in Utah, dirty soda shops and cookie shops are very popular

1981
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:09,400
because of Mormon rules of like you can't drink hot beverages or something.

1982
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:11,280
I think they've eased up on caffeine.

1983
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:13,560
Can Mormons not drink hot beverages?

1984
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:15,000
There's some sort of. Is that true?

1985
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
I think it was caffeine.

1986
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,760
That's different than hot.

1987
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:19,600
It was both.

1988
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:20,840
That'll inspire you.

1989
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:22,440
Like your head will start spinning.

1990
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:24,680
Once you realize that beverages can be warmed up,

1991
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:28,040
then you'll start to want the warm fluids that come out of a human body.

1992
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:32,520
I didn't read the book, you know.

1993
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:35,560
But I see you have a train ticket book to Utah.

1994
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:37,800
Dirty soda Stanley cups.

1995
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:39,600
This is a thing.

1996
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:40,760
I feel like that caught on.

1997
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:44,240
Well, there's that soda influencer that's a soda addict or addicted to soda

1998
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:45,320
that you send me sometimes.

1999
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:48,080
Yeah, yeah. He just drinks an insane amount of it.

2000
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:50,760
Yeah, it's like 12, 15 sodas a day.

2001
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:53,120
Different kinds, different soda fridges.

2002
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:55,640
But then he works out a lot, too.

2003
01:32:55,640 --> 01:32:56,520
He is in good shape.

2004
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:58,240
And he got the turkey hair.

2005
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:00,600
He flew to Turkey to get the hair transplant.

2006
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:04,480
It I think here, OK, I think it is a mixed answer here.

2007
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:09,240
What I'm seeing is Mormons are taught not to drink hot drinks,

2008
01:33:09,240 --> 01:33:12,400
meaning coffee or any tea other than herbal tea.

2009
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:13,560
So herbal is fine.

2010
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:16,160
I'm seeing some results telling me that hot chocolate is fine.

2011
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:17,480
I think it's not.

2012
01:33:17,480 --> 01:33:22,680
I think it is a caffeine thing, not the heat of the because by that nature,

2013
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:24,960
like can Mormons not eat stew?

2014
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:26,680
Where does it end?

2015
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:28,920
Miso. I don't know how much Miso.

2016
01:33:29,160 --> 01:33:30,920
I don't know if you're getting the best Miso in the world.

2017
01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:32,840
And maybe you are, though.

2018
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:33,800
I shouldn't say that.

2019
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:36,720
Maybe there's some Mormons out there who make the best Miso you ever had.

2020
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:38,160
There's a OK.

2021
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:42,160
I remember you remember the movie Swat based on the TV show?

2022
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:44,720
It's Samuel L.

2023
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:46,080
Jackson, Colin Farrell.

2024
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:48,440
I remember seeing that when it came out in theaters.

2025
01:33:48,680 --> 01:33:53,400
And there was a weird throwaway line where like the the front desk

2026
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:57,600
guy is like chugging a Dr. Pepper and he's like, and my wife's Mormon.

2027
01:33:57,600 --> 01:33:59,200
I'm not supposed to have this.

2028
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:00,720
So I drink it at work.

2029
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:04,360
Like, there's some weird moment in that that has stuck with me

2030
01:34:04,360 --> 01:34:07,520
for like over 20 years. Huh, huh.

2031
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:10,000
They did that. That's your Book of Mormon.

2032
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,600
That's where you learned everything about the religion was from Swat.

2033
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:14,000
From Swat. Yeah.

2034
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,640
Not the squad remake on CBS.

2035
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:18,600
That's different. Yeah, yeah. It's different.

2036
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:20,000
It's important to differentiate.

2037
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:24,280
And not Queen Latifah equalizer, Denzel equalizer.

2038
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:26,720
Right. There's going to be.

2039
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:30,480
I feel I feel like no end coming to like the network

2040
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:34,840
television shows Jason has been watching is reminiscing about.

2041
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:37,720
That's right. This is there's there's an onslaught coming.

2042
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:40,280
But I guess that's why we I guess have to end episodes.

2043
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:43,520
Yeah, right. Save them, save them for those times when it's.

2044
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:47,480
Well, after the two part shark attack episode of Dr.

2045
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:50,760
Odyssey, there's a 9-1-1 Dr. Odyssey crossover.

2046
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,880
Oh, my gosh. It's just too much.

2047
01:34:53,880 --> 01:34:56,360
ABC is in the Ryan Murphy business.

2048
01:34:57,160 --> 01:34:59,840
And they're doing boffo business.

2049
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:04,000
They're doing boffo ABC doing boffo business with this big boy.

2050
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,400
All right. You survived.

2051
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:07,360
They're right.

2052
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:09,760
Thanks for subscribing to the second gate where it's becoming

2053
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:11,720
extremely evident to me that a Dr.

2054
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:16,240
Odyssey episode is unavoidable and that somehow we will like work

2055
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:21,280

2056

It's happening. Dr.

2057
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:24,800
Odyssey episode.
