1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Warning, the following podcast references interstellar food trucks, minor characters

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,080
getting in personal arguments, a special hallway for necking, and massive shoulder strain.

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,240
Bobby Moynihan gets in the cockpit with us to talk Millennium Falcon Smuggler's Run on

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,800
today's podcast, The Ride.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:48,040
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a podcast about theme parks that we're thinking about renaming

8
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,160
crazy for coaxium.

9
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,600
I'm Scott Gardiner joined by Mike Carlson.

10
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,680
Yes, I'm here.

11
00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:00,440
We all have a love affair with the, it's not, it's just edging out of unobtainium as far

12
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,980
as like fake elements in a movie.

13
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:07,340
So we love coaxium on this show.

14
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,340
That is a fact.

15
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,460
The strongest most desired fake elements, the fake element Final Four, if we were ever

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:13,460
to do that.

17
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,880
We should do, we should figure out which fake elements are the best.

18
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,780
This would be the two, we'll have to determine if there's more.

19
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,880
Jason Sheridan, feelings about coaxium.

20
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,960
You know what?

21
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,200
I think now, now that they're stacked together, I think I just like, I have to agree.

22
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,200
Yeah.

23
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,200
I love the E.M.

24
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,840
McGuffins in the movie, like the driving force McGuffins.

25
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,920
We love our, we love our E.M.s.

27
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,720
There's so much to talk about.

28
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:47,320
Even besides the E.M.s with today's attraction, Millennium Falcon, Falkers, Millennium Falcon

29
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,080
Smuggler's Run.

30
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,280
I was too excited to get to the smuggler part.

31
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,040
We've never done a deep dive into this and we're so excited to talk about it and we have

32
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,560
a great guest to do it with.

33
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,560
Oh my God.

34
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,840
We're so happy to be joined by, from Saturday Night Live from Mr. Mayor and from Celebrity

35
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,740
Sighting with Jonathan Biting, the new podcast available on Stitcher Premium.

36
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,740
It's Bobby Moynihan.

37
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,740
Hi.

38
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,740
Hi, how are you?

39
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,740
Thanks for having me.

40
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,740
Absolutely.

41
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,740
Thanks for being here.

42
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,740
Oh nice, a nice little perrier.

43
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,740
Oh yeah, yeah.

44
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,740
Uh huh, uh huh.

45
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,740
Gotta stay refreshed.

46
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,740
Sponsored, sponsored.

47
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,840
This is a podcast for fancy boys.

48
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,600
Regular water.

49
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,600
That's why I'm here.

50
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,600
It's the coaxium of water, I believe.

51
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,600
It truly is, it truly is.

52
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:35,520
We're so excited to talk about this ride and with you, Bobby, especially because I was

53
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:41,960
thinking about how the whole thing with Galaxy's Edge when it opened is a chance for you to

54
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,860
get up close and personal and live your Star Wars story.

55
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,440
That seemed to be like copy, they were saying a lot.

56
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:53,440
I feel like you have lived your Star Wars story more than most people.

57
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,280
You've gotten so involved in terms of voice and characters and meeting people.

58
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,760
I guess, are there things that are particularly high on your list of highlights of your Star

59
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,760
Wars story?

60
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:13,520
I mean, it's funny you said that and my head starts spinning.

61
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,520
It's bonkers.

62
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,360
Yeah, I feel like the luckiest boy in the world.

63
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:32,400
I was just a fan and then that led to so many absolutely insane and amazing moments.

64
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:39,640
Getting to meet Carrie Fisher easily, the best one backstage at Comic Con.

65
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,840
JJ Abrams was super nice.

66
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,760
He had done something for SNL and invited me to Comic Con.

67
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,080
And it was when Force Awakens happened.

68
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,840
So I got to be there for that panel where they brought all the storm troopers out and

69
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,480
had everybody walk to the band show two blocks away at the end.

70
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,480
Oh, that one.

71
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,480
Right, right.

72
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,480
With a secret John Williams.

73
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,960
John Williams played the score.

74
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,000
So yeah, I was there for that.

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,320
That was a tremendously special evening.

76
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:18,840
Just getting to talk to Carrie and having that for the rest of my life will be the greatest.

77
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,920
Matt, the radar technician.

78
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:26,280
Yeah, so many crazy Star Wars things.

79
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:32,120
I just saw a picture of like 100 people dressed as Matt at some sort of Comic Con all giving

80
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,120
thumbs up on an escalator.

81
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,640
And I was just like, yeah, that's so dope.

82
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,640
That's the coolest.

83
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,440
You invented a costume.

84
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,400
Yeah, that's the craziest thing.

85
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:46,800
You would have been a person dressing as Star Wars characters and now you made one up essentially.

86
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,880
Yeah, I would have been a person hanging out with the people who tried.

87
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,360
I don't know if I would have dressed.

88
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,000
I haven't gotten there yet.

89
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,520
I've only dressed up as Star Wars characters for like television.

90
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,600
But I made an assumption, I guess, based on your work.

91
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,160
Yeah, not that I think that that's a bad thing at all.

92
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,160
I love it.

93
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:14,360
I just worry that people think my nerd credits are thicker and heavier than they are.

94
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,840
You can't point to the con.

95
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,080
I know there's people who know more.

96
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,960
That's why I try to respect them.

97
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,400
And you haven't done full Darth Maul face paint.

98
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,120
You couldn't lead a tutorial on how to be Darth Maul.

99
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,120
I want to, but I have not.

100
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,640
No, I would.

101
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,640
I would.

102
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,400
I told you.

103
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:38,240
Within that, I mean, like it's crazy to talk to you about Galaxy's Edge stuff because you're

104
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,040
you have a Galaxy's Edge character as well.

105
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:47,560
That's about as deep as you can go into this new Disney theme park Star Wars crossover.

106
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,560
You have a guy.

107
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,040
Yeah, I was.

108
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:56,120
Yeah, recently, I think it comes out this month, I shot something for Disney Plus, like

109
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,520
talking about the making of this game.

110
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,800
It's called Tales of Galaxy's Edge for Oculus Quest.

111
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,800
And I play Cecil Slack, the Cantina bartender.

112
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,840
And we were shooting there late at night, super late at night.

113
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,920
The park is closed and I'm in Galaxy's Edge standing next to the thing.

114
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,680
And they're like, that's where you're and they point and they're like, that's where

115
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,680
your Cantina is.

116
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,720
And I was just like, what?

117
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,720
What?

118
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,120
What are you talking about?

119
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,800
Like I hear that they're going to start sprinkling in sprinkling in things at the at the park

120
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,200
about the game and stuff.

121
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:41,600
And I just go like, yeah, to be part of that universe is insane.

122
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,600
The crazier, the crazier one, because I didn't know about it whatsoever.

123
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,200
That happened recently was just as a fan.

124
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:57,120
I got one of those like Star Wars A to Z, like all the characters, like, you know, kind

125
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,600
of character dictionary or whatever you would call it, a encyclopedia of all the characters

126
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,640
from Star Wars.

127
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,840
And I was like, I wonder if one of my Star Wars characters is in there.

128
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,280
And it was the one from Clone Wars.

129
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,960
It was all about Clone Wars.

130
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:21,600
And I looked it up and the species of that character was Moin, M-O-Y-N, like the first

131
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,200
couple of letters of my last name.

132
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,640
Like that was the character now.

133
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,160
And then I looked up like a different character and it said like, oh, the species is Moin.

134
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,160
I was like, dude, they named a species?

135
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,160
Like what?

136
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,800
Like it just keeps getting more bonkers.

137
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,880
As a fan, you just go like, it's the coolest.

138
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,840
But that's what it's about is inclusion.

139
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,640
And like, I like this nerdy thing and the minutia of it and to be involved in that.

140
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,600
And it's the dumbest thing in the world.

141
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,560
But like the beginning part of my last name is printed in a Star Wars book that some nerd

142
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,560
will read someday.

143
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,920
That's pretty sweet.

144
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,200
It's not lost on me.

145
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,960
I it's awesome.

146
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,160
Yeah, that's amazing.

147
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,680
What are the basics of a Moin?

148
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,440
Like if you were to see a Moin in the wild?

149
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,760
It looks like a butthole with eyes.

150
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,760
Beautiful.

151
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:22,200
It was one of Ralph McQuarrie's like original concepts for a creature that didn't get used.

152
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:29,160
It kind of looks like binoculars, like almost like a fur face.

153
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,760
It was an alien design.

154
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:36,400
I'm now kind of like Maz Kanata with the like she had like the sunken eyes.

155
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,400
Sort of.

156
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,400
Maybe I'm not.

157
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,400
She's not a Moin.

158
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,400
No, no, no.

159
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,400
Yeah.

160
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,400
She predated Moins.

161
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,400
She predates Moins.

162
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,400
Yeah.

163
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,400
Oh, gosh.

164
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:54,800
Now I'm holding up your podcast as I look for a picture of it.

165
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,800
That's OK.

166
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,800
I don't know.

167
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,800
This is where you look.

168
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,800
We're always looking up stuff.

169
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,800
It will take seconds.

170
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,800
How are you otherwise?

171
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,800
Oh, good.

172
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,800
We're good.

173
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,800
Got it.

174
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,800
Found it.

175
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,800
Let me see.

176
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,800
Wait here.

177
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,800
Say something so the camera cuts to you.

178
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,800
Oh, hello.

179
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,800
Hello.

180
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,800
Hello.

181
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,200
Pintu Son El.

182
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,120
Is that the one you voice or a different Moin?

183
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,120
That's the one I voice.

184
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,120
OK.

185
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,120
Clone Wars.

186
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,920
Oh, so it's not I'm saying it's the opposite of a Maz Kanata.

187
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,480
I was mischaracterized because the eyes extrude.

188
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,480
Yeah.

189
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,880
Those are the original Ralph McCrory concepts that they based it on.

190
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,880
Geez.

191
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,880
Yeah, that's very cool.

192
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,880
One that you own.

193
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,560
They put your name in a like original.

194
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,280
This is like as authentic.

195
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,960
This goes, I guess, I guess Moins do predate Maz Kanata is what I figured out.

196
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,960
I'm all over the place.

197
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:56,040
It's weird to hear like that, like, like as a Star Wars fan now to hear it like news,

198
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,160
like I just go like, that's so stupid.

199
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,160
So weird.

200
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,160
So crazy.

201
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,560
Is there a chance like, you know, William Shatner started writing his own Star Trek

202
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,680
novels that you could just write novel after novel about Moins?

203
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,720
Yes, I will.

204
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,480
And I have.

205
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,940
I have something coming out soon, like sort of like in the Star Wars, the nerdy universe

206
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,360
that I'm super excited about where I go.

207
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,720
Like I finally got to create like the thing that I love, which is just those small, weird

208
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,320
universes filled with lots of dumb characters.

209
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,320
But yeah, I love that.

210
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,320
I love that kind of stuff.

211
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,120
Yeah, you're like, I mean, you're like involved in like so many like I'm jealous, like you're

212
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,120
in DuckTales.

213
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:46,920
You're like it's so many different things that we loved as kids.

214
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,360
You've gotten to be a part of it.

215
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,360
It's funny.

216
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:56,040
Yeah, I feel like I just got to be a fan.

217
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,760
I've gotten lucky as far as being a fan of a lot of things and getting to be getting

218
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,340
to be involved in a lot of those fandoms.

219
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:09,400
Can I ask, have you gotten like the secret Imagineering tour that you're not allowed

220
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,400
to talk about?

221
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:16,080
I mean, if there's one that I'm not allowed to talk about, no, but I've gotten like a

222
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,880
pretty cool like I've definitely gotten to see a lot of cool stuff at Disney as far as

223
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:25,760
like I got to go to Walt like that Walt's apartment once, which is pretty special, like

224
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:31,360
seeing that whole thing and just realizing like you're in this place that he'd been like,

225
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:39,960
it's just crazy how pristine it is and how well kept it is and all that stuff.

226
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,440
I've tried to get in to see the basketball hoop at the Matterhorn.

227
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,160
I have not been successful yet.

228
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,480
Yeah, trying to think of like other cool Club 33.

229
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,800
I've been to a bunch of that's like that's super fun.

230
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,000
And yeah, like a couple of weird places.

231
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,240
For me, it's more like when we got to do the DuckTales parade and like I got to go like

232
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:06,000
literally behind the scenes and just go walk around back there and see see them like at

233
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,280
that time building stuff and it was just nuts.

234
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:15,040
Then recently doing that shoot at night, like seeing Disney when it's closed and walking

235
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,880
around when it's closed and being there for the moment at sunrise when they turn the speakers

236
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,920
on and all the ambient sounds.

237
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,320
So all of a sudden it's silent and then five seconds later there's birds, people laughing

238
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,360
and like X-Wings flying by.

239
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,720
It was like hearing the ambiance sound kick in and realizing like, oh my gosh, like I

240
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,640
had no idea that like they're pumping in the sound of fun.

241
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:47,280
I don't think I realized that like people like there's there's like walla essentially

242
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,760
people laughing like, you know, it's like there's a little bit of like tone to it a

243
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,760
little.

244
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,440
Yeah, that's crazy.

245
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,040
Yeah, that's a ball court.

246
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,400
I think that basketball court is really off limits from what I understand.

247
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,520
Yeah, yeah, I keep trying.

248
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,280
I've come close, but somehow.

249
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,600
Yeah, if you take it like a salt like put it on the Internet, please.

250
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,720
You got it.

251
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,720
I will tear it.

252
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,720
I will tear it down.

253
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,080
Yes, this was for podcast.

254
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,360
The ride. Thank you.

255
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,080
Thank you. Yes, I will show you our signatures.

256
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:30,400
The parade is pretty amazing to feel like Disney royalty getting the circus like, were

257
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,360
you in what was the parade?

258
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:37,640
We were on a double decker bus, the whole cast of DuckTales and Goofy.

259
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,640
It was and it was nuts.

260
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,720
Donald and Scrooge were on another one.

261
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:49,960
It was crazy. It was really, really fun and wonderful.

262
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,560
Why was Goofy on yours and not Scrooge?

263
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,960
Scrooge was sort of leading the parade down walking.

264
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,800
And then I don't know why Donald wasn't on ours or I don't know.

265
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,560
But I was fine with Goofy. He was great.

266
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,640
You didn't put up a big fight about it.

267
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,920
I I did not make eye contact with Goofy.

268
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,960
OK, I would not look at him, share space with.

269
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,720
No, he was he was actually wonderful.

270
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,800
You do hear those stories about him like don't hand him a diet coke without a napkin

271
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,800
wrapped around. It's not what he has hands with.

272
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,240
He only has a finger.

273
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,800
Yeah, I mean, it's a good point.

274
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,840
Concerned giant, giant gloves, too.

275
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,640
Yeah, you'd want to take those off before consuming.

276
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,040
Well, yeah, that's all I mean.

277
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:44,560
I mean, yeah, what a like stacked line of stuff, let alone like now this is this.

278
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,520
You mentioned something I had a question about with the virtual reality experience

279
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,640
that like because I think I looked up a little bit of stuff and I saw the view

280
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,280
from your from your canteen, a Seasal Slacks canteen,

281
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,600
which does overlook the Millennium Falcon.

282
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,400
So it's like part of the complex of the ride that we're talking about.

283
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,080
But then like where that's what I can't picture is like, are there buildings over there?

284
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,360
And it's like up high.

285
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,880
Well, that's the thing is like he hits a ship.

286
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,480
His bar is a ship, so it moves and like that it land.

287
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,560
Yeah, it lands on top of like the like right behind the other canteen.

288
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,840
If you stand at the Millennium Falcon,

289
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:29,680
it's like where the like just to the right of the blast doors

290
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,480
is where it should be, like if it was really there.

291
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,760
But it's just it's just.

292
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,040
I don't think it'll ever be there, but like I wish someday.

293
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,640
Like in a place you can't see from that vantage point, like behind some like

294
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,200
like something jutting out of the building from where those windows are,

295
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,000
it would be right there.

296
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,920
Wow, which that's a whole OK.

297
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,760
So there's Ogas Cantina, which is a physical place in the park.

298
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,200
And then there's Cecil Slacks Cantina, which I'm sorry,

299
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:06,160
floated down and landed essentially on top of the existing.

300
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,280
The way it was explained to me is it's like a it's like a food truck.

301
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,080
Oh, OK. Sure, sure, sure.

302
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,400
Wow. Or one of those pedal bars in like Nashville or like.

303
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,880
There's just more pedal bars in Star Wars.

304
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,520
If they make me a costume, I will pedal bar every day.

305
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,640
Every day when I'm not working, I will go there and pedal around for free.

306
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,960
All right. You put it out there.

307
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,240
I did. I will. I'll do it.

308
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,040
I'm just happy Johnny did style.

309
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,280
They won't be able to get me to stop.

310
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,200
He's going to go at some point, too.

311
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:47,520
I look, I'm just happy that Ogas not getting undercut.

312
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,320
That was kind of my concern, like as if I was a business owner

313
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,720
and a similar, almost identically named business landed on top of my business.

314
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,880
And landed on top is a rude move.

315
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,440
It was a rude move.

316
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:07,160
Well, so anyway, and I guess in one connection point between that,

317
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,120
the Oculus experience, it's made by the same company.

318
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:16,520
They're the same wing of ILM that does the graphics for Smuggler's Run,

319
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,760
which is like this unprecedented,

320
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,400
like they've never had to do anything at this level before the level of,

321
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,960
you know, Insta response time on such a massive scale.

322
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,760
It's a hell of a it's a hell of a wing.

323
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,240
That's what I'm saying.

324
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,400
Yeah, job ILMX lab.

325
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,200
But so but so this this attraction.

326
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,920
Yeah, you want to talk about Smuggler's Run.

327
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:46,440
I mean, well, first of all, you like you got to do it pretty

328
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,720
early on in its existence.

329
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,880
Correctly, you were a guy pretty quick or even before it opened.

330
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,000
Yeah, I got to go.

331
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,800
I got to go two or three weeks before it opened and like walk around.

332
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:05,800
And it was insane because like I remember going like, there's no way

333
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,560
this is going to be done in three weeks.

334
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,080
Being like.

335
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,680
How a lot like like how how are you opening the doors

336
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,560
to this place in three weeks, like kind of feeling that way a little bit,

337
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,720
just because there was so much that they had to do.

338
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,760
And but I yeah, it was like, I think maybe one of the first people,

339
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:36,120
I mean, like in the couple days, like that got to ride it before it opened.

340
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,560
I did it with Donald Faison.

341
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,840
We went for resistance.

342
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:46,040
They actually like they brought us there to shoot like they wanted to shoot

343
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,360
us coming around the corner and seeing the Millennium Falcon for the first time

344
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,400
and then doing the ride.

345
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:57,280
And they literally just never pressed record.

346
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,040
So we had to do it again.

347
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,920
Like we came around the corner, we freaked out, and they just act

348
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:07,040
like that dumb thing that never, ever happens as they weren't recording

349
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,400
or they just didn't get the shot of us.

350
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,400
So we had to do it again.

351
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,920
And like, I don't think it was very real the second time.

352
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,520
So they ended up not using it.

353
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,480
But but we got to do the ride and it was like it was amazing.

354
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:26,480
And now I've been on it 50 times and to go back there again afterwards

355
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,880
and to see the place like finished so quickly, like it was like what they did

356
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,480
was insane and now having gone back a couple of times.

357
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,840
Since then, it just keeps getting it just keeps like

358
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,240
they just keep adding to it and making it better and making certain pieces

359
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,760
different and it's a real fun, beautiful place to walk around.

360
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,800
But that ride itself is my I just took my four year old daughter on it

361
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,320
and she was not a fan.

362
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,720
Oh, interesting.

363
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,320
Well, how did how did this play out?

364
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,320
Well, I wouldn't say that.

365
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,440
I wouldn't say she was not a fan.

366
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,400
I would I would say she much like it was over and she was like, cool, we did it.

367
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,080
Like, OK, not like mind blown forever change.

368
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,680
I think she was a little bit like that was insane.

369
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,400
I think I was in a real spaceship.

370
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,760
And if that was true, it rocked way too much like for her.

371
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,720
But it was like too much information almost.

372
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,200
Yeah, I think it's also like

373
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,800
I forget that there's an age where you're like, so wait a minute.

374
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,920
I just went into space.

375
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,440
Yeah, like it was very real.

376
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,920
Like that's a very real thing.

377
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,560
Right. Oh, yeah.

378
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,600
How are like what are the lines in general?

379
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,040
Like like meeting characters?

380
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,800
Is that like I met the character like like how long?

381
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,800
Oh, yeah.

382
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,640
For yeah, fully Chewbacca.

383
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,240
Chewbacca is a man.

384
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,560
Nice man. Yeah.

385
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,920
Sure. Yeah, there's no like.

386
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:55,000
Yeah, no, she she if she believes that she just wants it to be real, too.

387
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,920
She's very fun and imaginative.

388
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,000
I think if I told her there was somebody inside Chewbacca, she'd be like.

389
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,800
I know, I know, I know.

390
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,920
Just let's pretend.

391
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,600
That's a better place to be.

392
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,880
Like, why did we I don't want to write.

393
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,920
I wish I bought it all when I went in.

394
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,320
Can I reset my memory and just like believe that it's Mickey Mouse again?

395
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,040
That's where I live.

396
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,960
That's the space I inhabit is that close as you.

397
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,640
Let's just all pretend it's real.

398
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,360
Yeah, for the rest of the we're not going to talk about imagineers and all that.

399
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,000
It's just pretend we never heard that word.

400
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,120
That was that's I would do that.

401
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,520
If if if I didn't know any better and I was a kid, I would tell.

402
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,440
I could go back in time.

403
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,640
I'd go, maybe go imagine here this time.

404
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,040
You got another chance around.

405
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,080
That might be fun. Sure. Oh, true.

406
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,120
Yeah, absolutely.

407
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,440
We believe in this podcast.

408
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,480
It's not too late for us to do it.

409
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,360
Oh, dear. I realize that.

410
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,440
Like that. That's another thing like that.

411
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,680
Star Wars did. Holy crap.

412
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,760
Like I went to

413
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:01,120
the opening day of Galaxy's Edge, and I just happened to be there

414
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,320
the same day as Jet Lucas,

415
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,440
George Lucas's son, who I had met recently at.

416
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:13,000
At I had met briefly at Star Wars Celebration.

417
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,760
And he came up to me and he was like,

418
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,600
you played my dad on SNL and I was like, oh, no, like he's going to be angry.

419
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,480
But he was actually really cool and really nice about it.

420
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:29,720
But I ended up spending the day with Jet Lucas and like the guys he was with

421
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:36,400
at Disney and this older guy with a mustache and like another friend.

422
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,040
And they were we were hanging out all day.

423
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,880
We did the rides. We did Smuggler's Run and we did it twice.

424
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,040
And then like I started driving and I was having way too much fun.

425
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,040
And the guy, the older guy with the mustache got a little like,

426
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,680
hey, man, like, I don't think we should take this more seriously.

427
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:57,000
He was very concerned about my my

428
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,160
that I wasn't taking the ride as seriously as I should have.

429
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,600
Can I say I have a guess who this is?

430
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,000
But I think we all have a guess who you're talking about.

431
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,840
But keep going.

432
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,680
And I was like, wow, OK.

433
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,440
But he was very nice.

434
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,560
We had fun all day.

435
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,040
I asked him a bunch of questions.

436
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,920
No idea that this man was who he was.

437
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,880
And then we finally, towards the end of the day, went on the Indiana Jones ride.

438
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,160
And he was talking about pointless stuff.

439
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,160
And he's like, and when I built this and I was just like,

440
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,360
what do you mean you built this?

441
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,480
And he was it was Tony Baxter,

442
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,720
the guy. And I was just like, what?

443
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,040
And like that, I thought about the all the other questions

444
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,000
I could have been asking all day.

445
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,960
I love that he wanted to take this ride seriously.

446
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,280
Yeah, yeah. What does that mean?

447
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,800
He was like, can you not be the pilot?

448
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,760
Ben was a much better.

449
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,960
I was with Ben Schwartz, too.

450
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,680
And he's like, Ben is a much better pilot.

451
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,800
Let's let Ben drive.

452
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,520
We're trying to get we're trying to get two coaxiums here.

453
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,600
We got to the first time we only got he was very angry

454
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,960
with how many coaxiums I got as a pilot.

455
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,080
I love that.

456
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,960
But I do, too.

457
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,120
I'm trying to be funny.

458
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,680
It was it was he was wonderful.

459
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,800
He was of course, a whole accidental day with with Tony Baxter.

460
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,320
I think that we would like pay, you know, too much like like twenty

461
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:21,240
thousand dollars at an auction for same same.

462
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,920
It's like I said earlier, it's not lost on me.

463
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:29,520
I I I realize how insane that was.

464
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,240
I've been lucky enough to have a lot of insane days like that.

465
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,160
Yeah, sure. Yeah, that's bonkers.

466
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,160
I'm still just trying to get over that George Lucas named his son Jet.

467
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,360
That's like a cool name.

468
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,280
Yeah, it's pretty dope.

469
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,000
Yeah. Yeah.

470
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,880
And famous Jackson and him.

471
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,520
And it goes, those are the only jets out there.

472
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,320
One's fictional. Yeah.

473
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,280
Well, that yeah, that's amazing.

474
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,800
What a day.

475
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,840
So so all right.

476
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,920
So you've done this.

477
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,000
You've done this right a bunch.

478
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,200
Do you feel like you have gained any wisdom on how to?

479
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,480
I mean, it seems like opening day, you were already like you maybe knew

480
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,400
the difference between one and two coaxiums.

481
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,000
Like, do you have you gotten any better at this attraction?

482
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,920
Yes. Wow.

483
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:21,640
The first time I tried it, we only got to I think we only got to do it once or twice.

484
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,200
And.

485
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,760
No one kind of like it was a very weird experience, because it wasn't like

486
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:33,320
you you're going to Disneyland and somebody's walking you through the whole

487
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,120
thing and you get the whole experience and you're waiting and you get excited

488
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,480
and then you get on the ride and somebody tells you what to do.

489
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,840
It was very much like wait in this all purpose room.

490
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,760
And then they just brought me into the thing and they were like,

491
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,960
all right, we're going to start shooting.

492
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,200
And like no one explained how to do it.

493
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,480
So it just turned on and we were like, what?

494
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,200
And like we just crashed the whole time

495
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,160
the first time that they did it and laughed.

496
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,560
And then the second time we kind of did it.

497
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,280
But now weirdly like.

498
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,800
It's crazy to say, but like I've gotten to do it alone a bunch,

499
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:15,600
like like a couple of times where like it was just me

500
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,280
literally holding both controls of the pilot thing.

501
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,760
And just flying that, like I've gotten to do that like five or six times.

502
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,360
And like that is super fun.

503
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,960
Even the characters in the movies didn't get to do that.

504
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:36,120
So it's always funny to like take your time and try and do it

505
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,800
and not have a different family that's not yours

506
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,720
begging you to not crash.

507
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,800
And like it was it was fun.

508
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,680
I it's it's it's amazing.

509
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,440
And then when you realize like

510
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,800
that you do it a couple of times and like you get like,

511
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,560
oh, it's just that's all it is, is like a big TV.

512
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:59,600
Yeah. And like it's amazing what how much it just transports

513
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,000
transports you instantly into that world.

514
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,520
Right. Yeah. I'm going to insist on doing that next time when I'm full.

515
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,680
There's a cockpit full of people.

516
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,920
I control both. Honestly, easier.

517
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,920
I think it's much easier to control both.

518
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,880
And you feel like you're driving the Millennium.

519
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,920
And it's crazy. And you feel like it.

520
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:22,920
And it's a it's a real it's a real fun time for adults to be children.

521
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:30,080
Of the three positions, pilot, gunner, engineer, do you have a preference?

522
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,280
Pilot. I mean, yeah.

523
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,760
Yeah. If you're yeah.

524
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,880
Yeah. I feel like if you're a gunner or an engineer, you're you're

525
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,000
enjoying the pilot, have a good time while you go like that.

526
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,040
Yeah. You're you're still pretty great.

527
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,840
It's fine to hit the buttons.

528
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,320
All the switches and they say there's like over 200 buttons

529
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,080
and switches that are functional, like that you can press in that car.

530
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:01,760
Oh, wow. But I didn't know that they all do something.

531
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,560
It's hard to tell what exactly it's like.

532
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,200
You have three primate.

533
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,720
If you're in the game for button pressing engineers, really,

534
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,480
if you just want to do as many as possible, even if you don't know

535
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,360
what the hell they're doing, then engineers the spot for you.

536
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:19,560
When I when I was at SL, I wrote a sketch about when Force Awakens came out.

537
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:23,880
It was like a trailer and they built the Millennium Falcon cockpit for us

538
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:29,440
to shoot in. And like I I was like, can I take this home?

539
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,960
Like it was it wouldn't have fit in here.

540
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,160
Like, well, it would have been here.

541
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:38,560
But like I went like, I really want to take this home and sit in it and keep it.

542
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,280
But that that did not happen.

543
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,160
I took the R2D2.

544
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,720
Oh, wow.

545
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,760
Wait, is that like a like a full that's like it was supposed to be the real R2 in the.

546
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,840
Yeah, I have it downstairs in my garage.

547
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,360
I'll show it to you later.

548
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,920
Wow. Wow.

549
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,280
That's I. OK.

550
00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:00,080
So in terms of like because, yeah, I have to admit that I don't feel like I've

551
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,960
I don't think I have any more like perspective any time I go on

552
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,480
as to like how to improve my performance.

553
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,480
I think, you know, if you're doing multiple doing different positions every time,

554
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:15,720
it can be it can get confusing, like how to, you know, advance your skills or whatever.

555
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:22,040
But do you have any do you know any like specific tips you could say of how to

556
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:26,840
is it just about positive mental attitude and I think it's about

557
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:32,400
just positivity in life, meditating and staying in a healthy lifestyle

558
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,360
and, yeah, taking care of others and

559
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,040
just life in general.

560
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,960
The better you are as a human, the better you'll be at Smuggler's Run.

561
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,240
Smuggler's Run.

562
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,440
I know there's like a like a Chewie,

563
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:51,960
like there's like if you press a certain set of buttons before the ride starts,

564
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:57,600
Chewbacca, it's Chewbacca make sounds the whole time in the ride.

565
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,480
Like you're like he's he's there with you as your co-pilot.

566
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,240
There's a lot learned about this.

567
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,480
I didn't know about this before. Chewie mode.

568
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,040
You know, Chewie mode, Jason.

569
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:11,840
Yeah, if you you need like a full cockpit to do it, because like you have to.

570
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,000
It's like the old Konami where you have to like

571
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,640
like do everything, like press these buttons before you hit this.

572
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,640
But like wait for them to tell.

573
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,760
Don't hit it when they tell you to hit some other stuff and then

574
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,080
steer it all the way to different sides.

575
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:33,640
And then basically you can do the whole ride with just Chewie screaming at you.

576
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:38,160
And I'm going with family for the first time soon who haven't been on this.

577
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,040
And I am tempted like, guys, we got to do Chewie mode.

578
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,280
That was the first experience.

579
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:47,440
It's just no instructions, just a Wookie screaming at you the whole time.

580
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,840
Might be easier, though.

581
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,680
I mean, yeah, yeah, maybe.

582
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,800
I have to run Jason, you have to run drills beforehand

583
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,040
to make sure they know how to do it.

584
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:00,840
Oh, my family already loves my bullshit when theme park planning.

585
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:06,320
Like, we have to do a cheat code for this ride.

586
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,720
I'm pretty sure I would get run out of town.

587
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,560
Sure.

588
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,360
Oh, but the whole ride is getting barked instructions anyway.

589
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,960
So just, you know, you do some extra barking at the top.

590
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,640
That's true. But I mean, I don't want to rob them of Jim Cummings

591
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,280
great performance as Hondo Anaka.

592
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,680
This is very funny in the pre-show and in the ride.

593
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,920
He has some great lines.

594
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,640
That's fantastic. Yeah, yeah.

595
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,640
If we step out of the cockpit for a second, I mean, this is one of the great

596
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,720
things about this ride is Hondo Anaka.

597
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,840
Is it the we've said this before, I want to say is maybe the second

598
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:47,920
most advanced animatronic in in all the Disney parks, with maybe the Navi

599
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,960
shaman of song being number one.

600
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,640
Does anyone know if I'm right or wrong on this?

601
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,200
I can cross that. Yeah, I think that's.

602
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,560
I think you're close. What about the flipping Spider-Man?

603
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,160
Oh, wait. Oh, is that it now?

604
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,800
Oh, maybe that's it now. You're right.

605
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,880
That's pretty advanced.

606
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,120
Is that technically the same cat?

607
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,000
It's like a stunt tronic.

608
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,640
Yeah, that's a different category.

609
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,720
Is it a difference?

610
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,280
Best supporting animatronic. Yeah.

611
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,200
I'm on the secret life of pets ride at Universal, like my voice.

612
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,040
And like those animatronics are insane.

613
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,400
I just did it for the first time, like two weeks ago.

614
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,480
And it's first of all, it's bonkers

615
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,800
to know that there's a room a couple of miles away from my house that I'm

616
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,040
Mel, the pug dog in it.

617
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:41,680
And like in the very beginning of the ride, I'm talking and you hear me run,

618
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,520
like seeing my character on a screen.

619
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:47,040
But then there's like these animatronics of the dogs like popping up.

620
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,760
So there's just like a lot of panting and like weird dog sounds.

621
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,200
But then there's one where I'm just on like a spin wheel,

622
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,040
like a like a fireworks wheel.

623
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,880
And I'm going, whoa, whoa, whoa, just like screaming.

624
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,800
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

625
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,920
And I realized that like there's just a room

626
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,880
a couple of miles away where I'm just my voice.

627
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,040
I'm just screaming all day long.

628
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,080
And it's like that's it's terrifying.

629
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,600
It's like Black Mirror in a way.

630
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,440
It's like that's so bizarre, but it's also wonderful and crazy.

631
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,200
You're like, I have to drive to my screaming room now.

632
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,480
Well, no, I was like I was like I was like,

633
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,280
I can't wait to bring my daughter on this ride.

634
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,600
And we were doing it.

635
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,280
And she kind of heard the voice and went like, look, like what's happening here.

636
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,360
And then I realized, like, yeah, this is playing 24 hours a day.

637
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,920
Isn't that bizarre?

638
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:38,560
Geez, this is something I've always wondered, the perspective of somebody

639
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:42,840
who has achieved this dream of like, yeah, there's this place all day.

640
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:46,400
And which is awesome to talk to somebody who's like clearly thinks it's

641
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,120
thinks it's insane because I feel like there are people who like,

642
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,400
what do I have to do now?

643
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,160
They phone it in.

644
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,560
They don't like I never went.

645
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,200
I don't care.

646
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,840
It's cool that you're like thinking about the oddity of that.

647
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,520
It's it's crazy.

648
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:01,000
Like I remember recording it and being like, this is this is not.

649
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,640
Yeah, it's it's all it's all insane.

650
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:08,760
The permanence to it, like presumably people are pulling up, you know,

651
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,400
the movie or things you've been in all the time, but you don't think about it.

652
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,680
It's like, you know, that feels like scatter shot as opposed to like,

653
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:18,720
this is a committed this is a robot that only exists to yell in my voice.

654
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:22,880
It's it struck me as as an odd thing to have to deal

655
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,760
with, just go like, this is so cool.

656
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,880
I was I couldn't wait to do this thing.

657
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:31,520
And then the inevitable existentialism

658
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:36,400
of just the when I just sitting there looking at this thing spinning and going,

659
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,680
oh, poor guy all day.

660
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:37,960
Huh?

661
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:44,880
It's like a sad like you cloned yourself and it's like it's like,

662
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,360
well, it's not that's a very black mirror.

663
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:52,000
Like you're kind of me, but you don't have my humanity and experiences.

664
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,400
Poor guy. Yeah, like I definitely I should talk to my therapist about that.

665
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,400
Like the fact that like I get upset when I hear

666
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,800
like the Spanish version where like somebody else is doing the voice.

667
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,760
I'm like, that's my dog.

668
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,840
Why are you?

669
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:10,600
Why do you why do you sound like I get mad when other people in other countries

670
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,120
start voicing my cartoon characters?

671
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:16,000
I go like, oh, no, I'll learn the language if I have to.

672
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,640
I will phonetically step through.

673
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,400
I will butcher this language.

674
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,480
That's what it takes.

675
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,680
I will. I will hurt your people just to prove a point.

676
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,960
I have in terms of voicing things.

677
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,720
Here's a question that maybe we should have asked right at the top.

678
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,280
Are you in Smuggler's Run?

679
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,720
No, you are not.

680
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,440
OK, because I started thinking about this because I first of all,

681
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,200
there is a website that says that you were on it.

682
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,280
And I was like, this doesn't seem like particularly vetted.

683
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:53,200
And I and I that is a I think what they're talking about is the in the queue

684
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,840
when there's like the workers who are messing up the vehicles

685
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,640
and, you know, like having problems in what is it?

686
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,320
Oh, not good transport solutions.

687
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:08,240
And I have wondered if the aforementioned Ben Schwartz is a voice in this.

688
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,480
Do you know if he is in it?

689
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,280
No, I don't believe he is.

690
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,320
Wow. Wow.

691
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,440
We were we were on it with our friend Griffin Newman.

692
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,400
He thought he spotted Ben. Oh, yes. You know, yeah.

693
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,160
He thought maybe he spotted Ben in it.

694
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,600
And then I saw it reported as fact on some website,

695
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,520
but it was like not the most vetted website.

696
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,800
So I'm glad we've gotten down to the nitty gritty here.

697
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,360
I apologize that you're not on it.

698
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,000
And I played Darth Vader on it.

699
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,720
Oh, that's OK.

700
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,440
I figured out that she could.

701
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,120
Yeah.

702
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,840
Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right.

703
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:46,160
And then you have to have six thousand dollars in cash in a shoe box

704
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,000
and just leave it there.

705
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,920
Still less than the hotel room.

706
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,800
Yeah.

707
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,760
It's a steal in terms of.

708
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,520
OK, so so other stuff that we covered that you're not.

709
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,400
It's not you got a business on that.

710
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,800
Oh, scores.

711
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:10,760
Here's this is something that I wanted because it's like scores from New York

712
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,320
in the 80s. Yes. Yeah.

713
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,800
Let's get any experience there as a child.

714
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,320
It's a wild place, baby.

715
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,560
We got to get back to those days.

716
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,160
My New York, Giuliani missed it all.

717
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,760
Oh, Giuliani.

718
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,680
I think part of the reason I've had trouble telling

719
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,800
if I am doing a good job on this attraction or not is like

720
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,960
as that as opposed to a Buzz Lightyear

721
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,840
type ride, they tell you there's a list.

722
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,960
They tell you what score you got and what that means.

723
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,600
And I don't really know what is a good score.

724
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:53,240
Now I realize this how many coaxium you get is part of it.

725
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,240
I guess like so.

726
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,880
So who is the guy you can get?

727
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,880
Oh, I've heard I've only seen two.

728
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,360
I've only gotten two once.

729
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,960
And that was with Tony Baxter.

730
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:05,440
And he was very impressed that we got to like it felt like

731
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,360
an achievement he was super psyched about.

732
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,280
Wow. Do you know Josh Shipley as well?

733
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,840
The name sounds familiar. Yeah, he was there, too.

734
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,360
He was there. Wonderful guys.

735
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,640
They were I've kept in touch with Joshua a lot.

736
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,840
They're fantastic.

737
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:25,720
But yeah, it does seem.

738
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,480
That there's a lot of graphs and a lot of information to do.

739
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,400
If you don't know ahead of time, it's a lot of information

740
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,640
to take in on the score.

741
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:37,840
I feel like it's always like 70 percent no matter what you do

742
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,480
or 20 percent accuracy no matter what you do.

743
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,120
Or at least for me. Yeah, that's kind of our feeling.

744
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,440
Yes. That like you're sort of damned if you do damned if you don't.

745
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:50,120
And like no matter what, Hondo's taking your money, which I guess is part of.

746
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,400
Look, that's just that's how Hondo plays it.

747
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:57,360
But also like you just went like this, like if you just put your hands up

748
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:01,080
and never everybody did that, no matter you'd get 30 percent every time.

749
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,600
Yeah, yeah.

750
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,280
There's videos of that on YouTube.

751
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,840
Like you can watch videos of our group didn't touch anything.

752
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,800
And here's what happened.

753
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,000
Like because they sort of I guess this thing is kind of like

754
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:17,800
bowling if you put the bumpers up like it's like sort of there's a thing

755
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,360
it's going to do and there's variance within that.

756
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,480
But you can't like get an F.

757
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,560
Really, you can't like completely bomb out outside of the stores

758
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:30,080
that you would put a quarter in and like go like it's the most expensive

759
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,840
one of those like little rock machine.

760
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,920
Yeah.

761
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,840
Rocking horsey machine.

762
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,600
It's like they're trying to do.

763
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,520
I mean, this is a whole thing.

764
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,920
They're trying to make it like realistic, quote unquote.

765
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,400
So it's they're not going to say like here completely grade you

766
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,200
in a way a video game would.

767
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,320
So they're trying to have it a little bit both ways.

768
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,960
It's it's and being able to do it a bunch of times,

769
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:57,960
I would say if you're able to get to do it more than once,

770
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,280
don't worry about the game.

771
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,640
Just enjoy how cool it looks.

772
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:08,680
Yeah, yeah, that really is kind of part of how like

773
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
all the stuff is there for you and you have to do it at certain times.

774
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,200
But just like looking around at just how

775
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:18,960
I just being in it, I really enjoy the stress.

776
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,360
I feel like can take out some of the fun for people

777
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:25,600
because some people find everything very stressful in there,

778
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,520
especially if you're like shoulders

779
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,560
locking up while you're hitting the guns or something.

780
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,920
It also happens super quick.

781
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,360
They get you in and get you out of there.

782
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,520
So yeah, that is true.

783
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,160
There's something about that that you can't like.

784
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,840
I mean, maybe you got it the first time you went because they were filming you,

785
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:44,280
but like that you it's tough to have a minute of like, wow,

786
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,960
and in the cockpit because it's like, OK, sit down, press the button,

787
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,800
start doing it.

788
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:53,560
You don't get to enjoy yourself to to to sit there and go, wow,

789
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,760
which is what it really is for.

790
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,520
And this is the best part about it.

791
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,680
Yeah. And you do.

792
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,200
If you don't know the rules, it's hard. Yeah.

793
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:07,240
You end up with like an extra minute or two in the hold in like the lounge area

794
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,960
that that I thought was smart, like holding like they assign you your your party.

795
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:19,520
Everyone gets a, you know, card with their group color and what your role is.

796
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,120
And you can always like trade it if it's, you know,

797
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,920
you know, everyone or you're want to talk to strangers,

798
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:29,760
but you can sit at the hollow chess board and take a picture.

799
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,160
You usually have enough time to linger there.

800
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,760
I would argue, though, that's like the highlight of the whole thing.

801
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,320
And I'm not even trying to put the ride down.

802
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,040
That's like the whole I wish you had like 10 more minutes.

803
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:43,080
I want to I literally want to touch everything every time I go in. Yeah.

804
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,680
I think I've gotten to spend like without exaggerating,

805
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,800
like a few hours in that room in total.

806
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:53,840
And it really is that like just like when you sit there and now you go like,

807
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:58,360
like now when I go there with friends or family, I go, come here, like, look at this.

808
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,400
Because like just like these they have these little sections

809
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:05,320
or like little things that Easter eggs and whatnot or little.

810
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,960
It's just so well, the people who built it loved it.

811
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,120
And you can tell. Yeah, that's I this is going to sound controversial,

812
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:18,520
but the best ride in Galaxy's Edge is the waiting area for the Millennium Falcon.

813
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,960
I mean, I don't.

814
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,760
That's what you saw all over Instagram and Twitter.

815
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,040
Like, I mean, that was like that first month or so.

816
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,680
Now you sort of accept it as part of the fabric of the park,

817
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,880
which is what happens to these attractions.

818
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,880
But like it felt like the like it's cooler than any concert

819
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,520
that was going on at the time.

820
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,600
Like, yes. And when you check Instagram, oh, they got to go and they got to go.

821
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,840
And this famous person got to go.

822
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,840
My friend got to go.

823
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,560
And I was just like, it was really in the air.

824
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:47,280
That room got to touch Hans blankets that are sitting on a shelf

825
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,920
and they're hard for some reason.

826
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,280
I guess they don't want to get it like soiled, but

827
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:57,840
we also I I had the very odd experience that the three of us,

828
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:01,520
I was the first one to go on it because we were there opening day as well.

829
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,960
And we got into Ogas pretty early.

830
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,560
And I had already guzzled a blue milk from the stand.

831
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,440
And then I drank the one they had in the bar.

832
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,120
And I was like, I have to use the refresher.

833
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,160
I have to use the restroom.

834
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:22,840
And they had not they were still figuring out like the get back into Ogas,

835
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,760
but they were at the like and they were they were like, hey, it's opening day.

836
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,360
If you leave, you can't come back in.

837
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,040
And I'm like, I have accepted that.

838
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,600
I got 30 minutes in here. I have to go.

839
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:38,560
So while I was waiting for Mike and Scott and everyone else to like finish,

840
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:43,200
I just walked onto the single rack around the Millennium Falcon.

841
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,160
And then when they came out, what did you do?

842
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,600
They're like, what did you do?

843
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,760
And I was like, oh, I went on the rock before anyone else.

844
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,400
I was engineer.

845
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,120
I used the restrooms. I walked around a little so.

846
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,560
And we were so mad.

847
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,760
That's a bold move. Yeah.

848
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,880
What are you? You sold out your bros.

849
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,080
Unbelievable.

850
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,480
Well, I mean, we went and did it.

851
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,400
But like, I mean, I had to do something.

852
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:11,880
But thanks to the revolutionary like turntable system, this ride really,

853
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:16,520
really the wait times are never too bad because they have so many cockpits.

854
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,760
Running at one given time.

855
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,040
Yeah, sure. That's a good thing about it, for sure.

856
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,280
Yeah, those lines are not crazy.

857
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,520
That single riders is really fast.

858
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:28,760
I got to walk the whole rise of resistance before it was open,

859
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,760
but I have never been on it.

860
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,120
Never been on. Wow.

861
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,920
Really? Wow. Wow.

862
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,760
But you saw. OK, so what state is it at?

863
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:40,920
Is there any video or is it just like they're still there, like finishing and lighting sets?

864
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,040
How would you say that again?

865
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,600
Oh, just like you walk through it.

866
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,720
Yeah, yeah. What state was it in?

867
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,800
Um, shambles.

868
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,520
Well, it was it was, you know, they didn't open for a year after that.

869
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,840
It was it was they had like, I think it was like the week

870
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:02,080
they realized that it was not going to be open and that it was going to be a very,

871
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:05,880
very long time before it was going to be open.

872
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:09,680
So, yeah, it was like not built.

873
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,320
Right. Right.

874
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,560
So are you looking at like

875
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,640
skeleton frame of Adad and that kind of stuff like this?

876
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,160
Yeah, like, but not that.

877
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:23,160
Yeah, that and like what I definitely remember was the because I've seen it online now.

878
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,840
The section where is it Admiral Akbar that's in like that ship?

879
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,280
Well, it's a different.

880
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,480
It's not. It's not.

881
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,480
Yeah, it's not Akbar, but it's a Mon Calamari. Yes.

882
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:39,520
That section, like standing there and going like, well,

883
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,840
this is going to look cool when it's done and then seeing it and going like, whoa.

884
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,600
I didn't see that at all.

885
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,240
Wow. Wow. But you just walked hallways.

886
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,960
That's that's pretty nuts.

887
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,160
It was fun. Yeah.

888
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:55,120
Like hard hat, like people still doing construction, like people literally go like,

889
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,680
give me a nail because he died.

890
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,440
We're opening soon. Like it was it was not.

891
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:07,000
Wow. It was the the the the tone definitely from the construction guys

892
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,440
definitely felt like what we don't want is a bunch of actors in the way right now.

893
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,760
What we don't need is that because we're trying to get this thing built.

894
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,960
Yeah, yeah, cute. Take your pictures.

895
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,360
Yeah, I get it. It's it's just patient.

896
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,080
But that's like that's like being almost that's as close

897
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:27,080
you're going to get to being like on the Death Star as it's being built.

898
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,640
This is like episode three.

899
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,800
Yeah. You were you were in a prequel basically.

900
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,640
Being in.

901
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,960
Gosh, what's the name of it?

902
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:41,840
Doc, on doors before it was open, like that was.

903
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:46,400
Oh, yeah. When they were still like they still had like a cart with all the stuff

904
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,240
like that they were putting up on the walls, like they were deciding

905
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:52,560
what was going to go where like seeing that was was pretty cool.

906
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:56,800
Especially now going in there now and seeing it all done and going like, well.

907
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,640
So they had like all this like all of his like collectibles

908
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,120
essentially like on the ground and they were like, decide it was like when I got

909
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:07,880
there, they were deciding what was going where and putting it in.

910
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,360
Putting stuff up. Wow. Wow.

911
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,600
Which it's like exactly the same in Florida.

912
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:15,560
So do they have to have them on conference call?

913
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:18,240
Probably. You know, we're putting it on the right wall. Is that OK?

914
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:22,560
I'm sure they have plans and like it's all mapped out for them.

915
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:27,120
But I remember them saying that helmet and that gun is going to be in a new

916
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,200
Disney plus series. And I was like, I don't care.

917
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,440
And it was the Mandalorian helmet and the gun.

918
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,520
And I was like, I don't know what that is.

919
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,240
And I don't care.

920
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:37,480
Like you kick the helmet.

921
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,440
Yeah.

922
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,920
They're going to come to me.

923
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,040
Stupid. No one's going to like this garbage.

924
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,600
I was just listening to it.

925
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,160
Let me bring up Griffin Newman's name again.

926
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,400
I was I was really listening to an episode, his podcast, Blank Check,

927
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,760
where they were talking about solo and I'll explain why in a second.

928
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:01,880
But on that episode, he was like he there was sort of a like tossed off like,

929
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,840
oh, yeah, Jon Favre is doing a show for Disney Plus.

930
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:07,760
And I remember how like, oh, yeah, that's weird that like nobody really thought

931
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,560
much of that, just like, sure, that'll be fine.

932
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,960
And then it's the hugest thing.

933
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,800
I remember thinking about it and not wanting to think because I was like

934
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,760
live action Star Wars on TV has like,

935
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,640
you know, you either have to be the Mandalorian or it's not going to work.

936
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,960
Right. Yeah. Yeah.

937
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,560
Done like at the top quality.

938
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,720
And that hadn't been that hadn't been done yet.

939
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,640
So it was like I remember being like, well, we'll see.

940
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,680
It was like almost not wanting to talk about it for fear.

941
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:39,080
That it wouldn't be everything I hoped it was and turned out to

942
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,760
and turned out that's what it was.

943
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:44,920
Well, and they George Lucas talked about like Star Wars TV show

944
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:47,800
Star Wars for years, right? Like, yeah, yeah.

945
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,160
They came close a couple of times. Yeah. Yeah.

946
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,600
They had like 60 scripts written or something crazy, like 50.

947
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,120
I think that's I think I'm right.

948
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,720
You are. ago. Yeah.

949
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:00,680
I had like but it was like the budget was like so high for each episode.

950
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,080
They were like, oh, we can't do this.

951
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,320
Yeah. You're doing it now.

952
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,640
And he's back now, which is great.

953
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,720
George's well, he's back. Yeah.

954
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:09,960
He's always around.

955
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:14,080
I like the idea that he's hanging around and at least influencing in some capacity.

956
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:17,840
I mean, I like seeing him with like the baby Grogu and stuff on that.

957
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:20,240
I like that.

958
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,800
I say I say give him his own give him his own series.

959
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,160
Let him do what he wants again.

960
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,600
I completely agree.

961
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,680
I think George should do.

962
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:30,280
Yeah, I think George should have like three series now.

963
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:31,480
He should be more busy.

964
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,120
Like he's trying to get away from doing it.

965
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:36,440
But I think you should just make him like punish him with more work.

966
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,280
I want to make him hate it again.

967
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:41,000
Yeah, exactly. Exactly what I'm saying.

968
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:47,080
Let me bring up why I was why I was re listening to Blankchap

969
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:50,640
because Griffin filled in a big hole for me about this attraction

970
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,840
because we took him on and we went a couple months ago.

971
00:49:54,120 --> 00:50:00,360
And I was saying how I'm a little vexed by the coaxium.

972
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:03,840
Like, why is so much hinging on the coaxium?

973
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:07,400
And he said, oh, here's what you are realizing.

974
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,400
This is a solo thing.

975
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,560
Coaxium is big and solo.

976
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:14,240
And admittedly, I had not seen the film solo.

977
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,840
And now I have flipped through the parts of solo that apply to coaxium.

978
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:24,520
I've learned so much more about coaxium, such as that you have to store it cold

979
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,720
or it'll blow your whole ship up.

980
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:30,440
So now I think I've gotten the coaxium education that I needed.

981
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:31,800
And I appreciate coaxium.

982
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:35,480
And now I look forward to pursuing coaxium the next time I go on.

983
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,440
Yes, I also think and this is

984
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,960
I don't think I'm talking out of school.

985
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,240
I think this is something that's known.

986
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:49,120
But like it's I think Disney like Galaxy's Edge in and of itself is like

987
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:52,040
the Disney version of Star Wars.

988
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,040
Like you don't see Leia, you don't see.

989
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:54,920
You don't see Han.

990
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,040
You don't see all those guys.

991
00:50:56,040 --> 00:51:00,960
And like the reason why there's Hondo and coaxium

992
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:06,760
and that version of Chewbacca and it's because it's all from the new Disney owned stuff.

993
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:11,760
Like it's like so that's why they had to mine all the stuff from like solo.

994
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,440
And like there's no.

995
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:20,960
George Lucas, Star Wars to Galaxy's Edge, it's almost all Disney.

996
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,440
Star Wars, yeah, little references.

997
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:28,320
Yeah, but it's but it's like the main characters are people they could legally

998
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,400
or less expensively less expensive.

999
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:33,640
Yeah. Oh, sure.

1000
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,120
Using licensing.

1001
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,280
It's coax coax.

1002
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,760
They own coaxium, not kyber crystals.

1003
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,320
Maybe I don't know.

1004
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:41,800
I don't know.

1005
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,080
I think they're selling kyber crystals, though.

1006
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:47,160
Well, I think maybe that was because of Rogue One, like they were allowed to use

1007
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:51,400
like the kyber crystals, like name or so, but it had something to do with like

1008
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:56,840
a lot of the main characters and stuff was chosen

1009
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:01,320
because they already owned it, so it was less expensive to use.

1010
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:02,920
Yeah, that makes sense.

1011
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,480
Yeah. And they could like maybe start.

1012
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,200
That's why there's no fresh.

1013
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:11,360
Yeah, no, no, none of these legend characters like legacy characters, kind of.

1014
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,640
Like they're there, but, you know, you don't see them walking around.

1015
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,040
That's why we get Kylo and Rey and.

1016
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:19,320
Sure, yeah.

1017
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:20,640
That lot.

1018
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:24,640
Now, we're of the kind of stupid opinion of that.

1019
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:28,640
That is now I respect the, you know, like the story in the world

1020
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,800
that they've weaved, but I think we feel well, I don't know.

1021
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,040
Why don't you just throw them all in, though?

1022
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:33,560
All right. All right.

1023
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:36,480
So you had your first couple of years where like, all right, now, yeah.

1024
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,920
Looks around and Amidala's around.

1025
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:41,040
I feel like it'll get there.

1026
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,000
It'll get there at some point.

1027
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,600
Like I'm talking all of it.

1028
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:47,920
I'm talking the breakfast cereals, the holiday special.

1029
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,720
The games.

1030
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,400
That's a gesture.

1031
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,760
Yeah. Diner owner.

1032
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:56,280
Yeah. You're that you win for best back wall.

1033
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,120
That's my entire office downstairs.

1034
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,480
Oh, the toys, everything you've done.

1035
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,280
That's good. Yeah.

1036
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,920
Yeah. It is to in here.

1037
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:12,320
Yeah. Can we speaking of classic characters,

1038
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:15,400
can we talk about something that I always like when it happens now?

1039
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,520
I'm Millennium Falcon Smuggler's run.

1040
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,920
There are many different ways you can go into the cockpit,

1041
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,160
which I appreciate that they kind of hide it.

1042
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:26,400
So you never feel like you're not going into the real one or there's too many,

1043
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,320
which is a real smart thing they did.

1044
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:31,960
One of them, of course, is special because it's the hallway

1045
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:35,160
where Han and Leia kiss. Yeah.

1046
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:38,720
And I always like I've never kissed in the hallway, but I kind

1047
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:43,960
I would like to one day kiss in the Millennium Falcon Smuggler's run hallway.

1048
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,160
Me too. Sure.

1049
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:47,920
I mean, I'm that big of a Star Wars fan.

1050
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,120
Yeah. So I get it.

1051
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,640
Yeah. Because anyone who's there,

1052
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:54,480
no, I guess anyone mistletoe, you got to do it.

1053
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:59,040
And I think people should do it going forward.

1054
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:04,040
Pay a very thin man to show up and interrupt us in a C3P0 suit.

1055
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,960
Yes. Yeah. Very fussy British man.

1056
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:12,120
You know, I have you have you read his book?

1057
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:13,880
Anthony Daniels.

1058
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:16,240
I know it's my favorite joke in the world.

1059
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:21,200
It's it. Well, it's just it is a it is a 120 pages of a man

1060
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,680
complaining about sand in his costume.

1061
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,280
And that's all it is.

1062
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,040
It's it's hilarious.

1063
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:31,440
But he does. It's all he does is say that it's just him

1064
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:35,600
reiterating on 120 pages that the suit was extremely uncomfortable.

1065
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:39,000
I believe he'd be an actor's life for me, you know?

1066
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:43,800
It's amazing.

1067
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,720
It's he still insists on doing it, too.

1068
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,520
God bless him. As he should.

1069
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,600
Yeah, I get that.

1070
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:53,280
I would be mad if somebody else did it.

1071
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,720
Yeah. So he's going to be doing it until like his 90s or something.

1072
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,880
I hope I hope that like there's still opportunities

1073
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,480
for him to keep doing it forever until he does it until he.

1074
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,560
Yeah. Until he's in a different galaxy. Sure.

1075
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:11,080
It's the nicest way to put it. Wow.

1076
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,280
That's beautiful.

1077
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:17,800
The backing up to the the actual Q area of Millennium Falcon.

1078
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:21,920
I very much appreciate that when you're stepping into the Millennium Falcon,

1079
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,720
it feels like you're on an actual like you're about to get on an airplane

1080
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:27,800
because there doesn't feel like there's anything under you.

1081
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:29,600
They did that on purpose.

1082
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,680
I remember them saying that that they built it like a flight deck.

1083
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:36,720
Like they tried to make it feel like even just walking in,

1084
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:40,760
like it was rickety and old and super cool.

1085
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,080
That is yeah, that is like a weird

1086
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:46,880
just something you don't even think about getting on a plane necessarily.

1087
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,920
But then when you're doing it, when you're walking through, you're like,

1088
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:51,000
oh, yeah, I am getting on a plane.

1089
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,280
That's what's happening.

1090
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:56,600
That back section to where you walk around like the back

1091
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,920
long thruster when you're still outside, kind of.

1092
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:04,200
That's really special when you're right behind the Millennium Falcon.

1093
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,600
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1094
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:09,440
It's yeah, it's nice to like, yeah, get the geography of it

1095
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,960
and like stare at it and understand how it works.

1096
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:13,080
I tried to get in there.

1097
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:17,720
I tried to get in the cockpit on the outside one and I came close.

1098
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,240
But then they were like, we can't.

1099
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:22,400
But like, evidently, only a couple of people have been in there.

1100
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,000
Oh, man.

1101
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,360
They did it the opening ceremony like Chewbacca was inside.

1102
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:28,800
So they probably had to preserve it.

1103
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:32,520
Make sure like it's evidently it's just extreme.

1104
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:36,600
The reality is it's just extremely small and hard to get into.

1105
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:42,120
Yeah, it like cracked off entirely the day before the opening ceremony.

1106
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:45,080
Sure, the inside of that thing isn't as beautiful as the outside.

1107
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,240
I remember we were in the line.

1108
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,320
I'm not making this up.

1109
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:51,920
We were in the line one of these times going by that section

1110
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,680
you're talking about, looking at the back of it.

1111
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:56,160
And I remember going, there should be a bar here.

1112
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,720
This is where the bar should be and it should overlook the whole thing.

1113
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:02,080
And now you're telling us that there is a hypothetical bar

1114
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:05,320
or a pedal, whatever card trying to get to that.

1115
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,720
Yeah, to build it and have it show up.

1116
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:08,200
I'm trying.

1117
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:08,760
Maybe they should.

1118
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,760
Maybe they should just let us drink in that line.

1119
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,960
So that should at least just give us that.

1120
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:18,400
When the steam comes out of the, you know, when they fire the steam

1121
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,000
out of the Falcon, that should just be alcohol.

1122
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:22,160
Yeah, yeah.

1123
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,560
Dripping like it's fuel to drink.

1124
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:27,240
Fuel in the air.

1125
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:34,040
Starship fuels taste a lot like Miller Highlight.

1126
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:41,040
Hey, that's a thing to say, just like as we meander, like as we're outside.

1127
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,200
I mean, is there like a better like you have to include

1128
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,680
this exterior as part of this attraction?

1129
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:50,000
And is there like a is there a grander

1130
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,640
exterior of a Disney attraction you could do?

1131
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:56,080
This could be it's the most photographable.

1132
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,440
Maybe Harry Potter.

1133
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,640
Like if I think it depends on what you're a fan of.

1134
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,680
But that Harry Potter world, like I'm not a huge Harry Potter guy.

1135
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:08,360
And I walk around that place and I go, damn, people must go in.

1136
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,760
If you're a diehard fan, you must go like insane over there.

1137
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:15,600
Like, but it's the same thing for Galaxy's Edge.

1138
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:18,520
Like it's just what you're more of a fan of, maybe.

1139
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:19,880
Yeah.

1140
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,920
Is there anything that you're a big fan of that has not been rendered

1141
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:29,360
in theme park worlds that you would love to see the Galaxy's Edge level commitment?

1142
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,920
Lost. I would go to the lost island.

1143
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:32,320
Yeah.

1144
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:33,480
In right.

1145
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:36,600
You know, there was a rumor of like, I don't know if this was ever

1146
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:40,240
like really on the table, but the Tom Sawyer Island becomes a lost experience.

1147
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:41,400
They were talking about it.

1148
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,400
But yeah, then it went away.

1149
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,440
I remember being heavily into that.

1150
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:46,960
It's trying to figure that out.

1151
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:47,640
Right. Right.

1152
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:49,120
That badly.

1153
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,240
Like, what is that?

1154
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,520
Like, it is weird to think of it because you're in, like,

1155
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:55,480
like frontier land and ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

1156
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,640
And then you get on and then you go to a like

1157
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:01,480
scary, like plane crash.

1158
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:02,440
Like monster.

1159
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:03,280
Like that.

1160
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:07,240
It would have been like the plane probably and like hatches and.

1161
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:08,120
Yeah.

1162
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,040
Smoke monster.

1163
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:09,520
Yeah.

1164
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,760
Smoke monster somehow on a digital screen scrim.

1165
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:14,400
Yeah.

1166
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:19,800
Like that was like that was there as opposed to like, you know, the playgrounds.

1167
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:23,520
Did people go to like, I guess if you I guess people take their kids

1168
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:26,440
to Tom Sawyer Island, maybe do they?

1169
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:27,640
I don't know. Yeah.

1170
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:30,960
I think it's still pretty popular for like kids to run around on it.

1171
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,120
And burn some steam off.

1172
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:36,520
There was a rumor for a little while.

1173
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:39,000
Again, God knows how far along this ever got.

1174
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,600
But the Discovery Island, the former nature

1175
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:45,680
exploration area in Florida at Disney World,

1176
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:52,600
that an island in between like the sort of wilderness lodge and the Magic Kingdom,

1177
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:58,120
they were going to turn that into lost after they shut it down as like,

1178
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:00,200
you know, meet the animals.

1179
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,320
And that never came to be.

1180
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:05,800
And now it's just a place that urban explorers like to go and get arrested.

1181
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:06,680
Sneaking.

1182
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:09,080
Where I live there.

1183
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,360
Used to live there for a while.

1184
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:15,000
I've lost many hours on YouTube going and watching those videos.

1185
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:16,520
Yeah. Oh, sure. Yeah.

1186
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,160
Yeah. What's on Discovery Island?

1187
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:21,040
Backpack people going through.

1188
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:22,600
Yeah. Are you a Bobby?

1189
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:24,640
Are you a Disney World fan as well?

1190
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,880
Are you mainly or mainly Disneyland?

1191
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,920
I've only I don't think I've ever been to Disney World.

1192
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,480
I've only I went very late in life.

1193
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:37,120
Disneyland and Disney World, I think only like in when I was in my 30s,

1194
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,440
late 30s or 40s.

1195
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:41,240
Like, I didn't I didn't go too much later in life.

1196
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,600
I'm in a ride at Disney World.

1197
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,520
And I have never been.

1198
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,480
I don't know if it's open yet.

1199
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:49,400
I don't think it's open yet.

1200
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:54,200
The old Phineas and Ferb ride is now DuckTales themed.

1201
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:59,360
This is now we we just had to get you like this is the second time

1202
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:02,680
within the month that we've had somebody on who's part of this thing,

1203
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,520
which apparently is like, is it announced or not?

1204
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,000
I don't know. Yeah, but there's this DuckTales.

1205
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,480
It's been going on for years.

1206
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,480
And it's yeah, I don't know.

1207
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,000
I don't know what's happening with it.

1208
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,800
Huh? Huh?

1209
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:16,920
This is this is this is like the scoop of the month is this DuckTales.

1210
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:21,520
We spoke to the person who is the John Cheadle sound alike.

1211
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,440
Like we had a guest who we did not realize was a perfect

1212
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:27,400
Don Cheadle double for his appearance as Donald Duck,

1213
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:32,160
which he sounded per it was like the right eye is such a good one.

1214
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:33,800
Yeah. Yeah.

1215
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:36,520
So that's come. But you did that like long ago.

1216
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:38,760
And then you don't know what we recorded.

1217
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,800
Yeah. Yeah. We recorded a bunch of stuff.

1218
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:44,480
It was supposed to be like the Phineas and Ferb thing was like an app.

1219
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:47,880
It was like a game, like a sort of like a treasure hunt.

1220
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:51,280
And they were going to, I believe, expand it.

1221
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,720
Like park wide, it was going to be like different.

1222
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,960
It wasn't it was going to be all over.

1223
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:00,240
There was animatronics in different parts of the park,

1224
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:03,840
and you would have to go find it on like through an app like it wasn't like

1225
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:07,760
the Phineas and Ferb thing was like a game that you played on your phone.

1226
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:13,120
The thing, but this was something that like you could do all around the park

1227
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:16,640
and there was hidden things in places and stuff.

1228
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:19,440
But yeah, sounds cool.

1229
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:22,760
I asked him about Disney World partially because are you are you familiar

1230
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:26,840
with like the old Epcot characters, Figment and Dreamfinder?

1231
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:32,160
I often try and inject into interviews that if they ever bring back Figment,

1232
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,120
then I want to be the voice of Figment very badly.

1233
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,400
Oh, there you go.

1234
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,800
I was going to bring up another thing because we.

1235
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,560
Or the guy with the beard as helper.

1236
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:42,160
That's what we were going to see.

1237
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:46,240
A guest of the show, Jenny Nicholson, I think long ago in an episode

1238
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,760
on our show brought up that I think there was the question posed

1239
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:52,320
if there was a live action Figment and Dreamfinder who would be Dreamfinder

1240
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:53,720
and she brought up your name.

1241
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:56,200
So you're you're down on either side.

1242
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,800
You would have a billion percent.

1243
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:58,560
Yeah.

1244
01:02:58,560 --> 01:02:59,560
Mm hmm.

1245
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:03,280
Well, that's that's a costume to, you know, like how great would you feel

1246
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:08,400
in a purple top hat and I may have it already waiting to go.

1247
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:15,560
Oh, it's in the dusty rubber made from ancient from old UCB shows.

1248
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:18,080
Right. We all have one of those sitting around.

1249
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:22,840
It was a Willy Wonka sketch initially, but you can repurpose my.

1250
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:26,760
I got into a car accident coming home from a UCB sketch show.

1251
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:30,760
My car got totaled and the cop was like, your car is totaled, man.

1252
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:33,480
If you've gotten anything in your car, why don't you throw it in my car?

1253
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:34,520
Well, I'll take you home.

1254
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,800
And I was like, oh, no.

1255
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,280
I proceeded to take out of my car

1256
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:45,320
a giant cardboard cutout of Angelina Jolie with Zach Woods's face on it.

1257
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:50,000
And African-American Santa Claus animatronic, like

1258
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,480
a box full of dildos.

1259
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:56,280
Like it was just like all props from our sketch show.

1260
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:58,640
And the cop was just like, what?

1261
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,640
What is happening?

1262
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,800
Did it all fit in his car?

1263
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,480
Yeah, yeah, it did.

1264
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:07,080
And then he drove me home.

1265
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:09,280
My poor Saturn didn't make it.

1266
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,280
Oh, too bad.

1267
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,280
I. Yeah, we've all been there.

1268
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:16,040
Yeah, we've all been there.

1269
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:20,240
A hunk of junk much like the Falcon.

1270
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:22,040
It did me well. It did me well.

1271
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:23,440
I enjoyed it.

1272
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:29,640
I like here for why did Dan here like what else can we shout out about this

1273
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,400
about this attraction?

1274
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,280
I guess, OK, well, let me say this.

1275
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:38,000
Just to like represent that, I think we've like we've like made fun

1276
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,480
of this attraction a little bit in the past and just like I think maybe we wonder,

1277
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:44,840
is there like with the coaxium thing,

1278
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:49,560
I think we wonder if is there like other stuff that they could do or progress?

1279
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:54,440
Like are there other sequences that they might consider putting into this?

1280
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:56,840
Because it seems like the most

1281
01:04:56,840 --> 01:05:00,400
ready to go, like that there's other worlds and other levels

1282
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:04,440
essentially in the Star Tours tradition.

1283
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:10,040
And that's a question, I guess, is like what stuff we would want to do

1284
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:13,400
with the Falcon if they ever were to do that?

1285
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,920
I mean, like I think we got to fly into that worm's mouth,

1286
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,240
maybe fly into that thing.

1287
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:23,160
Yeah, we got to get in that worm's mouth. I agree.

1288
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:29,560
I totally agree. Not being funny.

1289
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:31,360
That is I mean, it's a thing that's missing.

1290
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:36,320
How many rides have taken us inside a mouth like a great giant mouth?

1291
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:39,760
And maybe that is sort of seems like a place also that the gunner

1292
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:44,240
would be come incredibly in hand to like fire your way down the road.

1293
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:47,040
I'm trying to think of moments from the movies, like when it crashes

1294
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:49,720
and rise the resistance, like in the snow, like

1295
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:55,200
or the trench run, like helping Luke in the trench run.

1296
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:58,320
Yeah, the Kessel run itself. Yeah.

1297
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:03,640
Which they showed in Solo, which he cheats at that sort of

1298
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:08,200
because they did that like fix because Parsec is a unit of measurement,

1299
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:10,560
not a time, which is just an error.

1300
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:12,880
They do. There's a lot of that where they're like, this is an error

1301
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:15,960
and we're going to make it like a real plot point. Yeah.

1302
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:18,880
It's because they're trying to help nerds,

1303
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:21,680
but the nerds are the ones that made it wrong.

1304
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:24,360
And the it's hard. It's a hard line to walk.

1305
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,800
Yeah. It's also funny.

1306
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:30,320
It's also funny if Han Solo, I think, is stupid and just said it wrong.

1307
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:33,600
I know. Yeah. Or he's lying.

1308
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:36,600
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's just trying to be an asshole.

1309
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:39,120
Yeah, because he is. Yeah.

1310
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:41,160
That's what people like.

1311
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:46,120
He spends a good portion of the first three, you know, movies

1312
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:49,560
just kind of being a jerk, very charming jerk.

1313
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:55,000
It's crazy how like we love this terrible father, this drug dealing

1314
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:59,720
terrible father really is amazing.

1315
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,160
The son didn't turn out.

1316
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:04,320
That son turned out pretty bad, didn't he?

1317
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:06,160
That's about as bad of a kid.

1318
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:08,480
Like the movie, the movie should be called.

1319
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:10,880
Leia doesn't get the credit she deserves.

1320
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:16,000
Very good point.

1321
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,480
It's for someone in gaps, also just like a serious like, yeah, I mean,

1322
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:22,680
you know, you couldn't do it with her, but like, let's just see.

1323
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:23,760
Like what what happened?

1324
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:26,240
What was Kylo's upbringing?

1325
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:30,680
And it's just a serious like this very little sci fi and fun in it.

1326
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:33,400
It's very 30s.

1327
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,640
Star Wars is very squid in the whale.

1328
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:38,440
Like, we're going to have like a coming apart.

1329
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:43,320
You're just watching like a child become corrupted

1330
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:45,160
through the windshield of the Millennium Falcon.

1331
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:47,360
We're just sitting there

1332
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,640
like awkwardly, like, are we going to get out of here?

1333
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:52,960
No, we're not.

1334
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:56,240
So we're in it now.

1335
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:59,200
Yeah, I it's again, I'm not trying to be

1336
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:03,280
getting into a creature's mouth is what happens on Star Tours.

1337
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:06,600
Like I've said this before, like Star Tours has so many like moments

1338
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:10,040
that you really remember specifically that I feel like are missing

1339
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:12,240
from the Millennium Falcon ride.

1340
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:14,600
I agree. It's chaos.

1341
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:16,080
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

1342
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:20,120
And I think what you said, Bobby, about like just didn't kind of enjoy the chaos.

1343
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:22,560
Don't focus on the gamification too much.

1344
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:26,920
Like if they were to add new levels, like a little more just like, all right.

1345
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:30,160
Now just hit one button and just sit back and enjoy.

1346
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:32,680
Yeah.

1347
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:36,320
The experience is the room itself.

1348
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:39,320
It feels like more than like.

1349
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:43,240
Right. The point and everything gets confused is the experience.

1350
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:48,080
Yeah, I would love it, honestly, if they, you know, if they

1351
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:51,440
tweaked a version of it where it's like, OK, pilots,

1352
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:54,560
you do it for the first half and you do it for the second half

1353
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:57,320
and you do up and down and left and right at the same time.

1354
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:59,880
Like that would be easier, maybe.

1355
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:04,200
Yeah. Well, my fix, my fix has always been it should just be one person controlling it.

1356
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:06,960
There should be a gunner next to them with a joystick

1357
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:10,960
and then the other four should be engineer or call it a different call it, you know,

1358
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:15,320
call it like over heater check,

1359
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:17,440
overheat checker or something, I don't know.

1360
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:22,880
Or put a screen like something else so that they just they have their own little thing.

1361
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:26,960
Or also, like if you're going to be the gunner, put me in that seat.

1362
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:29,440
Put me in that bottom swivel seat.

1363
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:30,720
Yes, yes, yes.

1364
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:34,560
Preach into the choir. Yeah, that's where our single rider.

1365
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:37,880
Just that. That's all you got to do is you're alone in that thing.

1366
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:40,520
Like that should be like the new lightning lane.

1367
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:44,120
You pay twenty five dollars to get in that seat because I would.

1368
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:47,960
That's that would be worth it, because that looks like fun as hell.

1369
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:51,400
That's as a kid, especially you're like, I want to be on where that little thing,

1370
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:55,320
like that little like headset, which is looks fun, which I guess is just like

1371
01:09:55,320 --> 01:10:00,240
a old time like operator like Andy Griffith or something.

1372
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,880
And then you're firing a big gun in a rotating thing like it seems so awesome.

1373
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:07,360
Mike, that brings up I got to give them credit.

1374
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:10,680
All the old looking like cathode ray tube

1375
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:15,360
screens, all the old kind of like staticky screens

1376
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:17,680
that Hondo talks to you or Chewie, oh, sure.

1377
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:19,240
That is great.

1378
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:23,960
And they're all making everything look like dirty, but not dirty is a real skill.

1379
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:26,400
Yes. And they do it very well.

1380
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:29,440
And the screens look kind of old, even though they're not.

1381
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:32,960
If you like, look, you're like, oh, that's that's a higher definition

1382
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,320
than it may appear.

1383
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:36,600
But it's like kind of tricks you.

1384
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:38,280
Yeah, which is nice.

1385
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:42,640
So, yeah, I guess would you, Jason, would you want it to be dirtier?

1386
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:45,320
And oh, yeah. Oh, sure. Always.

1387
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:49,040
You would like worse dirty or messy.

1388
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:50,720
Should there be like shit everywhere?

1389
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:53,000
Should there be like paper?

1390
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,840
No, I want to try. I want to be tricked.

1391
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:56,720
I don't I don't want actual mess.

1392
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:58,920
I want that's fair. Theater.

1393
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,240
The theater of theater of dirt.

1394
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:02,680
The theater of dirt.

1395
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:03,480
The theater of dirt.

1396
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:04,880
I don't I like.

1397
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:08,560
Yeah, I don't want the actual hard hat experience that Bobby had going through.

1398
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:14,280
Yeah. The hyper hyper heightened version of like showing up

1399
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:18,080
at like community theater layman's productions when it's like

1400
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:21,800
the carpenter down the street is writing this all fun is taxed.

1401
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:26,160
Please don't rehearse kids, please.

1402
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:27,480
Don't rehearse.

1403
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:29,720
This is dangerous.

1404
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:32,720
I I they really they should.

1405
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:37,080
I think they try to shy away, especially Galaxy's edge from like cheap stuff

1406
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:42,160
like in the Millennium Falcon, like we should cruise through Coruscant

1407
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:47,080
and see like Padme and Anakin like arguing or something like

1408
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:50,520
like like in like in Soarin went.

1409
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:54,160
Yeah. Soaring when you see Jack Sparrow and them on the beach.

1410
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,600
They chose little like Easter egg thing.

1411
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:57,600
And he gives you. Yeah.

1412
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:01,120
Well, like Michael Eisner is in he golfs in the original Soarin.

1413
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:03,120
No, really?

1414
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:07,680
Yeah. The guy who hits a golf ball that flies at you is a pair.

1415
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:10,200
And Palm Springs is Michael Eisner.

1416
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:12,000
Wow. Yeah.

1417
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,840
So I more cheap shit is honestly what I want.

1418
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:16,800
I want like a little less clever.

1419
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:20,440
Less clever, less like, yeah, like glad dumber stuff.

1420
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:22,240
Gunga low hanging fruit.

1421
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:24,040
Just a little boss.

1422
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:29,560
Nass waving at you like for a while for a long time.

1423
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:34,400
And I'm serious, like that's for people like those characters, you know,

1424
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:38,080
and the darker side of the star, the Noah Baumbach

1425
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:41,680
the Star Wars characters arguing.

1426
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:44,920
Yeah, I guess I want more characters arguing

1427
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:46,680
in general.

1428
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:50,320
I like that conflict, that drama.

1429
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:52,520
Minor characters fighting.

1430
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:53,680
Yeah. Minor characters.

1431
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:55,680
Five lines or less.

1432
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:57,360
The more less lines, the better.

1433
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:00,680
That John Cassavetes flavor in the Star Wars universe.

1434
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:03,040
Yeah, that's what I'm looking for.

1435
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:03,720
Well, why don't look?

1436
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:06,840
I mean, if we if we're going to keep it consistent with Galaxy's edge,

1437
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:09,960
like maybe if, you know, if we're stick, if we have to stick to the

1438
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:13,680
the Dexter is not around, we do have Seasal slack.

1439
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:15,920
And it seems like you'd be willing to do more sleaze.

1440
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:19,600
I think if the location is right there, like you have to imagine that

1441
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:22,640
the Falcon would have a little bit of trouble landing sometimes

1442
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:26,680
and maybe crash right into Seasal slacks floating Cantina.

1443
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:34,240
Yeah. Maybe is like chewing out a fry cook or something.

1444
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:37,640
As long as he's arguing with someone

1445
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:41,240
and having a heated conflict and that we get to sit there

1446
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:43,240
for a few minutes and enjoy.

1447
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:47,440
And if people start to like them and they become beloved characters, no more.

1448
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:49,560
We need minor characters.

1449
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,160
Minor characters only.

1450
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:55,360
No show people, no people that are their own show.

1451
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:58,000
We're talking rank or keepers.

1452
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,160
Oh, yes. Yes.

1453
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:04,240
Or just let's see him really processing the death of the rank.

1454
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:06,840
I tried to write a sketch.

1455
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:09,960
Yeah. At SNL, where it was when Brogue One came out,

1456
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:11,400
where is a Star Wars story.

1457
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:14,240
It was just all these other spin offs and it was like Porkins

1458
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:19,000
and the rank or keeper and Lauren Michaels had no clue what I was talking about.

1459
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,160
What? Yeah.

1460
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:23,920
I don't believe it.

1461
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:28,760
To be fair, he's right. Yeah.

1462
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:31,240
Bobby, I don't know what a Porkins is.

1463
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:37,200
Oh, man, that would be great.

1464
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:41,880
I OK. Well, this has been a blast.

1465
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:44,720
I mean, any any any closing thoughts on Bollion?

1466
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:50,280
If I like tips to do the next time you go with stuff that we want to see happen.

1467
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:52,920
I love it there.

1468
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:55,520
There's a little hidden Mickey in Galaxy's Edge.

1469
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:59,040
And when you when you get off of.

1470
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:03,560
Smugglers run and you go right.

1471
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:05,360
There's like a ramp.

1472
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:08,400
There's like a ramp that goes up

1473
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,880
like snakes around into the food court.

1474
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:13,560
Docking Bay. Yeah.

1475
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:14,560
Yeah. You know what you mean?

1476
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:17,120
Yeah. And there's a little hidden Mickey on the wall there.

1477
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:20,720
There's like three like bullet holes that are in the shape of a Mickey Mouse

1478
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:23,920
on that ramp. Oh, that's scary.

1479
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:25,240
Which I yeah, I like that.

1480
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:27,960
Yeah. It's like somebody wanted to kill Mickey. Yeah.

1481
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:34,280
How many Hunter after somebody's a talking mouse, three feet tall.

1482
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:38,560
Yeah. I like that Mickey's been in Galaxy's Edge.

1483
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:40,920
That's canon now. Yeah.

1484
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:42,720
That's another yeah, that's another dumb thing.

1485
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:45,400
Just have yeah, Mickey's Mickey should be in Galaxy's Edge.

1486
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:49,720
I believe I love the whole E.T.

1487
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:56,000
crossover, the fact that in the movie he well, in the Star Wars movies,

1488
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:00,840
in the prequels, there's the Senate scene where all the E.T.s have their own box.

1489
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:02,920
Yeah. We're talking about.

1490
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:05,760
Yeah. I want to say the name of the character, I think right now.

1491
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:08,120
I don't want to. I'm going to bungle it.

1492
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:09,720
I don't know how to say it out loud. You got to do it.

1493
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:14,000
Greble, Senator Greble, I believe is the name because it's Spielberg backwards.

1494
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:16,360
Is the name of the E.T.

1495
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:17,720
Goodness. Yeah.

1496
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:18,920
Do you know that one?

1497
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:21,720
That is the Moine naming system in action.

1498
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:24,480
That is Spielberg backwards equals Moine.

1499
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:26,440
Lauren doesn't know that either, I bet.

1500
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:28,560
No, he does not.

1501
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,840
But he was best man at Carrie Fisher's wedding.

1502
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:33,920
Is that right?

1503
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:35,880
Yeah. To Paul Simon, right?

1504
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:37,920
Yeah. Wow. Oh, that's wild.

1505
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:39,960
Yeah. That's a good nerd.

1506
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:41,560
Now I forget what I was saying.

1507
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:43,520
Sorry, Greble. Senator Greble.

1508
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:45,680
That's the room of the E.T. senators.

1509
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:48,240
Yeah, that whole idea that in E.T.

1510
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:51,160
when he's dressed up and he sees Yoda and he's like home

1511
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:53,760
and it's because now they've connected the two movies like

1512
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:56,320
that's why he recognized Yoda in E.T.

1513
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,160
because he's in the Star Wars universe.

1514
01:16:58,160 --> 01:16:59,040
And that's so good.

1515
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:01,760
I truly enjoy that.

1516
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:04,560
When he points at the oh in the oh wow.

1517
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:07,760
And then there's the point where Elliot starts going, this is Boba Fett

1518
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:09,640
and starts showing him the action figures.

1519
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:12,400
And it's like he's like, whatever, I know, like I know those guys.

1520
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:17,160
I love I love I want I want E.T.

1521
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:20,080
to show up in the Star Wars universe with a fucking lightsaber.

1522
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:23,680
I've he's like, I've served in the Senate with these these people.

1523
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:27,080
I know. I know.

1524
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:29,360
You you you have them as toys here.

1525
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:31,800
These are this man was a murderer.

1526
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:37,920
That that's my favorite thing that I want to see that theory.

1527
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:43,520
And the theory I want most to be true

1528
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:47,160
is that the little girl, the little blonde girl with the curls

1529
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:50,920
and the white headband from the E.L.O.C. adventures. Yes.

1530
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:53,800
Is young Captain Phasma.

1531
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:56,920
Oh, I haven't heard that.

1532
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:58,480
I like that. I like that.

1533
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:00,560
That's going to be I'm going to be thinking about that all day.

1534
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:02,800
Yes, I enjoy.

1535
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,520
I wish that was true.

1536
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:07,000
Because I mean, the start of that second movie

1537
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:10,320
really gives her an incredibly tragic backstory.

1538
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:14,560
Yeah. Geez.

1539
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:16,680
Well, all right. Incredible connections.

1540
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:19,640
Great ideas for future expansions.

1541
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:21,560
I think I think full E.T.

1542
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:23,160
say full of greeblips.

1543
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:25,400
Senate hearing is what I think we'd all like to see.

1544
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:29,120
But thanks for thank you for coming and sharing your thoughts

1545

1556
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:04,160
and is recently out of jail.

1557
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:06,320
He went to jail for biting Kathy Bates and now

1558
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:09,320
I'm out of jail and starting a podcast.

1559
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:13,000

01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:39,320
Now what's echoing in my head, just one more thing is that like I

1572
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:40,840
were this will come out a little later.

1573
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:42,240
We're recording it before Halloween.

1574
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:44,800
And I'm like, there's still time for me to get an E.T. mask.

1575
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,880
Go somewhere and people say, oh, you're E.T.

1576
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:49,640
and then you say, no, I'm Senator Gribble.

1577
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:52,040
Oh, get it right.

1578
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:56,080
So anybody else who wants to go in on that with me or next?

1579
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:57,720
I'll do it.

1580
01:19:57,720 --> 01:20:01,520
I'm going to do this book of Boba Fett.

1581
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:05,080
That's true.

1582
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:07,960
But we want a book of we want a book of gribble.

1583
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:12,920
A West Wing, like a West Wing with gribble.

1584
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:16,280
Yeah, they could just go on Senator Jaws.

1585
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:18,440
Sure.

1586
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:22,120
Easier to say a little easier.

1587
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:24,240
All right, everybody. Thanks for listening. Bye bye.
