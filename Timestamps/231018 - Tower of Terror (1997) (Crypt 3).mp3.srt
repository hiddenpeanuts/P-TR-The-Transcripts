1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,480
I want to dive right in. I want to talk about the poll. The thing about the polls that I think

2
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:53,480
is great is the audience gets to vote with their heart, you know, and just put out in the world what episode they want and whatever they want is correct. And there's no right or wrong. There's no right or wrong answer. Except for this time. There was a right answer here in the Crypt 3 poll. The right answer was Harrison Ford and Callista Flockhart's Halloween costumes. Now I don't want, you know, and it's not a good note maybe to start with,

3
00:00:53,480 --> 00:01:08,480
but I wanted to get this right out of the way. We're excited to talk about Tower of Terror the movie. We will talk about Tower of Terror the movie. That being said, the right answer was right there. And it only came in fourth? I have to say I'm shocked.

4
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,080
I had been tracking and it was number three. What knocked it out of three?

5
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:25,080
I'm not sure. I think maybe Spirit Halloween still snuck up there. I mean, while we're naming things, the nightmare experiment will be the run or that'll be the incumbent next Halloween. So we'll revisit that.

6
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:52,880
Really fascinating. It's very interesting. If you don't know it, and we didn't dive in, so I don't really know it, but it seems like Hong Kong Disneyland tried to do this in 2016. They tried to do maybe the only true Disney attempt at a horror nights that had actually scary and upsetting stuff, all of which is maybe more upsetting than usual because it involved Disney characters being entrapped and tortured seemingly.

7
00:01:53,780 --> 00:02:21,980
So fascinating. But if we want that, that's going to have to be next Halloween. For now, I mean, Harrison and Calista. Look, I also we revealed a little bit recently about how a certain type of topic is usually Mike's pick. And so I saw people saying, I see Mike's trying to get his nonsense in there with Harrison and Calista. Let me tell you, listener, this was all of our pick. We were all abuzz about Harrison and Calista.

8
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:35,080
This was this was no one person's pick. This was everyone's pick. And, you know, it can't always align the way you want it here on Crypt 3, but over on the cemetery gate where we choose Harrison and Calista coming soon.

9
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,680
Yeah, okay. Yeah, I think that's right. I think it has to be right.

10
00:02:38,680 --> 00:03:05,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, it's where, you know, hey, the audience controls here, but we control the other place. And I like I think it's really nice to I enjoy getting to promote a an audience suggested topic. And yeah, and that one I'll tip my hat a little. I'll give away my opinion a little. It's a little bit of nonsense. But also every year when I see the pictures, I smile.

11
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,880
Like I'm always looking forward to like, what are they doing this year?

12
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,780
Uh huh. Yes.

13
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,180
A little bit of nonsense. Be a whole lot of nonsense. But that's what

14
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:28,580
I don't know. This is a substantial topic, I think will deep dive into their career into their marriage. See how it's doing today, how it survived post pandemic. I think there's I think it's rich. There's a lot to talk about. And I'm sure very theme park related.

15
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,180
Yeah, very, very much so.

16
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:39,980
But we did we did, of course, land at something theme park related. And I mean, sorry, you know, it's based on a film, a sort of a film.

17
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,080
Shot in a theme park, parts of it.

18
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,980
Parts of it.

19
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:43,880
I mean, kind of.

20
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,380
Little parts of it.

21
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,280
Little parts of it.

22
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:56,680
For November, back to regular suggestions, regular topics, not only topics which will go up against the strange Animal Kingdom show Kite Tales.

23
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,780
But for now, let's dive in. A number of people suggested this.

24
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,580
So this is how you know there was there was all there was, you know, mass agreement on this.

25
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,080
Among them, Dylan Lee, Six Fogs, Great Adventure, nice name.

26
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:17,480
And then I think Z.H. might have been the main and first one who said quite simply Tower of Terror, the Steve Guttenberg movie.

27
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,980
And here we are now.

28
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:19,480
Yeah.

29
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,380
We all watched this film.

30
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,080
We did.

31
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,880
I think as far as I know, I didn't know.

32
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,480
I didn't ask.

33
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,580
We don't watch it together.

34
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:25,980
Mm hmm.

35
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:26,480
We did not.

36
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,780
No, we didn't have a party for it.

37
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,680
No, we didn't.

38
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:34,180
We watched presumably the same single bootleg copy that is uploaded to YouTube.

39
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:34,780
Yeah.

40
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:41,480
Now this I think that this is purchasable as a DVD or even perhaps VHS.

41
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:48,780
I seem to recall it existing as physical media, but you cannot find this on Disney Plus today.

42
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:49,280
Yeah.

43
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:49,980
This is certified.

44
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,980
I think now probably YouTube is you're in our best bet.

45
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,580
Yeah.

46
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,680
Jane has DVD and it's somewhere.

47
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,280
We don't know where it is right now.

48
00:04:59,280 --> 00:04:59,780
Okay.

49
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,280
Owner of the DVD.

50
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:08,380
Books are still or books and movies are still in moving box like we haven't filled up the bookcases yet.

51
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,780
Well, you got to get Tower of Terror the movie out and on a shelf.

52
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:16,980
When guests come over, they're going to be wondering do you where's your physical copy of Tower of Terror from 1997.

53
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,680
Blue Ray players not hooked up yet.

54
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,180
It's a mess of cables on top of the.

55
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,280
4K, Blue Ray.

56
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,280
U.K.

57
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:23,580
Yeah.

58
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,580
Oh, it's going to sparkle in that Blue Ray.

59
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,680
Why are you wasting your time?

60
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,680
This is a film.

61
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,780
This is a film from October 1997 was the release.

62
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:41,180
This was a movie for ABC's Wonderful World of Disney.

63
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,680
And I was like in what order do we go?

64
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,980
Exactly.

65
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,080
Is there context?

66
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,680
Do we discuss the casting a little bit?

67
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:56,280
But as soon as I have now said ABC's Wonderful World of Disney and that's where this premiered that tells us something very important about this movie.

68
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:56,680
Right. Of course.

69
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,480
And how it was presented on television.

70
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:06,680
So why, you know, why not cut to the chase what we all want and with no further explanation.

71
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,280
Here's what we want.

72
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,280
Give it to me.

73
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,780
Give me that hit.

74
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,080
Hello, I'm Michael Eisner.

75
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:19,180
Music and sound plays such an important role in setting the mood both in filmmaking and in our daily lives.

76
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:19,880
That's so true.

77
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,380
That's why I do some of my best thinking in elevators.

78
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,380
There's a safe and quiet.

79
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,980
They always have such a nice and right use of it.

80
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,780
Wow.

81
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,580
Once again, a bright idea has come to me in an elevator.

82
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,780
The next time I think I'll take the stairs.

83
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,780
Welcome to the Wonderful World.

84
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,780
Oh, Michael.

85
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:59,580
Michael wandered into that 10 second clip of Tower of Terror promotional footage that has been used.

86
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,180
Over.

87
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,980
Seemingly the majority of our lives.

88
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:15,580
Yes, we have how many times have we seen this and in revisiting old specials and looking at resort TV, it's the fits like there's the shaft and there's like the wheel creaking and then the shaft, the car flying down.

89
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:20,880
And then the the numbers that take you all the way up to 13 was spinning and spinning around.

90
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,280
Yeah.

91
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:28,580
And we see this footage even if the rest of what it's accompanying is shot on cheap video.

92
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:28,980
Yes.

93
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:40,880
Still, we look at this like nice film footage like really nicely directed and lit footage that was in all the TV ads, which also and I'm maybe taking this from a listener.

94
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:51,080
Somebody pointed out how this intro and the ads for Tower of Terror always made you feel like so wait, you go to this thing and you stand in an elevator.

95
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:56,880
You do not have a seat or a seat belt or a restraint or even a pole to hold.

96
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,780
You were just they're just going to drop me in an elevator.

97
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,980
I might hit the ceiling.

98
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,880
I might collapse and keel over.

99
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,680
Yeah, kid told me that's what it was.

100
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,280
I think some kid told me that's what happens on it.

101
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:14,480
It looked very scary and very cool, but I was fully prepared like well, we're going to do this cool thing and we might die.

102
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:19,880
I don't know why all these people are laughing, but I guess it's what this is the way I'd like to go out.

103
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,880
I'm a child.

104
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,680
Sure.

105
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,280
Huh?

106
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:34,480
Or I mean, if you believe the story that you're told at the beginning of the ride, a story which is reprised in the film and the basis of the film, then you might believe that this is not the way to death, but rather to eternal life.

107
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,080
Yeah.

108
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:50,880
If a weird creepy limbo, but like that's maybe if something happened to you up there, then maybe you get decades more and you're locked in age wise, then you get to be the Sally Shine of the fifth dimension or whatever it is.

109
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,280
Wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.

110
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,480
Wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.

111
00:08:53,480 --> 00:09:00,680
Hey, walking around a beautiful hotel, a lot of those plants still holding up just going, it's raining, it's pouring over and over again.

112
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,280
Big band music playing.

113
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,280
Oh boy.

114
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,280
Big band music.

115
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,280
On a creaky old turntable.

116
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:14,680
I was going to say that the beginning of this film, they play that the one song from the 30s.

117
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,280
I wrote that down, yes.

118
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:23,880
The film starts with the big band equivalent of like one of the three Vietnam War rock songs.

119
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,280
Oh, that's true.

120
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,280
That's the Fortunate Son of the 30s.

121
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,280
That's how we know that it's the 30s.

122
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:34,680
The song is Sing Sing Sing and that's how you know we're in the past, baby.

123
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,680
Sing Sing Sing is playing or Fortunate Son.

124
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,680
Or it's a candy bar commercial from the 90s.

125
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,680
Oh, that's true.

126
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,680
Something like that.

127
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,680
Something with some creepy early CGI Snickers bars or something.

128
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,680
Yes.

129
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,680
Or like a swing dancing Gap Khakis ad.

130
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,680
Very possible too.

131
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,680
Could be in there.

132
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,680
I think that's probably it too.

133
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,680
I guess that's mostly West Side Story, but I feel like there was a sword at generations of Gap ads.

134
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,080
Eisner also uses a joke that's in the movie.

135
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,080
Like I'll take the stairs?

136
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,080
I'll take the stairs, yeah.

137
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,080
That's almost like one of the only, what else do you got?

138
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,080
I guess that's true, but it is funny that he uses the same joke.

139
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:16,080
That is the main bullet point in the press kit that they gave everyone.

140
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:22,080
Like, okay, when you're doing interviews, work in I'll take the stairs.

141
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,080
The press kit for this movie?

142
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,080
Well, for the movie, for the ride, for any, like, okay, everyone.

143
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,480
This will work.

144
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,480
This will kill.

145
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:35,480
Seeing Eisner also with the listener can't see unless you look up the clip.

146
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,480
And you have to also to find that it's like within, it's not in the main YouTube version of that.

147
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,480
You got to go fishing a little bit, which is great.

148
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,480
There's like, there's no shortage of hellos.

149
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,480
And that one wasn't in one of your montages?

150
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,480
No.

151
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,480
So often do I run into ones that aren't in the, they did so many of these.

152
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,880
At this point, I don't think I even, because I, and I updated it and added more.

153
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,880
And even with the second one, I don't think I got even half in there.

154
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,880
It's crazy.

155
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:06,880
And there used to be a YouTube channel that like was compiling them all, but I think it disappeared.

156
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,880
I think it went into ghostly limbo.

157
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,880
So I don't know what happened.

158
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:18,880
But you get to see, you only have one shot basically of Eisner reacting to free falling to his death.

159
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:28,280
And this is, this has long been a setup for hammy acting, I'd say, is like making people like the Regis's of the world.

160
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,280
Oh, yeah.

161
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,280
Ride the Tower of Terror.

162
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:34,280
And Regis is broad, silly, bug-eyed.

163
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,280
Yes, but it's something.

164
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:42,280
Eisner is just, he's just giving, it is the, it's just no reaction.

165
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,280
It's just his like resting face.

166
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:49,680
It's like if you just saw him at a coffee shop, just kind of, you know, not thinking about anything.

167
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,680
This is, it's how you would look falling to his demise.

168
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:59,680
Yeah, it's an interesting choice as we probably assume they didn't have a ton of time with him.

169
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:05,680
So maybe, you know, two takes each and, okay, great, Michael, that was great.

170
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,680
And we'll tilt the camera.

171
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,680
So like we'll tilt the.

172
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:16,080
Now we still, this again, we don't have like total confirmation on this Eisner Soren situation.

173
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,080
But as you just said, I, of course, they didn't have a lot of time with him for a lot of these things.

174
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,080
Yeah.

175
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,080
And it remains my biggest question.

176
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,080
It's like, why is he waiting through all these flybys?

177
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,080
Unless he is just relaxing.

178
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,080
Yeah, it's true.

179
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:33,080
Like getting crunk at the Arnold Palmer La Quinta course.

180
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,080
I don't think he's a big drinker, but I don't know why I think that.

181
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,080
Yeah, I'm not sure.

182
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,480
Well, now we know he's not a big golfer.

183
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,480
He's not a big golfer.

184
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,480
He gets tired of golf.

185
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,480
So we know he's a big shower.

186
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,480
Now we know that about his office from the recent Eiger.

187
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,480
Well, of course.

188
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,480
Yeah, he loves the double.

189
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,480
Did he love the double shower?

190
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,480
No, Eiger loved the double shower.

191
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,480
He said he lived for the double shower days.

192
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,480
Eisner could have been a quadruple shower guy.

193
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,480
We don't know.

194
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,480
We don't have the information.

195
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,480
After every meeting, he took a shower.

196
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,480
He loved to be so fresh for each meeting.

197
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,480
After every shoot, they took it out of him.

198
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,480
A speakerphone on a cart into the shower room.

199
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,480
Sampling the different Mickey's Kitchen foods on his desk.

200
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,480
All right, I got to take a shower after each one.

201
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,480
He personally approved every brownie.

202
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,480
To make a soup. I got it on my forearm.

203
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,480
It's going to be a long day.

204
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,480
Bring me a peanut butter and jelly pizza.

205
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,480
Can I get something with gummy worms on it?

206
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,480
Michael, you have to approve this new plush pile we're thinking about putting in each Disney store.

207
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,480
All right, but I got to take a shower first.

208
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,480
It's going to be 45 minutes.

209
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,480
I got to get a steam worked up in there.

210
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,480
And then he comes out and he knows it.

211
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,480
I have just one shower is all it takes.

212
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,480
And he's like, I think it's got to be more of a cone.

213
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,480
You need a 35 degree. Otherwise, it's going to be too imposing.

214
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,480
He does his best thinking in the shower.

215
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,480
So yeah, he comes out and he goes, it's Tigger. It's Eeyore.

216
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,480
It's Mickey, then Minnie, and then it's all the Aristocats.

217
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,480
And that's the topper. That's the big thing.

218
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,480
All the Aristocats are on top of the plush pile.

219
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,480
Michael, you did it again. Back to the shower.

220
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,480
Someone bring me a worms and dirt for the love of God.

221
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,480
Yeah, yeah, he did it all.

222
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,480
It's got to be what it was like.

223
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,480
Yeah, like got the ideas out of his pores.

224
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,480
So we start off strong and we're there.

225
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:31,480
And then because this also this comes in the Renaissance of Eisner intros,

226
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,480
because this is the return of Wonderful World of Disney.

227
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,480
It's when they start airing it on ABC, because you forget a lot of those were aired on NBC, I believe.

228
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,480
Or maybe I think I don't recall if there's any CBS in there.

229
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,480
But now they own ABC. We're bringing back the landmark franchise.

230
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,480
They thank God they didn't think of a new host.

231
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,480
Thank God it's still Eisner because a lot like five years have passed.

232
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,480
I hate to to rail it, but not completely.

233
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,480
Have you guys seen that Byron Allen is thinking of buying ABC?

234
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,480
I've seen I've definitely heard swirls of they're trying to sell these networks.

235
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,480
And then the website deadline has an article about Byron Allen every single day.

236
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,480
So Byron Allen context for listeners.

237
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,480
Byron Allen may need context.

238
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,480
All right. Byron Allen does a show that we've talked about on here.

239
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,480
I think a little bit called Comics Unleashed.

240
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:31,480
But just in addition to that, he's like a very low key media mogul, made a huge fortune and now seems to be in position to bid on ABC.

241
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,480
My God, he might just own all of ABC.

242
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:40,480
He is a I believe a Malibu mega estate neighbor of Eisner.

243
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,480
Yes.

244
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,480
He's another where the compound is ridiculous.

245
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,480
Right.

246
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,480
I hadn't heard this ABC thing.

247
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:57,480
There was a profile of him a few years ago about his giant house and just how many shows he's produced for daytime TV and cable.

248
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,480
We knew him.

249
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:06,480
I feel like the thing we knew him for was that show Comics Unleashed, which is like a roundtable show.

250
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:14,480
And he would set up the most softball like, hey, Mike, I heard you had a story about Byron Allen story.

251
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,480
Like I heard you had read a Byron Allen article recently.

252
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,480
Well, yeah.

253
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:24,480
Well, the Norm MacDonald version is we John Love what's on the show and Byron Allen would set up people up for the material.

254
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,480
So he just turns to John and he goes, John, so I understand you're getting older.

255
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,480
Like that's the transition.

256
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,480
The vaguest set up.

257
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:41,480
Anyway, yeah, he just quietly is by Allen on his 10 billion dollar offer for ABC and other Disney networks.

258
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,480
Capital's not an issue.

259
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,480
But by Bob, you're not ready to pursue the sale supposedly.

260
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,480
But Byron says that the 10 billion Disney TV asset offers fully financed.

261
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,480
He's got the money.

262
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,480
My God.

263
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,480
So he's in the mix.

264
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,480
And he said, I'm the prettiest girl of the dance.

265
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,480
There you go.

266
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,480
And regulators would block big tech and private equity.

267
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,480
So it's got to be me.

268
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,480
I just give it to him.

269
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,480
Does he then start doing?

270
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,480
Well, I mean, I don't know if they're going to start if they're going to bring back Wonderful World at Disney, but then it could be Byron Allen.

271
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,480
Hey, that'd be fine.

272
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,480
I love that.

273
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,480
Yeah.

274
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,480
Yeah.

275
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,480
I don't want this to be sold to like a like a giant conglomerate or something or some tech company.

276
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,480
Yes.

277
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,480
So it's all to Byron Allen.

278
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,480
ABC is about heart.

279
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,480
It's a little upstart network.

280
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,480
You don't want to see some big company owning it.

281
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,480
No.

282
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,480
How weird would that be?

283
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,480
No, it's bad.

284
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:42,480
I want all my favorites to be like in a little cottage of content.

285
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,480
That's right.

286
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,480
So well, that's exciting.

287
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,480
We'll monitor that.

288
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,480
But this was in this era of so the show is back.

289
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,480
A Wonderful World of Disney.

290
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,480
And we and so they're making an effort to this was I think in the first few months.

291
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,480
And I remember this era.

292
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:04,480
I was excited by this era because we're getting a bunch of great new Disney films, all of which have some novelty to them.

293
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:11,480
Some of which are like reprisals of old IP, you know, mixed in with like they just showed Toy Story or whatever.

294
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,480
But I was trying to remember some of these.

295
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:20,480
And it's the first one of this era was a movie called Toothless where Kirsty Alley is the Tooth Fairy.

296
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,480
There was a movie called Angels in the End Zone.

297
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:31,480
Remember there was another Angels in the Outfield where Christopher Lloyd came back and my high school classmate David Gallagher was in it.

298
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,480
Little disgust.

299
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,480
I think at this point, my date with the president's daughter was in this era.

300
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:43,480
If you remember that one, that is kind of a charming that is that's Wilfred Dell from World.

301
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:51,480
Who is it was funny enough in that that I'm like, I don't know how he didn't become kind of a low budget romcom lead.

302
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,480
Sure. In the wake of it.

303
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:58,480
The next week after Tower of Terror, they showed the brandy Whitney Houston Cinderella.

304
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,480
That's what I was going to ask.

305
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,480
That's what I was going to ask.

306
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,480
That was right after this.

307
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,480
OK, that's the same run.

308
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,480
Yeah, because I remember that.

309
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,480
I remember the renew marketing push.

310
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:15,480
Like I was certainly the hook line and sinker for the refresh wonderful Disney.

311
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:21,480
Looking back, I in my head, I'd mush together the ride opening and this movie.

312
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,480
But it's three years later.

313
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,480
No, it was after the fact.

314
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,480
After the fact. Yes.

315
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:37,480
The audiences in Florida have become accustomed to this property and they've taken many rides on the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror, leading notably to the movie Tower of Terror.

316
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,480
Something was missing along the way.

317
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:46,480
Well, that I got like that was like, OK, that's like comic book logic.

318
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,480
Like the Wolverines and every issue of the X-Men, but the X-Men aren't in every issue of Wolf.

319
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,480
He has his own adventure.

320
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,480
You worked that out when you were a kid.

321
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,480
I worked it out when I was a kid.

322
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,480
It's like, oh, there's a Rod Serling in this Wolverine is the prototype.

323
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,480
There's no Twilight Zone stuff.

324
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,480
It's just the original story of the ride.

325
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,480
I get that I liked and I loved the ride.

326
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,480
I feel like, yeah, I loved it, too.

327
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,480
I love the ride. I've been on the ride.

328
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,480
I love the ride.

329
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,480
So I was excited for a movie based on the ride.

330
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:21,480
I feel like they were able to double dip, like get people who hadn't been there like, oh, look, it's yeah, that's right.

331
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,480
Yeah, we should we should go check that out.

332
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,480
And then people who had been there like, oh, it's like it's the ride.

333
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,480
It's the building.

334
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,480
So you're describing people said watching TV and saying, look, that's that ride.

335
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,480
We should go.

336
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,480
Look, a lot of people didn't have Internet.

337
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,480
So we had to get our kicks wherever we could.

338
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,480
You know, from the television.

339
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,480
That so that implies that you watch this at the time.

340
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:48,480
Yeah. As I did this and I think the brandy Cinderella, which is on Disney Plus.

341
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,480
And we watched a couple of years ago and we're like, yeah, that was pretty good.

342
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:59,480
And this I also was like, this held up pretty this is a pretty competently made movie.

343
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,480
This is kind of like it is. Yes.

344
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,480
It is a solid movie.

345
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,480
But I'm sure there's holes. I'm sure there's holes.

346
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,480
Don't you almost wish that it wasn't, though?

347
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,480
I 100. Look, I have no nostalgia for this.

348
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,480
I didn't know existed when it was out and watching it.

349
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,480
Now I go, this is too like fine.

350
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:22,480
The movies. Yes, for its it is it is in tribute to the people who made it.

351
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,480
Yes, it is fine. Yeah.

352
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,480
But now, yeah, like what do you do?

353
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,480
What do we do?

354
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:35,480
We just we just show we describe the plot of a fine movie, I guess is what we did.

355
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:40,480
The guy who made Are You Afraid of the Dark made this, which is a show I really liked as a kid.

356
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,480
And I could feel the Are You Afraid of the Dark in this.

357
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,480
Yeah, yeah, sure.

358
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:54,480
Light thrills, light thrills, mild ookiness, little messages, little hearts, the big kind of like, oh, is he going to do the right thing?

359
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,480
No, yes, he is.

360
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,480
Turns, turns, good little turns. Yeah.

361
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,480
That actually worked for me. Yeah.

362
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,480
The turns. Yes. I didn't see them coming.

363
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,480
Did you see this when it was out, when it was aired?

364
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:11,480
I think my history with this being a theme park fan and then seeing it pop up on YouTube,

365
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:22,480
I have given it a go and gotten lost kind of in the first half hour because while it ultimately ended up working fine for me,

366
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,480
there's a while there where it's like this is the most daytime horror movie.

367
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,480
Oh, I know.

368
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:34,480
Of every seat. It's just like it's sort of like aesthetic-less for a while.

369
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,480
And I just got, it just lost me in that realm.

370
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,480
But here now that I had to watch it, it's my job to watch it.

371
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,480
I made it to the end and I'm like, okay, you know what?

372
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,480
It started picking up a little mojo.

373
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,480
It became, it started to feel like a light horror movie.

374
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,480
Some aesthetics entered the picture, some darkness and some creepiness.

375
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,480
When Gutenberg is not doing the heavy lifting, the movie gets better.

376
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,480
Yes, yeah. That's what I would say.

377
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,480
I mean, let's, yeah, maybe it's the time to talk about that.

378
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:14,480
Steve Gutenberg is the star of the film and it's the thing that probably from a distance makes you think, well, this must be a hokey film, right?

379
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,480
Is that sort of how, now I'm questioning why do I feel that way?

380
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,480
Steve Gutenberg kind of has this jokiness about him.

381
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:31,480
And where does it come from? Is it his name? Is there something that he's especially bad in that, is it this?

382
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:36,480
Why does Gutenberg feel like a joke?

383
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,480
I can tell you where it starts for me. It's the Stonecutter song on The Simpsons.

384
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,480
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

385
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,480
And I knew that they were making fun of him.

386
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,480
The Illuminati organization does all of these things.

387
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,480
Who keeps the metric system down?

388
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,480
But then elsewhere in the song is who makes Steve Gutenberg a star?

389
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,480
And it's all bad stuff.

390
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:00,480
Yes, yeah, yeah. It's all terribly evil or just suspicious.

391
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,480
So I was like, at the time I went, OK, got it. Steve Gutenberg sucks.

392
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:12,480
But is that it? Is that just, I mean, this is a feeling I have all the time now where there's somebody just like, guess who's starring in every movie and show?

393
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,480
And I'm like, but why?

394
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,480
Well, yeah.

395
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,480
I mean, this is a very common thing now.

396
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:22,480
That person is not necessarily always like a malicious presence.

397
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,480
No.

398
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,480
Sometimes it's just like, well, this guy's a little like bland, a little nothing.

399
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,480
Yeah.

400
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,480
And then they just like strike gold with the agents of the world and now they're in prime position.

401
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,480
Yeah.

402
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,480
And then they won't be in like a year after it all comes out and is boring and bad.

403
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:51,480
As a kid, in the same way that I would mush together Billy Joel and Bruce Springsteen just because they were so ubiquitous at like where I grew up and family parties and.

404
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,480
All right. I will accept this as if it's not insane. Yes. OK.

405
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,480
Well, OK.

406
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,480
But in.

407
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,480
How old were you?

408
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,480
Like in my single digits.

409
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,480
Like I'm saying people playing these at like weddings or christening.

410
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,480
Hearing the songs.

411
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,480
Yeah. Hearing the songs.

412
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,480
Not the men. OK.

413
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,480
Not the men.

414
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,480
Why does that think that's weirder?

415
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,480
I think the songs aren't alike at all.

416
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,480
Yeah. But when you're a kid, you don't necessarily.

417
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,480
No, I'll forgive the kid.

418
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,480
No.

419
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,480
Again, I just mean to say they're like the wallpaper.

420
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,480
They were kind of.

421
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,480
You weren't actively paying attention.

422
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,480
Sure.

423
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,480
Yes. I wasn't paying attention.

424
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:28,480
In that same way, I would mush together Billy Crystal and Steve Gutenberg.

425
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,480
Interesting.

426
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:36,480
Because they both kind of had the same like kind of funny way about them.

427
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,480
And in a lot like.

428
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,480
I would say Albert Brooks, Steve Gutenberg.

429
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,480
And when I was younger, maybe I was a little confused by.

430
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,480
OK. OK.

431
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,480
Yeah. Yeah. Because none of the movies are for you exactly.

432
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,480
Right. So you haven't had the cause to really sit and investigate.

433
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:57,480
I might have known the difference by the time or Steve Gutenberg landed with me more because he was in the Olsen Twins film.

434
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,480
It takes two. Oh, yeah.

435
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,480
And to my kid sister, I would see most of the Olsen Twins content.

436
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,480
Kirstie Alley aforementioned an acceptable film.

437
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,480
Fine.

438
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,480
Sure. I've never seen it.

439
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,480
I know reason to, but it satisfied what it needed to then.

440
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:24,480
I think that would be like a teacher is hung over or teacher doesn't feel well, but it's still that like that in school.

441
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,480
Any Olsen Twins thing.

442
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:33,480
Sure. Because it's like I don't even have to check this to know this is fine to show a lot of them have songs.

443
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,480
So music teachers would often be like, we're watching.

444
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,480
We're watching this today.

445
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,480
You know, you want to hear perfect two part harmony and listen to the Olsen Twins.

446
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,480
Yeah. Yeah.

447
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,480
Do what they do.

448
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,480
It takes two.

449
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:53,480
I just remember that the plot of it, that it is the parent trap, but with real twins and not optical illusions.

450
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,480
Oh, oh, the same thing.

451
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,480
So what if we get we oh my gosh, this is our excuse to do the parent.

452
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,480
We don't have to do any comping.

453
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,480
We have the twins already.

454
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,480
We have to do it.

455
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,480
Is it?

456
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,480
There's a good chance that many Olsen Twins movies are that they have that plot.

457
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

458
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,480
They might have done.

459
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,480
I mean, I'm sure I don't know every episode of so little time.

460
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:24,480
I don't know the full filmography, but I imagine that they used their lookalike abilities to do a lot of fun mix them ups.

461
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,480
Yeah. Yeah.

462
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,480
So so Gutenberg. Yes.

463
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,480
And now I don't again.

464
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,480
There's that Simpsons thing.

465
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,480
But I'm like, what am I?

466
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,480
What have I seen where Gutenberg like sucks?

467
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,480
I don't feel that way in Three Men and a Baby.

468
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,480
Yeah.

469
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,480
Those are fine.

470
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,480
He's fine in that.

471
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,480
Yeah.

472
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,480
He's fine in this also.

473
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:57,480
I'm just saying once the characters show up, it gets moving a little bit because they're more they're like horror, you know, archetype broad quick hit kind of character.

474
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,480
So you're like more interested in what a crazy voiced ghost guy is doing.

475
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,480
I think it's the weakness of the whole thing.

476
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:13,480
Listeners, if you don't know, this is we said that it starts with the one song from the 30s and it starts with an effect, an entire scene in the 30s as just as the ride begins.

477
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,480
But after that, it becomes entirely modern day.

478
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,480
And the modern day, I think, is the struggle.

479
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,480
Don't you almost want to see?

480
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:27,480
I was like, either I want to see an entire 30s movie or I want or I want there to be 30s.

481
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,480
And then we pick it up in like the 50s.

482
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,480
And like Sam Spade guy is solving the mystery of what.

483
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:40,480
So we're still in a time period because the 90s are very dull and play a very dull.

484
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,480
Yeah.

485
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,480
Is the new haunted.

486
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,480
Have you seen the new Haunted Mansion?

487
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,480
I know it did just streaming.

488
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,480
Is it modern day?

489
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,480
I think so.

490
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,480
Yeah, I believe so.

491
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,480
This is a big problem.

492
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,480
It's like all this stuff.

493
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:56,480
And this is like they have like we need it to be like people aren't going to understand if it's in the past.

494
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,480
And it's like people like the aesthetic of the old past.

495
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,480
It's creepier.

496
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,480
It can be weirder.

497
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,480
It feels more otherworldly.

498
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,480
Now, I don't think any kid is like bothered by.

499
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:18,480
No, because you get to enter this whole world like some dumb executive like brain thing where it's like, well, we need to have some sort of like adult from the 90s who's struggling with something.

500
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,480
And we have to deal with him for 30, 40 minutes.

501
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,480
And then we can get to like the old timey ghost stuff.

502
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,480
And you're like, no, we just.

503
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:32,480
Well, there is so much 90s specifics in here.

504
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,480
One, the weekly world news.

505
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,480
Oh, yeah.

506
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,480
Of it.

507
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,480
Oh, yes.

508
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,480
The crazy tabloids we all see.

509
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,480
The name of Steve Gutenberg's character.

510
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,480
Yes.

511
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,480
Is it Bucky?

512
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,480
It's no.

513
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,480
It's Buzzy Crocker.

514
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,480
Buzzy.

515
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,480
OK.

516
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,480
Buzzy Crocker.

517
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:54,480
Just so we don't end up in a run of like now let's explain the entire plot in a row.

518
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,480
Buzzy Crocker is a writer for the National Inquisitor.

519
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:04,480
And when we meet him, he seems as far as we can tell, he's the king of nonsense.

520
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,480
How could you believe that kind of stories?

521
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:13,480
But they get the tabloids flying and he seems like a little like Buzzy seems a little scuzzy.

522
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,480
Yeah, he's cynical.

523
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,480
He just wants to make money.

524
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,480
And we find that he's faking it essentially.

525
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,480
He's faking most of what he does.

526
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,480
He's a liar.

527
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,480
But yes, Jason, that's true.

528
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,480
It's very like that's very of its era.

529
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,480
And like people now I think you just know what it is.

530
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,480
Like, oh, yeah.

531
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,480
So they started making all these newspapers and made up stuff to buy.

532
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:37,480
But at the time you'd get like I remember being with my mom or grandma at the grocery store and like, what?

533
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,480
You expect us to believe this?

534
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:45,480
Like almost akin to like or like a 90s not understanding like, you know, wrestling isn't real.

535
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,480
Yes, it's more complicated.

536
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,480
And that's a weird and also a movie's are real.

537
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

538
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,480
Why are we applying that logic?

539
00:30:53,480 --> 00:31:01,480
Also the 90s, the real newspaper newsroom is the most hectic place on earth.

540
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,480
Oh, yeah.

541
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,480
It's just constantly firing people handing papers to take a phone calls.

542
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,480
And yeah, there's there's not a still moment in it.

543
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,480
Yes. And the people there are deadly serious.

544
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,480
Unlike. Yeah, this is the news.

545
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,480
Yeah. Get real.

546
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:19,480
Yes. Well, there's that because his girlfriend.

547
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,480
Correct.

548
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:32,480
Works at the ex-girlfriend that when this when we meet them is from the legitimate news from the Los Angeles banner, I believe.

549
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:39,480
And then we come to find that he used to be a legitimate journalist.

550
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,480
He was not about faking everything and chasing sensationalized stuff.

551
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,480
And he kind of maybe pines to to go back to that.

552
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,480
What he what happened was that he fell for some fake news.

553
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,480
He was handed a tape.

554
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,480
I'm good. They don't really resolve who gave him a T.

555
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:00,480
He was he wrote he wistfully recalls a story he wrote mobster mayor.

556
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,480
And it was a video of the mayor taking a bribe from the mob.

557
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,480
But the video was a fake.

558
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,480
Right. And now I wonder that leaves me with questions about this.

559
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:18,480
This is not in an AI deep fake era where actors dressed up as the mayor and as a bugsy esque mobster.

560
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,480
Hey, I get there is a bag of cash for you right here.

561
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,480
I don't know. I don't know how he fell for this.

562
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,480
I don't know. He really should have double checked.

563
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:36,480
Yeah, I feel like newspapers of that caliber, especially back then, really went to great lengths to authenticate weird videotapes.

564
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,480
Yeah, yeah. So I don't know.

565
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:47,480
I don't remember who despite growing up here and I remember who the mayor was at that time, maybe an easily fakeable mayor.

566
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:55,480
If the if the mayor had a mustache or a big silly hair, then maybe if you know, like you could this is New York, but you could fake an Ed Koch from behind.

567
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,480
Oh, that's really. Yeah. Yeah.

568
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,480
You really think you should see the face, though.

569
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,480
Buzzy. Come on, Buzzy.

570
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,480
You should see the face of the mayor.

571
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:09,480
Well, he might have maybe he got too eager and like we got because he had he needed to make his career.

572
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:13,480
So it's like, get it. Who cares? It's vetted. Somebody gave me this. Who was it? I don't know.

573
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,480
A guy. He was nice. Yeah.

574
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,480
So I don't know. But it destroyed his career.

575
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,480
And now he's a tabloid shady guy, although it seems like that's going.

576
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,480
He's doing better. Fine, too. Yeah, I know.

577
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:29,480
And you don't have like all the integrity ish. You can just like run around and do a little.

578
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,480
It's not that. Little dress up shoots with your niece.

579
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:36,480
It is also funny that it's like treated sort of like as very serious thing that he's doing.

580
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,480
That's like unethical, where it's like most people knew that like Wolf Boy wasn't real.

581
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:46,480
So when they put Wolf Boy on the cover of these, like people like really upset with him.

582
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,480
And it's like he could be doing worse things with his life.

583
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:57,480
Oh, you also get a snippet of another 90s go to where like the actor is hired to play a doctor.

584
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,480
And there's a gag where he's going to saw off an alien head.

585
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,480
But Kirsten Dunst is in the end. The actor is very actor.

586
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:08,480
Like very actor for like 90s.

587
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,480
Like, did you believe my performance?

588
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:16,480
Like, you know, that sort of like when it breaks and now everybody's an actor.

589
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,480
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, this is presented to us as the Steve Gutenberg movie.

590
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:33,480
But it's interesting because we're that that is the first mention of Kirsten Dunst, the second lead of it, who really the career at this point of Kirsten Dunst.

591
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:40,480
Like it's like she was a big star already, I feel like, in making this.

592
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:46,480
And because interview with the Vampire had already happened, which I just saw for the first time.

593
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,480
It was really entertaining. I really enjoyed it.

594
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,480
She's nominated for Golden Globe already.

595
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:58,480
And then right after this, she has like she goes like straight to a ton of big old movies, which is sort of hasn't stopped since.

596
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,480
So it's almost like the only lull in Kirsten Dunst's career is this film.

597
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,480
This is the one. This is the valley.

598
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,480
And not to say because, look, it's still it's a job and it's a Disney movie.

599
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,480
Her only Disney movie hasn't done anything.

600
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,480
Hasn't done a Marvel or anything.

601
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:20,480
But here's what I having just watched interview the Vampire and that she is like doing this great performance against these giant stars.

602
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,480
And I was adding up like everything she did before this before Tower of Terror.

603
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:30,480
And then I made a list. This is this is a list of the actors who she had worked with.

604
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,480
And these aren't just people who are in the movie.

605
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,480
Also, she had scenes with everybody I'm going to mention.

606
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,480
This is all before the age of 15 when she shoots Tower of Terror.

607
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:50,480
Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Robin Williams, George Clooney, Woody Allen and Mia Farrow, Winona Ryder, Susan Sarandon, Kirk Douglas, Nick Nolte.

608
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:56,480
And months before shooting Tower of Terror, Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro in Wag the Dog.

609
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,480
Wow. That that is at 50.

610
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,480
She has exclusively worked with the biggest stars of the century.

611
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,480
That's so bonkers.

612
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,480
That is when you have that all together.

613
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,480
Bring it on. It's just a few years after this.

614
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:15,480
Yeah. Then she enters this like really good comedy run and then Spider-Man soon after.

615
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:23,480
I remember being very excited seeing Dick in theaters because there were so many comedy people.

616
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:30,480
I'm like just a weird 12 or 13 year old just going like it's got Bruce McCullough and Will Ferrell.

617
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,480
I feel like it was heavily promoted in Entertainment Weekly as well.

618
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,480
It was pretty.

619
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,480
I remember you in Entertainment Weekly.

620
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,480
I was in Entertainment Weekly.

621
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,480
Were you as well? EW? Were you an EW kid?

622
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,480
I would look at it at the library sometimes.

623
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,480
Sounds like a no.

624
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:50,480
Me too. Until I demanded a subscription then yes I would also look at it at the library.

625
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:56,480
Let's go to the library mom. Straight to like well how's Legends of the Fall doing on the box office?

626
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:03,480
Well they started doing comic book coverage at some point around 99 or 2000.

627
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:11,480
And it's like alright we hit the big time and now the big time is like haunted house.

628
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:17,480
Like you can't escape comic book stuff. It's just the chains we've forged in life.

629
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,480
It's going to destroy the movie industry.

630
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,480
So we have you guys to blame. If you'd kept your mouth shut back then.

631
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:31,480
No no I was just rooting around in dirty bins in smoke-filled holiday and ballrooms.

632
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:38,480
Anyway I guess I'm saying that like at this I think maybe she just like had a pocket she needed to fill.

633
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:50,480
A job came up. Let's do it. But I think already at 15 with that list of credits I think that being in this kind of slow moving Disney light horror movie with Steve Guttenberg.

634
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,480
This is beneath Kirsten Dunst I think. I mean she does an admirable job.

635
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,480
Sure. I mean maybe there was a strategic reason. They were like well Disney we got to get you in at Disney.

636
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:05,480
I don't know. I'm not sure what the reasoning was but yes when you put them all together like that this definitely seems to be an outlier.

637
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:09,480
It's like skippable in a Wikipedia.

638
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,480
Yeah. It's a TV movie.

639
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,480
It also.

640
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:20,480
Yes. Well hey maybe it came with a hole. She had a hole in her schedule. Maybe it came with a trip to Disney World for the family.

641
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,480
Possibly.

642
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,480
Well that's at the time when they used to do stuff like that.

643
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,480
Yeah that's true.

644
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:35,480
When Disney was nice to the people in their movies. Not like you think about what we gave you and now you want more. You greedy pig.

645
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,480
Speaking of which.

646
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,480
Yeah.

647
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:46,480
Tower of Terror the movie. The new iteration of this that has been discussed is that I guess is still in the works in theory.

648
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,480
Is it?

649
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:51,480
I'm trying to tell. It's not not in the works. It hasn't been killed off entirely.

650
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:59,480
They killed the Taika Star Wars finally I think. He collected his two million dollars to do nothing and then they've canceled it finally.

651
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,480
So he's attached to Tower of Terror.

652
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,480
Yeah I don't think I realized that till this morning.

653
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,480
So I'm just saying.

654
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,480
So are you saying that a Taika attachment means next to nothing?

655
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,480
I'm just perhaps I'm saying that it might not come to fruition.

656
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:23,480
I think this man when he enters a room he hunkers down and you have my focus. You have my full attention sir. Phones down. Phones off.

657
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,480
Sure.

658
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:33,480
I will not be Instagramming. I will not be checking emails about the 35 other things I'm attached to that are all the biggest properties in the history of the earth.

659
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,480
Two words.

660
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,480
That I got all of them.

661
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,480
Two words. Stretch Armstrong. Okay.

662
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:44,480
You write the dollar sign after stretch Armstrongs.

663
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,480
Turn the S's into dollar signs.

664
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,480
Oh yeah.

665
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:57,480
Anyways they're trying to make more of this but we don't have a lot of details about that. We don't know if it's the same characters. We don't know if.

666
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,480
Is it Buzzy Crocker?

667
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,480
Are we back to Buzzy Crocker?

668
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,480
Yes I don't know.

669
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,480
I'm guessing no but I don't know for sure.

670
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:13,480
Buzzy Crocker is aggregating like the top ten gardening tools you can get on Amazon. Like he's making those lists.

671
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,480
But now he's getting replaced by AI. Now AI just writes all those articles.

672
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,480
So where is Buzzy? What's Buzzy to do?

673
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,480
What's Buzzy doing?

674
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:25,480
Does he have to reinvestigate? Or maybe it's a different tower.

675
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:29,480
It's a retelling of the story I think. So it's not.

676
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,480
We modernize it. It's not. Okay. Okay.

677
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,480
And Jared Leto is Buzzy Crocker.

678
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,480
Because Disney loves him. I mean that's just what they would do.

679
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,480
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes.

680
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,480
He's in every movie that there is.

681
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:47,480
Yeah. Yeah. And he's going. He's deep diving for his part as Buzzy Crocker by doing what Buzzy Crocker would do and sending Jizz to people in the mail.

682
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,480
Yeah. Yeah. He's sending Jizz for sure.

683
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,480
It's very Buzzy.

684
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,480
That's what Buzzy would do in 2023.

685
00:40:53,480 --> 00:41:00,480
So that's kind of the. So okay. So Christian Dunst is the niece who helps him out with these little charades.

686
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,480
And that's what seems to be happening again with the Tower of Terror.

687
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:11,480
Because in this world, the Tower of Terror seems to be a big story, one that everybody remembers.

688
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:15,480
And it's on the Hollywood skyline. But nobody's been there in a long time.

689
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,480
Like nobody's really hanging out in this place.

690
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:21,480
But it's the same characters as you see in the ride.

691
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,480
It's the same group of five who get stuck in the limbo.

692
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,480
And the little girl, Shirley Temple equivalent, Sally Shine.

693
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:38,480
We learned that in this universe, this is one of the most notorious deaths ever that has made her a legend ever since.

694
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:43,480
This is like day the music died. Everybody knows the Sally Shine tale.

695
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:48,480
So what's my overall point? I don't remember.

696
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,480
This is the it's the universe where this is a big deal.

697
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,480
This is JFK. This is moon landing or whatever.

698
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:03,480
And but then Buzzy gets a lead that is about like maybe we don't know what actually happened that night.

699
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:11,480
Right. Yes. So yeah, you would have to think it's like hearing that there was like a conspiracy with the JFK assassination.

700
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:15,480
It's that level of big deal, which I don't know why Buzzy's getting the scoop.

701
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:21,480
I feel like it would be a bigger deal, like although, you know, really it's RFK goes on Joe Rogan to talk about that.

702
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,480
Now, RFK Jr. goes on to talk about a JFK conspiracy.

703
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,480
So maybe it is is Buzzy similar to a Joe Rogan now.

704
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,480
Everybody would. I mean, like, you know, Trump would have been talking about the Sally Shine.

705
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,480
Exactly. So yeah, maybe with Sally Shine.

706
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:38,480
We can't trust them. Yeah.

707
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:44,480
Yeah. So I like the sister Alex Jones would be Abigail.

708
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,480
Everyone had their eyes on Sally Shine. They should have been watching Abigail.

709
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,480
She was the snake in the grass. OK.

710
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:57,480
Trump definitely would have been a big Sally Shine movie fan, though, because as we know, Trump loves Sunset Boulevard.

711
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:03,480
He loves old Hollywood. So enchanting, magical, delight.

712
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,480
The oh, the step, the tapping. Oh, the tapping.

713
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,480
The tapping is it takes you to another world.

714
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:14,480
We stopped at a gas station when we were out on the campaign trail.

715
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:22,480
And there at the cash register by the candy bars, there was box of DVDs and they had 20 Sally Shine movies for ten dollars.

716
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,480
And I said, I'm getting this and we're watching them on the plane.

717
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,480
And I love a good deal and 20 movies for 10 bucks.

718
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,480
It's the best deal I ever got. Yep.

719
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:36,480
And he would quietly, like while the movie was on, turn to a staff and go like, isn't this great?

720
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,480
Isn't this wonderful?

721
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:43,480
Sir, things are escalating with Putin. I think we should.

722
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:46,480
This is only the sixth, the sixth Sally Shine movie of the day.

723
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,480
She's got a big lollipop. Don't bother me to wear it.

724
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,480
Movie 11. Look at, she's got a bigger lollipop now.

725
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:55,480
In this one, she dances with a big tuna.

726
00:43:55,480 --> 00:44:00,480
Giant tuna, the biggest you've ever seen. I got a bigger one.

727
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,480
Look at the ringlets. They're so adorable.

728
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,480
The red tried to get Ivanka to do the ringlets.

729
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:15,480
So this old lady approaches. Why does this happen?

730
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,480
I honestly, I know the old lady's there.

731
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,480
It reminded me of Titanic in a way, but I don't remember.

732
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:25,480
She wants to tell, she says I was there I believe.

733
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,480
Or she at least conveys that.

734
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,480
She knows, oh wait a minute, yes.

735
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:33,480
She knows that there was foul play with the elevator.

736
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,480
She says no one will believe me.

737
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:44,480
No one will believe me. She says she had read all of Buzzy's stories about the supernatural and aliens and stuff.

738
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,480
And she's like, you write about this stuff. You'll believe me.

739
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,480
Which is eventually I think kind of revealed to be a ruse.

740
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,480
She's fooling us, she's fooling everyone.

741
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,480
Of course it absolutely is a ruse.

742
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,480
It's a classic are you afraid of the dark tactic.

743
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,480
Spoiler alert.

744
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:06,480
This is the woman who did it. She made the accident happen.

745
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,480
Another are you afraid of the dark tactic.

746
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:15,480
If you think about it a lot, it's very unsettling.

747
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:19,480
As a kid I was like this is really intense.

748
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:27,480
It's an are you afraid of the dark where it's like one piece of information that was omitted has caused something awful to happen.

749
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,480
And now you'll live with regret for the rest of your life.

750
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,480
I'm trying to think of an example. I can't think of one off the top of my head.

751
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:39,480
But it feels very are you afraid of the dark where if only you knew that this is what the person thought or said.

752
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:44,480
And then decades go by and life decisions are made based on missing information.

753
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:50,480
And it's like if you only knew one little thing then everything would have been different.

754
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,480
But in the end.

755
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,480
I'm not a source of anxiety.

756
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:58,480
Are you saying that you were as a kid were just worried they were going to be...

757
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:03,480
I know everything because if I miss something I might send me down this other path.

758
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:10,480
If I don't say goodbye to them now, them or me could die without having said see ya.

759
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:14,480
I mean that's that's that would be a bummer.

760
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:20,480
That's just needless to say. But it wouldn't be quite as bad as like causing the death of a bunch of people.

761
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,480
Yeah. Other people get caught up in this. Yeah.

762
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:27,480
Nothing to do with maybe this is a good time to talk about the the people who we're dealing with.

763
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,480
Sally Shine has been mentioned.

764
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:39,480
Her nanny, Emmaline Partridge, she is blamed for what happened that she put a this nanny.

765
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:47,480
This Hollywood 30s caretaker somehow could put a curse on the girl and the elevator,

766
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:51,480
which caused it to whatever to free fall and they're locked in limbo.

767
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:56,480
Whatever you consider black magic, they say a couple of times.

768
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,480
Wow. OK. This nanny did black magic and that's Emmaline Partridge.

769
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,480
So and now we recognize them from the ride.

770
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:08,480
It's all I what I was trying to remember is I mean I watched the pre-ride video again.

771
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:12,480
None of these names are said. They're just kind of archetypes you get from afar.

772
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:19,480
And I don't know if Imagineering had the names and then they gifted the names to the makers of the film

773
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:28,480
or if the film invented the if all of the mythology of the five characters from the ride was invented by DJ McHale.

774
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:33,480
I do. Do we know? Do you know? Hmm. I don't think I know.

775
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:36,480
So maybe we're getting all these names from this.

776
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:43,480
But now when you go on the Tower of Terror, Florida and France only, you can, you know,

777
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:47,480
if you have if you're with somebody who is nervous, a partner, a family member,

778
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:52,480
nervous about the upcoming drops, you can distract them by saying, I know all of these characters names.

779
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:57,480
It's Caroline Crossan and Gilbert London and Sally Shine and Emmaline Partridge and Dewey Todd.

780
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:00,480
Maybe that will confuse them enough to put them in these.

781
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,480
Yeah, at least they know the put a name to their face. Yeah, yeah.

782
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:09,480
We don't like going on rides and not knowing every single thing that can be known.

783
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:13,480
Well, that's nothing can be a mystery. So now it isn't with this. Great.

784
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:17,480
The other thing about the Guardians Tower is you know all the names. You know, I'm coming in.

785
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:20,480
You don't have to learn all that, except for me, who's never seen the movies.

786
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:25,480
But they say their names. They do say their name with like light up signs. So that that does.

787
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:28,480
That does. Tanelier Tavon. Tanelier Tavon.

788
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:36,480
Caroline Crossan is the glamorous actress singer, boyfriend actor Gilbert London,

789
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:41,480
and then a bellhop named Dewey Todd.

790
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,480
I guess all I could think of with Dewey Todd was Jason.

791
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,480
Do you feel like this is a part that you would like to play if you were?

792
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:54,480
Tread lightly. Yeah, no, I well, I could not get over with the Dewey Todd thing.

793
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,480
The Dewey Todd thing. Then eventually we meet the caretaker of the hotel.

794
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:03,480
Yes. Who is just keeping it from falling down and paying the taxes.

795
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:14,480
And it says it's his grandson. Which leads us to believe that like, was Dewey Todd married?

796
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:19,480
Dewey Todd. He had a child. Yes, he would have had to. Yeah, Dewey Todd.

797
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:22,480
You think a bellhop can't be married? Yeah, what do you mean?

798
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:28,480
You don't think a bellhop fucks? He was kind of, I couldn't place his age.

799
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:34,480
I guess adult, but he was very like, all shucks. Yeah, could be 20, could be 70, I don't know.

800
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:44,480
Yeah. Oh, imagine looking down the end of your bed there and seeing a little bellhop hat popping up and down.

801
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:50,480
And he's got the bell too. You have the bell. All finished.

802
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,480
You have the bell. Let me know if you need anything else. The lady has the bell, yeah.

803
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:58,480
Yes, what do you need? How can I help? Ding ding. Dewey Todd here at your service. What do you need? Where do you want me to go?

804
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:03,480
You just hit it faster when you want him to go faster. Just point to a body part and I'll be there. Ding ding ding ding ding.

805
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:08,480
Then you slow it down. Efficient service as always from me, Dewey Todd. Tips the cap.

806
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:19,480
There's no mention of Dewey Todd is solely obsessed with proving he's not a doofus to his father, who is the owner of the hotel.

807
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:26,480
Seemingly. Yeah. Sure, I remember that. Everything what you just said. Yes, the father. Of course I do.

808
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:36,480
When they're at the party at the end. That and proving to the people that he was stuck in limbo with, like, I didn't do this. This wasn't me. I didn't fuck up.

809
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:45,480
And I fuck. And I fuck. Also, I'm pretty sure, I think my, we were trying to conceive, I don't know if it happened.

810
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:50,480
I'm left in the limbo and I don't know if I had a kid or after that a grand kid. I left a widow and a new child.

811
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:55,480
Well, that's true hell. That's amazing. He has such a chipper attitude. Yeah, really. Given that.

812
00:50:55,480 --> 00:51:04,480
But yes, the connection here becomes, okay, like, so nobody knows what's going on at this hotel, but there is somebody working there, just kind of a caretaker.

813
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:13,480
And that's Dewey Todd's grandson. The grand, somehow the grandson of the bellhop ended up owning the hotel or not owning it, but he's there.

814
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:18,480
He could own it, I think is what, right? He could. Yeah.

815
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:28,480
I think, spoiler, it is what happens. But that's the character who he has got another name, but they only call him Q.

816
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:36,480
Yes. The quartermaster. Q, where is he? What's the guy's name? Michael McShane. There it is. I got it.

817
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:42,480
Yes. Now here's Michael McShane. You were, Jason, before we started recording, you listed some of this man's credits.

818
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:52,480
British Hose Line. British Hose Line. My, like him, or my favorite role of his guys is Professor Keen Bean from the Richie Rich movie.

819
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:59,480
Oh, yeah. From part one, Not Christmas Wish with David Gallagher.

820
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:04,480
I don't know if he's in Chris, I don't think he is, but I could be wrong. He's in a lot of stuff.

821
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:11,480
He's a guy who just pops up in things, especially in the 90s. Yeah. And like I have a lot of affection for him when I see him.

822
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:18,480
So when he popped up in this, I went, hey, Keen Bean. Keen Bean. And he's also, he's on, he's FDR on Seinfeld.

823
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:26,480
Franklin Delano Romanowski. Oh, right. Okay. Kramer and Newman's friend. Oh, yeah. They're playing risk, I believe, against him. Yeah.

824
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:33,480
And he's got, he just pops up in a lot of things. Office space. Office space, yes. He's the hypnotherapist who has a heart attack.

825
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:41,480
And then Ron Livingston is stuck in the like vibing state. Yes. So he's in a lot of stuff. Wait a minute.

826
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:50,480
In Rich, I thought this was right, but I didn't want to vocalize it. In Richie Rich's Christmas Wish, Professor Keen Bean is played by Eugene Levy.

827
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:55,480
Wow, really? What do you mean? Like they cast way up. Yeah, that's not what usually happens.

828
00:52:55,480 --> 00:53:01,480
For no offense to McShane, but you know, like Levy's a star. How does that part? Yeah, how do they? Plus up.

829
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:10,480
Well, is everybody else, like who else is in it? Apparently Marla Maples. Really? Trump's ex. Oh, I know exactly who Marla Maples is.

830
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:22,480
Tiffany's mom. That's weird. As Mrs. Van Doe. Mr. Van Doe is Richard Fancy. Oh, that's Mr. Lipman. Wow, another Seinfeld.

831
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:31,480
Who plays Cadbury in Richie Rich's Christmas Wish? The Butler. The Butler. Keen Curtis might be the same.

832
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:38,480
Is it the same guy? Wait, no, I don't think it is. That's the guy, because the guy from Jumanji plays Cadbury in Richie Rich.

833
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:46,480
From Kirsten Dunst in Jumanji. Yeah. I'm wondering if they did a total recast of everybody.

834
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:52,480
Like, so they failed to lock everybody down for Christmas Wish? I guess. Straight to video a few years later?

835
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:58,480
I don't think anyone recurred unless Leslie Ann Warren was in the, I don't remember who his parents were.

836
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:10,480
There's a really funny, so Professor Keen Bean is like Richie Rich's Q from James Bond. He's like the inventor and he gives Richie Rich all these weapons basically.

837
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:25,480
Oh yes, which come into play. I remember that being one of those movies where I'm loving the first hour as a kid and then it just becomes this scary, it becomes about blasting lasers at the Mount Rushmore being built of the riches.

838
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:32,480
Yeah, and it's very stressful. I've said this before, that I liked the Lassie movie from the 90s because there was no climax at all.

839
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:40,480
Because I remember going, here comes the scare, here comes the intense part, and then the movie just ended and I went, oh good, everything's fine.

840
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:47,480
Okay, great. Richie Rich, yeah, I remember going, when they're showing the mansion and he's got the McDonald's in there.

841
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:52,480
I think if anyone has positive feelings about the movie, it is entirely from the McDonald's scene.

842
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,480
Yeah, there's a McDonald's in the mansion.

843
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:58,480
And there's a roller coaster. We only like roller coaster and McDonald's.

844
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:04,480
I mean those were the only things I liked as a kid. Not going on roller coasters, seeing them. Too scared to go on them.

845
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:11,480
There's a joke, I mean I laughed at this and he's in the room, the professor's room and he's showing off all this stuff.

846
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:15,480
And the professor gives him a bulletproof outfit or some crazy shit.

847
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:23,480
And then he yells at one of his assistants, his child assistant, she's just shooting a machine gun at this suit.

848
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:26,480
I'm like, what is this movie? I don't remember this.

849
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:31,480
That was like a go-to I feel like when you had a Q type character.

850
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:32,480
Oh sure, yeah.

851
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,480
This is bulletproof and they unload a machine gun in it.

852
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,480
It's like, see I'm not lying.

853
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,480
But this was a child's movie.

854
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:43,480
Oh yeah, sure. Blank check too I feel like.

855
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:45,480
Unloaded a machine gun at some point.

856
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:51,480
Well no, no, just in terms of stressful. Blank check the movie, not the podcast.

857
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:57,480
Similar to Richie Rich where it's like at a certain point I'm like, man this kid is having a lot of fun.

858
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:01,480
And then the bad guy, I'm like, is he gonna kill that kid?

859
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:05,480
Yeah, there's real danger, yes. And the FBI is involved.

860
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:09,480
All these era movies, like Dennis the Menace, I just remember the last.

861
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:12,480
Oh yeah, Christopher Lloyd is genuinely really scary.

862
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,480
He does not play that fun.

863
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:15,480
And he's like, yeah, like killing.

864
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:16,480
Gonna cut ya!

865
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:23,480
He's gonna kill Dennis the Menace at the end of the last 30 minutes and I'm like, I do not like this. This is scaring me.

866
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:30,480
See, this is one of my favorite movies from when we were kids, Camp Nowhere.

867
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:37,480
The stakes are very low of like, oh no, we might have to go home early this summer.

868
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,480
That's not as scary.

869
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,480
It's not as scary.

870
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,480
And I was less scared I'd say by animated peril.

871
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:47,480
Beast has fallen to his death, I don't care. I know it's all pretend.

872
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,480
But real actors.

873
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:56,480
And then like, you know, and just, you know, really what it was with Christopher Lloyd and that was like too unshaven.

874
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,480
I was so uncomfortable with his amount of shaving.

875
00:56:58,480 --> 00:56:59,480
I hear ya.

876
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:04,480
Either clean shaven or not. Full beard, the in-between scared me as a kid.

877
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:10,480
I think his teeth and his unshavenness is unkempt. He was unkempt.

878
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:11,480
Yeah.

879
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:15,480
And not in a fun Doc Brown way, who is also unkempt but not in the same way.

880
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:18,480
Yes, or a fun, who's the taxi character?

881
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,480
Jim Magnatowski.

882
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:20,480
Yeah, yeah.

883
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,480
He was also unkempt in a different way.

884
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:26,480
Yes, but unkempt for kids, we don't like unkempt for kids.

885
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,480
Not unkempt for kids.

886
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,480
No one comes around.

887
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:29,480
Faster, very, Kempt.

888
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:32,480
These Hollywood sickos are putting on Kempts in front of our kids.

889
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,480
Right. Sebastian Jackal, very Kempt.

890
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,480
Yes, yeah. He cleans up nice.

891
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,480
Christopher Lloyd can be very Kempt when he wants to be.

892
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,480
Absolutely.

893
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:44,480
They put that coat on the hanger between takes, you know.

894
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:45,480
Yeah, they have the steamer.

895
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:48,480
Yes, get all the hair off, all the dust.

896
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:53,480
Okay, so now, Buzzy.

897
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:57,480
I had the least feel like explaining the plot of the movie.

898
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,480
No, I know, and we're like so early.

899
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,480
We're so early in it, too.

900
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,480
Well, we could blast, you know, whatever.

901
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:07,480
Okay, so we're poking around this hotel and Buzzy assumes he's just going to do his old stuff.

902
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:11,480
He's going to dress up his niece and take fake photos.

903
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:14,480
It's a strange relationship in general.

904
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:15,480
Yeah, I know.

905
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,480
There's something uncomfortable about it.

906
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:19,480
Here, put this on. We'll lie to them all.

907
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:20,480
Yeah.

908
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:29,480
But then he's hiring actresses to be the ghosts in his little fake photo play.

909
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:34,480
And then this mysterious actress shows up named Claire Poulet.

910
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:35,480
Yeah.

911
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:40,480
And she has kind of a strange air about her.

912
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:44,480
And if you're smart at all, you're like ghost, ghost, ghost.

913
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:47,480
She doesn't, she's not loved this era or time.

914
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:48,480
And she's lit different.

915
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:49,480
And this is a ghost.

916
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:50,480
This is a ghost.

917
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,480
Yeah, she's in an old dress.

918
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:56,480
It's Melora Harden later of The Office.

919
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:04,480
And previously of the weird pilot that I love, Shangri-La Plaza, the musical about a strip mall.

920
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:09,480
I know I mentioned it on the show because then I was interviewed for an article about it.

921
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:10,480
Oh, wow.

922
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:11,480
So that proves that I mentioned it on the show.

923
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:13,480
That article exists somewhere.

924
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:15,480
Oh, Melora Harden, I didn't, I.

925
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:16,480
She's in The Rocketeer.

926
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,480
Oh, right.

927
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:18,480
Yes.

928
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:25,480
And I either I knew or I forgot the trivia that she was supposed to be Jennifer in Back to the Future.

929
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:26,480
Oh.

930
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:27,480
Was cast even.

931
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:28,480
You have the part.

932
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,480
Let's even take some promotional photos.

933
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:31,480
And great.

934
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:35,480
Well, we're going to get filming all of our scenes with Eric Stoltz.

935
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,480
So we'll see you in six weeks.

936
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:39,480
We'll be ready for you then.

937
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:40,480
Then things change.

938
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:45,480
They don't work out and they have to call her and say, we have recast and we have this new actor.

939
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:52,480
He is shorter and we don't we just frankly don't believe a short man and a tall woman and she was recast.

940
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:53,480
Yep.

941
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:55,480
Jason thoughts.

942
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:57,480
I don't care for it.

943
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,480
Sympathies to Michael J.

944
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:03,480
Fox, I guess.

945
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:04,480
Yeah.

946
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:09,480
Will listener, would anyone believe a tall girl and a short guy?

947
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,480
What a strange.

948
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:13,480
This was before Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.

949
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:18,480
Which I feel like maybe a long way into making that like, OK, great.

950
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,480
As America, we're comfortable with it.

951
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,480
Seeing such a normal, acceptable couple.

952
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:24,480
Two normal folks.

953
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:25,480
A non-strange couple.

954
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:30,480
Two normal folks being together with a little height difference.

955
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,480
And everything was fine from then on out.

956
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:34,480
America's sweethearts.

957
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,480
But not Back to the Future.

958
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,480
So anyway, she shows up.

959
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:44,480
She's kind of the conduit to the all of the ghosts beginning to appear.

960
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:47,480
And as soon as she shows up, weird stuff starts happening.

961
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:52,480
Green lights and a headless butler who sits up.

962
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:55,480
And now, OK, we're starting to cook here a little bit.

963
01:00:55,480 --> 01:01:03,480
And then it leads to this really unsettling thing where the elevator doors open and there's pure flame behind them.

964
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:10,480
And then that nanny who we're at the moment suspecting is there or just no is the bad guy.

965
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:14,480
She's saying, you're a bad girl.

966
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,480
You're a bad, bad girl.

967
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:19,480
As the flames of hell appear behind Kirsten Dunst.

968
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:21,480
That's genuinely upsetting.

969
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:22,480
Yeah.

970
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:29,480
But then once they actually talk to the ghosts, they realize they don't know the whole story.

971
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:30,480
There's a lot.

972
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,480
There's very quick acceptance of ghosts.

973
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:33,480
There's ghosts here.

974
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:35,480
OK, well, let's have a conversation with them.

975
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:39,480
Not a ton of like, Jesus Christ, like crying for a while and like, no, it's OK.

976
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:44,480
We're ghosts like dealing with like everything we thought we knew about the earth is.

977
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:48,480
Well, yeah, dealing with that and then just being like, oh, so that opens up a world to like my whole family.

978
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:51,480
Like I can talk to them maybe in some ways and they're somewhere else.

979
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:53,480
And what do I think about religion now?

980
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:58,480
Like there needs to be many, many scenes of Steve Gutenberg coming to all of these realizations.

981
01:01:58,480 --> 01:01:59,480
Yeah, yeah, yes.

982
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:05,480
And yeah, yeah, pure, pure weeping, breaking, breaking down, not even speaking English anymore.

983
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:07,480
He feels so insane.

984
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:14,480
The interstellar scene of Matthew McConaughey crying, like seeing his daughter or something with Steve Gutenberg in the Tower of Terror movie.

985
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,480
And perhaps going to the top of the tower and ending his own life.

986
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:18,480
Right.

987
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:19,480
Possibly.

988
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:23,480
I mean, so you could you blame him so freaked out as he by everything he's discovered.

989
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:25,480
This would be very overwhelming all at once.

990
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:26,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

991
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:27,480
To deal with.

992
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:28,480
Do what you got to do, Steve.

993
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:31,480
But instead he's just kind of like, well, I could prove that there's ghosts.

994
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:34,480
And I the whole time I was real.

995
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:37,480
I was like, what am I lacking in Gutenberg?

996
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:38,480
He's not bad.

997
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:39,480
He's not bad.

998
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:43,480
But much like Eisner earlier, there is just not the presence.

999
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:49,480
There's no you really just in a movie like this, you really lean on where you know there's not going to be a lot of effects to make the spooky stuff happen.

1000
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,480
They don't have the biggest budget for that.

1001
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:55,480
So really, you just need an actor who you know is going to be really compelling making faces and going.

1002
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:58,480
And he's just not at all.

1003
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,480
He I don't feel like he's ever scared.

1004
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:03,480
He seems like maybe five percent concerned at times.

1005
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,480
Yes, he's really there.

1006
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:07,480
He's even the whole kind of movie.

1007
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:08,480
Yeah.

1008
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:12,480
Like Eddie Murphy Haunted Mansion doesn't work, but you could tell that they're teasing it.

1009
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:17,480
The trailer was just basically there's a teaser that was just like him going.

1010
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:23,480
Well, at least there's the Eddie Murphy will be interesting to look at as he screams and is scared.

1011
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:24,480
Yes.

1012
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:25,480
Yes.

1013
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:32,480
And there's Steve Gutenberg just frankly is not the I even these movies are not as good as the Don Knotts, the Ghost of Mr.

1014
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:33,480
Chicken movie.

1015
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:35,480
I'm going to take your word for that.

1016
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:36,480
But yes, it's an old of you.

1017
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,480
You've heard of this movie, though.

1018
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:39,480
I think so.

1019
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:43,480
Don Knotts is like a very believe it or not, a timid kind of guy.

1020
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:46,480
And he has to spend the night in a haunted house.

1021
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:50,480
And boy, imagine Don Knotts selling being scared.

1022
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:51,480
He did it all the time.

1023
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:53,480
These guys aren't doing anything close to that.

1024
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:55,480
Gutenberg is just, yeah, goes OK.

1025
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:59,480
Don Knotts made a meal out of being alone, being scared.

1026
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:08,480
He looked like a living like the Haunted Mansion ghost that pop up with like locked in ghoulish like, whoa, that's just what Don Knotts looked like all the time.

1027
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:09,480
That's true.

1028
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:10,480
So it was a natural thing for him.

1029
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,480
Perma scared animatronic.

1030
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:18,480
Do you think they based the shaky need groundskeeper on Don Knotts?

1031
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,480
I kind of looks like Don Knotts, doesn't he?

1032
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:25,480
I think Don Knotts influenced scared characters for decades.

1033
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:29,480
And I feel like is there any better scared guy on TV than him?

1034
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:35,480
I can't think of one off the top of my head of somebody who like watching be scared or nervous.

1035
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:43,480
His whole character was as I maybe talked about on this show before he developed a character called like Nervous Man before Andy Griffith show.

1036
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:44,480
OK.

1037
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:48,480
So like he came in with like I'm the perfect guy to be nervous.

1038
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:53,480
So like that's how that's how he made his career basically.

1039
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:57,480
So but I'm just like, do you have any influence on you?

1040
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,480
Either of you in that way?

1041
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:01,480
He is perpetually nervous.

1042
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:06,480
I'm sure he did because we watched the end of Griffith show all the time was a child and he was my favorite kid.

1043
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:10,480
Like what kid wouldn't like him the best, I guess, if all made nervousness acceptable.

1044
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:11,480
Right.

1045
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:12,480
It's a lot of care.

1046
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:16,480
I mean, Jim neighbors certainly was influential, but not as much as Don Knotts.

1047
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:17,480
Don Knotts, I don't think.

1048
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:21,480
But Don Knotts Haunted Mansion from the old days would have been awesome, I bet.

1049
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:22,480
Well, they should have cranked it out.

1050
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:24,480
They should have gotten that movie going.

1051
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:25,480
Absolutely.

1052
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:27,480
He was already in like Disney stuff.

1053
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:29,480
That movie should have come out in 1971.

1054
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:30,480
Yes.

1055
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:35,480
Starring Dean Jones and who was the one actress they liked?

1056
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:37,480
Suzanne, Suzanne Bouchette.

1057
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:38,480
Yes, Suzanne Bouchette's in there.

1058
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:39,480
Yeah.

1059
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:40,480
And Don Knotts.

1060
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:41,480
Film it in the ride.

1061
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:44,480
And it's still bad, but it's better than this stuff.

1062
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:45,480
Yeah.

1063
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:46,480
There's something to it.

1064
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:47,480
Yes.

1065
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:48,480
There's an aesthetic we like.

1066
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:49,480
I'd say so.

1067
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:55,480
You know what I was comparing this movie to the whole time was the recent film before this

1068
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:57,480
came out, Casper.

1069
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:02,480
Casper, I think a movie that works pretty well and that kind of sticks with everybody.

1070
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:10,480
And that's like a haunted, that's a guy and a younger girl in a haunted house.

1071
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:14,480
And that's modern and we don't care that it's modern.

1072
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:17,480
The modernness doesn't bother because it's all kind of a magical reality.

1073
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:18,480
It's in the worlds.

1074
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:19,480
Yeah.

1075
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:24,480
And when you compare Pullman to Pullman just has like, he's like kind of an odd, ticky

1076
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,480
David Lynch actor.

1077
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:26,480
He's a weird actor.

1078
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:29,480
So you plop him in a family movie and that's going to round him out a little, but he'll

1079
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:31,480
naturally bring odd tickiness to it.

1080
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:32,480
Yes.

1081
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,480
And that's where I think Gutenberg is not the right.

1082
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:38,480
They needed somebody with like a little darkness for this to work a little better.

1083
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:39,480
Yes.

1084
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:43,480
And I think with a recast, I think this might end up closer to the lane of like a Hocus

1085
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:46,480
Pocus that we, you know, what's not bad is that Tower of Terror.

1086
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:47,480
I watched that every Halloween.

1087
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:50,480
I think you get maybe like, and I don't know who did the cinematographer.

1088
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:52,480
You get like a different cinematographer.

1089
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,480
The day has to be, it should just all be at night also.

1090
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:55,480
Never day.

1091
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:56,480
Yes.

1092
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:59,480
Different cinematographer all night and then kind of a weirder leading guy.

1093
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:00,480
Yeah.

1094
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:01,480
Yeah.

1095
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:05,480
Cause Kirsten Dunst and in Casper, Christina Ricci.

1096
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:06,480
Both good.

1097
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:07,480
Both.

1098
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:08,480
Yeah.

1099
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:09,480
Really fun.

1100
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:10,480
I couldn't figure out who.

1101
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:16,480
I was trying to think who's, who's gettable in this era who's a little creepy and maybe

1102
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,480
he, I think this is too far.

1103
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:21,480
Although, Hey, look, I would never complain about seeing this person.

1104
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:22,480
Crispin Glover.

1105
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:23,480
Crispin Glover is the dad.

1106
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:24,480
Oh my God.

1107
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:25,480
Put him in a family movie.

1108
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:26,480
He's good.

1109
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:33,480
It legit good in like Mike, the movie where a little Bow Wow finds the magic shoes so

1110
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:37,480
he could play basketball and he's an evil orphanage owner in it.

1111
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:38,480
But that's scary.

1112
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:39,480
I guess maybe he can't be like the dad.

1113
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:40,480
He's pretty scary.

1114
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:41,480
He's too, yes.

1115
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:45,480
You know, the only time he works for family movies, I guess, is he's still a villain.

1116
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:46,480
Yeah.

1117
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:47,480
He's good for sure.

1118
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,480
But yeah, that's like 97.

1119
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:52,480
But he wasn't scary in Back to the Future.

1120
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,480
Other than just being genuinely, generally.

1121
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:56,480
Yeah.

1122
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:57,480
He's very unnerving.

1123
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:58,480
Uh huh.

1124
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:02,480
But I feel like that might be too unnerving for your lead guy because Pullman is the perfect

1125
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:05,480
example of like kind of weird guy.

1126
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:06,480
But I still as a kid liked him.

1127
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:07,480
Yes.

1128
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:08,480
I was still like, oh good.

1129
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:09,480
It's Bill Pullman.

1130
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:12,480
I feel, I feel good about this.

1131
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:15,480
But yeah, is there another TV guy?

1132
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:18,480
I'm trying to think of anyone was like Brent Spiner.

1133
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:19,480
Oh my God, please.

1134
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:20,480
Brent Spiner.

1135
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:21,480
Jonathan Frakes.

1136
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:22,480
Frakes.

1137
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:24,480
Frakes though is too little too smooth.

1138
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:28,480
I think you want a little bit more of like a dark darkness in there.

1139
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:29,480
Frakes is such a.

1140
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:32,480
So there's an investigation to be done at the Tower of Terror.

1141
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:33,480
He's a little too.

1142
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:34,480
Hi, I'm Mike Laughlin.

1143
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:35,480
Sure.

1144
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:36,480
That's close.

1145
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:39,480
You've just been in also a villain part, but Flintstones.

1146
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:44,480
He works in a family movie, but then you can like, you know, he's the dad in Inside Out.

1147
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:47,480
And that's, there's no malice or weird.

1148
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:49,480
Actually, I think that that might be right.

1149
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:54,480
He's got like a, you know, a clean, trustworthy face.

1150
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:57,480
Uh, and I, yeah, he can be a dad in a Disney TV movie.

1151
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:58,480
That's not a bad idea at all.

1152
01:08:58,480 --> 01:08:59,480
That's not bad.

1153
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:00,480
Yeah.

1154
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:02,480
But then he would just be, there'd be something odd about it.

1155
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:05,480
More so just Gutenberg is just too, too vanilla.

1156
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:09,480
Yeah, I think, yeah, I think that's, I get why they were like, he's a friendly family,

1157
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:11,480
friendly guy, but yeah, for this movie.

1158
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:14,480
But you know who had it out for him at ABC?

1159
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:16,480
Bobby Iger.

1160
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:17,480
For Gutenberg?

1161
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:19,480
No, for McLaughlin.

1162
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:21,480
Iger canceled Twin Peaks.

1163
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:22,480
Oh.

1164
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:25,480
So you think he, you think based on that, that he was, he specifically had about the ass?

1165
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:28,480
He was in that weird thing.

1166
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:33,480
No, no, no, not on my, yeah, maybe they, well, Iger was there.

1167
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:34,480
Yeah, maybe they had him.

1168
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:37,480
Maybe he was, they were about to shoot and he said, pull him.

1169
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:39,480
I'll call Gutenberg.

1170
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:40,480
I know him.

1171
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:42,480
I have one last suggestion for this.

1172
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:44,480
Eisner plays the dad.

1173
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:47,480
It was right there.

1174
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:48,480
It was there the whole time.

1175
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:50,480
He'd be, he'd be a little odd.

1176
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:51,480
Hello, I'm Buzzy Crocker.

1177
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:52,480
My name's Buzzy Crocker.

1178
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:54,480
I work for the Inquisitor.

1179
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:56,480
You may know me from my article about Wolf Boy.

1180
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:59,480
Now I'm here to investigate the matter of a different kind.

1181
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:00,480
Go.

1182
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:01,480
Take some photos of my niece.

1183
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:04,480
For the periodical I work for.

1184
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:06,480
Don't cut her head off.

1185
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:07,480
Oh my God.

1186
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:08,480
You're a bunch of ghosts.

1187
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:09,480
Ghosts are real.

1188
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:14,480
You know, again, again, you know, I come back to like, if he was the golfer, how brief is that?

1189
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:15,480
What does that give us?

1190
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:16,480
What does that actually do for us?

1191
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:24,480
But as opposed to imagining if he is the star, if he had to take six weeks to play a character named Buzzy.

1192
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:28,480
All right, when's lunch?

1193
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:30,480
I have to do all of my CEO work.

1194
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:31,480
Did he?

1195
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:33,480
We're losing light.

1196
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:34,480
We're going to do half an hour.

1197
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:35,480
Okay, that'll be half an hour.

1198
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:36,480
Shit, shit, shit.

1199
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:37,480
Okay.

1200
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:38,480
And I don't remember my lines.

1201
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:39,480
Where are my lines with?

1202
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:41,480
What do I say to Sally in the next scene?

1203
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:42,480
I swear.

1204
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:43,480
Give me an earpiece.

1205
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:45,480
Or no, he does the Godfather Marlon Brando.

1206
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:49,480
We're like, write the lines on a PA shirt and I'll read them off of that.

1207
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:51,480
Put them on a billboard outside the window.

1208
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:53,480
I'll just, I'll do it one take.

1209
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:57,480
Did he, do you think Michael Eisner, he started, I think he felt like he was the star.

1210
01:10:57,480 --> 01:11:07,480
I think he felt like he had to do, and maybe this isn't in one of his books, he felt like he had to do those intros to give it a Disney of another face, a warm face, friendly guy, like Walt did.

1211
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:12,480
But then at a certain point, did he regret that choice and then just felt like he had to keep doing these intros?

1212
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:14,480
Because it seems like he was cranky when he was doing them.

1213
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:19,480
So it wasn't, I think he liked it on some level, but I wonder if he regretted the precedent.

1214
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:21,480
Just in terms of like how many they're going to need.

1215
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:22,480
Because that's what you're saying.

1216
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:25,480
There's so many, more than I even imagined.

1217
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:29,480
And what's the minimum time this could all take, you know?

1218
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:30,480
One hour?

1219
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:31,480
Yeah, I'd say so.

1220
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:37,480
If they're like lit, ready to go, then maybe they could do it pretty fast.

1221
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:38,480
Right.

1222
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:44,480
But, you know, some of them are in weird, some of them he has to be in Florida for or somewhere weird.

1223
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:47,480
They had to build a little set and light it.

1224
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:51,480
You know, there was a little lighting gag to make it look like he was on the elevator.

1225
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:53,480
Right. And Iger abandons this immediately.

1226
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:55,480
Like he doesn't, he never did one of these.

1227
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:56,480
No.

1228
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:57,480
As far as I know.

1229
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:58,480
No.

1230
01:11:58,480 --> 01:11:59,480
It's why we should have known back then.

1231
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:00,480
Unwillingness to host.

1232
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:01,480
We should have known.

1233
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:02,480
Don't trust this guy.

1234
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:05,480
That has to be number one if you're the Disney CEO.

1235
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:06,480
Yeah, it's got to be you.

1236
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:11,480
And if Tim Cook buys Disney, he's going to have to do these intros again.

1237
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:13,480
That's the only way I will accept it.

1238
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:15,480
The only way he regains our trust.

1239
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:20,480
You know, I don't know if I can see myself buying another of his products unless he hosts the show.

1240
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:24,480
Or unless my current ones break and then I have to and will buy the products.

1241
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:25,480
Well, that's a good point.

1242
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:29,480
Due to their wretched monthly warranties.

1243
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:30,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1244
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:31,480
Constantly.

1245
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,480
Due to them wearing down very readily.

1246
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:34,480
Okay.

1247
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,480
I mean, really, we should have just amended this.

1248
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:43,480
We should also have taken matters into our hands and just added, you know, listeners suggested Tower of Terror, the movie with Steve Guttenberg, we should have just added intro.

1249
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:44,480
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1250
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:45,480
We've only done that.

1251
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:46,480
Yes.

1252
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:47,480
But whatever.

1253
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:51,480
We're fitting that within this broader episode.

1254
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:53,480
Ghosts are sitting around.

1255
01:12:53,480 --> 01:13:00,480
We soon realize that Abigail, the old lady who gave Buzzy the tip, is Sally Shine's sister.

1256
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:05,480
And we realize that she's been in a sanitarium for a long time.

1257
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:16,480
A real movie sanitarium where you're going across the lawn and there's like 10 people of various Ilks all speaking to unseen people or doing somersaults.

1258
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:18,480
Or walking upside down.

1259
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:20,480
Yeah, not how you would portray it.

1260
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,480
You would not portray it like this these days.

1261
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:23,480
I think.

1262
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:24,480
At least they get the lawn.

1263
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:25,480
The lawn's nice.

1264
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:26,480
The lawn is nice.

1265
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:27,480
The grass is nice.

1266
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:33,480
And the actual reporter does some actual investigation.

1267
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:38,480
Yeah, Neopiepels comes through and does what Buzzy cannot do.

1268
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:49,480
And finds in the lid of a steamer trunk a bunch of scrawled on Sally Shine like headshots and a doll with a head ripped off.

1269
01:13:49,480 --> 01:14:02,480
My favorite way to quickly communicate that she's mad at Sally Shine was like a black and white photo with the word bad scrawled on it in like jagged red lettering.

1270
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:07,480
She makes me frown.

1271
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:09,480
Yeah, it's very broad strokes.

1272
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:11,480
But at the same time, I didn't see it at the time.

1273
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:15,480
I didn't know in the moment it was going to be her.

1274
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:17,480
And the nanny is so loving.

1275
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:18,480
She would never.

1276
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:22,480
The ghosts are, there's no divisions between the ghosts.

1277
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:24,480
The ghosts all love each other.

1278
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:27,480
Honestly, their limbo hell doesn't seem that bad.

1279
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:28,480
You got a hotel to wander around.

1280
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:33,480
Like we were saying earlier, like it's, you know, old creepy records to play.

1281
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:34,480
They're all buddies.

1282
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:38,480
Aside from Dewey not getting to see his family.

1283
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:39,480
I missed this fact also.

1284
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:48,480
This is a bizarre tiny Wikipedia fact that Dewey Todd appears in other media also made by director DJ McKay.

1285
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:49,480
Right.

1286
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:57,480
Because DJ McKay wrote a book or a book series with many young adult book series with many entries called the Pendragon series.

1287
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:58,480
Yes.

1288
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:00,480
And Dewey Todd appears in The Neverwar.

1289
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:07,480
So for those of you out there who are craving more Dewey Todd from this film, check out The Neverwar.

1290
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:08,480
OK.

1291
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:11,480
If you're Dewey Todd, fix doesn't require seeing him.

1292
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:14,480
If you're just reading about him in his essence, does it?

1293
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:21,480
For November Club 3, if you want Jason to read The Neverwar and report back to us, please vote for it.

1294
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:25,480
Jason, Jason, the reader is always open to reading whatever long story.

1295
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:27,480
No, I'm a slow reader.

1296
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:32,480
Make sure you specify it's Jason only reading it and he's giving us a book report.

1297
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:36,480
Jason reads The Neverwar while Mike and Scott proceed with their lives.

1298
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:37,480
Uh-huh.

1299
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:38,480
Viable option.

1300
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:42,480
So I'm not saying it's happening, it's just if the listeners want it.

1301
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:43,480
They have to pick it, yeah.

1302
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:45,480
They have to pick The Neverwar for Jason.

1303
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:46,480
Oh no.

1304
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:51,480
You're allowed to throw an idea just for me.

1305
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:56,480
Jason's making a big scared face just like Steve Gutenberg's not doing.

1306
01:15:56,480 --> 01:16:01,480
If you can pitch something that I forced for just me to do, then you can do it right now.

1307
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:02,480
The forum is yours.

1308
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:07,480
I mean, let's sit here for a while and think about it.

1309
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:11,480
You have to read one of those.

1310
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:15,480
Did you have like the stories of love?

1311
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:19,480
You had one of those Barnes and Noble, like all the Lovecraft stories.

1312
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:21,480
H.P. Lovecraft, yeah, yeah.

1313
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:24,480
You had to read that cover to cover.

1314
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:27,480
Which we need to, so we got to pick one of those.

1315
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:32,480
So it's either you want Jason War, The Neverwar, or I have to read H.P. Lovecraft.

1316
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:35,480
Thousands of pages of the driest, slowest.

1317
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:40,480
I suppose you punished me more there, but to me The Neverwar by the Are You Afraid.

1318
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:42,480
Well, it's still, look, it's their poll.

1319
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:45,480
So I guess they can do it if they want.

1320
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:52,480
If they want to hear, then we'll have to be a six and a half hour episode in which we mostly don't participate.

1321
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:53,480
Right.

1322
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:57,480
We just sit here and drift in and out of sleep while Mike reads a Lovecraft synopsis.

1323
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:04,480
I just list to you the longitude and latitude of where the characters were at in the Mountains of Madness or whatever.

1324
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:05,480
Oh, yeah.

1325
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:08,480
Which is what is by far most of it.

1326
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:09,480
The agonies.

1327
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:14,480
Explaining exactly where they were in this fake scenario, in this made up scenario.

1328
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:22,480
The ghosts all, by the way, the ghosts in order to free their spirits, they need to get to the party.

1329
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:24,480
They never got to go to the party.

1330
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:29,480
So they tell us that that only by going to the party do we set our spirits free.

1331
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:32,480
We've tried the stairs, but we can't get past 11.

1332
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:35,480
So they need to make it to the Tip Top Club.

1333
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:36,480
The Tip Top Club.

1334
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:38,480
The party is heaven.

1335
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,480
Yeah, I guess so.

1336
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:42,480
The party in this is heaven.

1337
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:43,480
Yeah.

1338
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:45,480
And dying in an elevator is hell.

1339
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:46,480
Exactly.

1340
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:48,480
So the party seems fun.

1341
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:54,480
And I guess this is maybe to me proving the existence of the Christianity in general.

1342
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:58,480
So you didn't believe in Christian God until watching Tower of Terror, the movie.

1343
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:00,480
And now it makes sense to me.

1344
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:02,480
I didn't understand heaven until it was a 40s party.

1345
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:04,480
Well, then another good assignment.

1346
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:06,480
Mike reads the Bible.

1347
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:08,480
All of it?

1348
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:09,480
Which one?

1349
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:10,480
Oh, no.

1350
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:11,480
Okay.

1351
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:17,480
So we'll record that.

1352
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:20,480
There just won't be any Club 3s for the next 14 months.

1353
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:22,480
You've got to wait for that one.

1354
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:27,480
Something maybe to get us off of seeing the plot, which, boy, am I tired of doing.

1355
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:29,480
We haven't talked about this.

1356
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:39,480
When it cuts to the tower, to the tower itself, we see some shots that are clearly of the ride.

1357
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:44,480
It can only be the ride in Florida was the only one that existed at that time.

1358
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:49,480
I don't believe anything else in the movie is filmed in the ride.

1359
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:52,480
I saw something that said there was some lobby shots.

1360
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:53,480
Maybe.

1361
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:56,480
But even that, wouldn't you?

1362
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:58,480
I'm just thinking of claustrophobia.

1363
01:18:58,480 --> 01:18:59,480
It's small, yes.

1364
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:07,480
And I think maybe you're better off just like, you can make a new set where then you've got room to light it.

1365
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:10,480
I mean, certainly all the grounds of the hotel.

1366
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:16,480
And also, if you're going and filming in the lobby, now we're bringing at least to at least Gutenberg Dunst.

1367
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:18,480
And maybe we're having to bring ghosts.

1368
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:30,480
Now we're finding all these actors for a whole Florida shoot as opposed to, my guess, what they did is get one camera guy, perhaps already on the property, perhaps a cameraman for the Mickey Mouse Club or whatever.

1369
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:34,480
Can you just go film 10 shots of the Tower of Dare?

1370
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:38,480
Do one that tilts over and do some nights.

1371
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:39,480
Yeah, you know what?

1372
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:40,480
We're going to need some night ones.

1373
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:43,480
So 10 shots, please send them to us.

1374
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:45,480
And that is all of our Florida shoots.

1375
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:49,480
Yeah, I mean, maybe it's just like strategic shots of the lobby somehow.

1376
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:50,480
I don't know.

1377
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:51,480
Maybe this is also wrong.

1378
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:52,480
It could be like establishing.

1379
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:55,480
I just don't think they brought those actors to Florida.

1380
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:57,480
That would have cost them money.

1381
01:19:57,480 --> 01:20:00,480
That would have cost them to end up in park tickets.

1382
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:06,480
I saw really tight shots in front of the gates with a car.

1383
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:13,480
And I was like, did they build the gate and they can't make this shot any wider?

1384
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:15,480
I think you also see it's a back lot.

1385
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:17,480
You never tilt up.

1386
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:20,480
It's all. Everything is framed for a movie about a tower.

1387
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:25,480
Boy, do we not see much of that tower unless the tower doesn't have the actors in the shot.

1388
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:27,480
Yes, I think everything is oddly.

1389
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:28,480
Everything's clipped.

1390
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:29,480
Uh huh.

1391
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:30,480
Yeah, yeah.

1392
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:31,480
That's a lot.

1393
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:33,480
You know, it's how I can only imagine how low the budget of this was.

1394
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:34,480
That's how you do it.

1395
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:36,480
And I like that they use the real tower.

1396
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:41,480
They didn't do some CGI crap and make, you know, you got to give this movie this.

1397
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:45,480
It looks like the ride because they pointed a camera at the ride.

1398
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:49,480
This has been a big issue with a bunch of other ride movies.

1399
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:50,480
Just make it look like the ride.

1400
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:51,480
What are you doing?

1401
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:56,480
Yes. So that they actually did that, which is usually not happening in this.

1402
01:20:56,480 --> 01:21:01,480
Uh, sadly, I don't know why I had to look it up just now, but I really wish they had just shot it all there.

1403
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:07,480
And it was in 1999 because then they could have gone next door to the rock and roller coaster.

1404
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:08,480
Or at least sort of it's been a big guitar.

1405
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:10,480
You could have dressed up to look like something else.

1406
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:15,480
You'd be like, well, the guitar store is next door or something like you could have explained it away for some reason.

1407
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:19,480
This is like, I mean, I'm almost like I feel like I got my eyes out the door.

1408
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:22,480
I'd like to just end talking about this for as long as we want.

1409
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:25,480
It begs the question. Rock and roller coaster, the movie.

1410
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:26,480
Yeah, of course.

1411
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:31,480
So that I guess it just has to still it's still Therosmith and they're they're acting.

1412
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:37,480
Getting to see made in the 90s, every step of that getting to see like arriving at the session,

1413
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:41,480
maybe the moment where they all hired Ileana Douglas.

1414
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:44,480
We feel good about this. Just don't cramp our rock and roll lifestyle.

1415
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:52,480
As soon as this becomes us having to go, go to this appointment, that meeting, then that then then that's not rock and roll, baby.

1416
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:56,480
Wow. Yes.

1417
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,480
So I want to know how they met.

1418
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:03,480
I think that, yeah, I think you have to probably combine it has to maybe be an Aerosmith origin story in some ways, too.

1419
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:05,480
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1420
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:09,480
Because the recording Walk This Way in the session, which doesn't make any sense.

1421
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:10,480
Yeah. Yeah.

1422
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:16,480
Because it's the open in 1999 and it's not a new version of what they have rerecorded Walk This Way.

1423
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:20,480
Walk This Way, Aerosmith version.

1424
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:21,480
Yes.

1425
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:22,480
Steven's version.

1426
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:23,480
Steven's version.

1427
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:27,480
A young Scooter Braun stole the copy to the original.

1428
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:34,480
Well, if you go a step further from the rock and roller coaster, you get to the Fairfax market with the big hot dogs.

1429
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:36,480
So this is really talk about that movie, too.

1430
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:38,480
Yeah, that potential movie.

1431
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:40,480
Jason is Jason is vetoed Rock and Roller Coaster.

1432
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:41,480
He wants big hot dog.

1433
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:43,480
The big hot dogs for years.

1434
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:45,480
They've had big hot dogs there.

1435
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:47,480
Do they still have them?

1436
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:48,480
Yeah.

1437
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:50,480
OK. Well, hopefully that won't go away either.

1438
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:52,480
Well, we don't know Rock and Roller Coaster still around.

1439
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:53,480
Yeah.

1440
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:54,480
Sure.

1441
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,480
No talk yet of it going away.

1442
01:22:56,480 --> 01:23:05,480
Sorry. The other moment, I think you want to see like the first gig and where like nobody's there, but there's one guy nodding along.

1443
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:06,480
Right.

1444
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:10,480
And like he really keeps their spirits alive and he comes up and meets them after.

1445
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:15,480
And, you know, I just want you to know that concert meant the world to me and just whatever.

1446
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:26,480
You know, if you're doubting that you made a connection here, you really just consider me your fan so that that becomes the origin of you know how we feel about our fans.

1447
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:27,480
Oh, good.

1448
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:30,480
That's really where that feel like.

1449
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:35,480
Then he walks away and then Stevens, you know, Joe, that guy gave me a really good feeling.

1450
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:39,480
I guess you could say I have a good feeling about our fans.

1451
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:42,480
Wow. That's perfect because that's a great Han Solo moment.

1452
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:44,480
Yeah, yes.

1453
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:45,480
Uh huh.

1454
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:46,480
This is what Iger likes.

1455
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:47,480
So he's going to want to.

1456
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:49,480
Yeah, let's put that together too.

1457
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:54,480
How about the scene where Stephen walks this way?

1458
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:56,480
The first time he walks this way.

1459
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:58,480
And then they think, oh, Eureka.

1460
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:00,480
They say Eureka.

1461
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:02,480
And they say Eureka a lot during the movie.

1462
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:12,480
Well, and they can have a little interlude in this movie with the next door neighbor for Rockin' Rollercoaster, Lightning McQueen's Racing Academy.

1463
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:14,480
Well, we're jumping arrows here.

1464
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:16,480
I know, but it's.

1465
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:18,480
We're talking and you're over there looking something up.

1466
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:20,480
What's it going to be?

1467
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:27,480
I was confirming that the name in my head, Lightning McQueen's Racing Academy, a place I've never been to.

1468
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:28,480
Did you just say Lightning McQueen?

1469
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:32,480
Lightning McQueen, which would be a good name for like a treat or the porn parody.

1470
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:35,480
Or when he comes.

1471
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:39,480
Ka-chow. Ka-chow. Ka-chow. Ka-chow.

1472
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:41,480
You can get that in Fairfax Market too.

1473
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:43,480
There's lots of different little stands.

1474
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:45,480
Lightning McQueen donut.

1475
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:47,480
Yeah.

1476
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:49,480
Yeah, so yeah, that would.

1477
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:52,480
I think that would have been a more exciting movie to talk about.

1478
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:55,480
Did you see Stephen Taylor broke his larynx?

1479
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:58,480
His vocal cords are gnarled.

1480
01:24:58,480 --> 01:24:59,480
You can break a larynx?

1481
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:02,480
He's twisted and bleeding and then it was revealed he broke his larynx.

1482
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:05,480
So now he's like as month, the tour has to be like postponed.

1483
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:07,480
It's never going to happen for him.

1484
01:25:07,480 --> 01:25:09,480
I guess it's never going to happen.

1485
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:10,480
So.

1486
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:13,480
And along with this, his character is being assailed.

1487
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:16,480
Well, that's another story.

1488
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:20,480
This, I refuse to look at this man and think that he ever did anything wrong.

1489
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:25,480
Stephen Tyler did something wrong, illegal, unethical.

1490
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:29,480
One of our great song smiths about underage sex.

1491
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:31,480
Yes, that's right.

1492
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:33,480
Stephen Tyler, a great man.

1493
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:34,480
A good man.

1494
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:36,480
Let's all be on the record as much as possible.

1495
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:38,480
What are we, what are we, oh.

1496
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:43,480
I mean like, alright, the old lady did, the old lady starts like doing a hex.

1497
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:45,480
Yeah, they all.

1498
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:48,480
I like this because we've been walking through empty courtyards a lot.

1499
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:53,480
And now like, oh, now we're surrounded by candles and old lady's a witch and she's casting a spell.

1500
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:54,480
Here we go.

1501
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:55,480
We're doing okay here.

1502
01:25:55,480 --> 01:26:07,480
There's not a lot of speediness in like once they figure it out, they just kind of go about their business and they just let her like get all set up and go about her business.

1503
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:08,480
Yeah, it's.

1504
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:15,480
Because Buzzy, the real reporter is X is like, come on, Buzzy, we got to write this story.

1505
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:16,480
And that.

1506
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:17,480
Right.

1507
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:18,480
Side track.

1508
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:20,480
Everything gets, you know, delayed.

1509
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:22,480
They, you know, you got to go deal with the real ghost stuff.

1510
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:29,480
The actual story of the Tower of Terror doesn't quite make sense as a Twilight Zone morality play.

1511
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:30,480
Yes.

1512
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:36,480
But it is in the vein of like, well, the universe is doing this to these people because of some reason.

1513
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:42,480
That's sort of, that's the Twilight Zone generally is like the universe is punishing some somebody for something.

1514
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:43,480
Like a way that they are.

1515
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:44,480
Yeah.

1516
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:49,480
But in this case, it's like a little girl and a nanny who we've now learned is nice.

1517
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:55,480
Right. So they have to make up the actual, I guess, more practical reasons why this has happened.

1518
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:56,480
And it's a witch.

1519
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:57,480
It's a witch.

1520
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:59,480
Well, I guess it was a witch again.

1521
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:02,480
Like per usual here on the Twilight Zone.

1522
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:08,480
The true twist is that Sally Shine's sister did all the black magic.

1523
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:11,480
Abigail did all the black magic.

1524
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:18,480
But in a twist of fate, the party everyone was going to was a surprise party for her.

1525
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:19,480
Yes.

1526
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:29,480
Well, that's somehow 300 Hollywood stars and band members were all gathered for a party for the Tip Top Club for another little girl.

1527
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:36,480
Yeah. The Tip Top Club was apparently a Chuck E. Cheese of its day for kids parties.

1528
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:42,480
They made the best martinis and adrenochrome shakes around.

1529
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:51,480
I was going to say on that note, it was getting to a point in this movie where I realized that a bunch of bad shit is going down.

1530
01:27:51,480 --> 01:28:00,480
Basically, what we've here's what's been uncovered in this movie that a Hollywood tower is a secret hub of satanic rituals and child abuse.

1531
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:01,480
Yeah.

1532
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:04,480
And only one man can stop it and his name is Q.

1533
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:08,480
Very good point.

1534
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:16,480
This whole like I don't know why QAnon has taken all its cues from what's that movie White Squall?

1535
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:22,480
That's where the phrase comes from. That has nothing to do where they say this phrase that in the trailer it's not even in the movie.

1536
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:23,480
Right.

1537
01:28:23,480 --> 01:28:29,480
So I think that it was all actually everything they need to know is has been in Tower of Terror 97 the whole time.

1538
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:30,480
Right.

1539
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:39,480
QAnon should adopt the new they should adopt the tagline of the movie, which is hotel guests check in but they don't check out.

1540
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:42,480
That should be on signs of Trump rallies from now on.

1541
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:43,480
A little more.

1542
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:46,480
HGCI, BTD, CAO.

1543
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:47,480
Okay.

1544
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:53,480
A little more cumbersome than next time take the stairs.

1545
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:54,480
You know for simplicity.

1546
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:55,480
Yeah.

1547
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:56,480
Yeah.

1548
01:28:56,480 --> 01:29:09,480
That is some well next time take the stairs could apply to like you know if you can't find if you go to a pizza restaurant you can't find an underground sex cabal in the basement maybe you didn't look hard enough for the stairs.

1549
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:10,480
Next time take the stairs.

1550
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:11,480
Next time take the stairs.

1551
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:12,480
Yeah.

1552
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:13,480
You'll find Tom Hanks and Oprah in there.

1553
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:20,480
You'll find all everybody Kristen Dunst made movies with in the 90s all together getting Adrena Chromat at kids.

1554
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:21,480
Yeah.

1555
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:23,480
Yeah.

1556
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:29,480
Luckily this is behind the paywall or if it was main feed I think it would actually this would trickle down.

1557
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:32,480
To the real trickle over to the real QB poll.

1558
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:33,480
Like they'd hear this.

1559
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:34,480
Yeah.

1560
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:36,480
This is new podcast I've been checking out and they're really on the level.

1561
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:38,480
Although maybe that's a good idea.

1562
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:43,480
First of all they defended Steven Tyler and then secondly.

1563
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:44,480
Yeah.

1564
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:45,480
I'm really on board with everything they're saying.

1565
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:46,480
Yeah.

1566
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:48,480
I.

1567
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:49,480
OK.

1568
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:50,480
So anyway I don't know.

1569
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:59,480
So there's a satanic spell and then the only as we're getting towards the end I'm like the only thing they're like it's this kept for a movie called Tower of Terror.

1570
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:07,480
It's a little dopey and there's not a lot of action in it but then right towards the end they get in like the two cars are stuck up there and you got to hear it hang on.

1571
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:09,480
You got to cross from ear to ear.

1572
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:10,480
Trust me.

1573
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:13,480
And you do get some like scary elevators.

1574
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:15,480
So they fit it in budgetarily.

1575
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:22,480
They did it and this stuff is all this is not an unacceptable run as the climax of Tower of Terror the movie.

1576
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:23,480
Yeah.

1577
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:28,480
And they do start the service elevator like in the ride comes into play a bunch.

1578
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,480
They do say service elevator.

1579
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:31,480
Yes.

1580
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:33,480
So that was a good call back.

1581
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:36,480
Well I mean that actually.

1582
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:37,480
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

1583
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:40,480
So yeah you get that you get a little.

1584
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:52,480
Yeah you that that is your I'm trying to think like what what before it's seeing this what would I want from a Tower of Terror movie and it would be like a lot of elevator play.

1585
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:56,480
Love in an elevator.

1586
01:30:56,480 --> 01:31:00,480
What if you just moved Aerosmith to Tower of Terror and called it love in an elevator.

1587
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:01,480
Like if they're wanting to kick them out.

1588
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:02,480
Yeah yeah yeah.

1589
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:04,480
So rock and roller coaster be themes.

1590
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:06,480
But you move Aerosmith to Tower of Terror.

1591
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:08,480
I think this would be so well received.

1592
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:11,480
I think I think Disney fans worldwide would cheer.

1593
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:18,480
Finally our hated Twilight Zone property is out of there and more more there's more Aerosmith.

1594
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:19,480
What if they deserve.

1595
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:27,480
What if it's just everything is the same as Guardians except it's the Aerosmith in those cages and the start on the video screen.

1596
01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:31,480
Well then you'd be more invested because you don't want Aerosmith to be locked up forever.

1597
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:34,480
No they are the people of crime.

1598
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:36,480
What what have these men done.

1599
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:41,480
But he was without sin cast the first stone.

1600
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:43,480
Oh Tannaly or Tavon.

1601
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:46,480
It's also Tannaly or Tavon collecting Aerosmith as well.

1602
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:47,480
Last I find.

1603
01:31:47,480 --> 01:31:50,480
And Rock and Raccoon is breaking them up.

1604
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:54,480
I gotta break the bad boys of Boston out of these cages.

1605
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:57,480
Come on.

1606
01:31:57,480 --> 01:31:58,480
So yeah.

1607
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:03,480
They're gonna miss a record and say they're gonna miss their concert across town unless we just make it all one ride is what you're saying.

1608
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:04,480
One ride is what you should.

1609
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:05,480
Then you get to the.

1610
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:07,480
OK we're out of the gantry lift.

1611
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:11,480
Now hurry now get in a limo go.

1612
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:13,480
I'm their new manager.

1613
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:14,480
They fired Ileana Douglas.

1614
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:15,480
Now it's me.

1615
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:16,480
Rock it.

1616
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:22,480
They're making an appearance on one of Lady Gaga's jazz standards records.

1617
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:26,480
Steven's got a solo recording for his new country music career.

1618
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:27,480
Oh God.

1619
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:29,480
He's feuding with Joe again.

1620
01:32:29,480 --> 01:32:34,480
And he's releasing the album Red White and You.

1621
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:35,480
Not a joke.

1622
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:36,480
That's all right.

1623
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:37,480
So that's right.

1624
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:38,480
So now you.

1625
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:39,480
I mean we didn't need to tell you that.

1626
01:32:39,480 --> 01:32:41,480
Tourists in the line you knew about Red White and you.

1627
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:46,480
We just want to remind you know in case anybody was.

1628
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:52,480
The sexy robot from Just Push Play the cover of Just Push Play also will be featured on this ride.

1629
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:55,480
We all know her.

1630
01:32:55,480 --> 01:32:56,480
Well we gotta learn her name.

1631
01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:57,480
Yeah.

1632
01:32:57,480 --> 01:32:58,480
I wonder if she has a name.

1633
01:32:58,480 --> 01:32:59,480
That's a good question.

1634
01:32:59,480 --> 01:33:02,480
We'll find that out before we put the proposal together for this.

1635
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:03,480
We have to.

1636
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:04,480
We're hurt.

1637
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:09,480
We must find it out before the world's last Aerosmith fan who isn't you dies.

1638
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:12,480
Clock is ticking.

1639
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:14,480
Well look I think we're pretty much there.

1640
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:19,480
The power of forgiveness slows down the elevator and the ghosts are.

1641
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:23,480
The ghosts all get to come down the elevator and then immediately go back up the elevator.

1642
01:33:23,480 --> 01:33:24,480
Yes.

1643
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:26,480
To heaven which is the tip top club.

1644
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:32,480
They get to all it took was a jazz concert and then they all disappear.

1645
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:35,480
Disappear with their loved ones.

1646
01:33:35,480 --> 01:33:41,480
Also all the humans do take the stairs but no one is winded.

1647
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:42,480
They walked out.

1648
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:44,480
The most believable part for you.

1649
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:48,480
Yeah.

1650
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:50,480
You wanted a five minute scene of everybody catching their breath.

1651
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:51,480
Yeah yeah.

1652
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:53,480
Ah shit.

1653
01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:54,480
God.

1654
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:56,480
Should have just done the elevator again.

1655
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:57,480
Geez.

1656
01:33:57,480 --> 01:34:00,480
Just full five minute shot of huffing and puffing.

1657
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:01,480
Yeah.

1658
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:02,480
Is there even water?

1659
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:04,480
I just need some water real quick.

1660
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:05,480
Oh God.

1661
01:34:05,480 --> 01:34:07,480
Yeah that would have been more realistic.

1662
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:08,480
They wanted the night.

1663
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:10,480
This movie is like a tight 90ish minutes.

1664
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:11,480
So maybe that was cut.

1665
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:14,480
I got to say one of my favorite parts about it.

1666
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:16,480
I was so happy when I saw 90 minutes.

1667
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:17,480
I said yes.

1668
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:18,480
90 minutes.

1669
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:20,480
90 minutes for this thing.

1670
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:23,480
Now assuredly any Tower of Terror.

1671
01:34:23,480 --> 01:34:26,480
The rule of movies now is movies are long.

1672
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:27,480
Always.

1673
01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:28,480
That is the rule.

1674
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:33,480
So we can assume that Tower of Terror with Scarlett Johansson if made will be.

1675
01:34:33,480 --> 01:34:34,480
220?

1676
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:35,480
Yeah probably.

1677
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:36,480
I think so.

1678
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:37,480
But how else are you going to.

1679
01:34:37,480 --> 01:34:39,480
You can't get it done today.

1680
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:42,480
And the fools in 97 somehow wrapped it up quick.

1681
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:44,480
But you got to jam a lot in.

1682
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:48,480
And especially if that film as we're pitching includes Sarah Smith.

1683
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:50,480
Sarah Smith includes.

1684
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:51,480
I mean I think it's maybe.

1685
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:53,480
My thought.

1686
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:57,480
What I want out of that movie is that you explore the full Towerverse.

1687
01:34:57,480 --> 01:35:00,480
Because all the towers go to different Limbo's.

1688
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:01,480
They're all across the world.

1689
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:02,480
So why not get Rocket in there.

1690
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:05,480
Why not get Harrison Hightower in there.

1691
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:06,480
Of course.

1692
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:08,480
Yes they can all meet in elevator.

1693
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:10,480
They all like wander the globe in elevator Limbo.

1694
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:12,480
And assume that there's no one else in it.

1695
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:13,480
Right.

1696
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:14,480
Until they meet.

1697
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:15,480
There's only.

1698
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:16,480
There's what.

1699
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:17,480
What's the amount of.

1700
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:18,480
Six people.

1701
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:20,480
Ghosts in elevator Limbo.

1702
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:23,480
And then Guardians of the Galaxy who are not ghosts.

1703
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:25,480
But they're in a they're in real world Limbo.

1704
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:26,480
Right.

1705
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:27,480
Yes.

1706
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:28,480
That makes sense.

1707
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:29,480
So let's get them all again.

1708
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:31,480
All the elevator the full universe of elevator.

1709
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:34,480
Well Tyka I'm sure he's hard at work on his typewriter now.

1710
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:37,480
Typing away for the script for Tower of Terror.

1711
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:39,480
When this guy comes.

1712
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:42,480
When he sits down he buckles down.

1713
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:43,480
Full attention.

1714
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:44,480
Here we go Tyka.

1715
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:45,480
Bring the magic.

1716
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:47,480
Because you got to get it on the page.

1717
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:50,480
Because you can't just get to the set and make it all up as you go.

1718
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:52,480
You're not going to find it on the set.

1719
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:53,480
You need to have this all worked out.

1720
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:55,480
You can't just rely on.

1721
01:35:55,480 --> 01:35:56,480
Improv.

1722
01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:57,480
Make a mubs.

1723
01:35:57,480 --> 01:36:00,480
First thing back when the new writers contract.

1724
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:03,480
You know Seth Meyers came back pretty quick.

1725
01:36:03,480 --> 01:36:06,480
Tyka booted up final draft.

1726
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:08,480
To do that Tower of Terror script.

1727
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:11,480
Back to the page thing that he reveres.

1728
01:36:11,480 --> 01:36:12,480
That he cares about.

1729
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:15,480
Well you know it's the most.

1730
01:36:15,480 --> 01:36:17,480
Some people find the blank page terrifying.

1731
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:19,480
But it's also very optimistic.

1732
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:22,480
It's a world of possibility.

1733
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:24,480
Who's this character?

1734
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:25,480
Who's this guy?

1735
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:27,480
Willy Wonka of screenwriting.

1736
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:29,480
Another property that Tyka has.

1737
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:30,480
True.

1738
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:31,480
He does. He does.

1739
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:33,480
That is a real thing I think.

1740
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:35,480
But he's not doing the new.

1741
01:36:35,480 --> 01:36:37,480
No because the Paddington guy is doing the new.

1742
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:38,480
Wonka.

1743
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:40,480
No it's an entire other.

1744
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:41,480
It's a different Wonka?

1745
01:36:41,480 --> 01:36:42,480
I think so.

1746
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:43,480
Really?

1747
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:44,480
Another Wonka?

1748
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:45,480
What element of Wonka does Tyka have?

1749
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:47,480
Unless I was told this in a way.

1750
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:48,480
No no no.

1751
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:49,480
Here.

1752
01:36:49,480 --> 01:36:50,480
This was said years ago.

1753
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:51,480
Right before the pandemic.

1754
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:52,480
This news caused the pandemic.

1755
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:57,480
Tyka went to TV2 to reimagine Charlie and the Chocolate Factory for two Netflix original

1756
01:36:57,480 --> 01:36:58,480
series.

1757
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:00,480
So we're just going to want to start with two.

1758
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:03,480
Usually the way TV shows go is just do two at the same time.

1759
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:05,480
So that's going to be the best for you I think.

1760
01:37:05,480 --> 01:37:07,480
We don't want to make you wait.

1761
01:37:07,480 --> 01:37:08,480
So let's get up to.

1762
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:11,480
We'll do one is two seasons and one is three.

1763
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:12,480
We'll pre-renews those.

1764
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:13,480
So that's five.

1765
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:14,480
Get going.

1766
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:19,480
And I know you got to leave and get working on Tower of Terror and your Star Wars.

1767
01:37:19,480 --> 01:37:22,480
Probably a Jurassic World or two.

1768
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:23,480
But get those in.

1769
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:25,480
Get those drafts in when you can.

1770
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:30,480
I think that is the Roald Dahl estate has a Netflix deal.

1771
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:32,480
Yes I think that's right.

1772
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:34,480
Because of the Wes Anderson stuff?

1773
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:39,480
No I think they were just plumbing like going through the Roald Dahl books.

1774
01:37:39,480 --> 01:37:42,480
So is that separate than the Wonka like young Wonka movie that's coming out?

1775
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:43,480
I think so.

1776
01:37:43,480 --> 01:37:45,480
Yes because that's Warner Brothers.

1777
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:46,480
That's Warner Brothers.

1778
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:47,480
Okay.

1779
01:37:47,480 --> 01:37:53,480
So maybe there's competing Wonka properties now which is funny but also not that unsurprising

1780
01:37:53,480 --> 01:37:54,480
in this day and age.

1781
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:55,480
Yeah.

1782
01:37:55,480 --> 01:37:59,480
And also as we know Tyka has a first look deal with Everywhere.

1783
01:37:59,480 --> 01:38:01,480
So they actually can't.

1784
01:38:01,480 --> 01:38:06,480
I've tried I've pitched my own shows that are complete or like here's an idea that I

1785
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:09,480
had that I alone thought of and I want to do it.

1786
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:12,480
And what I've gotten from every network is can we give it to Tyka?

1787
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:14,480
Is that just a quick question?

1788
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:15,480
You mind if Tyka does it?

1789
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:16,480
Wasn't he?

1790
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:22,480
Did I send that there was a story and then I saw it was from like 2019 or very start

1791
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:27,480
of 2020 that he was going to do Flash Gordon at Disney?

1792
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:29,480
Yeah that sounds right.

1793
01:38:29,480 --> 01:38:34,480
I think that's another two million dollar check cashed and not.

1794
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:39,480
That was the only I tried to look into it more and it was just one deadline story.

1795
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:41,480
I think there was some talk of it.

1796
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:47,480
Tyka's process is going to he sits down his computer like we said he types into Google

1797
01:38:47,480 --> 01:38:53,480
movies he writes down 10 movies then he drives to movie studios and says the names of the

1798
01:38:53,480 --> 01:38:56,480
movies to the executives and they say here's two million dollars.

1799
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:57,480
It's a good one.

1800
01:38:57,480 --> 01:39:00,480
I mean look it's good work if you can get it.

1801
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:01,480
I would like to.

1802
01:39:01,480 --> 01:39:07,480
Just looking people dead in the eye and going three women and a baby.

1803
01:39:07,480 --> 01:39:08,480
All right.

1804
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:10,480
Can you validate my parking sir?

1805
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:14,480
Okay we'll get I'll get working on the check though validation and thank you.

1806
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:15,480
Please don't.

1807
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:18,480
No need to ever actually make it done.

1808
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:20,480
Well you survived.

1809
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:22,480
I guess the three.

1810
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:25,480
Three is a good one to be behind multiple paywalls I'd say.

1811
01:39:25,480 --> 01:39:26,480
Sure.

1812
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:28,480
Your bravery saved the haunt cast.

1813
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:31,480
Well done freedom frighters.

1814
01:39:31,480 --> 01:39:32,480
Oh good.

1815
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:33,480
Yeah.

1816
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:35,480
Nice of Halloween intimacy.

1817
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:43,480
But we now send you to come up with some regular November topics as we are off to do some

1818
01:39:43,480 --> 01:39:48,480
research about a few beloved wonderful classic Halloween costumes.

1819
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:50,480
I want to drop a quick bomb.

1820
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:53,480
I found the schedule for my high school band trip.

1821
01:39:53,480 --> 01:39:55,480
My mom found it not knowing.

1822
01:39:55,480 --> 01:39:58,480
Oh not knowing even about talking about that on the episode.

1823
01:39:58,480 --> 01:40:02,480
And I was like first of all I went right to the page of the Pleasure Island and I'll put we'll

1824
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:05,480
talk about this more later and I'll post some photos of it.

1825
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:06,480
I was like where is it.

1826
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:08,480
Where's the Pleasure Island Club because I didn't know.

1827
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:10,480
Remember I said I didn't know which one it was.

1828
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:14,480
It doesn't say it just says dance party at Pleasure Island in the morning.

1829
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:18,480
But here's the piece of information that I did not remember that I think is amazing.

1830
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:23,480
We marched in band in front of the Spectro Magic parade.

1831
01:40:23,480 --> 01:40:24,480
Wow.

1832
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:25,480
What.

1833
01:40:25,480 --> 01:40:26,480
You were an opening act.

1834
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:28,480
We opened for Spectro Magic at the Magic Kingdom.

1835
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:29,480
Wow.

1836
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:30,480
Oh boy.

1837
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:31,480
And I don't remember I didn't remember that detail.

1838
01:40:31,480 --> 01:40:36,480
So I just wanted everyone in the club three to know that I've opened for Spectro Magic.

1839
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:37,480
Damn.

1840
01:40:37,480 --> 01:40:40,480
Well that should be your new credit.

1841
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:43,480
If we're trying to like you know interest people in the show.

1842
01:40:43,480 --> 01:40:44,480
Right.

1843
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:45,480
What have the hosts done though.

1844
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:46,480
Why should I listen.

1845
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:47,480
And that's when I was like I'm going to be the opening act for Spectro Magic.

1846
01:40:47,480 --> 01:40:48,480
That's right.

1847
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:49,480
I will.

1848
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:50,480
I will list that.

1849
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:51,480
I will list that.

1850
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:52,480
In that stage.

1851
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:53,480
2002.

1852
01:40:53,480 --> 01:40:54,480
2002.

1853
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:56,480
The doll face Spectro Men.

1854
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:57,480
They were really nice.

1855
01:40:57,480 --> 01:40:58,480
Yeah.

1856
01:40:58,480 --> 01:40:59,480
We were actually really nice.

1857
01:40:59,480 --> 01:41:00,480
We were on the show on Tender Earth guys.

1858
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:01,480
Wow.

1859
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:02,480
And they said keep at it gang.

1860
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:03,480
Andatique.

1861
01:41:03,480 --> 01:41:06,480
And that meant a lot.

1862
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:08,480
You could be where we are someday.

1863
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:09,480
You'll have opening acts someday.

1864
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:12,480
You could have a doll face one day.
