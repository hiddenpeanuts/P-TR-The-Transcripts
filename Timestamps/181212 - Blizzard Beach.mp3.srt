1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,720
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,528 --> 00:00:28,508
This podcast, The Ride, the second gate hosted by two good boys and one sad boy.

3
00:00:29,188 --> 00:00:31,908
The sad boy, you ask, is me.

4
00:00:32,148 --> 00:00:33,968
And let me tell you guys why.

5
00:00:34,328 --> 00:00:37,728
I'll just unveil, me, Scott Gardner, joined by Mike Carlson, Jason Sheridan.

6
00:00:37,728 --> 00:00:38,768
Hi, Mike Carlson here.

7
00:00:39,008 --> 00:00:39,948
Yeah, I want to hear.

8
00:00:40,288 --> 00:00:42,348
This is hot off the presses.

9
00:00:43,488 --> 00:00:45,308
I haven't even texted about this.

10
00:00:45,748 --> 00:00:51,668
I'm beginning to book my vacation to Tokyo Disney in April and I'm very excited.

11
00:00:51,668 --> 00:00:54,608
And as it's coming together, I'm thrilled.

12
00:00:55,508 --> 00:01:00,508
But we're getting into the area that I've been fearing, which is starting to find out

13
00:01:00,508 --> 00:01:05,308
what rides are going to be refurbished in the time that I'm there.

14
00:01:05,328 --> 00:01:06,508
Oh my God, what is it?

15
00:01:06,828 --> 00:01:08,968
I'm kind of, my heart just like doubled in speed.

16
00:01:09,088 --> 00:01:09,908
You can see why.

17
00:01:10,268 --> 00:01:13,448
When I clicked on the link, it was one of these, it was like WDW Explorer.

18
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:18,268
So one of these Twitter's we follow is in Japan and they sent a link.

19
00:01:18,788 --> 00:01:23,408
And during the time that I'm there, I will not be able to go on Pooh's Hunt.

20
00:01:23,848 --> 00:01:24,628
Oh, no.

21
00:01:24,768 --> 00:01:25,988
I'm so upset.

22
00:01:26,948 --> 00:01:28,148
I actually was.

23
00:01:28,328 --> 00:01:30,448
Oh, my God. Yeah, yeah.

24
00:01:30,748 --> 00:01:35,428
Which OK, so we just we just recently released this episode about Tokyo

25
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:38,728
Disney with Lindsay, where I left halfway through.

26
00:01:39,448 --> 00:01:43,328
And so so it's been but but Erin, who's also going with me, didn't give a shit.

27
00:01:43,328 --> 00:01:44,208
She heard all the spoilers.

28
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:46,528
OK, yeah, sure. This is entirely my psychosis.

29
00:01:46,888 --> 00:01:48,548
But she said, oh, my God.

30
00:01:48,688 --> 00:01:53,488
Wait, well, now that we know we're not going, can you can I tell you about the stuff?

31
00:01:53,528 --> 00:01:54,468
And I'm like, yeah, sure.

32
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:58,168
And we watched a video and it was starting to come and she were here.

33
00:01:58,188 --> 00:02:01,048
This is a spoiler, right? Just skip like, you know, if you're listening,

34
00:02:01,048 --> 00:02:02,028
you don't want to hear about Tokyo Disney.

35
00:02:02,028 --> 00:02:03,148
Skip three minutes ahead.

36
00:02:03,308 --> 00:02:07,228
But she's like, oh, I think this is where it's going to get crazy.

37
00:02:07,368 --> 00:02:12,688
And I watched the you did the crazy room where there are.

38
00:02:12,688 --> 00:02:16,428
There is a big pot with a heffa lump or woozle on it.

39
00:02:16,508 --> 00:02:18,108
So I've seen this now.

40
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:21,408
I know what it is and I know that I don't get to do it.

41
00:02:21,488 --> 00:02:24,628
At least not this time, because, of course, I'm already thinking.

42
00:02:25,168 --> 00:02:26,828
Maybe maybe Japan has to come.

43
00:02:26,968 --> 00:02:31,188
I haven't even been and already we were like we're so we feel we're trying to cram

44
00:02:31,188 --> 00:02:33,388
so much in. I'm already thinking about Japan trip number two.

45
00:02:33,448 --> 00:02:35,168
But anyway, no, no poos, honey.

46
00:02:35,228 --> 00:02:37,768
Well, at least the emperor's kiss is open.

47
00:02:37,848 --> 00:02:40,028
You got to make sure to ride the emperor's kiss.

48
00:02:40,108 --> 00:02:41,628
What's the emperor's kiss?

49
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:45,088
I don't know. I think I really don't have the energy to.

50
00:02:45,088 --> 00:02:46,108
I was going to try.

51
00:02:46,508 --> 00:02:50,988
Could I? Yeah. Could I string along for four or five months

52
00:02:50,988 --> 00:02:54,508
that there is a ride he has to go on called the inverse kiss?

53
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,508
You wait in the moment.

54
00:02:56,588 --> 00:02:59,428
You suddenly decided to do a long con joke.

55
00:02:59,548 --> 00:03:04,088
Yes. And twice as quickly, I decided to give up on it

56
00:03:04,088 --> 00:03:07,568
because if I prodded you a lot more, you might not have been ready.

57
00:03:07,728 --> 00:03:11,288
I think because I started to smile as I finished saying kiss,

58
00:03:11,288 --> 00:03:14,368
not that the listeners could hear that, but it would have been a vaguer.

59
00:03:14,368 --> 00:03:16,308
The emperor's token or something.

60
00:03:16,568 --> 00:03:20,288
I think this is I mean, all of this is harder to do with the Internet nowadays.

61
00:03:20,308 --> 00:03:24,368
And I think only two people here, one who went to Tokyo Disney.

62
00:03:24,548 --> 00:03:26,748
Yeah. But if you guys had played the little.

63
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,268
Yeah. But you didn't like look over at me a wink.

64
00:03:29,508 --> 00:03:31,988
I would have seen. I guess that's true.

65
00:03:32,408 --> 00:03:34,768
Yeah. You are you like off, Mike?

66
00:03:34,768 --> 00:03:36,108
You went like, play it cool.

67
00:03:36,608 --> 00:03:40,568
Yeah, that would have been very funny if I did the cocaine nose thing.

68
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:43,328
I also easily heard all this or seen it all.

69
00:03:43,328 --> 00:03:44,008
That's true.

70
00:03:44,008 --> 00:03:46,948
What a weird plan that you suddenly hatched.

71
00:03:47,088 --> 00:03:47,748
I think it's delightful.

72
00:03:48,548 --> 00:03:50,608
I know. I like this is, you know, I didn't have.

73
00:03:50,728 --> 00:03:52,628
Did you guys have liar friends growing up?

74
00:03:52,728 --> 00:03:55,628
The kids who like Nintendo to is coming.

75
00:03:55,688 --> 00:03:58,468
I said on the podcast, I'd buy it pretty easily.

76
00:03:58,788 --> 00:04:00,848
I think if you'd taken it a little further,

77
00:04:01,148 --> 00:04:03,768
I think you could have strung me on for like a little more of this episode,

78
00:04:03,768 --> 00:04:06,428
but probably not for months and months. Yeah.

79
00:04:07,188 --> 00:04:10,168
But what do you think the emperor's kiss is like?

80
00:04:10,568 --> 00:04:15,268
Does the emperor's kiss have a power in a snow white fashion to fix something?

81
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:21,508
Or is it something or is the protagonist of the ride a like poor girl?

82
00:04:21,908 --> 00:04:25,328
I don't even want to say a place where where are their emperors?

83
00:04:25,428 --> 00:04:30,108
Some like planes girl who wants the emperor's kiss and dreams of it.

84
00:04:30,868 --> 00:04:34,148
I think it would just be you would be the protagonist

85
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:38,848
and it would be like it would end with the the current

86
00:04:39,468 --> 00:04:43,868
emperor, emperor, the current because there is still a lineage, right?

87
00:04:43,888 --> 00:04:46,968
There is still like a ceremonial Japan.

88
00:04:46,968 --> 00:04:48,368
Yeah. Kissing you.

89
00:04:48,408 --> 00:04:49,988
There's not an emperor of Japan.

90
00:04:50,088 --> 00:04:52,028
There's a president of Japan.

91
00:04:52,568 --> 00:04:54,248
There is a president. Yeah.

92
00:04:54,288 --> 00:04:56,888
But I don't. Is there a figure of a queen?

93
00:04:57,188 --> 00:05:00,908
Because the lineage didn't just die with your he to hold on.

94
00:05:01,928 --> 00:05:04,368
Let's find out if there's a real emperor in Japan.

95
00:05:04,748 --> 00:05:07,528
I think it's like even more ceremonial.

96
00:05:07,528 --> 00:05:10,488
But like there is an emperor, but he has no lips.

97
00:05:10,568 --> 00:05:12,148
OK, I guess Jason is right.

98
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,548
The current emperor is Akahito.

99
00:05:14,768 --> 00:05:17,588
He acceded to the Chrysanthemum

100
00:05:17,588 --> 00:05:21,708
throne upon the death of his father, Emperor Shoah in 1989.

101
00:05:21,848 --> 00:05:22,568
Sorry, what's the name again?

102
00:05:23,388 --> 00:05:26,008
Akihito, Akahito, Akihito.

103
00:05:26,248 --> 00:05:28,428
So at the so there's an Akihito robot.

104
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:32,148
I think you would welcome blow you a kiss and he welcomes you to Japan.

105
00:05:32,448 --> 00:05:36,088
So maybe this is like in the main street zone or whatever it's called.

106
00:05:36,088 --> 00:05:37,928
Their world bizarre or something.

107
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:40,188
And it's like that takes the place of Lincoln.

108
00:05:40,348 --> 00:05:42,288
It's a it's a figure who's important to them.

109
00:05:42,328 --> 00:05:46,668
Oh, yeah, because Lincoln, they wouldn't have the they wouldn't have the context.

110
00:05:46,668 --> 00:05:50,908
Yeah. So in the opera house, there's a thing where the current emperor

111
00:05:50,908 --> 00:05:53,388
that gives blows you a kiss. Right.

112
00:05:53,808 --> 00:05:56,708
Or I would hope that they would have the technology by now where you

113
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:59,108
the robot would actually touch your face with its mouth.

114
00:05:59,908 --> 00:06:01,068
Let me give you a real kiss.

115
00:06:01,748 --> 00:06:04,408
That seems awfully forward for the Japanese culture.

116
00:06:04,508 --> 00:06:05,828
Mm hmm. They still have.

117
00:06:05,828 --> 00:06:08,348
It's more of a proverbial kiss. OK.

118
00:06:09,088 --> 00:06:12,988
But you're thinking a few steps ahead to when this technology is perfected.

119
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,748
Next time you go visit old mini. Yep.

120
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:17,068
It's like lucky day.

121
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:19,608
I've been saying they finally have blinking Mickey and Minnie.

122
00:06:19,628 --> 00:06:22,648
And now I want pursing lips Mickey and Minnie.

123
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:24,368
Well, they purse. Well, they have to.

124
00:06:24,388 --> 00:06:25,768
That's how you do a kiss.

125
00:06:25,788 --> 00:06:28,588
Oh, thanks, Michael.

126
00:06:29,268 --> 00:06:32,568
I'm just saying it's great to have you learn to kiss from some book

127
00:06:32,568 --> 00:06:34,608
that says like step one purse.

128
00:06:35,148 --> 00:06:37,008
Purse your lips. Purse your lips.

129
00:06:37,308 --> 00:06:39,468
Close your eyes and see they have both the elements you need.

130
00:06:40,348 --> 00:06:42,908
So now it's just yeah, now it's just a matter of the technology

131
00:06:42,908 --> 00:06:43,948
catching up to these ideas.

132
00:06:44,728 --> 00:06:47,028
Contracts the lips back and forth.

133
00:06:47,128 --> 00:06:49,928
This is on on points with you

134
00:06:49,928 --> 00:06:55,028
referring to Lindsay as your love and the whole room going, what?

135
00:06:56,368 --> 00:06:57,428
It was kind of haunting.

136
00:06:58,388 --> 00:06:59,208
Oh, that's nice.

137
00:06:59,308 --> 00:07:00,828
Haunting is the phrase.

138
00:07:01,568 --> 00:07:04,168
She said she thought it was cute, but yes, she was caught off guard.

139
00:07:04,168 --> 00:07:05,388
Yeah, because I don't say that.

140
00:07:05,388 --> 00:07:07,288
Well, I was thinking of a fun way to say it.

141
00:07:07,308 --> 00:07:09,168
But yes, now I want either.

142
00:07:09,768 --> 00:07:12,028
You said it in a stressed tone is what I recall.

143
00:07:12,228 --> 00:07:17,068
Like she my girlfriend, my love, which I think that was what made it odd.

144
00:07:17,368 --> 00:07:20,508
Was that like the delivery like you like you said it in the way

145
00:07:20,508 --> 00:07:22,948
where if you had a stressful day and you were running around everywhere

146
00:07:22,948 --> 00:07:24,308
and then my love.

147
00:07:25,548 --> 00:07:28,508
I hope I didn't sound irritated, which is.

148
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:31,248
Well, the point is that she understood.

149
00:07:31,248 --> 00:07:36,808
Yeah, she understood that that's just a stifled, emotional, motionless man

150
00:07:36,808 --> 00:07:40,988
trying to show affection and a break it out, which is almost the sweetest thing.

151
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:42,528
So she got that. Yeah.

152
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:47,208
Which is it could be the sort of the journey of the Emperor's Kiss

153
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:51,868
ride that he's if you learn about him and learn that he's notoriously cross.

154
00:07:51,868 --> 00:07:55,308
But then like maybe like the right little girl gives him a present

155
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,008
and brightens his day or something.

156
00:07:57,248 --> 00:07:59,868
And now he's blowing a kiss to all of us as people.

157
00:07:59,928 --> 00:08:01,288
Yes, because he's thankful.

158
00:08:01,308 --> 00:08:06,068
He's thankful everyone is coming and visiting and once in

159
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:09,048
welcome to the country.

160
00:08:09,268 --> 00:08:12,808
And if you are one of my countrymen, welcome as well.

161
00:08:13,008 --> 00:08:15,628
I think now we've sort of we'll eventually do a full

162
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,728
Patreon episode on Emperor's Kiss.

163
00:08:18,028 --> 00:08:19,228
We'll build out the Emperor's Kiss.

164
00:08:19,228 --> 00:08:22,368
But we won't for a while because we've talked a little too much about it right now.

165
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:25,588
And I thought it was a great way to break the ice.

166
00:08:25,608 --> 00:08:28,148
Second only. Oh, wow.

167
00:08:28,268 --> 00:08:32,308
Jason, well during heat of the sun melting the snow

168
00:08:32,308 --> 00:08:34,848
of a failed ski resort.

169
00:08:36,188 --> 00:08:42,708
Blizzard Beach is today's topic, which the just the basic

170
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:46,508
point about it is it's one of the water parks in Walt Disney World.

171
00:08:46,808 --> 00:08:51,308
It is not Typhoon Lagoon, which has a big ship teetering atop a mountain.

172
00:08:51,488 --> 00:08:57,388
It is the one that is winter themed and that is supposed to be that all of the slides are

173
00:08:57,388 --> 00:08:58,848
ice melting.

174
00:08:59,188 --> 00:09:01,688
And that's what's taking you down the hill.

175
00:09:01,748 --> 00:09:06,688
So if you're only the vaguest aware of these parks, that's that's what it is.

176
00:09:07,028 --> 00:09:10,688
The natural disaster that caused Blizzard Beach was a freak snowstorm.

177
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:15,168
And the natural disaster that caused Typhoon Lagoon was a typhoon.

178
00:09:15,468 --> 00:09:20,608
So all of them, all the Disney part, all the Disney water parks caused by mayhem

179
00:09:20,608 --> 00:09:22,368
and death. Yeah, weird.

180
00:09:22,768 --> 00:09:27,768
River Country, River Country USA, the late, late grade river, the original water park.

181
00:09:27,948 --> 00:09:32,348
I don't think that's an old swimming hole, old swimming hole filled with

182
00:09:32,348 --> 00:09:35,208
disgusting bacteria because it was all freshwater.

183
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:38,828
I guess all the water parks is like Volcano Bay now.

184
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,848
That's an active volcano universal.

185
00:09:40,988 --> 00:09:43,148
So that's also a disaster.

186
00:09:43,388 --> 00:09:48,648
The thing all the theme parks are always discovering like mountains with problems

187
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:53,968
and like construction sites that are haunted or problematic

188
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,908
or old burial grounds.

189
00:09:56,628 --> 00:10:00,288
These days, all of them, Disney Universal, every one of them should have been more

190
00:10:00,288 --> 00:10:01,848
careful picking these properties.

191
00:10:01,848 --> 00:10:03,608
Oh, yeah. Maybe surveyed it.

192
00:10:03,648 --> 00:10:08,588
Check to see if you have a volcano and like you didn't look to see if there was an old

193
00:10:08,588 --> 00:10:11,508
ski resort from the one time that it snowed in Florida.

194
00:10:11,568 --> 00:10:13,168
Well, that's that's different.

195
00:10:13,408 --> 00:10:14,808
The Blizzard Beach. I hate to.

196
00:10:15,028 --> 00:10:17,888
This is a good I wanted to keep talking about this, but Blizzard Beach.

197
00:10:17,948 --> 00:10:20,408
They built it after the snowstorm.

198
00:10:20,408 --> 00:10:25,508
So Disney incorrectly thought, well, the snow is going to be in Florida forever.

199
00:10:25,788 --> 00:10:27,428
They built the whole ski lodge.

200
00:10:27,808 --> 00:10:31,228
Then the snow melted, which makes them look like fucking idiots.

201
00:10:31,228 --> 00:10:35,868
OK, they thought this is a new like this is this is a new phenomenon.

202
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:39,248
This is a new like a source of business for us.

203
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:42,528
We can build if it's snowing in Florida, we'll be the first to build a snow resort

204
00:10:42,528 --> 00:10:44,148
or ski resort. And then it didn't.

205
00:10:44,148 --> 00:10:45,188
Yes. Keep snowing.

206
00:10:45,188 --> 00:10:48,128
And it melted. And that's why it's just like there's some snow there.

207
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:51,728
Got it. OK. No, thanks for setting me straight on the table.

208
00:10:51,728 --> 00:10:53,808
People would be real mad if I hadn't done that.

209
00:10:54,268 --> 00:10:56,588
It's very important to know the Blizzard Beach backstory.

210
00:10:57,068 --> 00:11:01,628
Yeah. I mean, I do have the entire and by the way, we are discussing.

211
00:11:01,948 --> 00:11:05,708
Let me I'll break KFabe and say that.

212
00:11:06,068 --> 00:11:09,908
Yes, that this is not this isn't the real story.

213
00:11:10,228 --> 00:11:13,708
This is the imagineered backstory.

214
00:11:13,728 --> 00:11:17,228
Right. Because the real story is just they want to build a water park.

215
00:11:17,448 --> 00:11:18,228
And they wanted a water park.

216
00:11:18,408 --> 00:11:20,268
They had to already.

217
00:11:20,428 --> 00:11:21,808
Mm hmm. Yes, at the time.

218
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:24,068
And River Country has been retired. Yeah.

219
00:11:25,188 --> 00:11:29,328
River Country to put you kind of closer to in the in the geography.

220
00:11:29,508 --> 00:11:31,948
River Country is closer to the Magic Kingdom.

221
00:11:32,028 --> 00:11:37,108
And then Blizzard Beach is like very far on the side pockets of Disney World,

222
00:11:37,168 --> 00:11:38,808
as is Typhoon Lagoon.

223
00:11:39,348 --> 00:11:41,188
What it's kind of closer to Animal Kingdom.

224
00:11:41,468 --> 00:11:43,548
Yeah, it's in that zone.

225
00:11:43,568 --> 00:11:47,408
And it's by that Christmas miniature golf course.

226
00:11:47,848 --> 00:11:50,988
Yes. Winter Summerland, Winter Summerland built after.

227
00:11:51,108 --> 00:11:55,188
So that's what kind of it was sort of a way to extend the theme, I feel, of

228
00:11:55,188 --> 00:11:56,268
a Blizzard Beach. Right.

229
00:11:56,268 --> 00:12:02,068
River Country closer to Bay Lake and the assorted bodies of water soon to become.

230
00:12:02,068 --> 00:12:04,848
Oh, yeah. Reflections, colon,

231
00:12:05,368 --> 00:12:10,648
Disney's dashed lodge or whatever the hotel name is called.

232
00:12:10,648 --> 00:12:13,428
Yeah, there's some recent hotels announced.

233
00:12:13,888 --> 00:12:18,488
Yeah. Which, again, I don't it seems like they're going for like an upscale,

234
00:12:18,748 --> 00:12:20,808
like a wooden spa kind of aesthetic.

235
00:12:20,928 --> 00:12:24,008
But it's like, just call it River Country Lodge.

236
00:12:24,168 --> 00:12:25,848
Like, get that nostalgia money.

237
00:12:25,968 --> 00:12:26,928
What are you doing?

238
00:12:27,388 --> 00:12:33,248
I mean, nostalgia for diseases and typhoid and

239
00:12:33,248 --> 00:12:34,528
staff infections.

240
00:12:34,528 --> 00:12:36,208
People don't remember all that.

241
00:12:36,268 --> 00:12:37,928
Does the year aches?

242
00:12:38,788 --> 00:12:42,108
Yeah, all the new hotels don't seem like they're going to do a lot of nostalgia.

243
00:12:42,368 --> 00:12:45,288
It's all like a Clance classy ish.

244
00:12:45,288 --> 00:12:46,788
The other year. Yeah.

245
00:12:47,148 --> 00:12:49,768
There's no Horizons Lodge, no Horizons Lodge.

246
00:12:49,848 --> 00:12:52,588
There's no Maelstrom in.

247
00:12:52,788 --> 00:12:55,028
There's no I would love that.

248
00:12:55,028 --> 00:12:57,588
Sure. And like, yeah, various trolls around.

249
00:12:57,608 --> 00:12:59,648
And then you check in and where are we staying?

250
00:12:59,888 --> 00:13:02,068
Oh, we're in the oil barracks.

251
00:13:02,068 --> 00:13:05,728
The wake up call is just back back.

252
00:13:05,728 --> 00:13:07,188
Don't go back to sleep.

253
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:10,028
Man, that's a good idea.

254
00:13:10,048 --> 00:13:11,268
We have so many good ideas.

255
00:13:11,488 --> 00:13:13,928
We just throw them off, but they won't use.

256
00:13:14,688 --> 00:13:19,508
Yeah. But I don't know if they if Disney catches wind that these guys are just

257
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:23,428
giving away ideas for free, you know, they're going to rifle through and, you know,

258
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:24,748
they're going to have to do that.

259
00:13:24,748 --> 00:13:25,288
Yeah. All right.

260
00:13:25,348 --> 00:13:26,488
We got to start working on that.

261
00:13:26,508 --> 00:13:30,328
The I survived the Emperor's Kiss t-shirts immediately.

262
00:13:30,548 --> 00:13:35,708
So we copyrighted now in all the domains before the Emperor's Kiss dot J.P.

263
00:13:35,788 --> 00:13:37,028
What's the Japanese?

264
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:38,128
Oh, yeah.

265
00:13:38,128 --> 00:13:42,988
OK, before they have Trump at the Hall of Presidents kissing you on the way out.

266
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,488
Oh, no. Kim way.

267
00:13:45,828 --> 00:13:47,288
Who? Oh, sorry.

268
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:47,568
Go ahead.

269
00:13:47,768 --> 00:13:49,928
Who went to Blizzard Beach here?

270
00:13:49,928 --> 00:13:51,068
I did. The three. I went.

271
00:13:51,228 --> 00:13:51,988
You have been OK.

272
00:13:51,988 --> 00:13:54,988
It was kind of a brief stop.

273
00:13:55,048 --> 00:13:59,268
And I truly have no memories or stories to pull from it.

274
00:13:59,328 --> 00:14:00,988
Wait a minute. Oh, no, no, no.

275
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:01,948
This was there.

276
00:14:01,988 --> 00:14:05,128
Not not Typhoon Lagoon.

277
00:14:05,128 --> 00:14:06,908
Oh, man. I'll just sell.

278
00:14:07,228 --> 00:14:08,128
I'll say it now.

279
00:14:08,488 --> 00:14:12,028
The the big the family raft ride.

280
00:14:12,188 --> 00:14:12,508
Yes.

281
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:22,128
I went on with my dad and my younger sister who's like a little cagey, afraid,

282
00:14:22,368 --> 00:14:25,188
more scaredy than me, if you can imagine that.

283
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:30,408
And the the raft, I do remember it being pretty like hulking.

284
00:14:30,588 --> 00:14:35,748
It's it's giant and very tall, more so than most family raft rides.

285
00:14:35,748 --> 00:14:39,968
And everybody's kind of buckled in with those straps just against the edge

286
00:14:39,968 --> 00:14:42,608
that you're holding on to. And she was maybe

287
00:14:42,608 --> 00:14:46,128
she would show up.

288
00:14:46,188 --> 00:14:47,428
What a mean brother I am.

289
00:14:47,588 --> 00:14:51,468
I just we started going like where everybody's kind of strapping in.

290
00:14:51,668 --> 00:14:56,808
OK, ready. And then they pushed us off and then Kelly goes, I'm not ready.

291
00:14:57,428 --> 00:14:58,408
Freaks out.

292
00:14:58,408 --> 00:15:04,008
And then we go up the first like the first time they got to splashes up a curve.

293
00:15:04,008 --> 00:15:07,588
She gets the like high end of it.

294
00:15:07,768 --> 00:15:10,768
And it did go pretty far up in my memory.

295
00:15:10,808 --> 00:15:12,508
And it's one of the tallest vantage points

296
00:15:12,508 --> 00:15:16,408
in all of Disney World that I remember, just the pure raw

297
00:15:16,408 --> 00:15:22,208
like the most terrified scream.

298
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,708
And then it became a problem.

299
00:15:23,828 --> 00:15:25,888
Like my dad was laughing at her for a little bit.

300
00:15:25,888 --> 00:15:29,708
And then and then he kicked in like, oh, wait, no, God, my daughter is

301
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:32,008
terrified for her life. I do need to deal with this.

302
00:15:32,088 --> 00:15:33,568
Did you enjoy it?

303
00:15:33,568 --> 00:15:37,168
I did. And I'm still I look, we made it.

304
00:15:37,168 --> 00:15:38,808
She's fine. Everyone's fine.

305
00:15:38,948 --> 00:15:40,708
I it really makes me laugh.

306
00:15:40,948 --> 00:15:42,408
How terrified she was.

307
00:15:43,148 --> 00:15:44,568
Wow. She did not.

308
00:15:45,908 --> 00:15:50,948
I think that was the same vacation also, where we went on the what now is the flight

309
00:15:50,948 --> 00:15:54,968
of the hippogriff and she grabbed my mom's breast in fear.

310
00:15:56,028 --> 00:15:56,508
Right.

311
00:15:56,468 --> 00:15:57,408
Just latched.

312
00:15:57,648 --> 00:15:58,988
She just like was grabbing anything

313
00:15:58,988 --> 00:16:05,468
and just grabbed my mom's boob and squeezed it and was too young and oblivious

314
00:16:05,468 --> 00:16:08,628
to know she was molesting my mom.

315
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,328
So a lot of good stuff with my sister.

316
00:16:11,568 --> 00:16:14,548
What year is this? Probably, I don't know, 10 years ago.

317
00:16:15,028 --> 00:16:16,068
Yeah, pretty recent.

318
00:16:16,288 --> 00:16:17,368
I don't know.

319
00:16:17,448 --> 00:16:18,828
Flight of the hippogriff. How long has that been?

320
00:16:18,948 --> 00:16:20,708
No, no, but it was it was the unicorn.

321
00:16:20,988 --> 00:16:24,108
Oh, oh, oh, this would have been 99 or so.

322
00:16:25,488 --> 00:16:27,208
Early in the violence of adventure run.

323
00:16:27,648 --> 00:16:30,188
And I think so I think is the only time I went to Blizzard Beach.

324
00:16:30,308 --> 00:16:33,528
Right. The only thing I remember is my sister thinking she was going to die.

325
00:16:33,528 --> 00:16:38,008
Oh, I also have an infamous family story at Blizzard Beach.

326
00:16:38,108 --> 00:16:40,008
I guess I'll just tell it now.

327
00:16:40,188 --> 00:16:43,508
Well, we were going to do the family raff ride and my brother chickened out halfway

328
00:16:43,508 --> 00:16:48,728
up and I think for whatever reason we're like, oh, you have to have four to do it.

329
00:16:48,828 --> 00:16:51,668
Now when reading about it, they're like, oh, they would have just paired you

330
00:16:51,668 --> 00:16:57,008
with another party of two or one to like fill out because the bigger rafts,

331
00:16:57,008 --> 00:16:59,968
the minimum is four just to distribute the weight evenly.

332
00:17:00,008 --> 00:17:03,448
I remember if there was another people, if there were other people, I don't know.

333
00:17:03,528 --> 00:17:03,888
Well, whatever.

334
00:17:05,488 --> 00:17:11,088
But the real story is about how my father almost drowned at Blizzard Beach.

335
00:17:11,088 --> 00:17:16,808
So we were and this wasn't even one of the big slides.

336
00:17:17,048 --> 00:17:18,868
I can't even honestly looking through all

337
00:17:18,868 --> 00:17:22,528
the maps and watching a bunch of YouTube ride throughs.

338
00:17:22,588 --> 00:17:26,648
I called him and we were trying to figure out what it was.

339
00:17:26,668 --> 00:17:32,208
And I think it was in like the teen, the fake teen training area where like

340
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:36,408
obstacle course and stuff, there was a smaller slide that emptied out into what

341
00:17:36,408 --> 00:17:41,948
looked like a full sized pool and my whole family was going on.

342
00:17:41,948 --> 00:17:46,148
It was not very big and I would not have had my glasses on.

343
00:17:46,168 --> 00:17:48,648
And I've always been blind as a bat without glasses.

344
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:51,108
But when we were like walking past this

345
00:17:51,108 --> 00:17:55,088
pool to go up, I swore I like kind of hazily saw I was like,

346
00:17:55,128 --> 00:17:58,908
does that say ten feet, like ten feet deep pool?

347
00:17:58,908 --> 00:18:01,808
But I was like, oh, I don't know.

348
00:18:01,808 --> 00:18:03,608
I don't have my glass. I didn't say anything.

349
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:09,768
So my mom and brother went down first and it was again, we were not that high up.

350
00:18:09,828 --> 00:18:12,288
It was pretty much just straight down into this pool.

351
00:18:12,488 --> 00:18:17,688
And my dad yells down like how like I forget whether it was.

352
00:18:17,688 --> 00:18:19,748
How was it or how deep was it?

353
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:22,668
Because I think by that point, we started talking about like,

354
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,968
what are we expecting when we hit the water?

355
00:18:25,008 --> 00:18:28,788
Because some of these slides, you hit the water and there's either like the speed

356
00:18:28,788 --> 00:18:31,228
stop or you just go into a three foot pool.

357
00:18:33,048 --> 00:18:37,448
And my mom, I don't know if she just didn't hear or what, just went, it's good.

358
00:18:37,688 --> 00:18:38,428
It's OK.

359
00:18:38,788 --> 00:18:44,628
And I kind of braced myself going down because I thought like, oh, this is this

360
00:18:44,628 --> 00:18:47,028
might be deep. And sure enough, I was right,

361
00:18:47,068 --> 00:18:50,888
but it still caught me off guard when I hit like and did not hit bottom.

362
00:18:50,968 --> 00:18:54,728
And so then I just like quickly swam to the side.

363
00:18:55,428 --> 00:18:58,428
My dad went in and

364
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:04,568
was also surprised that it was deep, but he swam straight ahead the length of a pool.

365
00:19:04,808 --> 00:19:09,008
And so he was like, well, at this point, halfway through, he's like,

366
00:19:09,008 --> 00:19:10,868
I surely can stand up now.

367
00:19:10,868 --> 00:19:14,168
And he went to stand and did not hit the

368
00:19:14,168 --> 00:19:19,848
ground and kind of like lost his balance and like surprised, sucked in water.

369
00:19:19,888 --> 00:19:22,368
So then he's like trying to gain back his balance.

370
00:19:22,488 --> 00:19:25,348
And we're all just watching this like, oh, my God.

371
00:19:25,368 --> 00:19:31,308
And a lifeguard jumped in immediately and and pulled him to the side.

372
00:19:31,328 --> 00:19:35,528
And what he told me when I talked to him, he's like, well, the worst of it was when

373
00:19:35,528 --> 00:19:40,508
they got me out of the water, I was like coughing, like just trying to get my

374
00:19:40,508 --> 00:19:44,768
breath back and coffee was fine, but the lifeguard was just screaming out.

375
00:19:44,888 --> 00:19:46,588
I'm like, sir, are you OK?

376
00:19:46,808 --> 00:19:50,668
Are you all right? Like clearly like needed the OK.

377
00:19:50,668 --> 00:19:56,448
Oh, so for liability needed to hear my dad say, yes, I am OK so that we didn't

378
00:19:56,448 --> 00:20:03,628
press charges or anything. And so like it was it was it all worked out fine.

379
00:20:03,628 --> 00:20:06,508
My memory is that then the lifeguard came back.

380
00:20:07,568 --> 00:20:11,848
And gave him a shovel and a bucket and said, stick to the beach.

381
00:20:11,848 --> 00:20:14,148
Oh, really?

382
00:20:14,388 --> 00:20:17,068
My dad, my dad did not remember that.

383
00:20:17,128 --> 00:20:19,668
So I potentially feel that in my head.

384
00:20:19,808 --> 00:20:24,948
But like he was just clearly miserable for like the next couple, because like he

385
00:20:24,948 --> 00:20:29,948
went over my mom, he was like, that was OK, Lois.

386
00:20:30,148 --> 00:20:31,428
That was I asked you.

387
00:20:31,468 --> 00:20:34,128
She's like, I thought it seemed like OK.

388
00:20:34,468 --> 00:20:39,008
And when I was texting him about it, he said that was the second time she tried

389
00:20:39,008 --> 00:20:40,608
to get rid of me at Disney World.

390
00:20:40,608 --> 00:20:44,068
The other. Yes, the other.

391
00:20:44,228 --> 00:20:46,808
And I think I told this early on

392
00:20:46,808 --> 00:20:50,668
was they were in those little putt putt boats you can rent at Bay Lake.

393
00:20:50,668 --> 00:20:54,308
Yeah. And my dad ran out of gas in the middle.

394
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:55,268
Oh, yeah, you said that.

395
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:57,908
I think and she's like, I'll go back to the dock and get the guy.

396
00:20:58,008 --> 00:20:59,508
And then my dad was just bobbing around

397
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,008
out there as one of the transport

398
00:21:02,008 --> 00:21:04,908
boats were coming right at him.

399
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:07,768
And thankfully, like they saw it.

400
00:21:08,128 --> 00:21:13,688
And the wash from the boat washed him into the like slowly

401
00:21:13,688 --> 00:21:17,328
shored, like washed him into the rocks.

402
00:21:17,328 --> 00:21:23,268
He's multiple stories of water, multiple stories of water danger.

403
00:21:23,268 --> 00:21:23,788
Yeah.

404
00:21:23,788 --> 00:21:27,328
All right. So your dad should stay away from the water.

405
00:21:28,108 --> 00:21:28,548
Yes.

406
00:21:28,828 --> 00:21:29,728
Stick to the beach.

407
00:21:29,868 --> 00:21:33,948
Stick to the beach, which again, I could have filled that into my head.

408
00:21:34,008 --> 00:21:36,628
It's a pretty good line, though, for you to make up.

409
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:40,948
Doesn't it seem like too much of an own for like a Disney cast member to say that?

410
00:21:41,108 --> 00:21:42,288
But why would you have that memory?

411
00:21:42,488 --> 00:21:45,088
It wasn't there. I don't know, because I swear.

412
00:21:45,768 --> 00:21:46,128
I swear.

413
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:50,268
Because then later I feel like I feel like I also have a memory of us going like,

414
00:21:50,488 --> 00:21:54,608
we're not taking a bucket and a shovel back on the plate.

415
00:21:54,948 --> 00:21:57,108
Like, what are we going to do with this?

416
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:58,908
And it was delivered as an insult.

417
00:21:59,868 --> 00:22:01,668
Yeah, I don't know.

418
00:22:01,968 --> 00:22:02,268
You could have.

419
00:22:02,468 --> 00:22:05,468
I mean, your memory, it could have been like

420
00:22:05,468 --> 00:22:08,328
the guy thought he was being funny and he came over and he goes, hey, stick to the

421
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:09,448
beach. And he said it like that.

422
00:22:09,448 --> 00:22:10,528
And he was trying to be like pleasant.

423
00:22:10,528 --> 00:22:12,108
I think that's what it was.

424
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:13,948
That is kind of my memory.

425
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:19,828
Are you like rerouted in your brain from some like

426
00:22:19,828 --> 00:22:23,608
spring break movie or from like Hot Dog, the movie or something?

427
00:22:23,668 --> 00:22:27,008
That is my thing for like the asshole lifeguard.

428
00:22:27,108 --> 00:22:29,888
Who has the base to say to the nerd.

429
00:22:30,328 --> 00:22:32,608
It is entirely like a what was it?

430
00:22:32,628 --> 00:22:33,808
The Kazam.

431
00:22:34,128 --> 00:22:36,168
People thought there was a movie called Shazam.

432
00:22:36,628 --> 00:22:39,028
Or people thought there was a movie called Shazam.

433
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:40,548
No, it was Shazam.

434
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:41,328
Yeah. Yeah.

435
00:22:41,328 --> 00:22:42,888
But people know it was Kazam.

436
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:43,828
It was Kazam.

437
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:44,448
But right.

438
00:22:44,568 --> 00:22:46,148
The real movie is Kazam.

439
00:22:46,188 --> 00:22:46,508
Yeah.

440
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,288
The fake movie.

441
00:22:47,308 --> 00:22:48,328
The imagined movie is Shazam.

442
00:22:48,348 --> 00:22:51,528
Yeah. So I could have gotten some wires crossed in my brain.

443
00:22:51,848 --> 00:22:52,228
Right.

444
00:22:52,468 --> 00:22:53,988
Yeah. You carted that over.

445
00:22:54,368 --> 00:22:54,448
Yeah.

446
00:22:55,068 --> 00:23:01,828
Also, if the person who messaged us to say, I repeated a story once or twice in

447
00:23:01,828 --> 00:23:08,728
the past, said I was said that little guy is annoying to them, I say what?

448
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:11,428
Someone messaged someone DM us.

449
00:23:11,488 --> 00:23:14,848
Who's called me a little guy and said I was annoying.

450
00:23:15,148 --> 00:23:17,748
That person is hearing this, which would be insane.

451
00:23:17,948 --> 00:23:20,648
They're paying for more because they said they stopped listening.

452
00:23:21,028 --> 00:23:22,228
Eat my whole ass.

453
00:23:22,648 --> 00:23:25,608
Then take a long walk off a short pier.

454
00:23:25,608 --> 00:23:27,268
And what else?

455
00:23:27,688 --> 00:23:29,948
This is your chance to give them an item.

456
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,188
Oh, do it.

457
00:23:31,408 --> 00:23:33,368
Do it. Stick to the beaches, asshole.

458
00:23:33,748 --> 00:23:35,008
Yeah. Yeah.

459
00:23:35,068 --> 00:23:35,868
You showed them.

460
00:23:35,868 --> 00:23:39,408
You finally put that line in the right the right context.

461
00:23:39,408 --> 00:23:39,888
Yeah.

462
00:23:40,008 --> 00:23:41,948
Why would somebody do that?

463
00:23:42,048 --> 00:23:42,668
I don't know.

464
00:23:43,028 --> 00:23:44,208
I don't.

465
00:23:44,488 --> 00:23:47,228
Also, like it was a Twitter account with no tweets.

466
00:23:47,328 --> 00:23:51,128
So I'm like, did they register this just to DM people mean things?

467
00:23:51,128 --> 00:23:52,208
I think I can't even find this.

468
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:55,768
Did I say whenever I found one of our rare one star review?

469
00:23:55,988 --> 00:23:58,128
Rare. Proud to say rare one star reviews.

470
00:23:58,448 --> 00:24:03,148
But one of them was almost entirely just one star reviews of podcasts.

471
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:03,768
Yeah.

472
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:09,048
Between Hollywood Handbook and Amy Schumer's podcast or something.

473
00:24:09,388 --> 00:24:11,648
He just like spit like all and you see the date.

474
00:24:11,788 --> 00:24:15,068
See, so on certain days he just all right, I'm going to get through nine today.

475
00:24:17,188 --> 00:24:18,788
That's that is nice, too.

476
00:24:18,788 --> 00:24:20,768
This content does matter.

477
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:25,248
Check, you know, see who are these people who are these people?

478
00:24:25,508 --> 00:24:28,188
If it was like they were giving five stars to everything and then we got one,

479
00:24:28,188 --> 00:24:30,068
we would feel bad. Yeah.

480
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:35,708
And if it was like, well thought out and like really picked apart our insecurities,

481
00:24:35,828 --> 00:24:36,548
then yes.

482
00:24:37,908 --> 00:24:41,108
My mom, my mom told me that on the Snow White episode,

483
00:24:41,128 --> 00:24:42,068
she thought it was Mr.

484
00:24:42,228 --> 00:24:44,728
Toad where I said the line, my eyes are shut too tight.

485
00:24:44,888 --> 00:24:48,568
Interesting. I said, I and she goes, I don't even think we went on so I go.

486
00:24:48,568 --> 00:24:50,728
No, that is you. Your memory is wrong.

487
00:24:50,768 --> 00:24:52,388
We were for sure on Snow White.

488
00:24:52,548 --> 00:24:53,468
I remember the witch.

489
00:24:53,888 --> 00:24:55,328
And she's like, I don't know.

490
00:24:55,528 --> 00:24:59,668
So I in any theme park issue, I trust us more than our parents.

491
00:24:59,948 --> 00:25:00,548
I think so.

492
00:25:00,588 --> 00:25:02,988
We were more invested than I guess.

493
00:25:02,988 --> 00:25:03,948
They were adults.

494
00:25:04,168 --> 00:25:07,828
Yes. But we were absorbing the only things we remember from childhood.

495
00:25:07,828 --> 00:25:13,608
You fair. That is potentially my good have been clouded by how by the stress levels

496
00:25:13,608 --> 00:25:17,888
when I would just stress myself out of like, we're not going to get everything done.

497
00:25:18,488 --> 00:25:19,528
Yeah, yeah.

498
00:25:19,528 --> 00:25:22,568
We're not going to rewrite everything to that end.

499
00:25:22,568 --> 00:25:24,308
I think that is one thing.

500
00:25:24,328 --> 00:25:26,028
These are I would say this.

501
00:25:26,268 --> 00:25:29,788
I'd say Blizzard Beach and Typhoon Lagoon are very superior water parks,

502
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:36,268
excellent water parks, but you really, you know, for us in California or for P.

503
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:39,848
I feel like if you're doing the Disney World's,

504
00:25:39,848 --> 00:25:44,268
if you're doing the Disney World trip and you don't want to do 21 days,

505
00:25:44,428 --> 00:25:46,508
it's pretty hard to find you, which you might.

506
00:25:46,508 --> 00:25:47,348
That's on the table.

507
00:25:48,488 --> 00:25:51,388
But it is hard to jam in the water parks.

508
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:54,488
My parents, we do it to a speed where we could.

509
00:25:54,648 --> 00:25:56,208
We did want to do the water parks.

510
00:25:56,228 --> 00:25:57,488
I think I probably wanted to.

511
00:25:57,688 --> 00:25:59,948
But it almost never enters the conversation.

512
00:26:00,028 --> 00:26:03,088
People write us with advice or whatever, bring it up casually conversationally.

513
00:26:03,088 --> 00:26:06,028
I don't think I've ever heard you guys say, and you got to take a little time

514
00:26:06,028 --> 00:26:09,508
for the water park. Well, granted, we're in our 30s.

515
00:26:09,648 --> 00:26:11,588
You might say I have a different answer for somebody with kids.

516
00:26:12,188 --> 00:26:17,208
But well, my answer about if I went as a child, no, I was not allowed to.

517
00:26:17,768 --> 00:26:20,968
Wow. My mom felt that these were dangerous places.

518
00:26:21,088 --> 00:26:23,428
She was terrified of me going to water parks.

519
00:26:24,408 --> 00:26:27,628
Friends would invite me when I was 14, 15 to their birthday at local water parks.

520
00:26:27,668 --> 00:26:29,008
I was not allowed to go.

521
00:26:29,448 --> 00:26:35,388
Well, now that we had to make up, I had to make up an excuse why I could not go.

522
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:38,308
Are any you think any friends are listening who are putting it together now?

523
00:26:38,308 --> 00:26:40,368
Nope. OK, none of them are listening.

524
00:26:40,908 --> 00:26:42,228
They might not know.

525
00:26:42,728 --> 00:26:44,848
I got no elementary school audience.

526
00:26:45,068 --> 00:26:47,168
I have friends from elementary school that I still talk to.

527
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:50,108
But there's no I don't think they're paying us five dollars a month for this.

528
00:26:50,328 --> 00:26:54,528
Or if we're not doing it, we have the list a little more with these.

529
00:26:54,588 --> 00:26:57,208
And if you ever saw a name that you knew, it jumped out.

530
00:26:57,208 --> 00:27:00,768
Oh, yeah. Especially because often that was the name of our wife or the dad.

531
00:27:01,088 --> 00:27:05,588
Funny enough, actually, now that you say this, I believe maybe a guy I went

532
00:27:05,588 --> 00:27:08,308
to elementary school did subscribe to the podcast today.

533
00:27:08,308 --> 00:27:10,428
Oh, today. Hold on. Hold on.

534
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:12,648
Let me look. This is funny now that you bring this up.

535
00:27:12,648 --> 00:27:15,948
Oh, wow. What a rare opportunity to think David Meske,

536
00:27:16,108 --> 00:27:19,348
I believe, is the David Meske I went to elementary school.

537
00:27:19,728 --> 00:27:21,408
Shout out to David Meske. Thank you for your support.

538
00:27:21,448 --> 00:27:25,388
So if you are indeed the same David, I know. Thank you.

539
00:27:25,508 --> 00:27:27,648
But also correct us if you're not.

540
00:27:27,748 --> 00:27:32,568
But if you are, now you know, Mike and Mike's mom were lying to you.

541
00:27:32,628 --> 00:27:35,328
Yeah, I don't think this was a water park birthday of his.

542
00:27:35,328 --> 00:27:37,688
OK, OK. Specifically, a guy named Brian.

543
00:27:38,508 --> 00:27:38,568
Yeah, yeah.

544
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:40,328
Maybe I lied.

545
00:27:40,608 --> 00:27:42,468
Every person you went to school with had a water park birthday.

546
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:44,228
Maybe I lied to David. I don't know.

547
00:27:44,228 --> 00:27:45,268
I can't remember.

548
00:27:45,508 --> 00:27:49,168
My mom made if I did lie to you, David, my mom made me do it.

549
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:50,368
So to protect me.

550
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:56,428
Now, were you upset or were you possibly happy to like not have to brave like a

551
00:27:56,428 --> 00:27:58,008
really especially scary one?

552
00:27:58,788 --> 00:28:02,388
I think my mom had put a lot of fear into me in general.

553
00:28:02,428 --> 00:28:04,748
So I was always a little nervous and scared about everything.

554
00:28:04,768 --> 00:28:06,408
But I was upset.

555
00:28:06,428 --> 00:28:07,968
I think I was mostly upset.

556
00:28:08,108 --> 00:28:13,948
My mom at a certain point was like, all right, no more toys that shoot missiles.

557
00:28:14,128 --> 00:28:19,148
Like toys that shoot like spring loaded, like, you know, cyclops shoots,

558
00:28:19,388 --> 00:28:20,568
optic blast kind of missiles.

559
00:28:20,568 --> 00:28:26,288
And even as a kid, I was like, this is insane because I've been buying these for

560
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:32,868
years. Like I was like, but I already we have a room full of toys that shoot

561
00:28:32,868 --> 00:28:35,728
projectiles. And she's like, yeah, but I don't want any more.

562
00:28:35,828 --> 00:28:36,588
And I'm like, what?

563
00:28:36,688 --> 00:28:38,588
And what you probably meant was I don't want any more clutter.

564
00:28:38,708 --> 00:28:43,268
But I think she saw something on the news of literally a you'll shoot your eye out

565
00:28:43,568 --> 00:28:46,068
moment. So she was worried about that.

566
00:28:46,388 --> 00:28:50,248
Yes. But it's also like, well, they weren't that powerful.

567
00:28:50,368 --> 00:28:51,908
They were not that powerful.

568
00:28:51,968 --> 00:28:56,368
And and we weren't even we were pretty gentle young men.

569
00:28:56,388 --> 00:28:59,088
We were pretty bookish boys.

570
00:28:59,708 --> 00:29:04,888
So like we weren't exactly like, all right, now put it in front of my face and shoot

571
00:29:04,888 --> 00:29:10,008
me in the face with that with the G.I. Joe headquarters exploding missile.

572
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:10,748
Yeah.

573
00:29:11,488 --> 00:29:13,708
I my mom, I don't know, I guess she didn't care about that.

574
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:16,168
But there were plenty of other things that she worried about for no reason.

575
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:19,068
But anyway, so the first time I went to

576
00:29:19,068 --> 00:29:24,388
Blizzard Beach was last March in my infamous Disney World Trip, which I don't

577
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:27,728
even think we talked about because we were you know, you can't talk about old trip

578
00:29:27,728 --> 00:29:30,928
on and whatever we did two and a half hours.

579
00:29:31,148 --> 00:29:35,928
And it was mainly about the meal and mostly about just the meal.

580
00:29:36,168 --> 00:29:37,488
How many rolls you got?

581
00:29:38,188 --> 00:29:39,488
I don't think I realized you went.

582
00:29:39,548 --> 00:29:40,628
And I did.

583
00:29:40,748 --> 00:29:41,108
Yeah, we did.

584
00:29:41,168 --> 00:29:43,968
We spent half a day and probably maybe closer to four hours.

585
00:29:45,188 --> 00:29:48,908
But when Lindsey and I went to Disney World together first, the first time in

586
00:29:48,908 --> 00:29:55,188
like 2014 before we went, my mom said to me, don't go to any of those water parks.

587
00:29:55,228 --> 00:29:59,608
What she still got in my head that first trip we took.

588
00:29:59,668 --> 00:30:02,628
And then this time, I don't know if I warned her ahead of time or I said,

589
00:30:02,648 --> 00:30:03,548
I'm not even going to bother.

590
00:30:03,688 --> 00:30:05,028
I'm going we're going to Blizzard Beach.

591
00:30:05,088 --> 00:30:06,748
I never went to Blizzard Beach before.

592
00:30:07,188 --> 00:30:08,948
You're going to go here.

593
00:30:09,448 --> 00:30:13,788
So finally, do you have is this is there other area, other things you like

594
00:30:13,788 --> 00:30:16,928
you where your mom appears to you over your shoulder and.

595
00:30:16,988 --> 00:30:17,768
Yeah, constantly.

596
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:19,688
Huh? Yeah, it's constant.

597
00:30:19,828 --> 00:30:20,008
Yeah.

598
00:30:20,188 --> 00:30:20,408
Hmm.

599
00:30:20,468 --> 00:30:22,748
I don't need to put you on the spot and make you produce one.

600
00:30:22,768 --> 00:30:25,408
But if you have one, I'm trying to think.

601
00:30:25,688 --> 00:30:26,548
Hmm.

602
00:30:27,748 --> 00:30:28,668
Yeah, that's a good question.

603
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:30,748
I a lot of them, I have a sandwich you

604
00:30:30,748 --> 00:30:34,068
don't eat because she like squeezed one once and like flipped on mustard.

605
00:30:34,488 --> 00:30:36,088
Yeah, I'm trying to I've rooted out.

606
00:30:36,088 --> 00:30:39,208
I think I've rooted out a lot of the fears,

607
00:30:39,348 --> 00:30:44,988
but I think there's just still a general like if it's dark out,

608
00:30:45,488 --> 00:30:47,708
I'm suspicious of everyone on the street.

609
00:30:48,628 --> 00:30:51,748
There's like I mean, this is sort of a common one, but it's just like

610
00:30:51,748 --> 00:30:54,448
you got to get inside as quickly as possible.

611
00:30:54,448 --> 00:30:58,068
You will be murdered if you're outside when it's dark.

612
00:30:58,068 --> 00:31:02,108
There's sort of a general feeling that's not completely specific.

613
00:31:02,368 --> 00:31:03,868
You shouldn't have that in your head.

614
00:31:03,868 --> 00:31:07,788
But I do know that recently there was a scenario where someone wanted to murder

615
00:31:07,788 --> 00:31:10,928
your dog and that someone was a coyote. Sure.

616
00:31:10,928 --> 00:31:15,248
To be fair, not not a dog murdering maniac man.

617
00:31:15,508 --> 00:31:18,608
But like, I don't know, maybe that frame

618
00:31:18,608 --> 00:31:21,508
of mind made you put you more in the state to save Edwin.

619
00:31:21,768 --> 00:31:24,808
And but you got to keep your head in a swivel.

620
00:31:24,948 --> 00:31:27,688
You know, that's what you didn't say that in those words.

621
00:31:28,008 --> 00:31:29,008
But I'll think of another one.

622
00:31:29,008 --> 00:31:31,748
I'll think of some other ones that I'm trying to remember.

623
00:31:31,748 --> 00:31:37,468
My mom told me that if I ever as soon as I open a dirty book, I'll never be able

624
00:31:37,468 --> 00:31:39,408
to look at a clean one again. Whoa.

625
00:31:39,488 --> 00:31:40,328
What do you mean by that?

626
00:31:40,588 --> 00:31:44,428
I think it was in reference to not wanting me to read Mad Magazine.

627
00:31:44,428 --> 00:31:45,148
Whoa.

628
00:31:45,908 --> 00:31:49,268
Which my dad, this was a lot of the push and pull with my parents.

629
00:31:49,368 --> 00:31:51,948
My dad loved Mad Magazine, still does.

630
00:31:52,148 --> 00:31:54,148
He will just say, hey, check it out.

631
00:31:54,148 --> 00:31:56,588
And he bought one at the market because it struck him funny.

632
00:31:56,628 --> 00:31:59,168
And it'll be, you know,

633
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:05,568
like, I guess whether it's Trump or whether it's

634
00:32:05,568 --> 00:32:07,668
you would even Trump, like Trump with an Alfred E.

635
00:32:07,768 --> 00:32:10,468
Newman face, he's like, look at this.

636
00:32:10,788 --> 00:32:12,828
He like stood the basic sight of Alfred E.

637
00:32:12,868 --> 00:32:18,088
Newman's head over, you know, a sub-regulars body.

638
00:32:18,488 --> 00:32:21,748
But like, but also, like, wouldn't let me watch Beavis and Butthead.

639
00:32:21,808 --> 00:32:23,708
But then my dad wanted to watch Beavis and Butthead.

640
00:32:23,868 --> 00:32:28,388
So he'd like sneak me in to do so with the finger on the remote.

641
00:32:28,548 --> 00:32:31,668
Like, soon as she comes in, I'm changing this thing.

642
00:32:32,028 --> 00:32:35,068
So is she still mad at like Mad Magazine?

643
00:32:35,948 --> 00:32:39,408
Yeah, she's still kind of like, like, we shouldn't have.

644
00:32:39,548 --> 00:32:43,528
And I'm like, I'm a professional comedy writer.

645
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:45,848
I don't think you have to be worried about that.

646
00:32:45,848 --> 00:32:48,328
It was probably a very good thing that this happened.

647
00:32:48,348 --> 00:32:52,188
I find. And also the other story I tell all the time is when I

648
00:32:52,188 --> 00:32:56,528
when I finished my first movie that I'd ever met, there were jokes about

649
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:58,188
masturbating or something in it.

650
00:32:58,188 --> 00:33:01,608
And then she said, what would Father Loftus think if you saw this?

651
00:33:02,288 --> 00:33:03,828
I'm like, I don't think it's mom.

652
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:05,928
It's not for Father Loftus.

653
00:33:05,928 --> 00:33:11,388
So like, there's a lot of overprotective mom here in the group.

654
00:33:11,388 --> 00:33:14,468
But she was ready. I never could look at a clean book again.

655
00:33:15,168 --> 00:33:16,728
My mind was ravaged.

656
00:33:18,068 --> 00:33:25,388
Yeah. Now I got a podcast where I say crap and damn and I don't give a crap or a damn about it.

657
00:33:25,408 --> 00:33:29,148
Oh, and she would be horrified of the things you're going to say about ice skater.

658
00:33:29,148 --> 00:33:33,288
I'm going to tear into that crap ass ice skater.

659
00:33:33,288 --> 00:33:37,088
So dirty.

660
00:33:37,368 --> 00:33:43,268
But I was the you said dirty book and I was I the Mad Magazine is very funny

661
00:33:43,268 --> 00:33:44,608
because it's so harmless.

662
00:33:44,808 --> 00:33:46,988
Didn't mean pornography. She meant Mad Magazine.

663
00:33:47,168 --> 00:33:51,388
Yeah, I mean, I was thinking for an hour like, do you know Tijuana Bibles?

664
00:33:52,008 --> 00:33:54,548
No, those are like those were very popular

665
00:33:54,608 --> 00:33:57,328
at a certain point when like comic strips were at their height.

666
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:00,828
So it would be like Popeye nail in olive oil.

667
00:34:00,848 --> 00:34:03,828
It would be like dirty, dirty comic strips.

668
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:06,688
Those are actually dirty. Mad Magazine is so tame.

669
00:34:07,308 --> 00:34:10,048
Yeah. No one is not nailing anyone.

670
00:34:10,268 --> 00:34:12,928
It would be like you'd call Batman Bland Man.

671
00:34:12,928 --> 00:34:15,108
Yeah. Like it's so nothing.

672
00:34:15,348 --> 00:34:19,328
Yeah. I never got into Mad, but my mom didn't.

673
00:34:19,368 --> 00:34:20,368
She did not have a problem.

674
00:34:20,428 --> 00:34:22,208
I think she did buy me a Mad or two.

675
00:34:22,388 --> 00:34:23,308
It's never too late.

676
00:34:23,308 --> 00:34:24,588
It's a while. Check it out.

677
00:34:24,788 --> 00:34:28,168
But Archie, they make less of the issues now, but you can still go buy them.

678
00:34:28,688 --> 00:34:29,608
And sure. Yeah.

679
00:34:29,608 --> 00:34:30,528
Yeah. Get on Mad.

680
00:34:30,688 --> 00:34:34,068
So you're not under your mom's spell anymore.

681
00:34:34,068 --> 00:34:36,448
Only partially. That's not what she thinks.

682
00:34:37,448 --> 00:34:38,408
That's not how she operates.

683
00:34:39,988 --> 00:34:46,368
So we went I defied her in 2018 and we went to Blizzard Beach.

684
00:34:46,408 --> 00:34:48,968
And I was 34 years old.

685
00:34:48,968 --> 00:34:51,748
And I finally made it to Blizzard Beach,

686
00:34:51,748 --> 00:34:55,208
which because that I was so enamored with the pictures when it opened.

687
00:34:55,548 --> 00:34:57,488
And I finally was allowed to go.

688
00:34:58,268 --> 00:34:59,728
And I liked it.

689
00:34:59,808 --> 00:35:03,608
And luckily that Blizzard Beach is what I'm sure we'll talk about is stuck in the

690
00:35:03,608 --> 00:35:07,028
90s, baby, more so than almost any other.

691
00:35:07,248 --> 00:35:09,408
I mean, maybe I've got stuck in the 80s or whatever.

692
00:35:09,908 --> 00:35:17,568
But yeah, well, I associate this park with the Disney decade kind of about to

693
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:21,508
crest and crash like I because

694
00:35:21,508 --> 00:35:25,568
if you don't know this whole thing that Eisner declared in 1990,

695
00:35:25,588 --> 00:35:26,708
it's the Disney decade.

696
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:29,468
We're going to build so much shit in every one of these parks.

697
00:35:29,468 --> 00:35:34,148
And by the end of 2000, you won't believe how much we did, which is true because

698
00:35:34,148 --> 00:35:38,488
they did Animal Kingdom and by the multiple, multiple days they were expanding

699
00:35:38,488 --> 00:35:42,168
Disneyland a lot, but it really slowed down in the second half.

700
00:35:42,168 --> 00:35:46,428
And it really peaked in 1995 when it was in the early 90s.

701
00:35:46,428 --> 00:35:48,568
There was so much added to Disney World.

702
00:35:48,728 --> 00:35:51,348
And I remember this making me think, God, you're kidding.

703
00:35:51,488 --> 00:35:52,788
And there's a new water park.

704
00:35:53,028 --> 00:35:54,508
I think I hadn't heard the lead up.

705
00:35:54,648 --> 00:35:58,088
I maybe just like went and saw there's another water park.

706
00:35:58,128 --> 00:35:58,908
That's crazy.

707
00:35:59,368 --> 00:36:03,588
It just seemed like, God, they have like they're going so nuts here.

708
00:36:03,608 --> 00:36:06,488
And then it kind of stopped sort of right after this.

709
00:36:06,708 --> 00:36:11,208
So I do associate Blizzard Beach with like end of an era in a way.

710
00:36:11,408 --> 00:36:15,648
And a lot of those very 90s things were not updated for a very long time.

711
00:36:15,648 --> 00:36:18,308
Like Ellen's energy adventure, like

712
00:36:18,308 --> 00:36:22,408
in a venture's right, a lot of what happened in that very mid 90s.

713
00:36:22,408 --> 00:36:25,508
I feel like the spending freeze came not long after that.

714
00:36:25,508 --> 00:36:26,068
Yes.

715
00:36:26,348 --> 00:36:29,888
And it feels very much like another thing right around this time.

716
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:36,328
A big disagreement we had the 1996 Disney World anniversary cake castle.

717
00:36:36,328 --> 00:36:36,908
Oh, yeah.

718
00:36:37,068 --> 00:36:39,668
Which I think looks very corny.

719
00:36:39,728 --> 00:36:44,308
And I think Blizzard Beach is a little corny as well.

720
00:36:44,308 --> 00:36:44,728
It's a little.

721
00:36:45,248 --> 00:36:49,428
If I had to go to one today, I'd go to Typhoon Lagoon because it's a little more

722
00:36:49,428 --> 00:36:52,108
lush in the theming. I think Blizzard Beach is a little more blunt.

723
00:36:52,208 --> 00:36:53,228
Here's a big wall.

724
00:36:53,308 --> 00:36:56,408
There's a big, like, just flat surface of fake snow.

725
00:36:56,488 --> 00:36:59,048
Well, this type of thing, I don't think ages as well.

726
00:37:00,068 --> 00:37:01,328
Like it comes out of the gate hot.

727
00:37:01,368 --> 00:37:03,048
But then what else do you do with Blizzard Beach?

728
00:37:03,168 --> 00:37:05,948
Yeah. But I mean, I guess I just mean even like more of a style.

729
00:37:06,048 --> 00:37:09,148
Like the fake snow doesn't age well.

730
00:37:09,588 --> 00:37:11,588
Like a like fake rocks age wonderfully.

731
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,448
Fake snow, not so much.

732
00:37:13,448 --> 00:37:16,628
I feel like it's still it looks a little bit more tired.

733
00:37:16,648 --> 00:37:19,548
Not that it looks not that it was like that tired or anything when we went in

734
00:37:19,548 --> 00:37:25,708
2018, but it was like you can tell that this it just feels older.

735
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:26,928
It feels tired.

736
00:37:26,928 --> 00:37:29,588
It feels like the color scheme.

737
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:32,828
Also, I think I described in another episode is like a wild berry pop tart.

738
00:37:33,048 --> 00:37:36,728
Like it's just blue, bright blues and purples, which I like.

739
00:37:37,068 --> 00:37:39,048
But it's also stuck in time.

740
00:37:39,188 --> 00:37:40,648
By the way, I don't mean to sound negative.

741
00:37:40,648 --> 00:37:43,508
I do. I do like all this and I'd happily go to Blizzard Beach.

742
00:37:43,548 --> 00:37:46,748
Yeah, I like something about it is very frozen in time.

743
00:37:46,828 --> 00:37:49,948
The village, the little houses and stuff.

744
00:37:50,488 --> 00:37:55,008
I remember, look, water parks aren't traditionally known for their food.

745
00:37:55,108 --> 00:38:00,668
But I remember like one year I think we did go to both and going like, oh,

746
00:38:00,668 --> 00:38:03,008
the food's a lot better at Blizzard Beach.

747
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:06,088
Now it seems like it's kind of a whole lot of nothing.

748
00:38:07,048 --> 00:38:10,008
Yeah, we I mean, I the problem with

749
00:38:10,108 --> 00:38:13,648
my memory now is that we didn't have our phones because they were in a locker.

750
00:38:13,688 --> 00:38:17,488
So I don't have great pictures of everything we ate at Blizzard Beach,

751
00:38:17,488 --> 00:38:21,728
which wasn't much, but I'm trying to remember it was nothing special of

752
00:38:21,728 --> 00:38:25,488
I think probably right after my dad

753
00:38:25,488 --> 00:38:30,428
recovering from swallowing a gallon of pool water, going and eating a big

754
00:38:30,428 --> 00:38:34,168
meatball sub, so I bounce back from that drama pretty quickly,

755
00:38:35,308 --> 00:38:40,088
which I was reading reviews of Blizzard Beach stuff from a few years ago.

756
00:38:40,148 --> 00:38:41,068
And they're like, yeah.

757
00:38:41,108 --> 00:38:43,968
And then at this place, you can get like a jerk chicken sandwich,

758
00:38:44,028 --> 00:38:44,868
which is pretty good.

759
00:38:45,088 --> 00:38:47,888
They also have meatball subs and I'm like, they still have the meatballs.

760
00:38:48,088 --> 00:38:49,428
That's crazy to me.

761
00:38:49,428 --> 00:38:54,268
Now it seems like it's all been replaced by cold deli sandwiches and hamburgers.

762
00:38:54,268 --> 00:39:00,288
Yeah, which sort of in similar to also sort of product of the 90s Disney Quest.

763
00:39:01,028 --> 00:39:04,568
It like went down, like the food was a little more unique when it opened

764
00:39:04,568 --> 00:39:07,388
and then got sort of like, well, let's have food at all.

765
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:08,588
How about that's the bar?

766
00:39:08,908 --> 00:39:12,748
Is that though apparently there are many donuts are decent.

767
00:39:12,868 --> 00:39:13,788
That's what everyone says.

768
00:39:13,968 --> 00:39:19,248
We did not have those white chocolate and raspberry dipping sauce at both parts.

769
00:39:19,548 --> 00:39:22,668
Typhoon Lagoon, they have those two and apparently very good.

770
00:39:22,908 --> 00:39:24,148
Well, then this isn't unique to.

771
00:39:24,248 --> 00:39:25,388
Well, screw that then.

772
00:39:25,468 --> 00:39:30,068
Well, and also available at both parks is the the sandpail.

773
00:39:30,068 --> 00:39:31,588
Did you guys come across the sandpail?

774
00:39:31,788 --> 00:39:37,368
No, the sandpail is a childhood play bucket filled with ice cream

775
00:39:37,368 --> 00:39:39,148
and served with a shovel.

776
00:39:39,228 --> 00:39:41,388
And that's not what they that lifeguard threw at your dad.

777
00:39:41,428 --> 00:39:42,908
That is not what. No.

778
00:39:43,828 --> 00:39:47,108
The star of the show at Icee Expeditions is the sandpail.

779
00:39:47,388 --> 00:39:49,108
You get a bucket filled with chocolate

780
00:39:49,108 --> 00:39:53,128
and vanilla soft serve, top of waffle cone pieces, cookie pieces, sprinkles,

781
00:39:53,248 --> 00:39:55,988
hot fudge, caramel sauce, strawberry sauce, whipped cream and a cherry.

782
00:39:56,388 --> 00:39:57,168
Delightful.

783
00:39:58,068 --> 00:39:58,508
Delightful.

784
00:39:58,948 --> 00:39:59,868
Very nice picture, too.

785
00:39:59,968 --> 00:40:00,768
Bucket of ice cream.

786
00:40:01,088 --> 00:40:03,968
You did have I wish I had I wish I had documented this better.

787
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:08,288
I feel like my mindset wasn't as much of the theme park journalist last March as

788
00:40:08,288 --> 00:40:11,388
it is now. So I feel like I would have made sure to document the names of everything

789
00:40:11,388 --> 00:40:13,648
I got because I did drink at Blizzard Beach.

790
00:40:13,768 --> 00:40:17,868
Oh, you can get like you can get frozen cocktail stuff at Blizzard Beach.

791
00:40:18,148 --> 00:40:19,728
With funny names like the slides.

792
00:40:19,988 --> 00:40:22,108
I'm trying to remember if we should look.

793
00:40:22,248 --> 00:40:24,088
I couldn't find the names of.

794
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:24,748
Oh, shit.

795
00:40:25,368 --> 00:40:30,488
I started playing the music of Eric Blas Zach at Disney's Blizzard Beach YouTube

796
00:40:30,488 --> 00:40:31,848
channel. What's that?

797
00:40:32,088 --> 00:40:35,208
It's the like ambient music, which I guess now that I'm playing it,

798
00:40:35,208 --> 00:40:36,408
I'll just play it for you.

799
00:40:36,728 --> 00:40:37,348
I guess I'll play it.

800
00:40:37,588 --> 00:40:39,168
Let's let the audience in on it.

801
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:40,148
Walk around music.

802
00:40:41,448 --> 00:40:42,668
I did like the sound of that.

803
00:40:42,788 --> 00:40:45,708
I was going to say I was saving this for later because it's like this is a Scott

804
00:40:45,708 --> 00:40:47,328
fever dream. Here we go.

805
00:40:53,928 --> 00:40:55,208
Wait a minute, it picks up.

806
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:00,552
I think it does.

807
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:08,708
That was the fixer.

808
00:41:08,808 --> 00:41:09,388
There it is.

809
00:41:09,648 --> 00:41:10,588
Now we're rocking.

810
00:41:12,088 --> 00:41:13,968
See, I don't know.

811
00:41:14,168 --> 00:41:16,448
That to me, that's like a midi to me.

812
00:41:16,448 --> 00:41:17,388
Yeah, I guess you're right.

813
00:41:17,388 --> 00:41:18,048
It's not a synth beat.

814
00:41:18,048 --> 00:41:19,068
It's not the better, I feel bad

815
00:41:19,068 --> 00:41:20,868
because you named the man who did it,

816
00:41:20,868 --> 00:41:23,548
but it's no Larry Carle and Bubble Shuffle.

817
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:25,968
That's a little cheese ball,

818
00:41:26,188 --> 00:41:28,928
and that was like Mario Paint music.

819
00:41:29,468 --> 00:41:31,208
That, I like the Mario Paint music.

820
00:41:31,228 --> 00:41:33,928
There would be a masterpiece if you made that in Mario Paint.

821
00:41:34,288 --> 00:41:34,708
Yeah, yeah, I mean, yeah.

822
00:41:34,708 --> 00:41:36,368
Yeah, I still like, no, it's not as good

823
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:38,308
as the Tomorrowland loops or anything, for sure.

824
00:41:38,488 --> 00:41:41,928
I also like imagining like when they would have made that,

825
00:41:42,788 --> 00:41:46,888
how souped up the computer at the time would have been,

826
00:41:47,548 --> 00:41:50,408
like just to get that sound,

827
00:41:50,588 --> 00:41:52,468
and how we'd hear about that,

828
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:55,528
and it's like, oh, one gigabyte of memory, fuck off.

829
00:41:55,828 --> 00:41:56,928
Like garbage.

830
00:41:57,388 --> 00:41:58,568
Whatever gateway computer they used.

831
00:41:59,008 --> 00:42:00,408
All right, I was trying to figure out

832
00:42:00,408 --> 00:42:02,008
if we could figure out the cocktail names.

833
00:42:02,988 --> 00:42:03,748
I'll look them up.

834
00:42:03,748 --> 00:42:04,768
We'll see when we find it.

835
00:42:05,008 --> 00:42:08,068
So how did it land, the park land

836
00:42:08,068 --> 00:42:09,608
next to how you'd built it up?

837
00:42:09,868 --> 00:42:11,408
Do you regret not going as a child?

838
00:42:11,508 --> 00:42:13,068
Yeah, yeah, I would have loved it as a child.

839
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:14,648
I did really like it.

840
00:42:14,648 --> 00:42:17,768
We just had limited time there.

841
00:42:17,768 --> 00:42:20,928
I forget how many days we did that trip, seven maybe?

842
00:42:21,668 --> 00:42:23,168
So we were trying to do something,

843
00:42:23,488 --> 00:42:25,308
well, seven total with Universal as well.

844
00:42:25,828 --> 00:42:27,068
Oh, that's a lot, yeah, yeah.

845
00:42:27,068 --> 00:42:28,888
So it's a lot, and, oh no, was it eight?

846
00:42:28,908 --> 00:42:30,268
It might have been eight, I can't remember.

847
00:42:30,968 --> 00:42:32,688
That's something my dad remembered.

848
00:42:32,688 --> 00:42:35,808
He's like, yeah, we would occasionally go to the water parks

849
00:42:35,808 --> 00:42:38,268
if we were down there for more than five days,

850
00:42:38,268 --> 00:42:41,048
but it just seemed like too much to cram into

851
00:42:41,048 --> 00:42:43,828
with the Disney, four Disney parks,

852
00:42:44,008 --> 00:42:45,788
because Animal Kingdom would have just opened

853
00:42:45,788 --> 00:42:47,388
around the time of Blizzard Beach.

854
00:42:47,388 --> 00:42:50,648
And if you were gonna pop over to Universal for a day,

855
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:54,288
we didn't start staying until well into the 2000s

856
00:42:54,288 --> 00:42:56,088
staying on site at Universal for part of the trip.

857
00:42:56,108 --> 00:42:59,568
Well, I think it's a, I think the water parks in general

858
00:42:59,568 --> 00:43:01,768
are more for, that makes sense,

859
00:43:01,768 --> 00:43:03,428
that you might have gone more often

860
00:43:03,428 --> 00:43:04,808
because you're on the East Coast.

861
00:43:05,088 --> 00:43:07,128
I think if you're in Florida or Georgia

862
00:43:07,128 --> 00:43:09,508
and you go to Disney World once or twice a year,

863
00:43:09,948 --> 00:43:11,168
sure do water parks.

864
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:13,808
Tougher for me, coming from California,

865
00:43:14,068 --> 00:43:16,148
and my parents, we'd probably tie it into another trip,

866
00:43:16,328 --> 00:43:18,608
like we'd drive up the coast and see other stuff.

867
00:43:18,948 --> 00:43:22,588
So hard to fit water parks, although we did in 1999, so.

868
00:43:22,828 --> 00:43:24,408
I mean, I think, yeah, once-

869
00:43:24,408 --> 00:43:26,248
And I loved Typhoon Lagoon also, Grunt.

870
00:43:26,508 --> 00:43:28,788
Like we did, I think we spent a pretty significant day

871
00:43:28,788 --> 00:43:29,748
at Typhoon Lagoon.

872
00:43:29,748 --> 00:43:31,608
I went there twice and I loved that.

873
00:43:31,848 --> 00:43:33,648
When the three of us go to Orlando

874
00:43:33,648 --> 00:43:36,008
in the next nine to 12 months,

875
00:43:36,108 --> 00:43:38,228
we will do some water park,

876
00:43:38,228 --> 00:43:40,128
because I haven't been to Typhoon Lagoon.

877
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:43,108
Or if I ever, oh man, that's a weird memory.

878
00:43:43,268 --> 00:43:45,908
Have I ever been to Typhoon Lagoon?

879
00:43:45,968 --> 00:43:47,308
Wow. I think I have.

880
00:43:48,128 --> 00:43:48,728
Typhoon Lagoon? I think I went there,

881
00:43:48,848 --> 00:43:49,728
I think I went when I was 18,

882
00:43:49,768 --> 00:43:51,128
and my mom was not as worried about that

883
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:51,788
because it didn't have,

884
00:43:51,988 --> 00:43:53,528
my mom really thought that that slide

885
00:43:53,528 --> 00:43:55,408
at the top of Blizzard Beach I think was real.

886
00:43:56,088 --> 00:43:57,168
I think this is where it starts.

887
00:43:57,168 --> 00:43:58,808
I think the drop slide

888
00:43:58,808 --> 00:44:00,868
where it looks like you're gonna shoot off,

889
00:44:00,868 --> 00:44:02,268
I think she thought that was real.

890
00:44:02,268 --> 00:44:03,968
It's kind of like a fake ramp.

891
00:44:04,128 --> 00:44:04,408
Yes.

892
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:06,748
As if you're gonna shoot off skis

893
00:44:06,748 --> 00:44:10,168
and get air time, the kind of thing Goofy would go,

894
00:44:10,328 --> 00:44:12,928
wah-ha-ha-hoey, that's my mellow,

895
00:44:13,068 --> 00:44:14,668
I'm only half committing to the Goofy.

896
00:44:14,668 --> 00:44:15,068
That's fair.

897
00:44:15,548 --> 00:44:17,248
This is Summit Plummet.

898
00:44:17,608 --> 00:44:18,648
Summit Plummet is what we're talking about.

899
00:44:18,648 --> 00:44:21,268
The main attraction in Blizzard Beach.

900
00:44:22,248 --> 00:44:24,908
I never did, I have very,

901
00:44:25,888 --> 00:44:27,848
very strong boundaries with watered slides.

902
00:44:27,848 --> 00:44:31,088
If it's tube-based, I am fine.

903
00:44:31,248 --> 00:44:33,348
I do not like the ones that are like

904
00:44:33,348 --> 00:44:34,428
almost 90 degrees straight.

905
00:44:34,508 --> 00:44:35,848
I do not like the speed slides.

906
00:44:36,068 --> 00:44:37,468
I don't either, and I will,

907
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,228
I mean that's no surprise I guess to anybody,

908
00:44:39,288 --> 00:44:43,268
but I really, I understand the kinds of coasters

909
00:44:43,268 --> 00:44:45,528
and drop rides that I don't really go on.

910
00:44:45,728 --> 00:44:47,888
These I don't really see the appeal of.

911
00:44:47,888 --> 00:44:49,768
I feel like you can get hurt very easily,

912
00:44:49,768 --> 00:44:52,068
you can get skinned very easily.

913
00:44:53,528 --> 00:44:53,968
Ooh.

914
00:44:53,168 --> 00:44:55,528
I imagine, I don't know.

915
00:44:55,548 --> 00:44:57,348
I agree with both of those sentiments.

916
00:44:57,508 --> 00:44:59,208
I've never been on one of these giant drop slides,

917
00:44:59,248 --> 00:45:01,748
but I will pledge to the two of you,

918
00:45:01,848 --> 00:45:03,408
if we all go to Blizzard Beach,

919
00:45:03,808 --> 00:45:05,448
I will go on the Summit Plummet.

920
00:45:05,488 --> 00:45:07,688
I will try it, but I've never gone on one of these

921
00:45:07,688 --> 00:45:09,008
crazy things before because they scare me.

922
00:45:09,328 --> 00:45:11,748
I hear the wait times are also awful for it.

923
00:45:11,928 --> 00:45:13,588
All right, well if there's a person we can find

924
00:45:13,588 --> 00:45:16,128
that works at Blizzard Beach that will let us cut the line,

925
00:45:16,428 --> 00:45:18,828
Jason and I have both apparently pledged.

926
00:45:18,828 --> 00:45:21,808
But my memories of the other rides

927
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:25,168
at Blizzard Beach, and this can lead us in

928
00:45:25,168 --> 00:45:28,968
because we kind of got sidetracked with personal anecdotes

929
00:45:28,968 --> 00:45:33,468
into the kayfabe story of Blizzard Beach.

930
00:45:33,628 --> 00:45:35,908
But a lot of the slides at Blizzard Beach

931
00:45:35,908 --> 00:45:38,788
were mat-based or racing-based,

932
00:45:38,848 --> 00:45:40,288
which I thought was fun as a kid.

933
00:45:40,288 --> 00:45:41,808
Yes, that is a fun element.

934
00:45:41,928 --> 00:45:44,848
Which apparently, here to do the regular story,

935
00:45:45,428 --> 00:45:48,908
apparently when Disney had, this part was very,

936
00:45:48,908 --> 00:45:52,008
like came out of market research,

937
00:45:52,928 --> 00:45:55,648
we have two water parks,

938
00:45:55,888 --> 00:45:57,628
but we want to relieve pressure on them.

939
00:45:57,628 --> 00:45:59,268
We want to get them a little less crowded.

940
00:46:00,168 --> 00:46:02,168
And what can we do if we built a new one

941
00:46:02,168 --> 00:46:03,548
that the other ones don't have?

942
00:46:03,988 --> 00:46:06,568
And competitive slides was a big one.

943
00:46:07,788 --> 00:46:09,668
And I think there was a desire to do a little,

944
00:46:09,968 --> 00:46:12,868
to make it very different and do a very different theme.

945
00:46:14,468 --> 00:46:18,468
I think it was being plotted when the 1992

946
00:46:18,468 --> 00:46:20,528
Winter Olympics were going on.

947
00:46:20,968 --> 00:46:23,148
So an engineer was watching the Olympics and went,

948
00:46:23,268 --> 00:46:25,648
oh my God, there it is, winter in Florida.

949
00:46:27,248 --> 00:46:29,948
But that was not the full story,

950
00:46:30,308 --> 00:46:33,468
which is a lot of fun.

951
00:46:33,588 --> 00:46:34,428
I like the full.

952
00:46:34,548 --> 00:46:37,348
The full story is a blast and features

953
00:46:37,348 --> 00:46:40,108
one of my favorite park-exclusive characters.

954
00:46:41,408 --> 00:46:42,568
Which is?

955
00:46:43,068 --> 00:46:43,588
The ice skater.

956
00:46:43,768 --> 00:46:44,848
The ice skater.

957
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:46,708
He's real, he's my friend.

958
00:46:48,528 --> 00:46:50,228
Okay, well let's tell the story

959
00:46:50,228 --> 00:46:53,108
in order to give the context to ice skater.

960
00:46:53,408 --> 00:46:55,188
I have in front of me, but I'm not dying

961
00:46:55,188 --> 00:46:56,988
to just read the story.

962
00:46:57,288 --> 00:46:59,028
But here, let's just cliff notes and stop me

963
00:46:59,028 --> 00:47:00,548
at whatever part you want to say.

964
00:47:01,428 --> 00:47:04,168
One balmy day, a freak winter storm developed

965
00:47:04,168 --> 00:47:05,808
over the western end of Walt Disney World

966
00:47:05,808 --> 00:47:07,848
and covered the area in a thick blanket

967
00:47:07,848 --> 00:47:09,248
of powdery white snow.

968
00:47:09,488 --> 00:47:11,108
Before you could say hot cocoa,

969
00:47:11,408 --> 00:47:14,228
plans were underway for Florida's first ski resort.

970
00:47:14,468 --> 00:47:16,408
So sudden freak snowstorm out of nowhere

971
00:47:16,408 --> 00:47:17,428
in Florida, why?

972
00:47:17,788 --> 00:47:19,388
We gotta capitalize on it.

973
00:47:19,568 --> 00:47:20,708
Ski lifts were put up.

974
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:22,528
Toboggan runs were laid down.

975
00:47:22,608 --> 00:47:24,468
And an entire resort area blossomed

976
00:47:24,468 --> 00:47:25,508
around the mountain of snow.

977
00:47:26,148 --> 00:47:28,788
But before the first skier could strap on a pair of boots,

978
00:47:29,468 --> 00:47:31,888
the temperatures returned to their normal Florida levels

979
00:47:31,888 --> 00:47:35,288
and the powdery snow quickly turned into slippery slush.

980
00:47:36,308 --> 00:47:39,188
So as you said, water melting,

981
00:47:39,848 --> 00:47:41,288
the snow did not work out.

982
00:47:41,388 --> 00:47:44,448
They were going to have to foreclose this entire thing

983
00:47:44,448 --> 00:47:46,308
or it'll get filled up with vultures

984
00:47:46,308 --> 00:47:48,088
like the zoo at Disney World.

985
00:47:49,368 --> 00:47:51,428
But before you knew it,

986
00:47:51,848 --> 00:47:53,768
it doesn't say this,

987
00:47:53,888 --> 00:47:56,328
but I imagine the wrecking balls are coming.

988
00:47:56,648 --> 00:47:58,308
They're going to start tearing it down.

989
00:47:58,528 --> 00:48:00,848
They start swinging the first wrecking ball back.

990
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:02,868
And then what do they hear?

991
00:48:03,068 --> 00:48:04,668
Jason, do you want to take it from here?

992
00:48:05,028 --> 00:48:06,608
Tell the tale of your beloved.

993
00:48:07,308 --> 00:48:09,148
Well, they hear,

994
00:48:10,168 --> 00:48:11,968
I do not have that exact-

995
00:48:11,968 --> 00:48:12,208
You don't?

996
00:48:12,828 --> 00:48:15,808
They hear like a wahoo, right?

997
00:48:15,988 --> 00:48:17,768
Like they hear the cheers-

998
00:48:17,768 --> 00:48:19,948
A wahoo as Goofy would do.

999
00:48:20,388 --> 00:48:24,388
Yeah, and coming, careening down the mountain

1000
00:48:24,388 --> 00:48:29,288
is an alligator with skis who crashes

1001
00:48:29,288 --> 00:48:33,588
right into the main building of the little village.

1002
00:48:33,688 --> 00:48:37,068
Leaving a gator sized hole complete with skis

1003
00:48:37,068 --> 00:48:38,388
right in the logs.

1004
00:48:39,348 --> 00:48:42,308
And now, wait a minute, what's all this about?

1005
00:48:42,448 --> 00:48:44,968
First of all, this critter's been living here

1006
00:48:44,968 --> 00:48:46,528
and we didn't know about it.

1007
00:48:46,568 --> 00:48:50,788
And secondly, I see now the fun can be

1008
00:48:50,788 --> 00:48:54,568
that as it all melts away for decades and decades

1009
00:48:54,568 --> 00:48:55,728
and decades, apparently.

1010
00:48:56,568 --> 00:48:57,848
Yeah, it all very slowly melts away

1011
00:48:57,848 --> 00:49:01,288
and people can ride all the slides down the base

1012
00:49:01,288 --> 00:49:01,868
of the hill.

1013
00:49:02,148 --> 00:49:04,768
And that is, it is not a ski resort, it's a water park.

1014
00:49:05,228 --> 00:49:05,348
Right.

1015
00:49:05,348 --> 00:49:09,088
Is it, is the actual narrative of the land

1016
00:49:09,088 --> 00:49:12,268
that were sort of stuck in the maybe month period

1017
00:49:12,268 --> 00:49:13,628
after the thaw?

1018
00:49:13,988 --> 00:49:15,208
Oh, maybe that, yeah.

1019
00:49:15,328 --> 00:49:17,508
Well, which is why it still feels like the 90s.

1020
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:19,288
Yeah, so you can't update it.

1021
00:49:19,288 --> 00:49:22,508
And that's why the snowman tourists taking a picture

1022
00:49:22,508 --> 00:49:24,548
having fun at the park entrance.

1023
00:49:24,768 --> 00:49:25,868
That's adorable.

1024
00:49:26,148 --> 00:49:31,088
What you're showing is like a very rotund snowman family

1025
00:49:31,088 --> 00:49:35,088
with some like hats and dresses and shirts

1026
00:49:35,088 --> 00:49:35,808
and cameras.

1027
00:49:35,948 --> 00:49:37,608
And it's kind of, you can't really see it

1028
00:49:37,608 --> 00:49:39,648
but I saw a video, it's kind of a fountain

1029
00:49:39,648 --> 00:49:41,608
as if to imply they're melting.

1030
00:49:41,888 --> 00:49:43,488
That's a little more macabre.

1031
00:49:43,568 --> 00:49:44,408
The family is dying.

1032
00:49:44,808 --> 00:49:46,728
We're watching this cute family die with,

1033
00:49:47,008 --> 00:49:50,388
and including a little boy snowman with mouse ears

1034
00:49:50,388 --> 00:49:51,368
that says Button.

1035
00:49:51,648 --> 00:49:52,508
His name is Button.

1036
00:49:52,868 --> 00:49:56,468
These are, you talk about obscure park characters,

1037
00:49:56,568 --> 00:50:00,088
some of the most obscure ever part of Blizzard Beach.

1038
00:50:00,608 --> 00:50:04,168
Button the snowman, though I'm immediately fond of him

1039
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:06,928
and I hope we stay in this month forever

1040
00:50:06,928 --> 00:50:07,948
and that he never dies.

1041
00:50:08,288 --> 00:50:11,028
But that being said, Ice Gator who kicked it all off.

1042
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:14,908
Now he hangs around and stays in Blizzard Beach

1043
00:50:14,908 --> 00:50:16,388
and there's a walk around of him

1044
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:18,608
and he exists on merch and everything.

1045
00:50:19,508 --> 00:50:22,228
And I agree, I think he's fun.

1046
00:50:22,588 --> 00:50:24,288
And I like that there's a character

1047
00:50:24,288 --> 00:50:27,808
for only this one water park, that's delightful.

1048
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:30,248
But I'm curious Jason, for you to flesh out

1049
00:50:30,248 --> 00:50:32,388
what is the reason to love Ice Gator?

1050
00:50:32,548 --> 00:50:35,268
I just like that he's smiling all the time.

1051
00:50:35,268 --> 00:50:37,108
He's having the time of his life.

1052
00:50:37,608 --> 00:50:40,648
I do like that color, blue has always been my favorite color.

1053
00:50:40,748 --> 00:50:41,768
So I like that color.

1054
00:50:41,848 --> 00:50:43,228
Blue alligator, yeah, that's fun.

1055
00:50:43,348 --> 00:50:47,548
I also like that he has a counterpart at Typhoon Lagoon.

1056
00:50:47,928 --> 00:50:52,328
The much less interesting name of Lagoonigator,

1057
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:56,188
which I'm assuming would have had to come

1058
00:50:56,188 --> 00:50:57,808
after Ice Gator, right?

1059
00:50:58,088 --> 00:51:00,948
Like they must have reconned Lagoonigator.

1060
00:51:01,108 --> 00:51:02,048
That's a good question.

1061
00:51:02,928 --> 00:51:06,188
You know, merch was really good out the gate.

1062
00:51:06,328 --> 00:51:09,008
So they wanted to bring that to a...

1063
00:51:09,008 --> 00:51:14,188
Very good, the Lagoonigator, well, the Ice Gator

1064
00:51:14,188 --> 00:51:17,088
and to a lesser extent, the Lagoonigator Park Stars

1065
00:51:17,088 --> 00:51:19,568
are good little vinyl toys.

1066
00:51:20,208 --> 00:51:21,448
There was a Lagoonigator Park Star?

1067
00:51:22,248 --> 00:51:23,028
I believe so, yeah.

1068
00:51:23,188 --> 00:51:23,468
Really?

1069
00:51:23,528 --> 00:51:24,368
Do I not have you?

1070
00:51:24,368 --> 00:51:25,868
No, I think you have it.

1071
00:51:25,968 --> 00:51:26,508
Oh no.

1072
00:51:26,608 --> 00:51:28,328
But the Ice Gator one looks great.

1073
00:51:28,548 --> 00:51:30,248
You gotta have Ice Gator for sure.

1074
00:51:31,428 --> 00:51:32,348
Lagoonigator Park Star.

1075
00:51:32,708 --> 00:51:36,108
Your mom told you if there's a second alligator Park Star,

1076
00:51:36,328 --> 00:51:37,568
do not buy it, it's wasteful.

1077
00:51:37,588 --> 00:51:38,388
Oh, you're right.

1078
00:51:38,528 --> 00:51:40,808
Oh, I didn't even realize that was Lagoonigator.

1079
00:51:41,048 --> 00:51:43,448
I think I had thought that that was part of Blizzard Beach,

1080
00:51:43,448 --> 00:51:45,988
but you're right, I have Lagoonigator, the Park Star.

1081
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:46,468
Yeah.

1082
00:51:46,468 --> 00:51:48,428
You have a toy of this and you had no idea.

1083
00:51:48,608 --> 00:51:49,608
Gee whiz, Michael.

1084
00:51:49,688 --> 00:51:50,848
Wow, what a life.

1085
00:51:53,228 --> 00:51:58,688
Now, in addition to Ice Gator's general existence

1086
00:51:58,688 --> 00:52:02,548
in the park, you can also visit his home,

1087
00:52:02,948 --> 00:52:05,308
which is along the Lazy River path.

1088
00:52:06,268 --> 00:52:07,048
Do you know this?

1089
00:52:08,548 --> 00:52:13,228
Okay, so yeah, along the Lazy River, there's a cabin,

1090
00:52:13,468 --> 00:52:16,088
and evidently it's where Ice Gator lives.

1091
00:52:16,088 --> 00:52:16,588
Oh yeah.

1092
00:52:17,228 --> 00:52:21,328
And I think you typically, if you pass by,

1093
00:52:21,468 --> 00:52:22,728
can hear him snoring.

1094
00:52:22,968 --> 00:52:26,828
He's taking a nap in there, but every once in a while,

1095
00:52:27,548 --> 00:52:30,968
there is a, he winds up for a sneeze,

1096
00:52:31,508 --> 00:52:34,868
and then the chimney of the cabin blows its top,

1097
00:52:35,248 --> 00:52:38,268
and a bunch of water shoots out with a huge achoo,

1098
00:52:38,648 --> 00:52:42,648
and sprays all over you, passing by in the Lazy River.

1099
00:52:42,728 --> 00:52:46,048
I wish they did that for Mike Fink's cabin

1100
00:52:46,048 --> 00:52:47,988
on the Rivers of America.

1101
00:52:48,148 --> 00:52:49,088
That Mike Fink would sneeze?

1102
00:52:49,348 --> 00:52:51,848
Yeah, Mike Fink would sneeze and water would shoot out.

1103
00:52:51,908 --> 00:52:53,508
Well again, let's add it to the list

1104
00:52:53,508 --> 00:52:54,828
of what we want the articulated

1105
00:52:54,828 --> 00:52:56,688
Disney-suited characters to do.

1106
00:52:57,048 --> 00:53:01,348
Like what an honor if Donald sneezed at you.

1107
00:53:01,448 --> 00:53:02,248
Mm-hmm.

1108
00:53:02,588 --> 00:53:03,688
With an actual wet sneeze.

1109
00:53:03,688 --> 00:53:05,268
Yeah, that would be great.

1110
00:53:05,908 --> 00:53:09,768
And like Donald, his can smell like breadcrumbs.

1111
00:53:10,568 --> 00:53:14,608
Mike Fink's can smell like a fatback in Hardtack.

1112
00:53:15,048 --> 00:53:17,568
Like let's get some sense in there too.

1113
00:53:17,808 --> 00:53:18,988
The smellerizer.

1114
00:53:19,348 --> 00:53:19,948
The sneezing.

1115
00:53:19,948 --> 00:53:20,228
Yeah.

1116
00:53:20,688 --> 00:53:23,668
The most time we spent was in the Lazy River.

1117
00:53:23,688 --> 00:53:26,108
I love the Lazy River.

1118
00:53:26,128 --> 00:53:27,068
I'm a big fan, absolutely.

1119
00:53:27,328 --> 00:53:30,148
So we went by Ice Gator's house a few times,

1120
00:53:30,188 --> 00:53:31,888
and he sneezed on us multiple times.

1121
00:53:32,168 --> 00:53:33,208
What a blast.

1122
00:53:33,208 --> 00:53:34,108
What an honor and a blast.

1123
00:53:34,108 --> 00:53:36,088
That's really odd to present.

1124
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:37,488
Yeah, that you're getting snot on you?

1125
00:53:37,808 --> 00:53:37,948
Yeah.

1126
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:38,708
Yeah, yeah.

1127
00:53:39,108 --> 00:53:40,268
Alligator snot?

1128
00:53:40,388 --> 00:53:41,108
Alligator snot.

1129
00:53:41,388 --> 00:53:43,608
Well, yeah, Maggie, on Simpson's ride,

1130
00:53:44,688 --> 00:53:45,608
she, what does she sneeze on you?

1131
00:53:45,608 --> 00:53:46,668
That smells like baby powder.

1132
00:53:46,908 --> 00:53:48,628
She puts you in her mouth.

1133
00:53:48,828 --> 00:53:50,468
Yeah, but doesn't somebody sneeze on you?

1134
00:53:50,548 --> 00:53:52,408
Or I'm thinking of Honey I Shrunk the audience.

1135
00:53:52,608 --> 00:53:53,708
I think there's a dog or something.

1136
00:53:53,708 --> 00:53:54,048
The dog sneezes, yeah.

1137
00:53:54,048 --> 00:53:55,128
The dog sneezes, that's right.

1138
00:53:55,128 --> 00:53:56,168
The thing is about Maggie too,

1139
00:53:56,248 --> 00:53:58,848
the Simpsons are anti-vaxxers.

1140
00:53:58,848 --> 00:53:58,928
No.

1141
00:53:58,928 --> 00:54:01,128
So when you end up in Maggie's mouth.

1142
00:54:02,708 --> 00:54:03,288
Oh man.

1143
00:54:03,308 --> 00:54:04,988
Get ready for shingles.

1144
00:54:05,428 --> 00:54:06,748
You've had the chickenpox, right?

1145
00:54:06,908 --> 00:54:07,588
I have, yeah.

1146
00:54:07,668 --> 00:54:09,448
Okay, so it's shingles for you then.

1147
00:54:09,468 --> 00:54:10,388
It's a vaccine though.

1148
00:54:10,528 --> 00:54:11,768
You moved down the list.

1149
00:54:11,768 --> 00:54:12,668
There is a vaccine, yeah.

1150
00:54:12,668 --> 00:54:13,348
It's a shingles vaccine.

1151
00:54:13,988 --> 00:54:17,228
I also, I have a, I don't know where I got this,

1152
00:54:17,228 --> 00:54:19,028
but in my Ice Gator list of notes,

1153
00:54:19,028 --> 00:54:21,868
it says Ice Gator has an unnamed niece.

1154
00:54:22,428 --> 00:54:24,028
Why do I know that?

1155
00:54:24,028 --> 00:54:24,368
Where is that?

1156
00:54:25,468 --> 00:54:27,508
Why would he have a, why a niece?

1157
00:54:27,528 --> 00:54:29,108
Does she walk around too?

1158
00:54:29,228 --> 00:54:33,788
I feel like there was a female Ice Gator maybe.

1159
00:54:33,788 --> 00:54:35,488
In my head, I can kind of picture.

1160
00:54:35,488 --> 00:54:37,248
So if there was a female, and was she little?

1161
00:54:37,768 --> 00:54:39,368
Yeah, she might've been a littler.

1162
00:54:39,728 --> 00:54:41,708
So it's his niece.

1163
00:54:41,828 --> 00:54:42,288
It's his niece.

1164
00:54:42,388 --> 00:54:43,228
Where's her parents?

1165
00:54:43,508 --> 00:54:44,788
He's like a mountain bug.

1166
00:54:44,788 --> 00:54:47,388
He's like the beach bums that spring up

1167
00:54:47,388 --> 00:54:49,348
in like Big Bear or Mammoth.

1168
00:54:49,808 --> 00:54:52,168
Oh, and you don't want that guy raising a kid.

1169
00:54:52,268 --> 00:54:53,488
He was up early.

1170
00:54:53,828 --> 00:54:57,068
Yeah, but you let the kids visit and have a little fun.

1171
00:54:57,548 --> 00:54:58,748
But he's taking a nap,

1172
00:54:59,048 --> 00:55:01,368
because the pallet is freshest in the morning

1173
00:55:01,368 --> 00:55:02,608
when it's still a little chilly.

1174
00:55:03,168 --> 00:55:03,388
Yeah, he woke up super early.

1175
00:55:03,608 --> 00:55:05,608
Yeah, yeah, takes a nap, chills out through the night.

1176
00:55:06,748 --> 00:55:11,168
Here's what I was imagining also with Ice Gator.

1177
00:55:12,028 --> 00:55:13,468
And again, I hope with this podcast,

1178
00:55:13,568 --> 00:55:15,268
can always do a service, shining a light on that.

1179
00:55:15,428 --> 00:55:18,668
There is a Disney, there's this fandom for Disney properties

1180
00:55:18,668 --> 00:55:20,708
that you don't even know about,

1181
00:55:20,708 --> 00:55:23,588
and that they don't even realize have a following.

1182
00:55:24,428 --> 00:55:26,228
And with their incredible hunger

1183
00:55:26,228 --> 00:55:29,048
for getting things out of their IP,

1184
00:55:29,568 --> 00:55:32,588
I would like to see the Dumbo style,

1185
00:55:32,868 --> 00:55:36,308
the pseudo live action Ice Gator film

1186
00:55:36,308 --> 00:55:37,828
within the next five years.

1187
00:55:37,948 --> 00:55:38,728
Tim Burton directed?

1188
00:55:39,068 --> 00:55:39,848
Sure, I was gonna say,

1189
00:55:39,848 --> 00:55:41,128
well, he's gonna get a taste for it

1190
00:55:41,128 --> 00:55:42,468
after the mega success of Dumbo.

1191
00:55:42,548 --> 00:55:44,448
So they'll wanna sign him up ASAP.

1192
00:55:44,548 --> 00:55:47,728
I will accept the John Favreau, but if Tim is available,

1193
00:55:48,008 --> 00:55:49,688
let's see if he can do it.

1194
00:55:49,788 --> 00:55:54,128
But I was imagining the, I mean, like, you know,

1195
00:55:54,228 --> 00:55:55,528
look, Dumbo's a pretty thin plot.

1196
00:55:55,588 --> 00:55:56,768
Dumbo's a very short movie.

1197
00:55:57,008 --> 00:55:57,548
Very short, yeah.

1198
00:55:57,748 --> 00:55:59,568
With human characters, they're fleshing that out

1199
00:55:59,568 --> 00:56:01,328
into a much bigger thing.

1200
00:56:01,588 --> 00:56:04,608
Can you tell the 90-minute story of the Gator

1201
00:56:04,608 --> 00:56:09,388
who wants to race a melting ice slope down a hill

1202
00:56:09,388 --> 00:56:10,568
and crash into a wall?

1203
00:56:10,748 --> 00:56:12,188
I think we can pad that out. Sure, yeah.

1204
00:56:12,188 --> 00:56:13,608
I think that could be a bigger thing.

1205
00:56:13,768 --> 00:56:14,848
And I wrote down just the,

1206
00:56:15,048 --> 00:56:16,108
the rest of it doesn't matter,

1207
00:56:16,368 --> 00:56:18,688
but for sure, the trailer with the beat

1208
00:56:18,688 --> 00:56:21,008
of like a little British girl saying,

1209
00:56:21,228 --> 00:56:24,068
you're different, you were meant for more than this.

1210
00:56:24,468 --> 00:56:28,608
And then like an Imagine Dragons song, like a B-rate,

1211
00:56:29,368 --> 00:56:30,268
like something they, like it's something

1212
00:56:30,268 --> 00:56:31,708
they wouldn't put on an album.

1213
00:56:32,108 --> 00:56:36,988
And Imagine Dragons demo then plays this summer.

1214
00:56:38,568 --> 00:56:39,308
Dream of ice. Reverb the drums,

1215
00:56:39,348 --> 00:56:41,708
the reverb cranked all the way up on the drums

1216
00:56:41,708 --> 00:56:43,308
and there's like a timpani or something.

1217
00:56:43,308 --> 00:56:44,128
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1218
00:56:44,128 --> 00:56:45,828
Not timpani. I think we get Ryan Reynolds

1219
00:56:45,828 --> 00:56:49,448
to do that ski and alligator beach bum voice.

1220
00:56:49,708 --> 00:56:51,088
Oh no, Ryan Reynolds.

1221
00:56:51,348 --> 00:56:53,248
Inspired by Detective Pikachu,

1222
00:56:53,688 --> 00:56:55,708
Disney's like, well, we want a Ryan Reynolds voice.

1223
00:56:56,068 --> 00:56:57,988
You're right. He's a wisecracker.

1224
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:00,628
He's not an inspiring like Dumbo.

1225
00:57:00,748 --> 00:57:03,848
But I think there's something inspiring beats.

1226
00:57:04,108 --> 00:57:05,448
I think he's like wisecracking.

1227
00:57:05,448 --> 00:57:06,828
And then he knows that like,

1228
00:57:06,888 --> 00:57:09,048
not everything's a joke ice skater.

1229
00:57:09,048 --> 00:57:12,448
What are we gonna do now that the mountain closed?

1230
00:57:12,628 --> 00:57:14,428
Well, and he probably can be concerned.

1231
00:57:14,428 --> 00:57:16,868
He's having a blast of a winter in summer.

1232
00:57:16,948 --> 00:57:20,028
But then when he sees his snowmen friends,

1233
00:57:20,208 --> 00:57:23,128
his snowman friend, Button, he needs to say Button.

1234
00:57:23,568 --> 00:57:25,748
Button, the melting snowman is the heart of the story.

1235
00:57:25,748 --> 00:57:27,488
Yes. I mean, it's called ice skater,

1236
00:57:27,508 --> 00:57:30,268
but the heart of our tale is Button the snowman.

1237
00:57:30,688 --> 00:57:33,568
Because ice skater grew a fond of him and wants to,

1238
00:57:34,048 --> 00:57:36,468
you know, wants to see him around next summer winter.

1239
00:57:37,088 --> 00:57:38,088
I'm getting him by pitch mode.

1240
00:57:38,088 --> 00:57:40,188
Scott doing his executive dipshit voice.

1241
00:57:41,268 --> 00:57:43,588
You have to talk down to them like little children.

1242
00:57:43,768 --> 00:57:45,968
But the heart of the story, really?

1243
00:57:47,068 --> 00:57:49,188
And yeah, we'll sell a little bit of Button merch.

1244
00:57:49,448 --> 00:57:50,248
I think we will.

1245
00:57:50,588 --> 00:57:53,848
Oh, and if you're wondering, yeah, we got Tremblay.

1246
00:57:54,988 --> 00:57:58,408
Tremblay, Jacob Tremblay's on board, folks.

1247
00:57:58,768 --> 00:58:00,128
He's gonna be the voice of Button.

1248
00:58:00,668 --> 00:58:03,508
The only pitch I have for this is that Olaf is in it.

1249
00:58:04,068 --> 00:58:05,848
Oh, yeah.

1250
00:58:06,428 --> 00:58:10,668
Do you advertise it or is he a big surprise?

1251
00:58:11,848 --> 00:58:13,248
I think maybe, here's what you do.

1252
00:58:13,248 --> 00:58:14,968
There's one teaser trailer without him

1253
00:58:14,968 --> 00:58:17,128
and the sad people just to whet people's appetite.

1254
00:58:17,128 --> 00:58:18,248
And then the second one.

1255
00:58:18,368 --> 00:58:20,888
It's the Chewy were home moments.

1256
00:58:20,888 --> 00:58:21,908
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1257
00:58:22,148 --> 00:58:24,248
Like Olaf's here.

1258
00:58:24,368 --> 00:58:26,068
I'm in it too.

1259
00:58:29,728 --> 00:58:30,648
We can bake.

1260
00:58:31,148 --> 00:58:31,448
What?

1261
00:58:32,528 --> 00:58:34,468
He's high?

1262
00:58:34,808 --> 00:58:37,648
Yeah, they're all, I mean, ice skater definitely.

1263
00:58:38,028 --> 00:58:39,068
You're not, you're never gonna make it

1264
00:58:39,068 --> 00:58:39,788
in the world of Hollywood.

1265
00:58:39,928 --> 00:58:41,948
This is actually where it's gonna go off the rails

1266
00:58:41,948 --> 00:58:46,308
because ice skater in real life is always with Jimmy Buffett

1267
00:58:46,308 --> 00:58:49,208
doing those PSAs to try and get marijuana legalized

1268
00:58:49,208 --> 00:58:51,088
in Florida to party.

1269
00:58:51,768 --> 00:58:54,328
But they're gonna have to rein him in on the press tour.

1270
00:58:55,128 --> 00:58:55,268
So.

1271
00:58:55,428 --> 00:58:58,508
Buffett in the movie would be.

1272
00:58:58,508 --> 00:58:58,928
Yeah, Buffett's in the movie.

1273
00:58:58,928 --> 00:59:02,148
Original song for the movie, absolutely, 100%.

1274
00:59:02,148 --> 00:59:03,468
Ice is nice.

1275
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:05,228
Yeah.

1276
00:59:05,728 --> 00:59:06,628
Ice is nice.

1277
00:59:07,068 --> 00:59:08,688
And that same, you could save the work,

1278
00:59:08,728 --> 00:59:10,808
that guy who did the Blizzard Beach music you were playing

1279
00:59:10,808 --> 00:59:12,368
and just like crank out a MIDI.

1280
00:59:12,648 --> 00:59:13,268
Jimmy can sing over it.

1281
00:59:13,268 --> 00:59:14,768
I don't know, that's a little bit sophisticated

1282
00:59:14,768 --> 00:59:16,448
for a Jimmy Buffett arrangement.

1283
00:59:17,208 --> 00:59:17,888
So I'm not sure.

1284
00:59:18,028 --> 00:59:19,908
It's too robust of orchestration.

1285
00:59:20,048 --> 00:59:22,028
Yeah, you might not be comfortable with that.

1286
00:59:22,388 --> 00:59:23,368
I mean, this is all.

1287
00:59:23,368 --> 00:59:23,668
It's all great.

1288
00:59:24,088 --> 00:59:25,048
I'm big on this.

1289
00:59:25,348 --> 00:59:27,628
But here's, you know, also while we're

1290
00:59:27,628 --> 00:59:29,108
in the ice skater territory,

1291
00:59:29,108 --> 00:59:31,828
and I assumed that the episode would be mostly ice skater.

1292
00:59:32,928 --> 00:59:37,508
When you, the sad fact is when I was digging

1293
00:59:37,508 --> 00:59:41,888
for ice skater info, when you Google Disney World alligator,

1294
00:59:42,568 --> 00:59:44,648
you find the terrible story.

1295
00:59:44,868 --> 00:59:45,468
That happened a couple years ago.

1296
00:59:45,468 --> 00:59:46,928
That may be the one problem with this movie

1297
00:59:46,928 --> 00:59:50,628
is that like Disney not touching anything alligator related

1298
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:51,948
for at least a decade.

1299
00:59:52,168 --> 00:59:53,708
Potentially, and understandably,

1300
00:59:53,748 --> 00:59:56,028
because a couple of years ago, horribly tragically,

1301
00:59:56,168 --> 00:59:59,188
a toddler died in the lake outside of the Grand Floridian.

1302
00:59:59,468 --> 01:00:00,448
In the lake we have all.

1303
01:00:00,848 --> 01:00:01,528
Everyone.

1304
01:00:01,808 --> 01:00:03,768
And we were all encouraged to swim in.

1305
01:00:04,128 --> 01:00:04,668
We all have pictures of it.

1306
01:00:04,668 --> 01:00:06,228
The country was connected to.

1307
01:00:07,028 --> 01:00:10,328
So yeah, they maybe want to shy away from fun, love and gators,

1308
01:00:10,348 --> 01:00:13,348
especially in like communal water sports areas.

1309
01:00:13,888 --> 01:00:18,668
But here's the odd thing is that I forgot about this,

1310
01:00:18,808 --> 01:00:23,868
that one of the strange pieces of fallout of the incident

1311
01:00:23,868 --> 01:00:25,808
was that Disney World for a little while

1312
01:00:25,808 --> 01:00:29,348
started straying away from gator references

1313
01:00:29,348 --> 01:00:31,268
in the parks at all.

1314
01:00:31,508 --> 01:00:31,828
Yes.

1315
01:00:31,848 --> 01:00:34,188
And I watched a video and I read an article

1316
01:00:34,188 --> 01:00:36,608
about what would that have even meant?

1317
01:00:37,128 --> 01:00:38,948
Does that mean ice gator?

1318
01:00:39,468 --> 01:00:42,248
And in fact, the gators or crocodiles

1319
01:00:42,248 --> 01:00:43,968
that were in question are the,

1320
01:00:44,668 --> 01:00:46,788
they didn't take it out of Peter Pan,

1321
01:00:46,968 --> 01:00:49,368
but they stopped using the, I guess crocodile

1322
01:00:49,368 --> 01:00:52,208
in a parade.

1323
01:00:52,568 --> 01:00:55,668
They stopped using the princess and the frog alligator

1324
01:00:55,668 --> 01:00:57,688
in a show outside the castle.

1325
01:00:57,788 --> 01:01:00,168
And evidently there was a joke in the Jungle Cruise

1326
01:01:00,168 --> 01:01:03,768
about kids getting eaten by the alligators.

1327
01:01:03,848 --> 01:01:05,308
So they got rid of that understandably.

1328
01:01:05,308 --> 01:01:08,268
But I was wondering, did that mean that they stopped using

1329
01:01:08,268 --> 01:01:11,308
ice gator and Laguna gator, but I don't think they did.

1330
01:01:11,608 --> 01:01:13,448
Maybe those are far enough away

1331
01:01:13,448 --> 01:01:15,848
from the Magic Kingdom district

1332
01:01:15,848 --> 01:01:18,348
that ice gator was safe.

1333
01:01:18,488 --> 01:01:21,408
Well, and they're so exaggerated and cartoony

1334
01:01:21,408 --> 01:01:23,748
and they're bright blue and bright orange.

1335
01:01:24,088 --> 01:01:26,148
Like it's so removed.

1336
01:01:26,328 --> 01:01:27,928
I mean, the princess and the frog gator

1337
01:01:27,928 --> 01:01:30,528
also like big jolly and fun loving,

1338
01:01:30,988 --> 01:01:34,808
but is closer to an actual gator.

1339
01:01:34,808 --> 01:01:39,348
But the entire existence of the Peter Pan one is to eat.

1340
01:01:39,408 --> 01:01:40,508
That's true.

1341
01:01:41,048 --> 01:01:42,328
It is his craving for flesh.

1342
01:01:42,548 --> 01:01:44,428
So that did not get him out of there.

1343
01:01:44,488 --> 01:01:47,988
Yeah, it would have been, I mean, you could have removed him from,

1344
01:01:48,168 --> 01:01:50,468
I don't see he's in the phantasmic down there

1345
01:01:50,468 --> 01:01:54,028
because he phantasmic in Florida still 90 percent Pocahontas

1346
01:01:54,028 --> 01:01:55,468
perplexing.

1347
01:01:55,588 --> 01:01:58,308
Speaking of things not updated since the 90s.

1348
01:01:58,308 --> 01:01:59,048
Stuck in 95.

1349
01:01:59,688 --> 01:02:02,388
You know, that brings up a thing.

1350
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:04,948
Typhoon Lagoon has been up.

1351
01:02:04,948 --> 01:02:08,168
Typhoon Lagoon just got a new slide last year.

1352
01:02:08,448 --> 01:02:09,688
Misadventure Falls.

1353
01:02:10,008 --> 01:02:12,648
Right. And it's tied in now to sea.

1354
01:02:12,768 --> 01:02:14,648
Yeah, because Mary Oceaneer,

1355
01:02:14,688 --> 01:02:17,028
you're trying to find her lost treasure.

1356
01:02:17,408 --> 01:02:18,828
It's mythology. Yeah, it goes.

1357
01:02:19,008 --> 01:02:21,048
She ties into all the mythology.

1358
01:02:21,368 --> 01:02:22,108
Blizzard Beach.

1359
01:02:22,548 --> 01:02:27,068
Some of the slides in Blizzard Beach were closed for like a while.

1360
01:02:27,288 --> 01:02:29,668
And people were like, oh, they're going to redo it.

1361
01:02:29,668 --> 01:02:31,948
And it was really just like plumbing issues.

1362
01:02:31,948 --> 01:02:34,708
I think they eventually reopen them, but they have not

1363
01:02:34,708 --> 01:02:38,968
really had a new thing since it opened 20 years ago.

1364
01:02:39,008 --> 01:02:41,088
It's very Disney question that regard.

1365
01:02:41,228 --> 01:02:43,688
It's just it starts. But then then what do you do?

1366
01:02:43,908 --> 01:02:44,848
It's like big portions.

1367
01:02:45,048 --> 01:02:47,968
You know what? It also this all reminds me a lot of certain parts

1368
01:02:47,968 --> 01:02:51,988
of Islands of Adventure as well, like opened hot in the 90s.

1369
01:02:51,988 --> 01:02:54,228
But then what? What do we possibly do?

1370
01:02:54,508 --> 01:02:57,528
And like the general base of style is like

1371
01:02:58,428 --> 01:03:02,908
like not subtle and rich enough to like where little enhancements would work.

1372
01:03:02,948 --> 01:03:04,288
They kind of stick out like a store.

1373
01:03:04,368 --> 01:03:06,908
The whole thing looks like a big miniature golf course,

1374
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:09,388
which there is a literal one right next door.

1375
01:03:09,388 --> 01:03:11,828
Yeah, it isn't. It's just that kind of like big blunt.

1376
01:03:12,328 --> 01:03:13,428
I don't know. Is it really a problem?

1377
01:03:13,608 --> 01:03:15,508
Is it do they need to do anything to Blizzard Beach?

1378
01:03:15,828 --> 01:03:17,288
I mean, they don't.

1379
01:03:17,428 --> 01:03:23,008
Unless they have like unless fake snow technology has come so far.

1380
01:03:23,048 --> 01:03:27,328
Fake like not because not fake snow like they shoot on Main Street.

1381
01:03:27,488 --> 01:03:31,988
But like if they could redo the fake snow somehow to make it look more realistic,

1382
01:03:32,448 --> 01:03:34,028
maybe something like that.

1383
01:03:34,828 --> 01:03:39,228
You wonder if they've ever thought about big, big old frozen overlay.

1384
01:03:39,528 --> 01:03:40,928
Oh, yeah, I've frozen.

1385
01:03:41,288 --> 01:03:43,748
I am sure that's yeah, come up.

1386
01:03:43,808 --> 01:03:45,368
That would be that's a good idea.

1387
01:03:45,568 --> 01:03:48,888
Honestly, I wouldn't hate that kind of is and that would get you new stuff.

1388
01:03:49,208 --> 01:03:52,968
Yeah, I mean, it's there's not a ton

1389
01:03:52,968 --> 01:03:55,928
that anyone has thought of to do with a water park.

1390
01:03:56,088 --> 01:03:59,988
I feel like I feel like maybe maybe the ideas aren't there with the water park.

1391
01:03:59,988 --> 01:04:02,188
And I don't know.

1392
01:04:02,188 --> 01:04:03,788
It doesn't feel like you can do is.

1393
01:04:03,988 --> 01:04:05,728
I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong, though.

1394
01:04:05,728 --> 01:04:10,448
I think of more recent in water park stuff is those big funnels

1395
01:04:10,448 --> 01:04:13,468
that you just keep going around and then you go out the bottom.

1396
01:04:13,468 --> 01:04:14,848
You know what I'm talking about?

1397
01:04:15,188 --> 01:04:17,088
They do function like a toilet tray.

1398
01:04:17,168 --> 01:04:17,868
Do you know what I mean?

1399
01:04:17,908 --> 01:04:21,008
You slide in and you just kind of

1400
01:04:21,008 --> 01:04:25,728
go around until you go out the bottom into a big pool or something.

1401
01:04:25,728 --> 01:04:27,888
I had those at all the great wolf lodges.

1402
01:04:28,028 --> 01:04:30,748
And when I went to the one in Orange County, that's like

1403
01:04:30,748 --> 01:04:34,188
that's that's that part is technically outside the building.

1404
01:04:34,248 --> 01:04:37,548
And it's run right across the street or just like shitty apartments.

1405
01:04:37,648 --> 01:04:40,188
So like you might have a if you live around there,

1406
01:04:40,188 --> 01:04:45,568
you've just got a view of this of this toilet tunnel at this fake lodge.

1407
01:04:46,028 --> 01:04:48,108
It's a really weird zone. Very odd area.

1408
01:04:48,268 --> 01:04:51,688
And they keep posting like drone footage updates of construction

1409
01:04:51,688 --> 01:04:56,128
on the Margaritaville Resort and the top of the water slides.

1410
01:04:56,148 --> 01:04:58,508
I'm assuming they'll put in some more trees and stuff.

1411
01:04:58,548 --> 01:05:02,868
But if you're at the top of those water slides, you look out onto a gas station.

1412
01:05:02,868 --> 01:05:06,508
You look out onto a highway and like an A.M.P.M.

1413
01:05:06,868 --> 01:05:08,488
Yeah. Wow. That's funny.

1414
01:05:08,928 --> 01:05:13,728
Paradise. The expectations, I think, are low for water park theming.

1415
01:05:13,728 --> 01:05:18,388
So even like just Bozer Beach being a little bit different is like, oh, cool.

1416
01:05:18,448 --> 01:05:22,428
But like I was actually wondering this is if there's any

1417
01:05:22,428 --> 01:05:27,768
with Blizzard Beach, Disney think of the only other water park idea

1418
01:05:27,768 --> 01:05:30,168
because because Volcano Bay.

1419
01:05:30,428 --> 01:05:35,688
All right. It's but it's very it's it's just it's kind of an analog to Typhoon

1420
01:05:35,688 --> 01:05:37,668
Lagoon in a way. Everyone. Right.

1421
01:05:37,788 --> 01:05:39,328
The tropical theme for water parks.

1422
01:05:39,708 --> 01:05:41,528
So this is not a complaint a lot of people are making.

1423
01:05:41,868 --> 01:05:44,148
But is there any is there anything else?

1424
01:05:44,468 --> 01:05:45,528
Can you is there another?

1425
01:05:46,528 --> 01:05:48,548
I think you've hit on something.

1426
01:05:48,928 --> 01:05:51,548
And I think the other half of it is that

1427
01:05:51,548 --> 01:05:54,948
do they need to change it if guest satisfaction is still high?

1428
01:05:55,328 --> 01:05:57,368
Like that's the thing with Islands of Adventure.

1429
01:05:57,808 --> 01:06:01,648
Some of the lot of those rides are older, but still very popular.

1430
01:06:02,008 --> 01:06:05,648
But I think we're I think we're just I think we're still in the infancy

1431
01:06:05,648 --> 01:06:10,008
of the water park. I think there is that I think Universal's flirting

1432
01:06:10,008 --> 01:06:14,328
with something more interesting with it in Volcano Bay.

1433
01:06:14,548 --> 01:06:18,128
But they didn't take it to the like they didn't take it to the limit.

1434
01:06:18,728 --> 01:06:21,168
They have the volcano itself. Volcano Bay is amazing.

1435
01:06:21,168 --> 01:06:22,468
I don't know if I've talked about this before.

1436
01:06:22,608 --> 01:06:24,768
Not a lot. We were there for like four or five hours.

1437
01:06:25,568 --> 01:06:29,448
And being by the volcano, the amount of theming looking at it, it looks real.

1438
01:06:29,508 --> 01:06:32,988
Like I was in the wave pool and just staring at it for like 10 minutes going,

1439
01:06:33,048 --> 01:06:35,088
well, this is crazy how big this is.

1440
01:06:35,368 --> 01:06:37,928
And if you go inside, it's awesome.

1441
01:06:37,928 --> 01:06:41,028
Like there's little tunnels and you can talk to like

1442
01:06:41,028 --> 01:06:44,308
any like a god that's talking to you remotely somewhere.

1443
01:06:44,308 --> 01:06:46,448
They've done that in other parts of the parks.

1444
01:06:46,688 --> 01:06:50,688
But like that level of theming in a water park, I don't think has that

1445
01:06:50,688 --> 01:06:54,588
in that specifically in the volcano, I don't think has been done before.

1446
01:06:54,908 --> 01:06:57,928
Everything on the outskirts is a lot less interesting,

1447
01:06:58,468 --> 01:07:02,448
just like slides and you can kind of see like homes behind the slide.

1448
01:07:02,448 --> 01:07:03,808
Like you can see where people live.

1449
01:07:03,828 --> 01:07:06,168
Like it's it's sort of a normal.

1450
01:07:06,288 --> 01:07:09,948
There's a couple interesting slides, but nothing is themed like the volcano is.

1451
01:07:10,128 --> 01:07:15,248
So if you were to truly do a mega level

1452
01:07:15,248 --> 01:07:18,688
like themed water park, I think you can do anything with it.

1453
01:07:18,688 --> 01:07:20,168
I don't think we're just not used to it.

1454
01:07:20,208 --> 01:07:23,648
You could do in a whole adventure land water park, I think.

1455
01:07:23,668 --> 01:07:25,688
For sure. You have to do a ton of robots.

1456
01:07:25,748 --> 01:07:26,548
You'd have to do.

1457
01:07:26,888 --> 01:07:28,368
Then it's just like no one's used to.

1458
01:07:28,428 --> 01:07:30,248
No one expects that from a water park yet.

1459
01:07:30,448 --> 01:07:34,828
Well, it'd be interesting to do like because I really like the way Trader

1460
01:07:36,648 --> 01:07:40,808
Sam's expands the adventure land vibe elsewhere out of adventure land.

1461
01:07:40,808 --> 01:07:45,728
You could kind of take Jungle Cruise mythology and blow it out

1462
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:49,328
and tie it into some of that like adventures club kind of stuff.

1463
01:07:49,328 --> 01:07:51,508
Yeah, that's not the worst.

1464
01:07:51,848 --> 01:07:56,748
Like, yeah, Disney's like, you know, Far East kind of vibe.

1465
01:07:56,908 --> 01:08:01,608
The 60s, an entire like kind of 60s feeling, all that sort of volcano bay.

1466
01:08:01,648 --> 01:08:02,728
Right. As well.

1467
01:08:02,828 --> 01:08:05,048
There's probably a Tomorrowland water park somewhere.

1468
01:08:05,128 --> 01:08:07,348
Like, there's probably an idea for it.

1469
01:08:07,448 --> 01:08:13,248
Well, all the future ideas about water are just like, let's preserve it

1470
01:08:13,248 --> 01:08:14,928
and figure out how to make more of it.

1471
01:08:15,468 --> 01:08:18,088
Water World, the theme, the water water world.

1472
01:08:18,088 --> 01:08:18,928
Oh, that's a good one.

1473
01:08:19,368 --> 01:08:23,468
But the show has proven that people are not tired of Water World yet.

1474
01:08:23,848 --> 01:08:28,028
So the entire and the Mariners walking around and the smokers.

1475
01:08:28,228 --> 01:08:29,808
Yeah. For the smokers.

1476
01:08:29,908 --> 01:08:31,608
You have smokers, but the smokers are.

1477
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:33,708
Maybe this is like in a time of peace

1478
01:08:33,708 --> 01:08:36,208
and the smokers are walking around with refreshments.

1479
01:08:36,428 --> 01:08:40,208
That's true, because you can't really scare people too much in a pool

1480
01:08:40,208 --> 01:08:42,168
because bad things might happen.

1481
01:08:42,308 --> 01:08:45,848
Like there's a limit of how much startling you can do for people.

1482
01:08:46,668 --> 01:08:51,308
Mike, I remember talking to you after you came back from Volcano Bay, because

1483
01:08:51,308 --> 01:08:56,408
I was very interested, like Universal really did the full court press on like,

1484
01:08:56,448 --> 01:09:00,548
you know, here's the volcano, here's the tapu tapu system, the virtual lines.

1485
01:09:00,608 --> 01:09:01,668
Here's the food.

1486
01:09:01,748 --> 01:09:03,528
We made good food for the park and drinks.

1487
01:09:03,588 --> 01:09:07,288
And when you got back, you were like, yeah, they've already kind of

1488
01:09:07,288 --> 01:09:10,888
that only kind of line only kind of worked in the food.

1489
01:09:10,888 --> 01:09:13,868
They're already scaling back and the drinks were good.

1490
01:09:14,128 --> 01:09:16,548
But like, yeah, the drinks were good. The ice cream was good.

1491
01:09:16,668 --> 01:09:20,108
I remember I think I told that story on the podcast now.

1492
01:09:20,148 --> 01:09:23,208
I think about it of this poor woman who just so did not know

1493
01:09:23,208 --> 01:09:25,328
how to serve the food with the number.

1494
01:09:25,528 --> 01:09:28,528
And I waited for like 25 minutes at this tiny little like hut.

1495
01:09:29,468 --> 01:09:31,868
Yeah, I mean, they were who knows what it's like now.

1496
01:09:31,868 --> 01:09:33,088
I'm sure they've worked the kinks out.

1497
01:09:33,268 --> 01:09:35,688
That's every food place, though, where they have to scale back

1498
01:09:35,688 --> 01:09:38,428
a cool food because most dads go, what is this?

1499
01:09:39,028 --> 01:09:40,788
Huh? OK, well, I just want to a hamburger.

1500
01:09:40,888 --> 01:09:41,668
Can I get a hamburger?

1501
01:09:42,208 --> 01:09:46,888
Yeah, Flo's in Cars Land has had like a dozen different menus in six years.

1502
01:09:46,888 --> 01:09:51,188
Yeah. And we just ate there with its new menu and I just had like a tuna sandwich.

1503
01:09:51,408 --> 01:09:55,888
It was so. Yeah, it used to be like full platters or even just roast beef sandwich.

1504
01:09:55,928 --> 01:09:57,228
Like that was at least something.

1505
01:09:57,368 --> 01:10:00,768
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Sweet and sour sauce.

1506
01:10:01,048 --> 01:10:03,228
One flavor at a time. Damn it.

1507
01:10:03,828 --> 01:10:07,628
Yeah. So I think that there I think somebody could come along

1508
01:10:07,628 --> 01:10:09,388
and do a water park crazy.

1509
01:10:09,768 --> 01:10:13,708
You know, the other problem is, is that if you're just doing slides and tubes,

1510
01:10:13,908 --> 01:10:16,348
you can't control the guests as much.

1511
01:10:16,368 --> 01:10:19,668
It's harder to control the ride vehicles. Sure.

1512
01:10:20,328 --> 01:10:22,328
So what are coasters are a thing?

1513
01:10:22,408 --> 01:10:26,108
Yes, they have popular little version of that that we did at Volcano Bay.

1514
01:10:26,108 --> 01:10:27,768
That was interesting, but it was very tiny.

1515
01:10:28,108 --> 01:10:31,668
And I mean, the other innovation that I remember hearing water parks

1516
01:10:31,668 --> 01:10:34,488
was how big Schlitterbahn was making slides.

1517
01:10:34,488 --> 01:10:36,268
And look how that turned out.

1518
01:10:36,268 --> 01:10:37,928
Oh, boy. Yeah, I know.

1519
01:10:38,548 --> 01:10:39,908
That's that's one of the craziest.

1520
01:10:40,228 --> 01:10:43,108
Also, you were talking about like water parks are just getting started.

1521
01:10:43,328 --> 01:10:46,808
I think since we recorded the episode about Schlitterbahn,

1522
01:10:46,868 --> 01:10:51,808
I read further into this story, which, if you don't know, horrible death there.

1523
01:10:51,808 --> 01:10:52,628
I don't want to go into it.

1524
01:10:52,868 --> 01:10:59,088
But like the horrible thing about it is it like came from like truly a arms race.

1525
01:10:59,428 --> 01:11:03,028
Like it was this guy who was obsessed with perfection

1526
01:11:03,028 --> 01:11:06,848
and with pushing it bigger and better and longer and tougher.

1527
01:11:07,288 --> 01:11:10,888
He was like and he learned from the wet and wild guy.

1528
01:11:10,988 --> 01:11:16,208
He was like he had the tutelage of like a real hard ass son of a bitch,

1529
01:11:16,368 --> 01:11:20,588
a guy who like like a military kind of guy who invented all of the crazy types

1530
01:11:20,608 --> 01:11:24,348
of slides, which initially when they opened, you know, skin everybody's knees

1531
01:11:24,348 --> 01:11:25,288
and fucked everybody up.

1532
01:11:25,748 --> 01:11:28,868
And so like it it is it's like NASA level.

1533
01:11:29,228 --> 01:11:31,508
This guy like I'm dreaming bigger and we can get better.

1534
01:11:31,548 --> 01:11:35,528
And it literally culminated in him going to jail for murder.

1535
01:11:35,588 --> 01:11:40,448
Yeah, sure. Crazy that a guy's life was the drive for water park perfection.

1536
01:11:40,588 --> 01:11:41,608
And he ended up in jail.

1537
01:11:41,808 --> 01:11:46,508
The the behind the scenes story of Schlitterbahn, like the family

1538
01:11:46,508 --> 01:11:49,868
sniping and stuff is so like that.

1539
01:11:50,728 --> 01:11:52,488
That that played into it, too.

1540
01:11:52,488 --> 01:11:56,348
So I can only assume after he's done the press tour for Vice in succession,

1541
01:11:56,348 --> 01:12:00,208
season two, Adam McKay will be making a Schlitterbahn movie

1542
01:12:00,208 --> 01:12:02,708
about the family. Yeah.

1543
01:12:02,868 --> 01:12:03,548
The most. Yeah.

1544
01:12:03,668 --> 01:12:05,848
Big short vice Schlitterbahn.

1545
01:12:06,128 --> 01:12:10,108
The craziest political stories in America.

1546
01:12:10,268 --> 01:12:15,808
Yeah. Number three is I you know, I think I'm thinking of this in the way that I,

1547
01:12:15,848 --> 01:12:17,408
you know, you point out things in the room.

1548
01:12:17,448 --> 01:12:18,808
What about a thing about an outlet?

1549
01:12:19,468 --> 01:12:22,288
But I you do have Ninja Turtle stuff right behind you.

1550
01:12:22,288 --> 01:12:23,728
Yeah, yeah. And this would be a diff.

1551
01:12:23,828 --> 01:12:26,928
Think about a ride where you're in the sewer and you go meet the turtles.

1552
01:12:27,048 --> 01:12:28,688
Some greatest. Yeah, that would be the greatest.

1553
01:12:28,788 --> 01:12:32,228
And there's not really any good turtle attractions anywhere.

1554
01:12:32,708 --> 01:12:34,028
Because what this is the idea.

1555
01:12:34,028 --> 01:12:35,388
What if it's not like one theme?

1556
01:12:35,448 --> 01:12:37,228
What if it's an Islands of Adventure type?

1557
01:12:37,728 --> 01:12:41,848
We'd like it's if it's slides that all like intersect in the way

1558
01:12:41,848 --> 01:12:43,888
that they all have to and weave in and out of each other.

1559
01:12:44,068 --> 01:12:46,448
But you go this way and you meet the turtles and this way.

1560
01:12:46,448 --> 01:12:49,068
I mean, not frozen because it would be in the same.

1561
01:12:49,228 --> 01:12:53,588
But like this is the next I think you meet Owen from Jurassic World.

1562
01:12:53,788 --> 01:12:56,868
Yeah. Oh, and Grady.

1563
01:12:56,948 --> 01:13:01,048
And what's her name? Oh, she related.

1564
01:13:01,248 --> 01:13:02,608
Is she a Hammond or something?

1565
01:13:02,988 --> 01:13:03,848
No, she's not.

1566
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:06,548
Which is she's just part of it.

1567
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:07,508
She's got a lot on her plate.

1568
01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:08,968
That's all I know about her.

1569
01:13:08,968 --> 01:13:12,228
Yeah. Yeah. You mean, she was a lot of shoes.

1570
01:13:12,428 --> 01:13:13,988
That's good.

1571
01:13:15,008 --> 01:13:18,448
Yeah, I think that all the we don't even have to go bigger and better.

1572
01:13:18,488 --> 01:13:21,308
We can just do, you know, lazy rivers with robots on the side.

1573
01:13:21,848 --> 01:13:23,068
Yeah. But what do you do?

1574
01:13:23,168 --> 01:13:25,328
But you got to like keep them safe from splashing.

1575
01:13:25,908 --> 01:13:29,968
You know, people are jumping off and like, you know, trying to flood them with water.

1576
01:13:30,168 --> 01:13:34,988
And yeah, you'd have to put the show scenes set back or have a,

1577
01:13:34,988 --> 01:13:38,788
you know, glass or you got to get strapped into a tube.

1578
01:13:38,928 --> 01:13:40,048
Yes, that's true.

1579
01:13:40,508 --> 01:13:43,228
An interesting thing I found out about Cabana Bay,

1580
01:13:43,228 --> 01:13:47,928
the Universal Hotel that has a lazy river, they

1581
01:13:47,928 --> 01:13:51,748
sell you the tube, which I was like, oh, that's kind of chintzy.

1582
01:13:51,808 --> 01:13:55,848
And then but then it says, but then you keep it like you buy it

1583
01:13:55,848 --> 01:14:00,088
and you you can inflate it for you and you can use it for your whole stay.

1584
01:14:00,128 --> 01:14:02,248
And then you just deflate it and take it home.

1585
01:14:02,348 --> 01:14:02,848
You say you're pulling.

1586
01:14:03,088 --> 01:14:04,468
Oh, I think that's actually cute.

1587
01:14:04,628 --> 01:14:07,348
Taking a bucket, taking a pail and a shovel home.

1588
01:14:07,388 --> 01:14:09,188
Now you got to take a inner tube.

1589
01:14:09,348 --> 01:14:12,688
But you if it's deflated and you fold it and fold it.

1590
01:14:13,068 --> 01:14:16,048
Just a little with the art of

1591
01:14:16,048 --> 01:14:17,928
what you have to do with your clothes anyway.

1592
01:14:18,008 --> 01:14:18,768
Sure. Yeah.

1593
01:14:18,768 --> 01:14:20,828
You could make some space for it.

1594
01:14:20,828 --> 01:14:22,308
Well, and with your suits.

1595
01:14:22,328 --> 01:14:25,608
Well, we'll all get inner tubes when we go to Cabana Bay to.

1596
01:14:25,608 --> 01:14:28,008
Yeah. Next year, in the next nine to 12 months.

1597
01:14:28,108 --> 01:14:30,228
Matching and then we'll start recording them.

1598
01:14:30,348 --> 01:14:32,848
We'll start recording the podcast from inner tubes

1599
01:14:32,848 --> 01:14:35,468
that we just put on your on your apartment floor.

1600
01:14:35,508 --> 01:14:37,408
Oh, I thought you were going to be in a pool, but that's fine.

1601
01:14:37,808 --> 01:14:39,588
Well, yeah, none of us have a pool.

1602
01:14:39,768 --> 01:14:40,488
So that's true.

1603
01:14:40,808 --> 01:14:42,388
One of these days.

1604
01:14:43,288 --> 01:14:44,168
What have we missed?

1605
01:14:44,488 --> 01:14:46,728
Oh, there's a more going through all the slides.

1606
01:14:46,728 --> 01:14:47,808
Oh, the chairlift.

1607
01:14:48,268 --> 01:14:48,968
That was the thing.

1608
01:14:49,348 --> 01:14:50,188
I always thought was cool.

1609
01:14:50,408 --> 01:14:51,888
I'm too scared to go on that, too.

1610
01:14:51,888 --> 01:14:53,908
But I will go on it next time.

1611
01:14:53,908 --> 01:14:55,168
But I don't like a chairlift.

1612
01:14:55,228 --> 01:14:56,808
I get freaked out with the legs dangling.

1613
01:14:56,968 --> 01:14:58,108
My family was confused.

1614
01:14:58,108 --> 01:15:00,048
I really wanted to go on the chairlift,

1615
01:15:00,088 --> 01:15:02,948
even though I did not want to go on some of my plummet.

1616
01:15:03,348 --> 01:15:08,128
We didn't realize that you can walk up to those slides up high

1617
01:15:08,388 --> 01:15:12,588
or take the chairlift, which means you could have taken the chairlift,

1618
01:15:12,768 --> 01:15:15,448
gotten off the chairlift and walked back down.

1619
01:15:15,668 --> 01:15:18,548
Like I would have done that a million times if I had really.

1620
01:15:18,868 --> 01:15:19,548
Sure. Yeah.

1621
01:15:19,568 --> 01:15:21,408
You know, I love modes of transit.

1622
01:15:21,548 --> 01:15:22,328
Yeah, that's true.

1623
01:15:22,468 --> 01:15:24,288
This is essentially just this.

1624
01:15:24,548 --> 01:15:28,948
I mean, with the sky buckets gone, you know, this is this is what's left.

1625
01:15:29,008 --> 01:15:29,848
And it's a chairlift.

1626
01:15:29,948 --> 01:15:31,528
It looks like you have little skis.

1627
01:15:31,568 --> 01:15:33,848
You put your feet on the skis.

1628
01:15:33,968 --> 01:15:34,748
You would have gone up.

1629
01:15:34,768 --> 01:15:36,188
You just thought you had to go on the ride.

1630
01:15:36,188 --> 01:15:40,088
I thought you had to go on the thing when you got up there. Right.

1631
01:15:41,188 --> 01:15:43,388
Yeah, because there's different color.

1632
01:15:43,548 --> 01:15:47,988
I mean, there's all the different color hills as if they were ski runs.

1633
01:15:48,468 --> 01:15:52,088
I was like, I was starting to go to a look all these up and list.

1634
01:15:52,208 --> 01:15:55,208
I don't I feel like I don't care what's purple and what's green.

1635
01:15:55,528 --> 01:15:58,368
Yeah, I like my like that info

1636
01:15:58,368 --> 01:16:01,568
fell out of my brain as soon as I tried to put it in.

1637
01:16:01,568 --> 01:16:06,608
You know, I watched a compilation of like GoPro footage of people on the slides.

1638
01:16:07,668 --> 01:16:09,808
I mean, Summit Plummet definitely looked the cool

1639
01:16:09,808 --> 01:16:12,908
where you're like standing on the platform and the platform goes away

1640
01:16:12,908 --> 01:16:14,808
and you pretty much just drop some of them.

1641
01:16:14,928 --> 01:16:17,928
And also one of the highest points in all of Disney World.

1642
01:16:17,948 --> 01:16:20,448
Yes. If you're up there and other slides start from up there.

1643
01:16:20,448 --> 01:16:24,068
But if you go up there, yeah, you like see all of it's kind of creepy.

1644
01:16:24,068 --> 01:16:26,168
It's all this land out in front of you.

1645
01:16:26,168 --> 01:16:30,188
You only see the tallest stuff like Tower of Terror and the castle

1646
01:16:30,188 --> 01:16:31,788
or the earful tower.

1647
01:16:32,128 --> 01:16:35,148
Yeah, it's one of the yeah, that's one of those places.

1648
01:16:35,868 --> 01:16:38,188
Also, the average average I can see.

1649
01:16:38,188 --> 01:16:39,508
Oh, that's tough, too.

1650
01:16:39,588 --> 01:16:42,288
It's so weird just like that. It's planes flat.

1651
01:16:42,288 --> 01:16:45,608
And then you see one thing, two things, three things. Yeah.

1652
01:16:46,368 --> 01:16:49,908
Second highest and fastest in the world after

1653
01:16:49,908 --> 01:16:52,808
in Sado in Brazil in terms of water slides.

1654
01:16:52,808 --> 01:16:57,408
What is it called in Sano in Sano in Beach Park in Brazil?

1655
01:16:57,688 --> 01:16:59,288
Hmm. Blizzard Beach.

1656
01:16:59,488 --> 01:17:00,868
I found this interesting.

1657
01:17:02,168 --> 01:17:05,548
Typhoon Lagoon, second most visited water park in the world.

1658
01:17:05,808 --> 01:17:09,208
Blizzard Beach, number three, number one, Chime

1659
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:13,468
Long Water Park in Guangzhou, China in 2016.

1660
01:17:13,928 --> 01:17:18,308
Two million five hundred thirty visitors, five hundred thirty eight

1661
01:17:18,308 --> 01:17:20,428
thousand visitors, excuse me.

1662
01:17:21,748 --> 01:17:24,808
Typhoon Lagoon has the title, really.

1663
01:17:24,808 --> 01:17:27,748
China has the title and then Typhoon Lagoon and Blizzard Beach.

1664
01:17:28,348 --> 01:17:28,748
Interesting.

1665
01:17:30,328 --> 01:17:33,008
What are the rides with team boats, springs?

1666
01:17:33,008 --> 01:17:38,028
I talked about with my sister's terror is like a racing one.

1667
01:17:39,288 --> 01:17:41,748
The racing mat slides, I remember being very fun.

1668
01:17:41,928 --> 01:17:45,268
Like you lie on your stomach, you hold the mat and then you're

1669
01:17:45,268 --> 01:17:47,168
zipping around. Those were fun.

1670
01:17:48,668 --> 01:17:51,888
There's a training grounds because it kind of all has a vague

1671
01:17:51,888 --> 01:17:54,168
as if you're getting ready for the next Olympics.

1672
01:17:55,308 --> 01:17:58,348
And this resort, there's the slush gusher.

1673
01:17:58,568 --> 01:18:01,828
Good name, which is another body slide.

1674
01:18:01,988 --> 01:18:04,808
I think you go forward on that one, but it's not as high as the other one,

1675
01:18:05,168 --> 01:18:06,248
which I haven't done that one.

1676
01:18:06,288 --> 01:18:07,388
I didn't do that many slides.

1677
01:18:07,428 --> 01:18:08,928
I'm a little I'm a little upset with myself.

1678
01:18:08,928 --> 01:18:11,828
I think the lines were long and it was like we only have four hours.

1679
01:18:12,168 --> 01:18:14,048
Yeah, we have to go to the other places.

1680
01:18:14,188 --> 01:18:15,068
Might as well.

1681
01:18:15,268 --> 01:18:19,348
They good lazy river run, especially if a gator is going to snort at you.

1682
01:18:19,348 --> 01:18:21,168
Sure. Yeah, no problem there.

1683
01:18:21,168 --> 01:18:22,688
We did that on Volcano Bay.

1684
01:18:22,688 --> 01:18:26,188
I think I was trying to because from the last time of

1685
01:18:26,188 --> 01:18:29,148
I like to go hard on these vacations, but it's nice to have one day

1686
01:18:29,148 --> 01:18:30,968
in the middle to sort of relax.

1687
01:18:31,228 --> 01:18:34,608
Yeah, I figured what we can do is we can go have a couple of cocktails

1688
01:18:34,608 --> 01:18:36,328
and then just floating lazy river.

1689
01:18:36,348 --> 01:18:37,688
I get to see Blizzard Beach.

1690
01:18:37,688 --> 01:18:41,688
You get to be there, but you're not necessarily on your feet the whole time.

1691
01:18:42,008 --> 01:18:44,628
I think that's a good idea because I associate the pools

1692
01:18:44,628 --> 01:18:46,628
at the hotels and stuff with relaxing.

1693
01:18:46,628 --> 01:18:50,748
And I guess there is approach to water parks, exactly like you said,

1694
01:18:50,748 --> 01:18:53,668
where you can get that relaxing in to.

1695
01:18:53,668 --> 01:18:56,468
I read a report slash review

1696
01:18:56,468 --> 01:19:00,408
where I got a lot of these pictures from I was looking at for reference

1697
01:19:00,408 --> 01:19:04,008
was on the Disney tourist blog run by Tom and Sarah Bricker.

1698
01:19:04,028 --> 01:19:06,768
And they their advice for the park

1699
01:19:06,768 --> 01:19:10,248
was pretty much just like get there as early as you can.

1700
01:19:10,508 --> 01:19:14,308
And like you can knock out all the major slides in an hour.

1701
01:19:14,308 --> 01:19:15,328
And just chill.

1702
01:19:15,328 --> 01:19:16,348
Yeah, pretty much.

1703
01:19:16,448 --> 01:19:19,148
And then just relax because a lot of people think, oh,

1704
01:19:19,148 --> 01:19:20,808
you go towards the end of the day.

1705
01:19:20,928 --> 01:19:24,808
But that has now become the like second hand, not the old wise tale.

1706
01:19:24,888 --> 01:19:26,148
Like, oh, go at the end of the day.

1707
01:19:26,168 --> 01:19:27,188
That's when it's less crowded.

1708
01:19:27,308 --> 01:19:29,448
But it's like, well, everyone's heard that now.

1709
01:19:29,648 --> 01:19:36,508
So I just said the word chill and gave me a good new water park idea, which is

1710
01:19:36,508 --> 01:19:41,108
like if OK, the entire water park, an entire water park is Mr.

1711
01:19:41,268 --> 01:19:42,188
Freeze themed.

1712
01:19:42,188 --> 01:19:48,908
And the end, it all has to be a send from one point, right?

1713
01:19:48,908 --> 01:19:52,128
Like that you all the slides go down from this one hill.

1714
01:19:52,508 --> 01:19:55,448
And Mr. Freeze is up at the top, like laughing.

1715
01:19:55,908 --> 01:20:01,068
And he and every when you go up there, the idea is you're going to try to like

1716
01:20:01,068 --> 01:20:03,288
kill him or stop him or something.

1717
01:20:03,348 --> 01:20:07,928
But the slides are his way of casting you back down the hill.

1718
01:20:07,948 --> 01:20:09,688
Oh, wow. Yeah. No, no.

1719
01:20:09,788 --> 01:20:14,428
Try again. Ice try and then it'll be the Schwarzenegger.

1720
01:20:14,468 --> 01:20:17,168
It has to be. That's the only that's the ultimate one.

1721
01:20:17,648 --> 01:20:19,148
You got to give it to that.

1722
01:20:19,168 --> 01:20:21,228
You got to, you know, there's multiple jokers.

1723
01:20:21,308 --> 01:20:23,148
There's there's multiple Batman's.

1724
01:20:23,148 --> 01:20:24,248
There's only one true.

1725
01:20:24,328 --> 01:20:28,468
I mean, I have an affection for the animated series because I like to just say

1726
01:20:28,468 --> 01:20:32,768
he used to say his his wife's name.

1727
01:20:32,888 --> 01:20:35,148
He would go, Nora, Nora.

1728
01:20:35,148 --> 01:20:37,628
And I love saying that.

1729
01:20:37,708 --> 01:20:38,648
So I like that one.

1730
01:20:39,288 --> 01:20:42,048
But the first one he's talking about, the first one he's talking about his wife.

1731
01:20:42,108 --> 01:20:46,048
And there's a very, very serious scene where he's looking at a frosted over

1732
01:20:46,048 --> 01:20:50,168
photo of her and he says something about so I can find the cure.

1733
01:20:50,988 --> 01:20:52,608
It's delightful. It's great.

1734
01:20:52,748 --> 01:20:55,248
Well, as you're saying that, I was thinking, like, you know,

1735
01:20:55,608 --> 01:21:01,088
the management might find a sinister punishment based water park a little intense.

1736
01:21:01,628 --> 01:21:05,548
What if I love when park rides continue a story?

1737
01:21:06,088 --> 01:21:07,308
What if he does cure Nora?

1738
01:21:07,428 --> 01:21:10,508
And what if him and Nora are now like now we can

1739
01:21:10,508 --> 01:21:12,248
king and queen of the water part?

1740
01:21:12,608 --> 01:21:14,348
He opens a water and he cures it.

1741
01:21:14,348 --> 01:21:16,808
He can get out of the free suit, but he's still blue.

1742
01:21:16,948 --> 01:21:19,128
But he's wearing Hawaiian shirts and board shorts.

1743
01:21:19,388 --> 01:21:20,488
And Nora is there, too.

1744
01:21:20,508 --> 01:21:22,288
And they're the king and queen of the beach.

1745
01:21:22,368 --> 01:21:25,788
And he's like, I'm using my powers for fun now.

1746
01:21:26,008 --> 01:21:28,308
He's still like scary and blue.

1747
01:21:28,728 --> 01:21:32,648
And like his, you know, his military compound is still kind of in existence.

1748
01:21:32,728 --> 01:21:37,888
But he's put tiki lights all over it and he's wearing big, bright, yellow swim trunks.

1749
01:21:37,888 --> 01:21:40,508
Yes. And she's like, Gidget.

1750
01:21:40,948 --> 01:21:43,508
She's like she's she's a beach babe.

1751
01:21:44,208 --> 01:21:48,008
And and this is essentially him liquidating his assets.

1752
01:21:48,008 --> 01:21:51,868
Yeah. He's like getting rid of all of his ice fortresses.

1753
01:21:52,228 --> 01:21:54,188
Exactly. Except the Halloween overlay.

1754
01:21:54,548 --> 01:21:56,168
It's revealed it's a trick.

1755
01:21:56,768 --> 01:22:01,768
Because that's a comic book trope when it seems like the villain has gone straight.

1756
01:22:02,148 --> 01:22:04,228
And that's when the plan comes to fruition.

1757
01:22:04,508 --> 01:22:07,248
I think you throw a penguin in there, too.

1758
01:22:07,508 --> 01:22:08,428
Oh, yeah.

1759
01:22:09,108 --> 01:22:11,948
Is he he also has switched to good?

1760
01:22:11,948 --> 01:22:12,808
He's bad still.

1761
01:22:12,908 --> 01:22:14,148
He's still bad.

1762
01:22:14,528 --> 01:22:19,628
It's about the fight between freeze and and Penguin and Oswald.

1763
01:22:20,768 --> 01:22:25,188
They both use ice and slides in their fight,

1764
01:22:25,188 --> 01:22:29,608
but they both weaponized water slides, but one is for fun and the other is for terror.

1765
01:22:29,708 --> 01:22:34,728
Yeah. And at the bar, you can get a pitch black drink like the pig with bile.

1766
01:22:35,868 --> 01:22:39,728
That returns a movie that upset me as a child.

1767
01:22:39,728 --> 01:22:43,188
Like I was I was into all the toys and stuff from Batman Returns,

1768
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:44,688
but I did not see the movie in theaters.

1769
01:22:44,708 --> 01:22:47,208
And when I would see like, oh, yeah, pictures of it, I was like,

1770
01:22:47,208 --> 01:22:49,548
what is this nightmare movie?

1771
01:22:49,688 --> 01:22:55,108
Anyway, yeah, they make a big you can get you can get obviously all these places.

1772
01:22:55,108 --> 01:22:59,208
You can get buckets of colors, but nowhere can you get a big bucket of black goo.

1773
01:22:59,288 --> 01:23:00,328
Yeah. Yeah.

1774
01:23:00,868 --> 01:23:01,668
How's the time?

1775
01:23:02,328 --> 01:23:06,668
I was going to ask, actually, we've we've we've really pitched on a lot of stuff,

1776
01:23:06,968 --> 01:23:10,568
but there's a grand opening video of Blizzard Beach that we'll post.

1777
01:23:10,568 --> 01:23:12,548
Yeah. And it is very weird.

1778
01:23:12,928 --> 01:23:15,008
And what's the character name again that I forgot?

1779
01:23:15,348 --> 01:23:16,488
Helmet Pole.

1780
01:23:16,708 --> 01:23:20,288
Helmet Pole is the honorary mayor of Blizzard Beach.

1781
01:23:20,648 --> 01:23:22,668
And I'm going to ratfuck him, too.

1782
01:23:22,868 --> 01:23:24,368
I'm taking him out. Oh, yeah.

1783
01:23:24,528 --> 01:23:26,228
Yeah. This is honorary.

1784
01:23:26,348 --> 01:23:28,908
It doesn't maybe not an official position, but yeah, yeah.

1785
01:23:28,908 --> 01:23:32,308
You should also be the honorary mayor of Blizzard Beach for sure. Yeah.

1786
01:23:32,408 --> 01:23:35,408
I'd like to just declare that maybe we declare that right now.

1787
01:23:35,408 --> 01:23:36,508
Might be no struggle.

1788
01:23:36,648 --> 01:23:39,328
All right. Congrats to Jason, the mayor of Blizzard.

1789
01:23:39,728 --> 01:23:43,148
Hey, a hard fought battle, a barely fought battle.

1790
01:23:43,248 --> 01:23:48,988
But I will treat that, though, as a more ceremonial title because the true

1791
01:23:48,988 --> 01:23:52,528
ruler of Blizzard Beach is ice skater.

1792
01:23:52,728 --> 01:23:55,168
OK, so you want to be the vice mayor?

1793
01:23:55,268 --> 01:24:01,408
I will be I will be the vice mayor's vice gator, the vice gator, the vice gator.

1794
01:24:01,428 --> 01:24:05,628
And I will give a little kiss to all the guests to thank them for coming.

1795
01:24:05,968 --> 01:24:07,108
So I still look.

1796
01:24:07,288 --> 01:24:10,308
You love kisses ice skaters in this.

1797
01:24:10,308 --> 01:24:11,528
It's great. Everyone's happy.

1798
01:24:11,528 --> 01:24:15,768
There's a weird rap that we can't decipher, but we'll link to you'll enjoy it.

1799
01:24:15,848 --> 01:24:17,268
But at the end, they're playing a Beach Boys song.

1800
01:24:17,748 --> 01:24:21,848
Is there a Scott Gardner Beach Boys water park somewhere in your brain?

1801
01:24:22,648 --> 01:24:24,148
I I'll be honest.

1802
01:24:24,148 --> 01:24:28,748
This did occur to me on the way over. Yes.

1803
01:24:29,648 --> 01:24:31,988
Yeah, Beach Beach Boys Beach.

1804
01:24:33,608 --> 01:24:35,748
And yeah, I think it's a good opportunity.

1805
01:24:35,788 --> 01:24:40,008
You can meet all of the all of the characters from all the songs.

1806
01:24:40,488 --> 01:24:44,068
You can, you know, yeah, you can go to you can go to Kokomo.

1807
01:24:44,288 --> 01:24:46,748
You can you can meet the girls on the beach, right?

1808
01:24:46,868 --> 01:24:47,728
You meet Barbara.

1809
01:24:48,428 --> 01:24:52,728
There can be one that's about ecology and saving the planet.

1810
01:24:52,908 --> 01:24:56,208
Like they were all into right in the 90s, even though they're

1811
01:24:57,228 --> 01:24:59,068
mega Republicans from the 80s on.

1812
01:25:00,668 --> 01:25:03,908
But yeah, I think, you know, if there's a there's this

1813
01:25:03,908 --> 01:25:06,788
beach was compilation called the Endless Summer

1814
01:25:06,788 --> 01:25:12,008
that's like kind of all their big faces mixed in with a lot of like Americana

1815
01:25:12,008 --> 01:25:15,388
and kind of all their faces like almost ascend into a big mountain.

1816
01:25:15,708 --> 01:25:17,188
So, yeah, I'd like to see.

1817
01:25:17,248 --> 01:25:20,588
Yeah, it's slides where you go out of the out of the map.

1818
01:25:20,588 --> 01:25:24,948
How about you? You are the the the cool free

1819
01:25:25,548 --> 01:25:28,988
floating ideas coming out of the brains of America's band.

1820
01:25:29,788 --> 01:25:33,248
And so you're sliding out the ears of the years.

1821
01:25:33,488 --> 01:25:36,088
And Wilson's and yeah, oh, out of the ears.

1822
01:25:36,088 --> 01:25:39,608
Yes, that's where their ideas come from.

1823
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:43,068
But only one of Brian Wilson's ears because he's deaf in one.

1824
01:25:43,528 --> 01:25:45,688
But yeah, you're sliding out of Brian Wilson's brain.

1825
01:25:45,708 --> 01:25:47,928
You're sliding out of Al Jardine's brain.

1826
01:25:49,388 --> 01:25:53,008
The extra members, Blondie and Ricky Fetar, who were only there for

1827
01:25:53,108 --> 01:25:54,848
two years or so.

1828
01:25:54,848 --> 01:25:58,328
Is there like a Dennis Miniland somewhere?

1829
01:25:59,288 --> 01:26:03,848
Yes, but there's you have to be careful not to be careful in his brain.

1830
01:26:03,848 --> 01:26:04,928
It's very dangerous.

1831
01:26:05,068 --> 01:26:06,268
Yeah, yeah.

1832
01:26:06,268 --> 01:26:09,328
And there's a lot of bars in Dennis land.

1833
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:11,288
Yes. And stay away from the dock.

1834
01:26:11,708 --> 01:26:12,828
Yes. Yeah, yeah.

1835
01:26:12,868 --> 01:26:14,988
Don't don't be tempted.

1836
01:26:15,008 --> 01:26:18,488
There's a lot of like pictures and items from his past.

1837
01:26:18,508 --> 01:26:21,368
And you have to be careful not to dive in after them and drown.

1838
01:26:21,368 --> 01:26:25,608
Yeah. And watch out for the very charming grifter.

1839
01:26:26,368 --> 01:26:31,728
He that wanders the water seems to be gathering followers.

1840
01:26:33,828 --> 01:26:39,948
Yes, not all characters in the water parks are as pleasant as ice skater.

1841
01:26:40,048 --> 01:26:42,768
Some are some are scary like Charles Manson.

1842
01:26:42,808 --> 01:26:48,028
But yeah, I mean, you know, and I think a big epic waterslide

1843
01:26:48,568 --> 01:26:53,468
that's, you know, really the tumultuous journey of Brian Wilson

1844
01:26:53,468 --> 01:26:58,588
in his life and in which at one point you hit a room where you get stuck

1845
01:26:58,588 --> 01:27:01,468
and you stay there for three years.

1846
01:27:02,628 --> 01:27:04,048
Finally, you're allowed to leave.

1847
01:27:04,388 --> 01:27:08,448
I think that I just this just occurred to me that I have maybe the perfect

1848
01:27:08,448 --> 01:27:12,368
marriage for your Beach Boys ideas for a water park

1849
01:27:12,368 --> 01:27:14,608
and somebody who can actually get them done.

1850
01:27:14,808 --> 01:27:18,428
Why don't we try to contact John Binkowski?

1851
01:27:19,308 --> 01:27:22,828
Oh, I thought you were going to say, yeah, I also thought you were going to say.

1852
01:27:23,008 --> 01:27:24,728
Oh, Stamos can absolutely be in the water.

1853
01:27:25,008 --> 01:27:26,868
John Stamos, John's.

1854
01:27:26,888 --> 01:27:27,488
All right. Fair enough.

1855
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:30,568
Let's get Binkowski and Stamos in a room together.

1856
01:27:30,848 --> 01:27:33,308
Man. Yes. And let's pitch them on.

1857
01:27:33,428 --> 01:27:36,328
John Binkowski, the guy who invented Hard Rock Park.

1858
01:27:36,328 --> 01:27:39,648
Yeah, sorry for which there was like seemingly on the map.

1859
01:27:39,648 --> 01:27:42,228
At one point, there was some like maybe it was like a Beach Boys

1860
01:27:42,228 --> 01:27:43,368
waterslide or something.

1861
01:27:43,368 --> 01:27:45,708
There's something he needs something to do.

1862
01:27:45,708 --> 01:27:47,408
He's got to get back in the game. Right.

1863
01:27:47,528 --> 01:27:50,988
And there's a lot of land sitting around Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.

1864
01:27:50,988 --> 01:27:56,348
Yeah. And if a theme park proper with roller coasters is a hard sell,

1865
01:27:56,748 --> 01:27:58,128
why would a water park be?

1866
01:27:58,148 --> 01:27:59,788
And we can have Beach Boys Beach.

1867
01:28:00,248 --> 01:28:01,948
Binkowski obviously created a big bounce.

1868
01:28:02,408 --> 01:28:06,348
Excuse me. Binkowski can get the money, but he knows how to get this stuff done.

1869
01:28:06,768 --> 01:28:12,908
Stamos can get the documents in front of the parties that need to sign off on it.

1870
01:28:12,908 --> 01:28:14,788
Yes, he has the he can get the rights.

1871
01:28:14,788 --> 01:28:17,808
He can get all the members to sign off.

1872
01:28:17,808 --> 01:28:24,508
I think the biggest danger it's occurred to me, though, is that what could happen

1873
01:28:24,508 --> 01:28:30,228
is that they ask Brian Wilson to devise the plans for a smile waterslide.

1874
01:28:30,708 --> 01:28:34,048
No. And then towards the end, he goes crazy and burns the slide.

1875
01:28:35,808 --> 01:28:37,348
The slide was ahead of its time.

1876
01:28:37,368 --> 01:28:38,328
It was an evil slide.

1877
01:28:38,528 --> 01:28:40,548
They released part of the slide, though.

1878
01:28:40,768 --> 01:28:42,468
Part of the slide is open.

1879
01:28:43,068 --> 01:28:46,048
And the slide will go on to influence

1880
01:28:46,048 --> 01:28:49,128
and everyone talks about the slide.

1881
01:28:49,448 --> 01:28:53,828
Everyone talks about it for many years and fragments of the slide.

1882
01:28:53,888 --> 01:28:58,308
Like this part of a tube will get will will come out and people will explore it

1883
01:28:58,308 --> 01:29:00,968
and say, man, this is going to be the greatest slide of all time.

1884
01:29:01,548 --> 01:29:03,908
All right. I don't think this is impossible.

1885
01:29:04,348 --> 01:29:09,068
If we could get one tangible product out of this podcast,

1886
01:29:09,128 --> 01:29:13,568
the ability to visit Beach Boys Beach and the resurrection and absolution

1887
01:29:13,568 --> 01:29:16,948
of John Benkow. I mean, I would people say there's no second acts.

1888
01:29:17,548 --> 01:29:19,848
All the American Americans.

1889
01:29:19,868 --> 01:29:21,028
You're getting on your own.

1890
01:29:21,308 --> 01:29:23,268
Calm down. I nothing.

1891
01:29:23,408 --> 01:29:26,208
How many times do Walt Disney fail before he had a hit?

1892
01:29:26,408 --> 01:29:29,288
Like there's only second acts in the American.

1893
01:29:29,508 --> 01:29:33,568
Well, we're going to smile rose like a phoenix in the 2000s.

1894
01:29:33,568 --> 01:29:34,848
Yeah, I remember getting that out.

1895
01:29:35,048 --> 01:29:37,028
This idea. Yeah, I think it turned out good.

1896
01:29:37,028 --> 01:29:39,508
And I think the was Grammy winner.

1897
01:29:39,748 --> 01:29:43,108
And I think, yeah, it's time to, you know, this.

1898
01:29:43,208 --> 01:29:44,588
Yeah, this idea might take.

1899
01:29:45,228 --> 01:29:46,408
This could be my Smith.

1900
01:29:46,428 --> 01:29:50,308
This could take me 50 years to get off the ground.

1901
01:29:50,308 --> 01:29:54,848
No, I may have lost some of my soul and ability to speak

1902
01:29:54,848 --> 01:29:57,948
or reason or feed myself along the way. But

1903
01:29:57,948 --> 01:30:01,308
I don't know. This is your life's work.

1904
01:30:01,588 --> 01:30:06,128
This wouldn't be a beach boys waterpark that closes in two months.

1905
01:30:06,648 --> 01:30:09,608
We start, I think, which, by the way, when it because, you know,

1906
01:30:09,668 --> 01:30:13,308
by the time it opens, the Beach Boys will be a hundred year old band.

1907
01:30:14,468 --> 01:30:16,668
Yeah, but I think you've said before, though, these bands bands

1908
01:30:16,668 --> 01:30:18,208
will just be rebooted at a certain point.

1909
01:30:18,208 --> 01:30:20,208
So there will be a new Beach Boys, I think.

1910
01:30:20,648 --> 01:30:21,508
That's already what's happening.

1911
01:30:21,588 --> 01:30:26,168
If you go, if you're not as Beach Boys verse as me and who is the

1912
01:30:26,168 --> 01:30:29,448
the Beach Boys are, if you go see the Beach Boys in concert right now,

1913
01:30:29,448 --> 01:30:32,388
there's only one who is a legitimate original member.

1914
01:30:33,048 --> 01:30:35,688
The one Bruce Johnston is a little lesser and then John and then John Stamos,

1915
01:30:35,688 --> 01:30:39,688
who at this point was has been a beach boy longer than Brian Wilson,

1916
01:30:39,728 --> 01:30:41,448
really, in a way. Right.

1917
01:30:41,708 --> 01:30:43,088
But are a lot of them.

1918
01:30:43,288 --> 01:30:47,308
But, you know, they're already the Beach Boys will continue

1919
01:30:47,308 --> 01:30:48,908
post everyone's death for sure.

1920
01:30:48,908 --> 01:30:51,508
Yeah, it'll just be a bunch of dads standing around.

1921
01:30:51,788 --> 01:30:53,888
They'll grow. They'll be like 20 of them.

1922
01:30:53,908 --> 01:30:55,648
And which one of them is original? I don't know.

1923
01:30:55,668 --> 01:30:57,248
One of them probably. It doesn't matter.

1924
01:30:57,368 --> 01:30:59,708
No one gives a shit about it. Yeah. Yeah.

1925
01:30:59,708 --> 01:31:02,388
I do think Mike Love could live to be like one hundred and five

1926
01:31:02,388 --> 01:31:04,528
and like just in a chair on the stage.

1927
01:31:04,528 --> 01:31:07,828
And like it already seems like he's lip syncing a little bit.

1928
01:31:07,828 --> 01:31:12,368
He sounds extremely auto tuned. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1929
01:31:12,368 --> 01:31:13,468
You talk about theme drinks.

1930
01:31:13,528 --> 01:31:17,048
I want a theme drink in Beach Boys Beach where you can get ice cubes

1931
01:31:17,048 --> 01:31:20,488
that look like Mike. Mike loves beady eyes.

1932
01:31:20,508 --> 01:31:24,948
I think you could start to make love.

1933
01:31:25,308 --> 01:31:27,708
Well, I think there's got to be a whole hat store.

1934
01:31:27,888 --> 01:31:32,828
I think we could start with just one big slide,

1935
01:31:32,928 --> 01:31:37,108
a couple small slides in a lazy river and then all the merch

1936
01:31:37,108 --> 01:31:39,348
and like all the fun food.

1937
01:31:39,348 --> 01:31:42,108
Well, let's start simple like they did.

1938
01:31:42,128 --> 01:31:45,628
And then we'll get more experimental. Yes. As it goes.

1939
01:31:45,668 --> 01:31:49,608
Just have expansion pads on the sides and plans ready to go.

1940
01:31:49,668 --> 01:31:53,948
And if the experimental slides are poorly received, then for many decades

1941
01:31:53,948 --> 01:31:57,088
beyond that, we'll just do songs about remember the old slides.

1942
01:31:57,268 --> 01:31:58,968
By the way, the old slides used to be.

1943
01:31:59,108 --> 01:32:00,948
Let's just go back to the old side.

1944
01:32:00,948 --> 01:32:03,908
Back to the shack like Rivers Cuomo wrote.

1945
01:32:04,128 --> 01:32:05,368
That's my thing with it.

1946
01:32:05,528 --> 01:32:08,708
They are. It's kind of exciting for me to see in real time

1947
01:32:08,708 --> 01:32:12,348
a new band following all the steps of the Beach Boys.

1948
01:32:12,548 --> 01:32:16,028
Well, even that reminded me when you were saying about like him

1949
01:32:16,028 --> 01:32:19,048
not leaving his room, there was that I remember in high school

1950
01:32:19,048 --> 01:32:22,948
reading like a Rolling Stone at the library school library

1951
01:32:22,948 --> 01:32:26,608
when I used to like be a library assistant one period a day.

1952
01:32:26,728 --> 01:32:30,768
And it was about Rivers Cuomo talking about like, yeah, I painted my whole room

1953
01:32:30,768 --> 01:32:33,208
black and locked myself in there with my lizard.

1954
01:32:33,288 --> 01:32:37,888
Same stuff. Just hanging out with his lizard at a pitch black room all the time.

1955
01:32:38,388 --> 01:32:40,848
He's really to say he strayed from the formula.

1956
01:32:41,008 --> 01:32:43,268
He fucked to the formula as Mike loves to.

1957
01:32:43,728 --> 01:32:46,008
That's what he'll tell us in the making of this park.

1958
01:32:46,148 --> 01:32:47,908
Don't fuck with the formula, boys.

1959
01:32:48,328 --> 01:32:52,568
But then but yeah, Rivers like, yeah, he flew too close to the sun.

1960
01:32:52,588 --> 01:32:54,468
And now it's back to basics forever.

1961
01:32:55,848 --> 01:32:58,648
Yeah. Well, no, he's back to know he's experimenting again.

1962
01:32:58,728 --> 01:33:00,628
Oh, really? I'll play you the song.

1963
01:33:00,688 --> 01:33:01,848
You're going to hate it.

1964
01:33:01,848 --> 01:33:03,428
You should hear it.

1965
01:33:03,428 --> 01:33:07,088
This also reminds me of rolling forever.

1966
01:33:07,088 --> 01:33:10,388
What one of the funny is crazy.

1967
01:33:10,808 --> 01:33:13,628
One of the funniest things I've ever seen at a comedy show

1968
01:33:13,628 --> 01:33:18,608
and I believe past guest Paul Shearer would have been been on it

1969
01:33:18,608 --> 01:33:22,108
because he hosted this bit, but at the Del Close Marathon for many years,

1970
01:33:22,108 --> 01:33:26,808
they did a match game 75 show or 76.

1971
01:33:26,928 --> 01:33:32,828
And all of the panelists were like, you know, John Gemberling, John Gabris,

1972
01:33:34,228 --> 01:33:36,908
you know, UCB people playing 70 celebrities.

1973
01:33:36,948 --> 01:33:38,328
And Paul was always a host.

1974
01:33:38,528 --> 01:33:40,368
And Jack McBrayer was always the contestant.

1975
01:33:40,648 --> 01:33:42,528
And they would just be one of the contestants.

1976
01:33:42,628 --> 01:33:45,448
And the panel would just scream at Jack McBrayer.

1977
01:33:45,728 --> 01:33:48,568
But one of them, DC Pearson, was playing Brian Wilson.

1978
01:33:48,728 --> 01:33:52,708
And he just wrapped in a brown bed sheet scribbling in a notebook.

1979
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:56,228
And every time they came to him for an answer, he would just scream,

1980
01:33:56,228 --> 01:34:00,068
it's not ready and committed to it so hard.

1981
01:34:00,208 --> 01:34:01,168
And we just occasionally

1982
01:34:01,168 --> 01:34:05,968
like walk off stage and then wander back on with a bunch more notebooks.

1983
01:34:06,528 --> 01:34:08,188
And it was just one of the funniest thing.

1984
01:34:08,228 --> 01:34:10,788
And it was like, yeah, this is a two in the morning show.

1985
01:34:10,888 --> 01:34:13,268
No one will ever see this again. There's no video.

1986
01:34:13,268 --> 01:34:15,648
And I just remember things so funny.

1987
01:34:16,628 --> 01:34:18,488
Well, you know, to tie it all back together,

1988
01:34:18,748 --> 01:34:23,228
have you guys ever seen the Beach Boys album cover of Keeping the Summer Alive?

1989
01:34:23,408 --> 01:34:25,228
I think I have, but I don't know what off the top of my head.

1990
01:34:25,228 --> 01:34:27,928
This is like a Latter Day album in the 80s.

1991
01:34:28,108 --> 01:34:30,768
But the when you look it up and if you at home, look it up,

1992
01:34:30,788 --> 01:34:34,028
what you will find are the Beach Boys at the beach.

1993
01:34:34,288 --> 01:34:36,128
But the beach is inside.

1994
01:34:36,248 --> 01:34:39,608
Oh, I haven't seen a snow globe and outside.

1995
01:34:39,608 --> 01:34:41,308
It's pure cold.

1996
01:34:41,688 --> 01:34:46,148
And there's polar bears looking in like, what's this indoor beach happening here?

1997
01:34:46,388 --> 01:34:49,308
So the mixture of summer and winter,

1998
01:34:49,848 --> 01:34:53,468
of beach and tundra that is explored in Blizzard Beach

1999
01:34:53,808 --> 01:34:55,568
goes back to the Beach Boys.

2000
01:34:55,688 --> 01:35:00,448
The Beach Boys were the first to do it on a cover of a very bad album.

2001
01:35:01,288 --> 01:35:05,428
So I think it's only right that they we we honor them properly

2002
01:35:05,428 --> 01:35:06,928
with an entire working water.

2003
01:35:06,928 --> 01:35:09,988
This sincerely looks like the cover of a sci fi novel.

2004
01:35:10,008 --> 01:35:11,428
You'd find in a quarter bin.

2005
01:35:11,488 --> 01:35:14,728
Some I think we can make.

2006
01:35:14,868 --> 01:35:16,428
I don't think we can make this happen.

2007
01:35:16,428 --> 01:35:17,968
I think we can do it.

2008
01:35:18,048 --> 01:35:21,048
That when the cover, it's a book called like

2009
01:35:21,648 --> 01:35:25,228
Schoeninger's conundrum or some bizarre, scary, unpleasant

2010
01:35:25,228 --> 01:35:27,328
for a 70s phrase.

2011
01:35:27,848 --> 01:35:30,708
The new Weezer song is called Can't Knock the Hustle.

2012
01:35:30,708 --> 01:35:34,788
You don't need to play it for me to hate it.

2013
01:35:34,888 --> 01:35:38,388
If you're aiming for hate, you found you tap to the vein already.

2014
01:35:38,428 --> 01:35:40,828
What was the McCartney song called from a few?

2015
01:35:40,928 --> 01:35:43,148
Oh, you I'll tell you this.

2016
01:35:43,408 --> 01:35:45,368
I don't hate for you anymore.

2017
01:35:45,368 --> 01:35:46,208
Yeah, you played it.

2018
01:35:46,288 --> 01:35:49,548
It's lazy as shit, but there's it's not as bad as freedom.

2019
01:35:49,928 --> 01:35:52,008
Freedom is the worst, I think.

2020
01:35:52,368 --> 01:35:53,528
Freedom is the worst. Paul McCartney's

2021
01:35:53,528 --> 01:35:57,408
for you is horrible and it's cringy because he's like making a double

2022
01:35:57,408 --> 01:36:00,228
enchantre and it's I think he even said, like, you know, we did.

2023
01:36:00,748 --> 01:36:02,848
I was in there for an hour and we did wrote the lyrics.

2024
01:36:02,868 --> 01:36:05,368
And I was like, yeah, it's clear that you didn't give a shit about the lyrics

2025
01:36:05,368 --> 01:36:07,008
or what it like another produce.

2026
01:36:07,028 --> 01:36:09,728
Like they just made this for you and you're singing on it.

2027
01:36:09,808 --> 01:36:11,548
But I don't hate it.

2028
01:36:11,808 --> 01:36:15,488
Can't Can't Knock the Hustle is bad, but it's not the worst.

2029
01:36:15,688 --> 01:36:17,668
Weezer's song in two weeks time.

2030
01:36:17,708 --> 01:36:18,868
You will love it.

2031
01:36:19,048 --> 01:36:20,848
I think this is how stuff works with you.

2032
01:36:21,308 --> 01:36:24,068
Sometimes something starts and you hate it and it worms your way.

2033
01:36:24,308 --> 01:36:25,008
And then to. Yeah.

2034
01:36:25,148 --> 01:36:26,388
Very soon you'll be like, you know what?

2035
01:36:26,788 --> 01:36:27,748
Maybe I like it.

2036
01:36:27,828 --> 01:36:30,708
That happened with me with NBC Smash.

2037
01:36:31,028 --> 01:36:32,308
Do you think it was smash?

2038
01:36:32,628 --> 01:36:35,608
I yeah, the first season kind of fell off the second season.

2039
01:36:35,668 --> 01:36:36,688
Yeah, but you know what?

2040
01:36:36,728 --> 01:36:39,808
But obviously, look, that Beach Boys album that I said was very bad.

2041
01:36:40,008 --> 01:36:41,668
You know, you know, I listen to it.

2042
01:36:41,668 --> 01:36:42,788
Of course, of course, I do.

2043
01:36:42,868 --> 01:36:45,128
I got the song about the Santa Ana winds

2044
01:36:45,128 --> 01:36:47,408
bugging about all this.

2045
01:36:47,548 --> 01:36:49,828
Which starts with the narration.

2046
01:36:50,528 --> 01:36:55,168
There's a condiz a weather condition in in California called this known as the

2047
01:36:55,168 --> 01:36:58,768
Santa Ana winds and fire wind.

2048
01:36:58,768 --> 01:37:03,228
They explained is a little like Wikipedia fact about a type of wind.

2049
01:37:03,248 --> 01:37:06,188
So obviously there will be some kind of like in.

2050
01:37:06,268 --> 01:37:09,608
What if there was like an indoor like a hurricane simulator called Santa Ana?

2051
01:37:09,748 --> 01:37:10,428
When? Oh, wow.

2052
01:37:10,608 --> 01:37:11,908
Or what about what drives you off?

2053
01:37:11,948 --> 01:37:14,708
What's the what about the toilet bowl thing?

2054
01:37:14,728 --> 01:37:17,148
And like you act like it's the winds that are.

2055
01:37:17,148 --> 01:37:18,448
No, that would be more of a tornado.

2056
01:37:18,928 --> 01:37:20,368
Is there a thing about tornado?

2057
01:37:20,808 --> 01:37:23,108
Uh huh. I don't know if they do.

2058
01:37:23,568 --> 01:37:26,628
Maybe that's maybe that's part of like the Brian Wilson torment.

2059
01:37:26,948 --> 01:37:28,388
But yeah, that's a bowl for another idea.

2060
01:37:28,508 --> 01:37:31,548
Then the other winds. Yeah. Back to your something with the.

2061
01:37:31,628 --> 01:37:36,568
Yeah, that that that swirl is the, you know, that's that's Brian.

2062
01:37:36,828 --> 01:37:40,328
The emotional to torment about if you don't know.

2063
01:37:40,748 --> 01:37:42,008
It's the Carolina No tunnel.

2064
01:37:42,208 --> 01:37:45,288
If you don't live in California, the Santa Ana winds famous for helping

2065
01:37:45,768 --> 01:37:48,988
spread wildfires and making everyone a little nuts.

2066
01:37:49,368 --> 01:37:52,788
Like it's kind of like their superstitions about like people go a little mad

2067
01:37:52,788 --> 01:37:55,888
when the Santa Ana winds come in like chemtrails.

2068
01:37:55,888 --> 01:37:57,828
Yeah. Yeah, not too far.

2069
01:37:57,888 --> 01:37:59,968
Yeah, there's definitely conspiracies and stuff.

2070
01:37:59,988 --> 01:38:03,068
In my sense, it's like ash could be blown in your brain.

2071
01:38:03,208 --> 01:38:07,488
Yeah, I find the Santa Ana winds unnerving because it seems like a rainstorm

2072
01:38:07,488 --> 01:38:09,488
or hurricanes about to happen, but it doesn't.

2073
01:38:09,488 --> 01:38:11,308
It's just wind for the sake of wind.

2074
01:38:11,548 --> 01:38:16,048
And it will just blow palm fronds.

2075
01:38:16,068 --> 01:38:20,628
It'll just blow trees like down or just knock stuff down.

2076
01:38:20,828 --> 01:38:23,468
They suck. The Santa Ana winds are bad.

2077
01:38:24,168 --> 01:38:26,128
Why do you hate that? Huh?

2078
01:38:26,928 --> 01:38:27,988
They're they cause chaos.

2079
01:38:28,428 --> 01:38:29,208
Yeah, I guess that's true.

2080
01:38:29,408 --> 01:38:32,448
I did look at there's a thing that says music from Disney's

2081
01:38:32,448 --> 01:38:34,548
Blizzard Beach Water Park, which is a Spotify place.

2082
01:38:34,628 --> 01:38:38,788
I don't know if it's confirmed, but there's a Jimmy Buffett song on it.

2083
01:38:41,248 --> 01:38:41,868
Jolly Monsignor

2084
01:38:41,868 --> 01:38:43,748
changes in attitude, changes in latitude.

2085
01:38:44,148 --> 01:38:46,168
Mon, it's Mon Moen.

2086
01:38:47,248 --> 01:38:50,248
There's soul shaked up, but there's like Bob Marley.

2087
01:38:50,608 --> 01:38:53,008
I'm looking they have to have.

2088
01:38:53,008 --> 01:38:55,448
Yeah, they can't just play area music.

2089
01:38:56,088 --> 01:38:57,468
But Billy Billy Joel.

2090
01:38:57,708 --> 01:38:58,468
Yeah, River of Dreams.

2091
01:38:58,628 --> 01:39:03,428
I mean, I guess it's a water song is rivers in it, but I can't read red wine.

2092
01:39:03,768 --> 01:39:07,768
I do remember some pop songs being played, but I don't see any beach boys on this.

2093
01:39:07,768 --> 01:39:10,408
I think the only beach was just in that opening video

2094
01:39:10,408 --> 01:39:12,108
from the opening of Blizzard Beach.

2095
01:39:12,328 --> 01:39:15,768
Well, all the more reason to build a temple to them.

2096
01:39:15,808 --> 01:39:16,528
Beach was beach.

2097
01:39:18,268 --> 01:39:20,968
But what do we do? Hey, does anything happen to Blizzard Beach before we?

2098
01:39:21,328 --> 01:39:25,488
Oh, I think Blizzard Beach notable closes for like a month.

2099
01:39:25,508 --> 01:39:27,288
It's closed as we record this.

2100
01:39:27,288 --> 01:39:30,348
It closes about a month, month and a half every year

2101
01:39:30,348 --> 01:39:34,468
for maintenance because you got to be in because all those pipes

2102
01:39:34,468 --> 01:39:36,068
and stuff in Florida right now.

2103
01:39:36,068 --> 01:39:37,168
That's another reason.

2104
01:39:37,548 --> 01:39:41,368
Yes, but then there's also in the new year and like January and February,

2105
01:39:41,488 --> 01:39:44,668
they'll just be days where it's it's closed because it's too cold

2106
01:39:44,668 --> 01:39:46,928
because it's going down to the 40s at night.

2107
01:39:47,108 --> 01:39:47,868
There's an issue with it.

2108
01:39:47,868 --> 01:39:48,568
You're standing around there.

2109
01:39:48,568 --> 01:39:51,408
And sometimes I remember when I went, the sky was very gray.

2110
01:39:51,428 --> 01:39:53,168
And then we're in this fake snow place.

2111
01:39:53,268 --> 01:39:56,968
And it makes you like shrieks you into thinking it's colder than it is. Right.

2112
01:39:57,168 --> 01:39:57,808
Yeah, that's true.

2113
01:39:57,888 --> 01:39:59,888
The whole park is a real optical illusion.

2114
01:39:59,928 --> 01:40:01,268
It rained when we were there.

2115
01:40:01,308 --> 01:40:03,168
And that's why I think that's why actually we ended up leaving.

2116
01:40:03,288 --> 01:40:04,908
Now I think about it. Good reason.

2117
01:40:04,968 --> 01:40:06,448
But it wasn't that cold.

2118
01:40:07,208 --> 01:40:11,328
So my plus up is make it so it doesn't rain.

2119
01:40:12,068 --> 01:40:14,128
Sure. To get on that Disney.

2120
01:40:15,528 --> 01:40:16,268
Anything else?

2121
01:40:16,528 --> 01:40:20,508
Yes. Bring back that big meatball sub by a fun childhood memories.

2122
01:40:20,688 --> 01:40:21,748
Make it available.

2123
01:40:22,188 --> 01:40:22,948
Make it available.

2124
01:40:23,068 --> 01:40:26,568
Even though I'm sure it is the same as the meatball sub, you can get it subway.

2125
01:40:27,528 --> 01:40:29,708
Worse. Yeah, for sure.

2126
01:40:29,948 --> 01:40:32,868
OK, so Jason, our advice, then go to subway,

2127
01:40:33,688 --> 01:40:36,768
take that sub, dip it in the toilet for a second and then eat it.

2128
01:40:36,808 --> 01:40:40,008
That's so that meatball sub in my mind is like that bad

2129
01:40:40,008 --> 01:40:43,088
Beatriz record you still listen to.

2130
01:40:43,428 --> 01:40:45,068
Mike and I have guilty pleasure songs.

2131
01:40:45,128 --> 01:40:47,528
You have guilty pleasure subs. Yeah.

2132
01:40:47,608 --> 01:40:51,128
As we've said before, a friend of the show,

2133
01:40:51,348 --> 01:40:54,508
Andrew Grissel really handed me my hat once when he said,

2134
01:40:55,028 --> 01:40:57,988
if dessert didn't exist, would you have any memories?

2135
01:40:58,708 --> 01:41:02,528
A really good, really good, really good slam.

2136
01:41:03,328 --> 01:41:05,188
Yeah, the biggest burn really got you.

2137
01:41:05,208 --> 01:41:06,548
And he's like one of the nicest guys.

2138
01:41:06,548 --> 01:41:07,928
I know. But I can't.

2139
01:41:07,988 --> 01:41:09,248
We're here week after week.

2140
01:41:09,288 --> 01:41:10,488
We can't think of one that good.

2141
01:41:10,508 --> 01:41:11,908
You cannot knock that hustle.

2142
01:41:12,108 --> 01:41:13,148
I mean, that's just too good.

2143
01:41:13,808 --> 01:41:14,508
You can't knock the hustle.

2144
01:41:14,568 --> 01:41:16,268
I can respect that.

2145
01:41:16,908 --> 01:41:18,648
He says motherfucker in it, too.

2146
01:41:18,708 --> 01:41:19,988
Oh, cool. Oh, cool.

2147
01:41:20,208 --> 01:41:21,328
Man, that takes balls.

2148
01:41:22,068 --> 01:41:25,708
I wish I just want I want to see some sort of sea

2149
01:41:25,708 --> 01:41:28,028
tie in with Blizzard Beach, if they could.

2150
01:41:28,148 --> 01:41:30,688
If Ice Skater was in the Society of Explorers and Adventures.

2151
01:41:30,748 --> 01:41:32,328
I don't know if it actually makes a lot of sense

2152
01:41:32,328 --> 01:41:35,868
if they have anthropomorphic animals in the sea.

2153
01:41:35,868 --> 01:41:36,808
But let's start it.

2154
01:41:36,828 --> 01:41:40,308
They're all named Barnabas, Bullion and then Ice Gator.

2155
01:41:40,668 --> 01:41:43,488
I mean, all the statues talked at the Adventurers Club.

2156
01:41:43,668 --> 01:41:45,088
I don't think there was a ghost.

2157
01:41:45,308 --> 01:41:46,188
Yeah, there was ghosts.

2158
01:41:46,308 --> 01:41:48,508
Not a huge lead to go to talking animals.

2159
01:41:48,688 --> 01:41:51,088
Put the Ice Gator in the club is all I'm saying.

2160
01:41:51,648 --> 01:41:55,508
Did you guys see, I guess, was there anything else before I find

2161
01:41:55,508 --> 01:41:57,928
I found this music video that was shot at Blizzard Beach?

2162
01:41:57,948 --> 01:42:00,188
Oh, go for it. Is it of a real?

2163
01:42:01,108 --> 01:42:04,628
Well, it's Mickey's Fun Songs, and I think they'll set it up here, too.

2164
01:42:04,628 --> 01:42:06,108
OK, great. Oh, that's right.

2165
01:42:06,328 --> 01:42:07,588
Oh, I know what I'm talking about here.

2166
01:42:07,668 --> 01:42:09,548
I remember watching a little of this, but.

2167
01:42:19,024 --> 01:42:21,164
Precisely, to pockets and bathing suits.

2168
01:42:21,584 --> 01:42:22,264
Wow, this place is really cool.

2169
01:42:22,444 --> 01:42:23,604
The pockets are branded suits.

2170
01:42:23,884 --> 01:42:26,224
No it's not, it's hot, hot, hot.

2171
01:42:26,784 --> 01:42:27,984
I'll show ya.

2172
01:42:28,464 --> 01:42:32,744
Ole, ole, ole, ole, ole, ole, ole, ole, ole, ole.

2173
01:42:46,232 --> 01:42:47,992
Me so long fire!

2174
01:42:48,912 --> 01:42:49,952
This rules.

2175
01:42:50,872 --> 01:42:52,872
Goofy, don't you dare say mon.

2176
01:42:58,072 --> 01:42:59,412
Say it like this.

2177
01:43:00,252 --> 01:43:02,912
Is it sweet? I can't resist.

2178
01:43:03,932 --> 01:43:06,652
We need a party sound.

2179
01:43:07,572 --> 01:43:10,432
A fundamental charm.

2180
01:43:11,452 --> 01:43:12,812
Bum bum bum bum.

2181
01:43:13,372 --> 01:43:13,952
Everybody.

2182
01:43:14,692 --> 01:43:16,112
Bum bum bum bum.

2183
01:43:16,532 --> 01:43:21,072
I think that slide the children are going down is the one my family ate shit on.

2184
01:43:21,072 --> 01:43:22,992
Sorry to hear that mon.

2185
01:43:23,212 --> 01:43:25,132
Sorry about your dad, Jason.

2186
01:43:25,992 --> 01:43:26,312
Fine.

2187
01:43:27,712 --> 01:43:30,132
Alright, well, you guys get the idea.

2188
01:43:30,612 --> 01:43:32,192
You can watch this on YouTube.

2189
01:43:32,972 --> 01:43:36,132
It's a delightful video where Goofy is singing hot hot hot.

2190
01:43:36,692 --> 01:43:38,972
And all the kids are enjoying it.

2191
01:43:39,432 --> 01:43:42,892
Hey, send me that link for posting and also just for fun purposes.

2192
01:43:43,352 --> 01:43:44,912
That's one of your favorite new songs.

2193
01:43:44,972 --> 01:43:45,672
It is, yeah.

2194
01:43:45,792 --> 01:43:51,712
If you need a little summer in your winter, Buster Point Dexter by way of Goofy's got you covered.

2195
01:43:52,552 --> 01:43:54,192
It's a bop, as the kids say.

2196
01:43:54,852 --> 01:43:56,072
Kids do say that now.

2197
01:43:56,192 --> 01:43:56,732
Alright.

2198
01:43:56,732 --> 01:44:00,192
You survived Podcast The Ride, the second gate.

2199
01:44:00,632 --> 01:44:02,152
Thank you so much for your support.

2200
01:44:02,292 --> 01:44:05,112
We'll have more stuff as always come in your way.

2201
01:44:06,792 --> 01:44:08,492
And what else?

2202
01:44:08,492 --> 01:44:13,212
Subscribe to the main stuff on Twitter and podcast the right on Instagram.

2203
01:44:13,552 --> 01:44:14,512
You've probably done that.

2204
01:44:14,772 --> 01:44:15,512
Yeah, sure.

2205
01:44:15,952 --> 01:44:21,172
Oh, and with the holidays coming up, there are a million T public sales.

2206
01:44:21,192 --> 01:44:28,252
So if you want a shirt or one for your podcast, a ride fan in your life, they'll probably be on sale.

2207
01:44:28,472 --> 01:44:30,692
As I say this, sure, they're on sale.

2208
01:44:30,772 --> 01:44:31,432
What? Yeah.

2209
01:44:31,932 --> 01:44:33,612
Thanks for the thanks for plugging, Jason.

2210
01:44:33,812 --> 01:44:35,012
Hey, can't knock the hustle.

2211
01:44:35,112 --> 01:44:36,232
Hey, can't knock the hustle.

2212
01:44:54,264 --> 01:44:55,324
He's no goofy.

2213
01:45:04,144 --> 01:45:09,584
Oh, this is awful.

2214
01:45:10,504 --> 01:45:13,124
Once you open a dirty song, you can never list you a clean one again.

2215
01:45:20,408 --> 01:45:20,868
I'm outta here.

2216
01:45:25,752 --> 01:45:27,152
I'll leave you one, two.
