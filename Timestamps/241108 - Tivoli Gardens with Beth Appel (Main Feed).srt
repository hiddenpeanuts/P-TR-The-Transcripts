1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Warning, the following podcast may contain a clumsy ballerina,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
big beers,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
a horse with a bright smile,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and an elderly clown's wedding ring.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
All this plus Bethapel joins us to talk Tivoli Gardens on today's podcast,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The Ride!

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, or as it's called today, Podcast Turin.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm Jason Chardon, joined as always by Carlson.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm here, and I'm not Danish at all, but I will try to pronounce some of the words and embarrass myself, I'm afraid.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Oh, I'm going to 100% guarantee I'm going to be mispronouncing stuff left and right.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
On a recent episode, I called the actor Barry Keoghan, Barry Keegan.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I thought it was Barry Keo.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So I'm just saying, recently I felt like I've been doing a bad job pronouncing a lot of things,

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
including this poor actor's name who I'm mistreating with my knowledge, my lack of knowledge.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So prepare for it is what I'm selling the audience today, to get mad at me and to be upset with me.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Especially our Danish listeners.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yeah. Well, welcome to our Danish listeners.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We're talking about the historic Tivoli Gardens today, among other attractions in Denmark and around the world.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I guess today, I didn't even ask what credit she'd like.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
She's a writer on the sexualized college girls, the former artist director of the UCB theater.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's Bethapel. Hi, Beth.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Hello.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Are those credits right? Were those good?

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Those were both accurate.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
OK, cool.

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yeah. OK.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And I like that you've had so many sex lives of college girls writers on this podcast.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000
We have, yes. Well, you and Matt Orberton.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
That's right. This is a test.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I've been going back and forth. Justin Noble, we've been emailing.

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Oh, he still has not gone on.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:35,000
He has not, because I think I initially emailed him a year went by and he emailed me back saying, I'm so sorry.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
He's a very busy man.

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm sure he is. And then we were just trying to pinpoint and then we just got.

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So, Justin, we'll have you on soon.

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Eventually.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So Scott Garner, not here today. He's out on assignment.

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
But we're so happy to have you here.

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yes, I'm thrilled to be here.

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You pitched these topics to me, the Denmark topics.

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
But before we get to that, we have covered Las Vegas attractions in the past.

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Themed casinos, former theme parks in Vegas.

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yeah.

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But one of the blank spots is that we haven't covered is the Excalibur Hotel, the very themed Excalibur Hotel.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And I wanted you to ask you if you would tell the story.

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You have a very specific Excalibur experience.

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I do, but it might not be as much Excalibur related as you think it is.

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Really?

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Possibly.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Oh, OK.

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Because you mean about getting married?

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yes.

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I didn't get married there.

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You didn't get married there?

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
No.

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
But I did stay there for two nights.

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Oh, OK.

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So can you tell us about the pillows?

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Can you tell us about the blankets?

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Because that could be interesting.

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
No, I don't remember those.

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:05,000
But I eloped to Vegas to do an Elvis wedding because it was not possible to get a marriage license in the correct amount of time to then do a city hall marriage during COVID.

65
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And it was just easier to drive to Vegas and quickly get married there.

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And I was in a hurry to get married.

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I was like, I got to do this now.

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So we stayed at the Excalibur in deep, deep, deep COVID because that was one of the hotels you could stay at where you could get the limo package to take you to the chapel where we got married.

69
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
OK, that's good.

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
That's a connection to the Excalibur.

71
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
That is the connection.

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yeah, which we chose this chapel because we had randomly seen on Instagram that David Harbour and Lily Allen got married there.

73
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And we were like, that looks fun.

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Not really a fan per se of either of them, but they did get married at the same place.

75
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And then so we did that.

76
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
We stayed at the Excalibur.

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It was like the we thought it would be a cheap, cheesy place to stay.

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And it was.

79
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It was.

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And it really was.

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And we had to we had brought like champagne with us.

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:07,000
We had to request a refrigerator and they brought it on like an AV cart that like a TV would have been brought in on and like, you know, a middle school class.

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And it just was so loud.

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
We eventually had to unplug it.

85
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The fridge.

86
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yeah.

87
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It was like a mini fridge on an AV cart that made so much noise.

88
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So I would say the Excalibur has maybe seen better days.

89
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yeah.

90
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
My experience there has always been losing at the penny slots and very bad vibes.

91
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yeah.

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Well, the vibes during Covid were especially bad.

93
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I would say maybe worse than ever.

94
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Yeah.

95
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Did you have your wedding meal at the Dix last resort in Excalibur?

96
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Most of the restaurants were closed when we were there.

97
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So we went to a restaurant called Tommy Bahamas.

98
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Whoa.

99
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yeah.

100
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And then we went to the yard house.

101
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
There was like not a lot of places that we could eat.

102
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Tommy Bahamas.

103
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
We've talked about this on the show as a clothing brand.

104
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I didn't know it was you could.

105
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Yes.

106
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You can also eat a place where they'll serve you a hamburger as well.

107
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I couldn't believe it.

108
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I was like, why is there dinner at Tommy Bahamas?

109
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
But it was just a restaurant.

110
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And we wore bride and groom masks.

111
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And the purpose was give us free things.

112
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And it totally worked.

113
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Smart.

114
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Yeah, absolutely.

115
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And I wish masks were still a little more normalized so that we could lie.

116
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Oh, yeah.

117
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Like any sort of occasion you could put on a mask and sort of get birthdays.

118
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Birthdays.

119
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Right.

120
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Anniversary.

121
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Morning.

122
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
In morning.

123
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
In morning.

124
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Yeah.

125
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
R.I.P.

126
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Grandma.

127
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yes.

128
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Give me a free Mai Tai at Tommy Bahamas.

129
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
My grandma died.

130
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Free Tropical Monterellas sticks.

131
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What do they do at Dick's Last Resort when they're like trying to mourn, like help you mourn?

132
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Do they still call you gay but then also say, I'm so sorry for your loss?

133
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Like they have to keep in character and what the tradition of Dick's is, which is just to call you gay.

134
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yeah.

135
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
But then, yeah, they have to show some sort of respect for whoever you lost.

136
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Absolutely.

137
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
This is really a side note, but I worked at Ed DeBevix in high school.

138
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

139
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And so I'm no stranger to a place where you're supposed to kind of razz the customers.

140
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Are you from Chicago?

141
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
No, they open in Ed DeBevix in Denver.

142
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Really?

143
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Yeah.

144
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And I worked there for like a couple months, weeks maybe.

145
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And they brought in a specialist from the Beverly Hills Ed DeBevix to try to rehabilitate the restaurant and like teach the waiters like how to perform and stuff.

146
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And then I showed up to work one day and it was closed forever.

147
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And they didn't tell you ahead of time.

148
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
They did not tell me.

149
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
They did not tell me.

150
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I just showed up for my shift and there was like a sign on the door that was like closed forever.

151
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
That is like apropos with the vibe of Ed DeBevix.

152
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's like, fuck you, we're closed.

153
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It was on theme for sure.

154
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Did the sign say, fuck you, we're closed or something or no?

155
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
No.

156
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I didn't say fuck you.

157
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It would say like screw you probably.

158
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Screw you.

159
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Yeah.

160
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Yeah, it did.

161
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It said screw you, we're closed.

162
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Wow.

163
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Okay.

164
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Were you expecting like she was going to say we got married on the top of the Excalibur?

165
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Yeah.

166
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I don't know why I could tell that you thought something different happened at the Excalibur, but I knew it was not right.

167
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Dressed as a king and queen on the top with like an inflatable dragon or something.

168
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
We took pictures.

169
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yeah.

170
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Well, you had posted on Instagram ages ago.

171
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Yeah.

172
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And I'm like, I guess they have a wedding chapel with an Elvis inside the Excalibur.

173
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
No.

174
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I think I just saw the details and mushed it together.

175
00:08:45,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Now, this is one of it does cover one of our favorite like vacation topics, which is a bunch of crazy pain in the ass shit like a giant loud refrigerator on a high school AV cart.

176
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Yeah.

177
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And a limo from Excalibur to the Elvis wedding chapel.

178
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Yeah.

179
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And the limo was disgusting.

180
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And there were open beers in it when we got in it from the previous people.

181
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And the limo driver was very mean to us.

182
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Like very similar to Ed DeBevix.

183
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yeah, it was an Ed DeBevix style limo ride.

184
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Wow. Yeah.

185
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Are you sure they were just not opening the beers like to be polite so you didn't you could just get in and have a sip of cold one?

186
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I didn't test it because again, it was October of 2020.

187
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So whether or not it was just a polite beer too risky.

188
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Okay.

189
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yeah.

190
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Well, yes.

191
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So we do recommend the limo service from the Excalibur in general or perhaps not.

192
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I think if you are getting married at a chapel in Vegas, your standards are such and I include myself in this.

193
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm allowed to say this that it does that you don't you're not you don't care that much about the classiness of your fair enough.

194
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Fair enough. Okay.

195
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Well, let's look into if there is any sort.

196
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I don't even know if there's a wedding chapels in the main strip hotels.

197
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I feel like there's not.

198
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I've never seen one.

199
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
No big own stuff on buying like MGM Grant and stuff.

200
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I don't think so.

201
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I think you would that would be a different wedding experience than that.

202
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Yes.

203
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That would be like shut like it down.

204
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Like that would be very expensive.

205
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I feel like you get the full king and queen ceremony at the Excalibur.

206
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Even David Harbour and Lily Allen couldn't afford that.

207
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Right.

208
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And they're rich and they're rich.

209
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Yeah.

210
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Rich with friends and money.

211
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Yeah.

212
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Well, great.

213
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Well, I'm glad we cleared that up.

214
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm sorry.

215
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I should have told you sooner.

216
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You actively, I feel like, did not tell me.

217
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I forgot you even mentioned it.

218
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And then as soon as you brought it up just now, I was like, oh, there's been a misunderstanding.

219
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Look, it's all gravy.

220
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I mean, the story was worth it.

221
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I can tell you're mad at me, but we'll work it out later.

222
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
He's furious.

223
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I can tell.

224
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm like the Hulk.

225
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm always angry.

226
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
To be fair, Jason will say, well, I have a big story about a hotel.

227
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And then it'll be like, the story is that the sheets weren't on the bed or something.

228
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And that'll be it.

229
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
So like, this is actually, this is right in the zone of what he is interested in.

230
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Oh, great.

231
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Okay.

232
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yeah.

233
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
But now hold on a minute.

234
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
If the sheets were not on the bed and I checked into a hotel room, that would be very unusual.

235
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It would be unusual, but it's not like, oh my God, an amazing story.

236
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Well, it depends on, you know, you've only said the beginning of it.

237
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'd like to hear the middle and the end.

238
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I just told the story though that Jason's like, that is exciting.

239
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
What you're talking about is exciting.

240
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So I should have stepped it down.

241
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
There was a time when you went to an Airbnb in San Diego and the sheets were wet.

242
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Oh, yes.

243
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
The sheets were wet and there were dabs of hand lotion.

244
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And I was like, I don't think I want to stay here.

245
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
How did you know it was hand lotion?

246
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
He tasted it.

247
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I think I saw the bottle sitting out.

248
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Okay.

249
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And the guy had also said like, oh, you're my second Airbnb guest.

250
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
The first was last night.

251
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And he's like, yeah, sorry, man.

252
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I just threw the comforter in the wash and I put it on the bed and I'm like, I feel like you buy a second set.

253
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Yeah.

254
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
My first guest was last night.

255
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It was Buffalo Bill.

256
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
He greased himself up.

257
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
He got in the bed.

258
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
He put the lotion in the bed.

259
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I mean, he also was very late giving me the keys.

260
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And instead of meeting in the lobby, he pulled up a giant SUV on a street corner and kind of toss them to me.

261
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And I was like, this is not this is not a great experience already.

262
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
One star.

263
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
All right.

264
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Well, we'll we'll we'll think about this and we'll remember Jason.

265
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You know what?

266
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
We should do an episode on your top five hotel stories.

267
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Here's my Excalibur story.

268
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Oh, wait.

269
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
We're doing more Excalibur content?

270
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Now I know why this came up.

271
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Well, no, because the one time I went there was when I kept doing the My Vegas.

272
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
There's these games you can play on your phone and earn like rewards like free nights or free play.

273
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And I had racked up a lot and I just kept cashing in free play.

274
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And I got to the Excalibur and there was a long line for the players club.

275
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And we were in line.

276
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:22,000
There was a much older woman with long braided purple and blonde hair making out with a much younger man in line.

277
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Like full on teenagers in line at a theme park making out.

278
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And so we're in this long line and we get up to the window and they're like, you have cashed in too much free play.

279
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You cannot claim this.

280
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I don't understand how an app and what is happening.

281
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's an app you play at a casino.

282
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
No, you play it at home.

283
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's like slot machine games you play on your phone.

284
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And then it gives you like a free appetizer or free twenty five dollars in slot play.

285
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I see. So then you go to the place where you got the free thing.

286
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And then you have to activate it at the counter.

287
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
OK, is that the story? Is the story finished?

288
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Yeah, that's it.

289
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And that was at Excalibur.

290
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Yeah.

291
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I just want you to recalibrate.

292
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It just smelled like cigarettes everywhere.

293
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I want you to recalibrate what you think is interesting now going forward on the podcast.

294
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Because what Jason just told us his Excalibur story was that he was in line to cash in app points.

295
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
And he saw a lady kissing a man.

296
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Like nasty.

297
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And that was the story.

298
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Like nasty kissing and she had interesting colored hair.

299
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Right. But she didn't like go, hey, Jason, join us or something.

300
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It was just like we saw people kissing.

301
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
So I just like going forward.

302
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
That's the bar is what I'm saying.

303
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
This is summer twenty twenty one.

304
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
So still very weird vibes in Vegas.

305
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Yeah.

306
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
But I had racked up so many points because I was sitting.

307
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I was sitting at home during twenty twenty.

308
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Just playing these Vegas games.

309
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Where were you trying to use the points?

310
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
A restaurant?

311
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
No, I was trying to use trying to use slot play.

312
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I was trying to use Excalibur.

313
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You were in line for a slot machine?

314
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Huh?

315
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
If Scott were here, he would be so upset by now that we were talking about an app.

316
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
He would be screaming at Jason right now.

317
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Stop talking about points.

318
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I am taking advantage of his absence.

319
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
All right.

320
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
OK.

321
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'll ask further questions.

322
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I had already cashed in free play Luxor, Bellagio and New York, New York.

323
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And they said you can only do three casinos.

324
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
They cut him off like a bartender.

325
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
They cut me off.

326
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I understand.

327
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
They cut him off from his free points via an app.

328
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
He did win like a hundred dollars at Luxor.

329
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
So it wasn't always not lost.

330
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It's like if a mom was it's like if a mom was couponing too much and she went to a Ralphs

331
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
and they were like, Lady, look, you're cut off.

332
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
No more deals for you right now.

333
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Yeah.

334
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You're too good at this.

335
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And then she saw a woman and a man kissing and then told all her friends about it.

336
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
It was nasty.

337
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It was nasty.

338
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It was a May, December expression of love, Jason.

339
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I know it was weird.

340
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
There was nothing.

341
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Do you don't know what ages they were?

342
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I could have been 25 and 60.

343
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
That's Madonna's dating a young man right now.

344
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Cher is dating a 30 year old.

345
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You're 77 years old.

346
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Are you going to say Cher is inappropriate?

347
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
No.

348
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
One of our national treasures.

349
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
She is a national treasure.

350
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Better not.

351
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Look, we all got through 2020 in our own ways.

352
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Some of us were playing flash games on our phone.

353
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Some of us were like quickly eloping to Vegas.

354
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
That's right.

355
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Out of boredom, out of necessity love.

356
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Beth, did you get made out of boredom?

357
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I was like, God, I'm bored.

358
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I got to get married.

359
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I got to get the fuck out of LA.

360
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It was a good diversion.

361
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Absolutely.

362
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
If you're bored, I recommend eloping to Vegas.

363
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Yeah.

364
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I think our listeners, yeah, if you're bored right now, turn this episode off and head

365
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
to the Excalibur.

366
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Drive.

367
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Well, you can't get married there.

368
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Well, I did get the limo deal.

369
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Yeah.

370
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I want you to have your experience.

371
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
To get the limo deal.

372
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Yeah.

373
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Okay.

374
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Great.

375
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Well, let's get on the plane at Harry Reid International and fly to Denmark.

376
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
That used to be McCarran Airport.

377
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
They changed Harry Reid after he passed.

378
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Yeah.

379
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
The Vegas airport.

380
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Senator Harry Reid.

381
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Senator, yeah.

382
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You were in Denmark.

383
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Yes.

384
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,000
And you would text me that you're like, have you done episodes on Tivoli Gardens?

385
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Yeah.

386
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And the other place that you all seem more excited about is a park called Bakken.

387
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I would say I'm equally excited about both of them.

388
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Oh, equally excited.

389
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Okay.

390
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Tell us about Bakken.

391
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Okay.

392
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
So Bakken, I mean, you tell me about it.

393
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Bakken is the oldest amusement park in the world.

394
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Yes.

395
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And they tell themselves it's the oldest amusement park in the world.

396
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Tivoli Gardens, I saw conflicting reports that it is the second oldest theme park in

397
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
the world or...

398
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Third, I think.

399
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Third after a park in Vienna.

400
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Yes.

401
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Austria is number two.

402
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Yeah.

403
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I haven't, I've only seen the third, the version where it's the third.

404
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Yeah.

405
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Yeah.

406
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I have seen, I don't know.

407
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I don't know if Tivoli is trying to keep this narrative going that they're the second.

408
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I feel like it might be somewhere on their website that they're claiming this.

409
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Oh.

410
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
But I don't know.

411
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I didn't see any sort of write-up about a controversy.

412
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Well, I did carbon date some items that I found at each amusement park.

413
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Great.

414
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
And I'll let you know when the results come back.

415
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Thank you.

416
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Yeah.

417
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Yeah.

418
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
We would appreciate that.

419
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
That's what our listeners want, is more carbon dating on this show to really be factual.

420
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I, you know, honestly, that's not too far off because Bakken was established in 1583.

421
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
1583.

422
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,000
And I believe there was, like, we had to go to the king and get permission.

423
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Right.

424
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
To make this an amusement area.

425
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You had to get permission from the king to do most things though in 1583, I would assume.

426
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
You couldn't just go and get married in Vegas without the consent of the king.

427
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Well, sure.

428
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
He's got to arrange the dirty limousine to him.

429
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Well, the king did officiate my wedding.

430
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Oh, okay.

431
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Oh, right.

432
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
The king.

433
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
The King Elvis Presley.

434
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Right, of course.

435
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Yeah, it was by permission of the king that the guy built Tivoli Gardens.

436
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Right.

437
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Oh, Bakken.

438
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Oh, and Tivoli Gardens.

439
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And Tivoli Gardens.

440
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I think both, yes.

441
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Both had permission of their.

442
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Yeah.

443
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Yes.

444
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Royalty.

445
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
But yeah, Bakken, a spring, freshwater spring was discovered and it seemed like entertainment

446
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
kind of sprung up around that.

447
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Oh, cool.

448
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Didn't know that.

449
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Yeah.

450
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Yeah, so Bakken, I love amusement parks and theme parks of all kinds.

451
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Yeah.

452
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And Bakken was like a 45 minute train ride outside of Copenhagen when we were there.

453
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
So I was like, let's go to Bakken.

454
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:42,000
And it's weird because it's a combination of like really old looking things and buildings

455
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
the Demon Clown Puro.

456
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Puro, yes.

457
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Which is like a whole thing, like a nightmare, Commedia del Arte mascot.

458
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Like absolutely a terrifying, every image of Puro at Bakken and Tivoli Gardens was a

459
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
different kind of scary clown nightmare.

460
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Yeah.

461
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
You could say he almost has like a nun's, what do you call it, a habit?

462
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Habit.

463
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
On his head.

464
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Yeah.

465
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
On his outfit.

466
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Like it almost looks religious.

467
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
And then he has big like poof, white poofs on the front of his big jacket.

468
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Yeah.

469
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Giant eye, like dark eyebrows.

470
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Yes.

471
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
In a lot of images and then like white face paint.

472
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Right.

473
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Yeah.

474
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
He is scary.

475
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Yeah.

476
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
We're covering this when Scott's not here because he would just be screaming.

477
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Is he scared of clowns?

478
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
He doesn't care for them.

479
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Yeah.

480
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
He would really hate Puro.

481
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
There's a lot of Puro.

482
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
There's cartoon Puro and this other mascot, this moose mascot.

483
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Oh yeah.

484
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Well, we didn't see the moose.

485
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Is that a Bakken or Tivoli?

486
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
That's Bakken.

487
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Yeah.

488
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:58,000
So Bakken has like that kind of old school stuff, but the rides are like new-ish and

489
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
they look like they're from like a traveling fair kind of.

490
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Like they're the kind of rides you would expect if you were like driving through Iowa and

491
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
you were like, oh, there's a fair here.

492
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Right.

493
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
So it's just like, it's like one loop of rides.

494
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
There's a fun house that was pretty cool.

495
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,000
That was kind of like a little bit like the fun house in Greece at the end of Greece,

496
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
which is my measure of a fun house.

497
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Right.

498
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
But otherwise it's just like one loop and you get like, we kind of got like bamboozled

499
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
into getting like a full pass, which was like really expensive.

500
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It's like you can ride as many rides as you want.

501
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Although we were then told that I think you could only go on a ride like there was like

502
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
a limit of like 40 times.

503
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
You could only go 40 times a day?

504
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Yeah.

505
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Ride with your best 40 times or something.

506
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
They just paid you as Americans and like, we know you're going to get excessive.

507
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
So only 40 times.

508
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Okay.

509
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Yeah, exactly.

510
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
They were like, we know your type.

511
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:09,000
But I did immediately get motion sickness, which I've never gotten before.

512
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:17,000
But Bakken took me down so hard that I only went on maybe like four rides before I then

513
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
just had to like sit and watch my husband go on rides without me.

514
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
He didn't care.

515
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
He was like, I'm going on the rides.

516
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
What ride took you down?

517
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Great question.

518
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:35,000
So do you know the kind of ride where you're in like your own little like airplane kind

519
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
of thing and you control the wings and you can flip upside down?

520
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Yes.

521
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Have you seen the video of the woman who went and have you talked about her on the pod?

522
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I know what you're talking about.

523
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
She went to the Mall of America and she would go every day and ride the like Teenage Mutant

524
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Ninja Turtles version of this ride.

525
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
And she was like, I've gotten up to a hundred flips.

526
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
She was just like obsessed with it.

527
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
She was like, one time the ride stopped and I kept flipping.

528
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
They told me not to do that anymore.

529
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
She is amazing.

530
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
So we had seen that and my husband was like, I want to go on.

531
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
This is a ride like that and I want to try to flip.

532
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Right.

533
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
So I was like, let's go.

534
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
And although I was not trying to flip myself, you like use your like body weight to shift

535
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
from side to side and you put one wing up and one wing down and you just try to like,

536
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
it's like a competition.

537
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
There's like a leaderboard.

538
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
How many who got the most flips?

539
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Oh, I didn't realize there was like a competition aspect to it.

540
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
So this is a thing where it like it spins around, but then also your individual like

541
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
cars or whatever spins in like a circular motion.

542
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Yeah.

543
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:43,000
So it's like, it just goes around on an axis like the like regular, like an airplane ride,

544
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
like a Dumbo ride or whatever.

545
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
And then, yeah, you can spin upside down, flip upside down.

546
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
So I was not trying to flip because I'm not a daredevil, but I was watching my husband

547
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
try to flip.

548
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And because I was looking to the side for the entire ride, my brain's equilibrium got

549
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
really messed up.

550
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
So I got off that ride and I was like, I feel weird.

551
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:16,000
And then I rode a ride called Polyp that was like an octopus ride that was very spinny.

552
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
And I got off that and I was like, that's it for me.

553
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
In general, I try to avoid polyps of all types.

554
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Yeah.

555
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Polyps are never good, it turns out.

556
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
There's never a positive polyp.

557
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Yeah.

558
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Bakken, it's very unfortunate that you got the like unlimited ride, because Bakken is

559
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
unique.

560
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
You see this in a lot of older parks where admission is free.

561
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Yeah.

562
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
And then you pay per ride.

563
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
That's right.

564
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Or you just buy a full day pass.

565
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
And then ride four rides.

566
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
And then ride four rides.

567
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:59,000
But there are weird, I watched some videos, there are weird nasty machines in the queue

568
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
for like ATMs or like you can buy the single ride ticket.

569
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
But many of them are like cash or coins only.

570
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Yeah.

571
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
It was kind of overwhelming.

572
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
And it's also like every single person in Scandinavia speaks English.

573
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Like it's of course a shameful thing to be an American there and speak no other languages.

574
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Yeah.

575
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Until we got to Bakken and the woman at the ticket counter, suddenly she doesn't know.

576
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Oh yeah, yeah.

577
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
She can't answer a single question about whether or not we should get the all day pass.

578
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Very convenient.

579
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
She was like, I don't understand what you're saying.

580
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:42,000
So she's like, I don't want to call you a mark, but she maybe saw you as a mark perhaps.

581
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
She looked at us, she saw a couple of Commedia del Arte clowns.

582
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
And she said, I'm going to get, yeah, she was like a teenager.

583
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
She didn't care.

584
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Right.

585
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
But the other thing that was really weird and fun and interesting was we were there

586
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
during graduation time.

587
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
And do you know about Danish teens when they graduate?

588
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I think I've seen some TikToks.

589
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Jason, list everything you know about Danish teens.

590
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Well, I think it's in Danish teens, but do they just get really hammered and just go crazy?

591
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
That's one thing they do.

592
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Okay.

593
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Yeah.

594
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Okay.

595
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
So he's partly right.

596
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Do you know one other thing about them from TikTok?

597
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
No, I'm excited and afraid to hear about it.

598
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
They wear little caps.

599
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
They wear special little caps for like a week all around town that look kind of like train

600
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
conductor caps, like decorated with their name and embroidered and stuff.

601
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
So we were at Bakken with a ton of teens in like captain hats.

602
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Whoa.

603
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Now I'm interested.

604
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Wow.

605
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
So yeah, truly like little like, yeah, like I'm trying to think of an example of a character

606
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
that like a skipper from Gilligan's Island hats.

607
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
If that helps.

608
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Yes, that does help.

609
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
A 50 year old show.

610
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Does that help?

611
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Wait, what's his hat?

612
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
It's like a captain hat.

613
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
He wears the captain hat.

614
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
He wears the captain hat.

615
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
So do the captain's hats worn by the teens, do they like style each of them differently

616
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
or are they all sort of the same?

617
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
They are similar.

618
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
They're different colors, but otherwise they look pretty much the same except they have

619
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:28,000
names embroidered and the teens wear them everywhere with no real sense of irony it

620
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
seems.

621
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Right.

622
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
And there were like, like, you know, 18 year old boys or whatever.

623
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
And they were playing like park games, like the game where you throw the ball on a little

624
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
trampoline.

625
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Have you seen that?

626
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I don't think so.

627
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
What do you mean?

628
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
You bounce the ball.

629
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
You bounce the ball on a trampoline and then the person across from you has to like slam

630
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
it back onto the trampoline and it bounces around.

631
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Okay.

632
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
And they're tiny trampolines or a big one?

633
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
It's a tiny trampoline.

634
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Okay.

635
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Anyway, so these guys were wearing, you know, teens wear big giant like Jankos now basically.

636
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Yes.

637
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
So it's these teenage boys in big giant jeans, shirtless, captain hats on.

638
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Shirtless?

639
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Captain hats on.

640
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Wow, really?

641
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Yes.

642
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
And do you know is this just like they've done this for hundreds of years or is this

643
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
a newer teen trend?

644
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:22,000
This is an old school tradition in Denmark and they wear their captain hats, they go

645
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
around and they get super drunk.

646
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
And shirtless?

647
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Well, the shirtless thing was it was like hot and they were in the park.

648
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
So maybe that's just a Danish thing in general.

649
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Well, it's a teenage thing like teenage boy thing.

650
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Didn't you used to go slam a ball on a trampoline shirtless in the park when you were a teenager?

651
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I don't know.

652
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Maybe we slammed the ball, not on a trampoline, but somewhere.

653
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
We slammed balls somewhere.

654
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,000
But I wasn't looking to be shirtless a lot when I was a teen.

655
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Scandinavian people are fit, outdoorsy.

656
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Right, that's true.

657
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Shirtless.

658
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
And in general, like a higher quality of life from this, from all the polls.

659
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Yeah, exactly.

660
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Happy, satisfied.

661
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Yeah.

662
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
37 hour work week from what I understand.

663
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Yeah, and it was the summer.

664
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
So like the sun's out all, you know, never goes down and all of that.

665
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Yeah, it gets dark very late there.

666
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Yes.

667
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Yeah.

668
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
We never saw full dark while we were awake.

669
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Like it's just like blackout curtains and you go to bed.

670
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Oh, okay.

671
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Yeah.

672
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Interesting.

673
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Yeah.

674
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I think Jason wore like a captain's hat regularly for years.

675
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
That's not a joke.

676
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I just need to buy him one, I think, to make it happen.

677
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Wait, I have one.

678
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
That's true, you do.

679
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
But that's more of like a bit captain's hat.

680
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I want like a nice fitted one for you.

681
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Yeah, these are nice.

682
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
They're nice.

683
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
It sounds because they're embroidered.

684
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Yeah, they're like high end.

685
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Yeah.

686
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:51,000
At first I was imagining like, you know that thing, like colleges, freshmen all had to

687
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
wear little beanies.

688
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
What?

689
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
You know, I thought this was like a new thing.

690
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Like jughead?

691
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:05,000
At colleges, like back in the like early 20th century, the freshmen all had to wear these

692
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
little like beanie caps.

693
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
But like jughead caps with a little crown?

694
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Like with the propeller?

695
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Yeah.

696
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
What do you, which?

697
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
No propeller, but kind of similar.

698
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Like it would just be like cover the top of their head.

699
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Are you thinking of like a Yanaka?

700
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:30,000
It's similar to, I'm familiar with a Yanaka.

701
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,000
It is slightly bigger, but similar size wise.

702
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Got it.

703
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
It's like imagine a baseball cap and it was shrunk down to like a third of its size.

704
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,000
And it was, and I think it was just a way to like identify who you could rag on.

705
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Yeah.

706
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Like the freshmen were all Ed DeVex customers.

707
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I really want to fact check this, but now is not the time.

708
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I mean, I'm sure it was individual at each college.

709
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I just remember it's a guy had a display case of historical like, I think it dates back

710
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,000
to the time when it's like sit on top of a flagpole cram got as many people into a phone booth.

711
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Wasn't that the 60s?

712
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Huh?

713
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Wasn't that the 60s?

714
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I think some of that tradition carried on to the 60s.

715
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Wait, what?

716
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
The phone booth thing?

717
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Yeah.

718
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Wasn't that more of like a 60s thing?

719
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I don't know.

720
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I don't know when the phone booth thing was.

721
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I don't even know what the phone booth thing is.

722
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
People would try this before television and the internet.

723
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
People would try to cram at a phone booth.

724
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Okay.

725
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
As many people as they can fit in a phone booth.

726
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I am going to fact check when telephone phone booth stuff started at colleges.

727
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
That's a good idea.

728
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Okay.

729
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Because I need to know that.

730
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Yeah.

731
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000
So Danish teens, shirtless, embroidered captain's hats.

732
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Yeah.

733
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
In the park.

734
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
And they're hammered.

735
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Hammered.

736
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Are they polite or are they rowdy?

737
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
They were neither nor.

738
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
They were just like there.

739
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Okay.

740
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
We didn't interact with them.

741
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I did keep thinking like are we going to get bullied by these teens?

742
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Yeah.

743
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,000
But they seemed to be weirdly unconcerned with us.

744
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
They weren't like clocking us.

745
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,000
They weren't clocking me with my head and my lap from motion sickness waiting for my

746
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
husband to get off a roller coaster.

747
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
So we just all minded our own business.

748
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Oh, okay.

749
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
But that was one very kind of unique and interesting thing about when we were specifically at Bakken.

750
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:36,000
And another thing was one of the roller coasters my husband went on after I could no longer

751
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
go on a roller coaster, there's like a tunnel you go into and the roller coaster was not

752
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
themed.

753
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:49,000
However, when you got to this tunnel, there was a naked, above it, a naked woman and it

754
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
was as though you were going into her vagina.

755
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Okay.

756
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Hmm.

757
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
So.

758
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,000
He said when they got there, the teens behind him yelled pussy.

759
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
So he gets off the roller coaster.

760
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
He was like, I know you feel really sick and you want to leave.

761
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I need to go on again to get a video.

762
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
It is very interesting to see.

763
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Yeah.

764
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Because it seems like the rest of the roller coaster, there's nothing else.

765
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
It wasn't themed.

766
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
It's just that.

767
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Yeah.

768
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
It was just a roller coaster.

769
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Yeah.

770
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
So happy to share that video with you if it's of interest.

771
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
We could put that on social media.

772
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Yeah.

773
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
That's interesting.

774
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Like, is it, I actually do, I miss this.

775
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Is it like a, just sort of a cartoon version of this or is it just sort of to like, is

776
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
it like an abstraction of what it is?

777
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Of a vagina?

778
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Of going into the vagina.

779
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Yeah.

780
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Well.

781
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Is it detailed?

782
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I guess is really what I'm asking.

783
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
The tunnel is not adorned.

784
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Okay.

785
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
It's a tunnel.

786
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Right.

787
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
It's just, you understand it to be a woman's vagina because of the like cutout, like the

788
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
wooden art cutout above it.

789
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Okay.

790
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Which is like a painting of a naked woman.

791
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Okay.

792
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
With her legs open.

793
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
It's pretty graphic.

794
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
That's what we're getting at.

795
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
It's cartoon.

796
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
It's a caricature.

797
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:11,000
It's a photorealistic depiction.

798
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
It's like a health science like health book or something.

799
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Yeah.

800
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I wouldn't say that.

801
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
It's whatever you want to picture.

802
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Okay.

803
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
When you picture riding a roller coaster into a vagina.

804
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Okay.

805
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Which I assume when you both close your eyes to go to sleep at night.

806
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
That's kind of-

807
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Well, that's how I fall asleep.

808
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Yeah, yeah.

809
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
You visualize that.

810
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
It's like counting sheep for you.

811
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
You sent me a photo of Falken.

812
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Yes.

813
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,000
And I'm trying to, oh, okay, it downloaded.

814
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
It's kind of like, it's a horse with a lot of teeth.

815
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I don't know.

816
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I don't know how else to describe it.

817
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
It's a painting of that.

818
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Yeah.

819
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Okay.

820
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
It feels like it should be said.

821
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Did you say a horse with a lot of teeth?

822
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
That's right.

823
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Well, you'll see why.

824
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
A toothy horse is what you're talking about?

825
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
He's smiling big.

826
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Okay.

827
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Yeah, he's smiling big.

828
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I'm just going to send it to you.

829
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Do you know what the words next to it translate to?

830
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I do not.

831
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Did you look it up?

832
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I did not.

833
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I forgot there were words.

834
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I was just picturing the horse.

835
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Yeah.

836
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
There was a lot of-

837
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
That was a nightmare one night.

838
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I was trying to ride my favorite roller coaster,

839
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
but then I kept thinking about the tooth horse.

840
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
It's the last thing you want to see in a vagina.

841
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Yeah.

842
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Yeah.

843
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
So in this, do you know, I'd actually missed it.

844
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
How old is this ride?

845
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Do you know offhand?

846
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Or is this, this has been here for a while.

847
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
The woman, we're still talking about the woman.

848
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
We're still talking about the woman.

849
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I don't know.

850
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Well, the woman is of age.

851
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Okay.

852
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
None of the rides, I thought we would go

853
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
and it would be like that exhibit about,

854
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
with the vintage amusement park stuff

855
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
that was just in LA or maybe still is.

856
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Oh, the art exhibit that Drake, yeah.

857
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Yeah.

858
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Luna Luna.

859
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Luna Luna.

860
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I thought it would be like quaint,

861
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
like old, you know, cogs and things,

862
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
but it was new.

863
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
The rides felt very new.

864
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Right.

865
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Yeah.

866
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Yeah.

867
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Because some of the ones,

868
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
at least in Tivoli Gardens,

869
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
there's like a hundred years,

870
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
a hundred year old ride there.

871
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Yes.

872
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
But yeah, so I mean,

873
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
this is another thing I'll check.

874
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I'm checking on beanies.

875
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I'm checking on the foam booth stuffing

876
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
and I'll check on the age of this ride.

877
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I sent you the tooth horse.

878
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Oh, thank you.

879
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I have not seen it yet.

880
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I turned my texts off on my computer,

881
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
but I'll take a look at this right now

882
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
and I will react live.

883
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Oh, wow.

884
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
That is a toothy horse.

885
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Whoa.

886
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
It's just a lot of teeth.

887
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
It's like a human mouth's worth of teeth.

888
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Yeah.

889
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
It's like he got veneers or something.

890
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
It's a horse with veneers.

891
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
To find Danish tradition.

892
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Yeah, the words next to it say veneer horse,

893
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
if you translate them.

894
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
That's partly why people have such a,

895
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
like a happy experience living in Denmark

896
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
is because the horses smile at them so broadly.

897
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Even the horses have beautiful smiles in Denmark.

898
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Yeah, and that cheers everybody up.

899
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Yeah, exactly.

900
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
That makes you feel good.

901
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Yeah, throw a little captain's hat on that horse.

902
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Oh, shit.

903
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
That would be amazing.

904
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Yeah.

905
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
This is scary though.

906
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
This is frightening.

907
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Yeah, the art, a lot of it was like a little bit,

908
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
especially of the clown,

909
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
was like just a little bit freaky.

910
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
How often did you see that clown walking around?

911
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Never, not once.

912
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Oh, okay.

913
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I took a picture of his little house

914
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
where it's like you would do a meet and greet

915
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
and it was shuttered.

916
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
I mean, not to the...

917
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
There's a little stage where he does

918
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Little Comedienne Del Arte.

919
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Yeah, that was not in session when we were there, sadly.

920
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I have some sad news about the horse photo.

921
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Oh, Jason.

922
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
No, I mean, I guess it's boring news.

923
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,000
The translation of the words is entrance to the stables.

924
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Oh, why is that sad?

925
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Well, because I thought it'd be weirder.

926
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Like veneer horse with veneers.

927
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Yeah, veneer horse here.

928
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Come smile with the horse or something,

929
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
like smile with him.

930
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I didn't even know there were stables.

931
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
That's fun.

932
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
There aren't anymore, I don't think.

933
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I can't tell if it was literal

934
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
or if it was just like a little doodle or something.

935
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Well, it is kind of a park.

936
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
You know, Bakken is a park as well

937
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
that you could just walk around

938
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
and it's pretty much like Tivoli Gardens.

939
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
So probably at a point.

940
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I mean, there were stables everywhere, I assume.

941
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Bakken, it seems like the gist

942
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
of reading about it, watching videos.

943
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
A lot of people go there to hang out.

944
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
There's a lot of restaurants.

945
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
There's a lot of green space.

946
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
And for the amusement park element,

947
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
they build up because they can't really expand out.

948
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Right, yeah.

949
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
That sounds accurate.

950
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
There's a lot of different levels.

951
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Yeah.

952
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I think there is some nature restrictions.

953
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
It's protected area, so they can't really just expand.

954
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Yeah, nor should they.

955
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
It's fine.

956
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Yeah.

957
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
It's enough.

958
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Yeah, it's enough.

959
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
People like it.

960
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
How was the food?

961
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Did you eat there at all?

962
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,000
We had some gigantic beers.

963
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
There was a...

964
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
The candy selection was incredible.

965
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
My favorite candy is a filled rope,

966
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
like a licorice rope, but it has sugar kind of inside it.

967
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Okay, yeah, but not like a nerd's rope?

968
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
No.

969
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Okay.

970
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
That's a covered rope.

971
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Okay, yeah, it's more like a jelly-filled donut,

972
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
but it's a rope.

973
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Yeah, and they had a lot of options of that.

974
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
In general, I thought that the merch and food situation

975
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
at both parks was not good.

976
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Okay.

977
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Oh.

978
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Well, Tivoli has all these fancy restaurants

979
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
that you could go to.

980
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Okay.

981
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
But it wasn't Disneyland where you could casually go get...

982
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
A burger.

983
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Yeah, or a big turkey leg.

984
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Maybe they did have that, and I just missed it.

985
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Okay.

986
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
But yeah, so we didn't eat much yet, and also I was dying.

987
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Oh, I did have some really good fries

988
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
to try to curb my motion sickness.

989
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Did it work?

990
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
No, no, it was just time.

991
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Okay, okay.

992
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
It just needed time, maybe some water.

993
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Fries does seem safer than a schnitzel with gravy.

994
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Yeah, exactly.

995
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Like settle it down with some mackerel snacks.

996
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Yeah, yeah.

997
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
There's a picture on the website of what looks like a teen

998
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
with partial clown face paint.

999
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Did you see any of that going on?

1000
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
No, no.

1001
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Like a face painter or anything, no?

1002
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
No, also all of the rides that we have videos of,

1003
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
there was no one there.

1004
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
That was the other crazy thing.

1005
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Yeah.

1006
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Never a wait.

1007
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Often they would operate the ride

1008
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
with one or two people on it.

1009
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Right.

1010
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
So I don't know why.

1011
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
And school had just gotten out, you said.

1012
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
It's the high season there when we were there, end of June,

1013
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
but it just wasn't, it wasn't really,

1014
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
maybe that's the version of like crowded that it gets

1015
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
or something, but we didn't, there weren't like

1016
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
the extra things like Pierrot wasn't there doing

1017
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
his performances and his meet and greets

1018
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
and we didn't see anyone doing like face painting and stuff.

1019
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
So you didn't consider it like, all right,

1020
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I'm motion sickness, I can't do more rides.

1021
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I may as well get a full Pierrot face.

1022
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
No, I didn't think about that.

1023
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
But if I hadn't, I think the motion sickness

1024
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
was taking up a lot of my brain space.

1025
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
So if I had it to do over again,

1026
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I would have gotten my face painted like Pierrot for sure.

1027
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Did your husband Dave consider getting a full Pierrot face?

1028
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
He was busy getting, he was really focused

1029
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
on that vagina roller coaster.

1030
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
So we both kind of had our own things going on.

1031
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Right.

1032
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Yeah.

1033
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Maybe Pierrot wasn't there and the people

1034
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
didn't want to come because he wasn't around.

1035
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
That's true, maybe they had heard

1036
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
he wouldn't be there that day.

1037
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Right, this elderly clown.

1038
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
He wasn't here.

1039
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
The upsetting clown, they heard he wasn't there

1040
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
so the Americans are like, oh thank God he's not there.

1041
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
But the Dutch or the Danish.

1042
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Like this picture of him, he's an old man clown.

1043
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
He looks like he's hanging out by a garbage

1044
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
or like a ball wash at like a putting green or something.

1045
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Like I can't tell, it's like a little basket

1046
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
with a little hole on the top.

1047
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I don't know what it's for.

1048
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Is he pulling something out of it?

1049
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Yeah, maybe he's doing like some scarf trick or something.

1050
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Oh God.

1051
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
But yeah, he looks a little feeble

1052
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
but he's giving a thumbs up and he appears to be married.

1053
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
So he's got a ring on the ring.

1054
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I'm guessing he doesn't necessarily have to be married.

1055
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Do you think potentially he's married to the stage?

1056
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Do you think he has a formal ceremony?

1057
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Is there a Mrs. Pierrot?

1058
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Yes, it's the stage.

1059
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Yeah, it's the boards.

1060
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
He's devoted his life to performing.

1061
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
And yeah, he had an official ceremony.

1062
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I wonder if clowning in the style

1063
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
that has become what LA people think of clowning

1064
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
will make its way over and take over.

1065
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
And suddenly instead of Pierrot, it's like Natalie Palamides.

1066
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Taking a dump.

1067
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Doing a fringe festival-esque performance

1068
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,000
by taking a dump as she famously does on stage.

1069
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Is that what she does?

1070
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I haven't seen one of these shows.

1071
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
No, she does eat raw eggs sometimes

1072
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
and she hatches eggs and lays eggs.

1073
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
That was just that one show about eggs.

1074
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
That was just the one show.

1075
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Yeah.

1076
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
So sometimes she wrestles audience members

1077
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
in the Nate show.

1078
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Yeah, she was partially naked wrestling.

1079
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Anyway, I'd like to see maybe her...

1080
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I would like to see Pierrot partially naked

1081
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
playing eggs on stage at this park.

1082
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Yeah.

1083
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Yeah, but I don't know.

1084
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Maybe clowning's passed him by at this point.

1085
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Maybe.

1086
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
If he changes.

1087
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Maybe.

1088
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
But maybe, yeah, I don't know.

1089
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I would think he would be there if he's the mascot,

1090
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
so I hope nothing's wrong with him.

1091
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Yeah, it must have just been an off day for him.

1092
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Maybe he accidentally looked to the side on the flippy ride.

1093
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Oh, yeah.

1094
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
He had to take some time.

1095
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
He had to try to eat some fries and calm down.

1096
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Yeah, exactly.

1097
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:29,000
So overall, did your husband like all of the rides?

1098
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Or was he just sort of, he wanted to get it done?

1099
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
No, no.

1100
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
He loved.

1101
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
We both had a blast on all the rides we did,

1102
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
and he went on a couple more than once,

1103
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
and that's how he found out that there is a limit.

1104
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Right.

1105
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Even with the unlimited pass.

1106
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Careful.

1107
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
You're at two or three.

1108
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
You can't get to 40.

1109
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Exactly.

1110
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
And there was a...

1111
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
They scan a barcode.

1112
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
So it is like keeping track.

1113
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Interesting.

1114
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Yeah.

1115
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Because you would think it would be old school,

1116
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
but I guess these are...

1117
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
It's very updated, and that was,

1118
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
although it was really fun,

1119
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
that was like the most disappointing.

1120
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I thought it would be like quaint and old school,

1121
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
and it was not that.

1122
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Yeah.

1123
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Right.

1124
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
So yeah, it's almost like too modern.

1125
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
You would want it to be like more rickety.

1126
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Well, that is the trade-off is like the rides felt safe.

1127
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
That's true.

1128
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
For the most part.

1129
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Uh-huh.

1130
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,000
But yeah, I kind of wanted them to be really rusty,

1131
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
rickety, built 100 years ago.

1132
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,000
I feel like if it's like a flat ride that doesn't spin you,

1133
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I would want it to be as old as possible.

1134
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Yeah.

1135
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
If you're not going to lose your life if it malfunctions.

1136
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Yeah.

1137
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
So yeah, I get that.

1138
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
That makes sense to me, but yeah.

1139
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Because looking even like there's a big duck ride

1140
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
that looks like a family thing where you spin it,

1141
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
like the teacups Disneyland.

1142
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Yeah.

1143
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
But the duck looks too new for me.

1144
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Yeah, it's all very snazzy and like, yeah.

1145
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Even like the carnival, you know, throw a thing or whatever.

1146
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Some of those are like older, but yeah.

1147
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Yeah, you would want, yeah, you would want like the duck

1148
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
to be falling apart more, I think.

1149
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
You would want his like beak to be falling a little better.

1150
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Yeah, there was an amusement park growing up in Denver

1151
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
that's still there, I assume called Lakeside.

1152
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
And it was like the alternative to the nice amusement park.

1153
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
It was like the cheap, bad amusement park

1154
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
and everything was falling apart and that was kind of its charm.

1155
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Right.

1156
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Yeah.

1157
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Yeah, I mean, there is a fine line though between a bad park

1158
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
because sometimes it's good that it's falling apart

1159
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
and then sometimes it's like depressing.

1160
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Yes.

1161
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Yeah, you got to hit it in its sweet spot

1162
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
while it's on its way to becoming a depressing place.

1163
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Yes, right.

1164
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
And like Six Flags is like their mission statement

1165
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
was to always make it a little depressing.

1166
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Yeah.

1167
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
But it doesn't, I don't think it ever had a,

1168
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
not, I shouldn't say this.

1169
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Their mission statement.

1170
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
It's always, depending on,

1171
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
some of the parks were like acquired later.

1172
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
So some of the parks actually started with some quaintness.

1173
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Yes.

1174
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
And then they got sad.

1175
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
But then some of them I think were just built

1176
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
whole cloth as Six Flags.

1177
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
And I feel like those maybe lack the old school charm.

1178
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Well, that is the good park in Denver was called Elitch Gardens.

1179
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Oh, yes, of course.

1180
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Oh, well, yeah, I just made that connection.

1181
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
I've got some bad news because Scott went there.

1182
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Scott just went to Elitch Gardens.

1183
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
He just went to Elitch Gardens.

1184
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
You know, it became then a Six Flags.

1185
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Yes, it was a Six Flags briefly.

1186
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
And then it unbecame a Six Flags.

1187
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Yeah.

1188
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Wait, what happened?

1189
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Oh, it's kind of, it just seems to be in disrepair.

1190
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
It sounds depressing.

1191
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Oh no, that was the good one.

1192
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I know.

1193
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
I was afraid that's what you were going to say.

1194
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,000
It just seems like there was a lot of stuff down

1195
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
when he was there.

1196
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Yeah.

1197
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,000
And there was a lot of like preteen group,

1198
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
like tour groups, like middle school, high school.

1199
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Yes.

1200
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Groups and I think trying to navigate them all.

1201
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Half the park is down.

1202
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
That's fair.

1203
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
They have a four year old with them.

1204
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
And it just kind of was like a little overwhelming.

1205
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
I see.

1206
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Well.

1207
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
They have a Meow Wolf dark ride.

1208
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Meow Wolf was.

1209
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
At Elitch's now?

1210
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Yeah.

1211
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
At Elitch Garden.

1212
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Yeah.

1213
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Meow Wolf was given a full rein to redo a dark ride.

1214
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Great.

1215
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
That looks kind of cool.

1216
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
That's cool.

1217
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Yeah.

1218
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Well, yeah.

1219
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Maybe Lakeside's the place to go now.

1220
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
The formerly bad one.

1221
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Who knows?

1222
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Oh, it could be.

1223
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Who knows?

1224
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Who knows?

1225
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Real quick, did you play this game that appears to be shooting water at somebody holding their

1226
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,000
nose in a bathtub?

1227
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
We played a shooting water game.

1228
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I can't remember if it was that one.

1229
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Okay.

1230
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Yeah.

1231
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Because I'm trying to figure out what the narrative of the game is because it's like

1232
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
a person with different colored hair.

1233
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
All the people have different colored hair.

1234
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
One's orange or red.

1235
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
One's green.

1236
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
One's purple.

1237
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Are those not bath caps?

1238
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Oh, maybe they.

1239
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
I don't know.

1240
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
They look almost like a part, but maybe they are bath caps.

1241
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
That's not in focus on this photo.

1242
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
So perhaps not.

1243
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
But then they're holding their nose and you're shooting.

1244
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I'm trying to figure out.

1245
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Are you trying to wash them fast?

1246
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Maybe you're trying to fill up the bath.

1247
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Maybe you're, but they've covered their, their lower half is covered in bubbles.

1248
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Yeah.

1249
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
So they've already done some of it, but I wonder if you're trying to, I don't know if

1250
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
there's like holes in their feet.

1251
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,000
I don't know if you're trying to wash their feet and wash their chest and then wash their

1252
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
hands.

1253
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Well, they represent the start of the school years.

1254
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:32,000
So you graduate and you wear the little caps and you get drunk and then you're saying you're

1255
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,000
washing a bunch of teams before they start the school year.

1256
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Well, they are shirtless like the teens I saw.

1257
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Right.

1258
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
So.

1259
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Okay.

1260
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
So this is like wash a teen for their first day of school.

1261
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Wash a teen for their first day of school.

1262
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Yeah.

1263
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
That's what you're saying.

1264
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
And then you're given a puree.

1265
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,000
You're given a stuffed puree and you had to pass it on.

1266
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Oh my God.

1267
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
And it's cursed.

1268
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
It's alive.

1269
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Yeah.

1270
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
It's a prize.

1271
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
It's also cursed.

1272
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
It's cursed.

1273
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Cursed clown.

1274
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Lots of fine Danish traditions.

1275
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Yeah.

1276
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Well, let's talk Tivoli Garden.

1277
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Yeah.

1278
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
This is a historic park.

1279
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Yes.

1280
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:17,000
It was a wonderful time because I'm like, what are the odds someone just got back from

1281
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Tivoli, the park that Walt Disney visited multiple times and heavily influenced like

1282
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Disneyland.

1283
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Disneyland.

1284
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Heavily influenced.

1285
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Well, he apparently took a trip there with Art Linklater, the television broadcaster.

1286
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,000
And Art would just catch him like scribbling down notes.

1287
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Yeah.

1288
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Yeah.

1289
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
He would ask Art, like, what do you think about this?

1290
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
What do you think about this idea?

1291
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Because he was like stealing ideas from Tivoli.

1292
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Yeah.

1293
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:54,000
He was like the bad guy from Bring It On.

1294
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Yeah.

1295
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Very similar.

1296
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Yeah.

1297
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Yeah.

1298
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,000
He was like, you know, like a Perot type.

1299
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:08,000
He saw Perot and he said, I could learn a lot from that scary clown.

1300
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Yeah.

1301
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
And it is like, it totally lives up to that.

1302
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Like, it's like clear.

1303
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
There's just a lot of clear influence.

1304
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Although, I guess I don't know what rides were built when.

1305
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
So, I don't know like what he saw.

1306
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:30,000
I think it seemed like the things that sat with him are like very family friendly.

1307
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Yeah.

1308
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Good customer service.

1309
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:40,000
The ambiance and the landscaping are very beautiful because it is like a gardens.

1310
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
It is a public space.

1311
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:45,000
You have to pay a nominal like $20 to get in.

1312
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Something like that.

1313
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Yeah.

1314
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
I thought you could walk around and not ride any rides.

1315
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
I thought it was Bakken rules.

1316
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,000
And so, I did get in a bit of a tiff with the ticket taker.

1317
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Oh, wow.

1318
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:02,000
I think it's like $20 to get in and then like 20 or 30 for like unlimited rides.

1319
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Yeah.

1320
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Which was not an issue for me because I continued to have motion sickness.

1321
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Oh, no.

1322
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Whoa, no.

1323
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
So, it was a walk around situation for me.

1324
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
But there's a lot of stuff.

1325
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:22,000
There's like the NIMH Hotel, N-I-M-B, which on the outside looks kind of like the Taj Mahal.

1326
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:30,000
And to me was like clearly a potential inspiration for the It's a Small World building from the outside.

1327
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:35,000
But then there's this amazing dark ride called the flying suitcase.

1328
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Trunk?

1329
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Yeah.

1330
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Trunk or suitcase is how it translates.

1331
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:51,000
And the inside of that seems to have maybe been the inspiration for the It's a Small World slash the haunted mansion, et cetera.

1332
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Yeah.

1333
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,000
It is like a weird mashup of the two like styles to see.

1334
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Yes.

1335
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
You would think that was like a big ripoff or something or like.

1336
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Yeah, go ahead.

1337
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Yeah, I have the sign outside the flying trunk.

1338
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
It says a fairy tale journey.

1339
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:19,000
And it says, here you will meet numbskull Jack, Thumbelina, the top and the ball, the soldier and the dog with the eyes as big as teacups.

1340
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
The Ice Kingdom to the north with the Snow Queen and the Robber Girl.

1341
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
That's all one.

1342
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Yeah.

1343
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
The Little Mermaid and her sisters in the Kingdom of the Sea King.

1344
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
We all know that.

1345
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Right.

1346
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
The Emperor of China with the artificial nightingale.

1347
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Again, I don't know about the translation on this, but this is in English.

1348
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Like this wasn't translated.

1349
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:42,000
The Princess and the Pea and many more in Hans Christian Andersen's wonderful fairy tale world.

1350
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:52,000
It is like it's a lot of Hans Christian Andersen stories in one like condensed into one ride.

1351
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Yes.

1352
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Hans Christian Andersen himself was apparently so taken by Tivoli Gardens.

1353
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,000
It inspired that story, the nightingale.

1354
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
So Tivoli was opened.

1355
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
It's much more modern.

1356
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,000
It was opened in 1843.

1357
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Much more modern.

1358
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Much more modern.

1359
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
It's brand new practically.

1360
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
It's 180 something years old.

1361
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
But yeah, that ride.

1362
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
It's like, want to feel young?

1363
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Yeah.

1364
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:30,000
But there's a lot of just like this drooping tree is covered in lights at night.

1365
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
It's very beautiful.

1366
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Yeah.

1367
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Although it seems like it doesn't get dark till two in the morning.

1368
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Yeah, we didn't get to experience darkness there.

1369
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
But yeah, it's stunning.

1370
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
It's beautiful.

1371
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:54,000
It's like even the carousels are like the most beautiful, elaborate, ornate things.

1372
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Yeah.

1373
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Everything is just like really, really pretty.

1374
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:03,000
There's like a lake that was like part of like the moat originally.

1375
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Yeah.

1376
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
The city.

1377
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Yeah.

1378
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
It's just really nice.

1379
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
And there's swan boats and stuff.

1380
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Yeah.

1381
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,000
So there is an adorned haunted house that you can walk through.

1382
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Did you do via vendetta?

1383
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
We did not.

1384
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Wait, is that like a fun house or a haunted?

1385
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
No, it's like a haunt.

1386
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
That must be during Halloween or is it year round?

1387
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
I couldn't tell.

1388
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
It seemed like it might be.

1389
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
I think it's in addition to whatever ticket.

1390
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
You have to pay another fee for that.

1391
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
I don't think that was running when we were there.

1392
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,000
I think it might be seasonal because they have like Halloween and Christmas stuff too

1393
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
that I think would be very fun.

1394
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
But we didn't see that.

1395
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
From what is video, it's a vibes park to me.

1396
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:47,000
It just feels like that's the draw is like just how scenic it is and being there,

1397
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,000
especially if you can be there during the nighttime.

1398
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Yeah.

1399
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
It's not a rides park if that's kind of what you're saying.

1400
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
That's what I'm saying.

1401
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
It is a vibes park.

1402
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:03,000
It's like there's also the best thing we saw by far was there's this theater

1403
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:09,000
and it's like a giant outdoor, it's a proscenium stage and then an outdoor seating area

1404
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
with like, there's like some chairs I guess you could reserve,

1405
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,000
but then there's just like a hill where people are just watching.

1406
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:21,000
And the theater is like in the style of almost like a Chinese palace, like the proscenium.

1407
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
So beautiful.

1408
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:27,000
And then the curtain is like a big peacock.

1409
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Feathers.

1410
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Yeah.

1411
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:35,000
And it opens like a peacock's feathers would go down.

1412
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Yeah.

1413
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I guess I know what you mean.

1414
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
I don't know how else to say it.

1415
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
It takes like a number of people to operate it.

1416
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
I think they may have it automated now.

1417
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Oh, do they?

1418
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Okay.

1419
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
To me, it didn't look man-operated, person-operated.

1420
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,000
It looked more mechanical or something.

1421
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
But yeah, it's really beautiful and ornate.

1422
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:00,000
And then there's a show that we saw called Clumsy Hans.

1423
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
That's great.

1424
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:08,000
That's a ballet, like a pantomimey, like almost like Commedia del Arte ballet

1425
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,000
about a guy named Clumsy Hans.

1426
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
And there was just a huge crowd just watching like a gentle ballet.

1427
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Wow.

1428
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Yeah.

1429
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Yeah.

1430
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
It looks like they put up shows like this all the time.

1431
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Yeah.

1432
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
It's been like a hundred and what 80 years.

1433
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
But is Clumsy Hans, is that Hans Christian Andersen?

1434
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Is he Clumsy or is it just that's a guy's name?

1435
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I think that's just a guy's name.

1436
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Okay.

1437
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
It's like Clumsy John.

1438
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Interesting.

1439
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
And are his eyes as big as teacups or are they normal?

1440
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,000
We were kind of far away, but his, you know, it's more his clumsiness.

1441
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
It's his defining feature more so than big eyes.

1442
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Fair enough.

1443
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:47,000
But he, like his like dad is wants his brothers to marry a princess

1444
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
and he's going to like take them on horses and then Clumsy Hans wants to go too

1445
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
and dad's like, I don't want you to meet the princess.

1446
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,000
And then Clumsy Hans has to ride a goat.

1447
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Does he do it well?

1448
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Because he seems he's clumsy.

1449
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
So well, here's the twist.

1450
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Clumsy Hans is only clumsy in that.

1451
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:11,000
I mean, he's the person who played Clumsy Hans was like a great ballet dancer.

1452
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Right.

1453
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
But he kind of like tumbles in a graceful way.

1454
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Okay.

1455
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,000
But it's still clear ballet like graceful ballet.

1456
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,000
He's not taking like hard Chevy Chase style falls.

1457
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Yeah.

1458
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
I was going to say Chris Farley.

1459
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
He's not like falling through a coffee table or whatever.

1460
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,000
He falls, but he rolls out of it probably in a beautiful way.

1461
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Yeah.

1462
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:37,000
And the fall is like it's like West Side Story dancing fight, fight dancing, you know,

1463
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,000
where you're like, no one's really they're just like dancing.

1464
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Right.

1465
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:46,000
So Clumsy Hans is maybe like a nickname he created to like pretend he's like faux humble

1466
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,000
or something because he sounds like he's very graceful.

1467
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Hans is very graceful actually.

1468
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Other people are the ones calling him Clumsy Hans.

1469
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,000
But I guess he I didn't delve too deep into it.

1470
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Maybe he is perpetuating that to be like, right.

1471
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I'm just clumsy.

1472
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
And oh my God, did I just do a perfect pirouette?

1473
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Okay, that makes sense.

1474
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Yeah.

1475
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Clumsy Hans.

1476
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Is the goat cantankerous?

1477
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
They're fickle creatures.

1478
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:15,000
The goat is a two dimensional painted goat head on a stick.

1479
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Okay.

1480
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
All right.

1481
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
So does he ride it just like a little hobby horse?

1482
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
That's right.

1483
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
All right.

1484
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Really go either way, you know, with one of those.

1485
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
You mean it could be friendly or not?

1486
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Well, I'm saying you could really eat shit or you could just go about your business.

1487
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
That's right.

1488
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Yeah.

1489
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Yeah.

1490
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,000
But he has full control over the goat character because of just the simpleness of that of

1491
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
that apparatus.

1492
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Yeah.

1493
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Yeah.

1494
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Is Clumsy Hans, is he good looking?

1495
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Like, is he also just like I picture him hot.

1496
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Yeah.

1497
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Clumsy Hans has like a kind of a boyish good, good looks.

1498
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Yeah.

1499
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Not like a manly, like his brothers were more like manly, hot.

1500
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Okay.

1501
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Like brooding, whatever, princes.

1502
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
And then he's kind of like a boyish.

1503
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:08,000
He might be hot for American standards, but by Danish standards, he's not quite.

1504
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
They're looking for like a more tough guy or something.

1505
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
I don't know.

1506
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
You don't think that's right?

1507
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
I don't know.

1508
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,000
He's trying to figure it out in a picture.

1509
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:21,000
He's trying to figure out how fuckable Hans is in addition to being clumsy.

1510
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:27,000
I would say if you saw Hans in Vegas with an older woman.

1511
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Okay.

1512
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Go ahead.

1513
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Come on.

1514
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
You would think this is going to be a good story later.

1515
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Okay.

1516
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Got it.

1517
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Now I know what he looks like.

1518
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
A boyish charm.

1519
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Got it.

1520
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Got it.

1521
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Well, that's, yeah.

1522
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,200
We oftentimes lament the fact that Disneyland and Disney seems to be going away from a lot

1523
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,200
of live entertainment.

1524
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,200
Oh, is it?

1525
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:48,200
Well, just like they closed shows and there's an empty, the Hyperion theater in California

1526
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:52,200
Adventure has been empty for a while and that used to have a big elaborate Aladdin show

1527
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:53,200
and a Frozen show.

1528
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:56,200
I think it's going to get demolished for Avatar in the next five years.

1529
01:00:56,200 --> 01:01:00,200
And there's other examples of live entertainment being cut, which is very important.

1530
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:01,200
Well, yeah.

1531
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,200
To me in these parks.

1532
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,200
I'm curious what you think.

1533
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:09,200
I was with someone at Disneyland recently that has a conspiracy theory about the fireworks.

1534
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,200
Oh, can we hear it?

1535
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,200
So, no.

1536
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:13,200
Next question.

1537
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,200
Got it.

1538
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,200
All right.

1539
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,200
Oh, okay.

1540
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:21,200
So when I was there, they canceled the fireworks because of quote unquote wind.

1541
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,200
Right, right.

1542
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:23,200
Yeah.

1543
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:24,200
We could not detect any wind.

1544
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:25,200
We're looking at the trees.

1545
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:30,200
We're not seeing the trees blowing enough that fireworks couldn't happen.

1546
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:31,200
Right.

1547
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:35,200
And he is like, goes there quite a bit, this person I was with.

1548
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:39,200
And he's like, the fireworks are always canceled these days.

1549
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:42,200
And then we looked up how much it costs to do a fireworks show.

1550
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:48,200
And he's like, they're just trying to save money by pretending it's the wind.

1551
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,200
I would believe that.

1552
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,200
It's the theory.

1553
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:51,200
I believe it.

1554
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,200
Yeah.

1555
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,200
Yeah.

1556
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,200
Usually when I've seen them cancel it, it feels like it's windy.

1557
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,200
But yeah, I would believe that.

1558
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,200
Yeah.

1559
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,200
There's a lot.

1560
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:05,200
There could be a lot of costs, like downing live shows or running it a lot less sporadically,

1561
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:09,200
canceling fireworks, closing restaurants before the park closes.

1562
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,200
There's lots of ways to nickel and dime.

1563
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:15,200
It's the Disneyland version of saying the ice cream machine is broken at a McDonald's.

1564
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,200
Exactly.

1565
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,200
It's exactly that.

1566
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,200
It's exactly that.

1567
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:20,200
And I look, I know there's articles about those being hard to fix.

1568
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,200
You've sent them to me listeners and I don't care.

1569
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:23,200
I still don't believe it.

1570
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,200
That was like a new thing.

1571
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:25,200
I feel like that just came out.

1572
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,200
Yes.

1573
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,200
Like some article about ice cream machines.

1574
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,200
Yes.

1575
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,200
Yeah.

1576
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:32,200
Some sort of impossible contract and impossible.

1577
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:36,200
Like one company makes machines and only they can service them.

1578
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:37,200
Jason believes this a lot.

1579
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,200
And I think it's wrong.

1580
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:42,200
This feels like Big Donald's planting kind of a news story.

1581
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:43,200
Yes.

1582
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,200
With their power.

1583
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,200
I agree.

1584
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:46,200
Yeah.

1585
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:47,200
So I don't believe it either.

1586
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:52,200
But yeah, the big attraction that's like clearly a Disneyland thing is the big rollercoaster

1587
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,200
that looks, it's like a mountain.

1588
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,200
It looks like the Matterhorn.

1589
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,200
Yeah.

1590
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:58,200
And it like towers above everything else.

1591
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:03,200
And it's just, you can see it from a lot of parts of Copenhagen because, or downtown,

1592
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,200
it's like this Tivoli is in the middle of Copenhagen.

1593
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,200
In the middle of Copenhagen.

1594
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:10,200
And you can just see like basically the Matterhorn.

1595
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,200
It's very cool.

1596
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,200
But it's like, that's clearly where Disney got that idea.

1597
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,200
Wait, I'm confused.

1598
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:16,200
Is that the one with the person that operates it on the car?

1599
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:17,200
Yeah.

1600
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,200
Yeah, okay.

1601
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:19,200
A hand cart.

1602
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,200
Handbrake.

1603
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:21,200
There's a brake.

1604
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,200
This is very rare.

1605
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:27,200
There's only a few left in the world, but the roller coasters were right in the middle

1606
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:28,200
of the roller coasters.

1607
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:31,200
A guy operates a handbrake.

1608
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:34,200
And I saw videos where he's like standing up and waving.

1609
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,200
Yes, that's what I saw, yes.

1610
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,200
Yeah.

1611
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:41,200
Which seems like, I don't know if I like it better that there's a human being doing it.

1612
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:42,200
I don't think I do.

1613
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:43,200
I don't like it at all.

1614
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,200
Yeah, I don't think, right?

1615
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:45,200
No.

1616
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,200
Because like what if he forgets?

1617
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:47,200
Okay.

1618
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:53,200
I just mean like a computer is just going to do it unless something like a virus happens.

1619
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,200
Yes.

1620
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,200
Yeah.

1621
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,200
It's terrifying.

1622
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,200
Yeah.

1623
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:01,200
You would think, yeah, because there's literally like an old train, like a big crank, like

1624
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,200
an old train.

1625
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:05,200
There's not like a coal section where he's putting coal into an engine, but.

1626
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,200
It's crazy.

1627
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:09,200
I wonder if there's videos where he has like one ear pod in.

1628
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,200
Like if he's listening to a podcast.

1629
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,200
He's listening to a murder podcast.

1630
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:14,200
Yes.

1631
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:15,200
Yeah.

1632
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,200
And then he gets so excited he forgets to break the thing.

1633
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,200
Yeah.

1634
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:22,200
Because the climax of the podcast happens and he gets, yeah, he just gets distracted.

1635
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:27,200
I wonder what the worst thing that would happen if he doesn't do the break right would be.

1636
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:31,200
I mean, it would go sailing off the track, I'm assuming.

1637
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,200
The whole thing.

1638
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,200
It's the only one thing that could happen.

1639
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,200
Yeah, right.

1640
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:36,200
It would have to go, yeah.

1641
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:39,200
Or, I mean, maybe the worst thing is just you go around again.

1642
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,200
Maybe, actually, now that I think about it.

1643
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,200
He has to break it though at certain points in the roller.

1644
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,200
It's not just to end it at the end.

1645
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,200
Okay, yeah.

1646
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,200
So yeah, it's throughout.

1647
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:48,200
Throughout.

1648
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,200
Yeah.

1649
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:58,200
Every roller coaster at Disneyland, and imagine there's the guy on it who has to, every time there's a turn or something where they have to slow down, he has to hit a button or pull a lever.

1650
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:04,200
That should be like the highest pay, they should make like baseball player salaries to do that.

1651
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,200
Yes, I agree.

1652
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,200
Like you have many people's lives in your hands.

1653
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,200
Yes.

1654
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:08,200
Yeah.

1655
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,200
Like every roller coaster has a conductor.

1656
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:12,200
Every roller coaster has a person.

1657
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:17,200
Imagine if that was on the vagina roller coaster and the guy had to focus.

1658
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,200
Well, he'd get distracted.

1659
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,200
Yeah.

1660
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:22,200
Dead man's curve.

1661
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:23,200
You know?

1662
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:26,200
That's what I call my vagina.

1663
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:28,200
Yeah, it's so scary.

1664
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:31,200
I think I would want one on Big Thunder at Disneyland.

1665
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,200
Not a vagina, a conductor.

1666
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,200
Really?

1667
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:35,200
That would be fun.

1668
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:43,200
Because he could dress up like an old prospector, he'd have a big hat and a big beard, and then he could say stuff while the ride was going on.

1669
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,200
You get like a live performer aspect.

1670
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,200
I'm serious.

1671
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,200
Yeah.

1672
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:47,200
Like a performer aspect to Big Thunder.

1673
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,200
But you want someone going like, hold on tight, folks.

1674
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:53,200
Yeah, I want him to give me the business while the roller coaster is happening.

1675
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,200
Yeah.

1676
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,200
Yeah.

1677
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,200
Like roast me gently.

1678
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:57,200
That would be fun.

1679
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,200
Yeah.

1680
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,200
Little Ed DeBevix style roasting.

1681
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:01,200
Yes.

1682
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,200
Yeah.

1683
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:06,200
Well, yeah, the live performances are like the most special thing for sure.

1684
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:14,200
We also went to an open-air museum in Stockholm that had like the greatest musical I've ever seen in my life.

1685
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:15,200
Really?

1686
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,200
It was set in the 50s.

1687
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:19,200
I mean, in like a campy way.

1688
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:20,200
Yeah.

1689
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:31,200
And it was just about a guy whose job gave him a washing machine as like a reward for doing a good job at work, and his family being confused in the 50s about what the washing machine is.

1690
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:38,200
And like his wife worrying that if she used the washing machine, she would have too much time on her hands to think about other things.

1691
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:40,200
It's like very existential.

1692
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,200
Wow.

1693
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:44,200
There's a whole song about the man not being able to find his hat.

1694
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,200
He's a hat man and he needs to find his hat.

1695
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:47,200
That sounds good.

1696
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,200
It was honestly so good.

1697
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:52,200
We were like actually laughing.

1698
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:54,200
The performers were great.

1699
01:06:54,200 --> 01:07:01,200
And it was just in the middle of this like random like reenactmenty kind of open-air museum in Stockholm.

1700
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,200
So that kind of stuff is very special.

1701
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:04,200
Yeah.

1702
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:05,200
Yeah.

1703
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:15,200
Looking through, that was the stuff even just the Tivoli like made excited to be more than just the old ride that seems like it could fly off a track.

1704
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:16,200
And will.

1705
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,200
And might.

1706
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,200
Yeah.

1707
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:22,200
Well, although that one's been around for like 100 years, so I guess they're all experts at it.

1708
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:23,200
I don't know if this happened.

1709
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,200
I don't know what day of the week you were there.

1710
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:29,200
I'm excited by something at Tivoli called Friday Rock.

1711
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,200
We were not there for Friday Rock.

1712
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,200
What's Friday Rock?

1713
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:36,200
Friday Rock seems to be some sort of a concert series where you will get rock and roll.

1714
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:40,200
One of my favorite music genres.

1715
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:49,200
But what I was most excited is they have tribute bands like Billy Joel, the piano man from New York.

1716
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,200
A tribute to Billy Joel.

1717
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:54,200
And it looks like it also has some sort of a narrative about his career.

1718
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:58,200
Like they're doing a little story about like Billy Joel like starting out.

1719
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:00,200
A jukebox musical.

1720
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:01,200
That's what it seems.

1721
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,200
I could not find a video of it.

1722
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,200
So I don't know.

1723
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,200
That's cool.

1724
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,200
And it seems like maybe it only happens at Tivoli.

1725
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:11,200
They have the names of some of the performers and I looked those up and that didn't seem to be.

1726
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:14,200
We did see a list of names of performers.

1727
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:15,200
Yeah.

1728
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,200
But we weren't there for any of the performances.

1729
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:18,200
Yeah.

1730
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:29,200
The piano man from New York tells the musical story of Billy Joel's life and career about ups and downs and how a boy from the Bronx who would have preferred to be a professional boxer instead went on to become the world's most powerful.

1731
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:43,200
He became the world's most popular piano man with album sales of over 150 million copies and with hits such as Uptown Girl, Just the Way You Are, Tell Her About It, Honesty, New York State of Mind and of course the signature song Piano Man.

1732
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:44,200
Wow.

1733
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:47,200
So you get like a full bio of Billy Joel if you go to Friday Rock.

1734
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:49,200
They have a Tina Turner show as well.

1735
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:52,200
I don't know if I would trust them.

1736
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:55,200
You don't think in Denmark that's a safe trip?

1737
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:57,200
I'm just wondering how they would cast that.

1738
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:58,200
You know, it's a good question.

1739
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:00,200
I did not see a video and maybe there's a reason why.

1740
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,200
Yeah, they're like phones down.

1741
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:16,200
That's like, I see, I think Hamilton is starting to be done by high schools, including some high schools in the Midwest and I think, I think I see an issue.

1742
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:19,200
Listen, I was in the Wiz in high school.

1743
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:21,200
This has come up before.

1744
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:23,200
He sang a lot of Wiz in high school.

1745
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:26,200
He's on down the road in like middle school chorus.

1746
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:27,200
Yeah.

1747
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:30,200
And like spiritual, like wade in the water.

1748
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:31,200
Yes.

1749
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:32,200
Yeah.

1750
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:42,200
And yeah, looking back, I'm like, well, this spirit was correct, you know, like exposing us to new things.

1751
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:43,200
Yeah.

1752
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:45,200
But it is very funny to look back on.

1753
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:46,200
I know.

1754
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:50,200
Yeah, Hamilton taking on that role now is very special.

1755
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:52,200
They list like this Friday Rocks.

1756
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:59,200
They like in their history, they have like sort of a history on the website of different moments and they added Friday Rock.

1757
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:00,200
Like this was a big deal.

1758
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,200
1997.

1759
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:02,200
I got to go back.

1760
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:10,200
And then you have to go back and they list, they list like the first performers, the first few performers, including Danish rappers.

1761
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:13,200
Den Gale Pose, I guess.

1762
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:16,200
And I did look up what Den Gale Pose is.

1763
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:17,200
Big hit was.

1764
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:19,200
And this is the vibe of them.

1765
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:21,200
They are all in like straight jackets.

1766
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:22,200
Yeah.

1767
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:25,200
Which honestly, I don't know that the music really sounds like, but like it sounds like this.

1768
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:33,200
Wait for the Danish rapping rock and roll.

1769
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,200
Yeah, we're rocking now.

1770
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:53,200
So that's like one of the first groups that played Friday Rock.

1771
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:54,200
Wow.

1772
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:59,200
Imagine you get to watch Clumsy Hans, the ballet, and then go over to the bandstand and listen to that.

1773
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:00,200
Right.

1774
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:01,200
That would be a perfect Friday.

1775
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:02,200
I didn't understand a lick of that.

1776
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:04,200
But you understood the vibe of it.

1777
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:05,200
Oh, yeah.

1778
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:06,200
Absolutely.

1779
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:07,200
You felt it.

1780
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:11,200
I have a couple more Walt Disney things.

1781
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:12,200
OK, great.

1782
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:13,200
Yeah.

1783
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:15,200
One, there's this picture.

1784
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:24,200
So if you go on a Disney cruise that as a port stops in Copenhagen.

1785
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,200
Oh.

1786
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:29,200
As a, you know, day on land.

1787
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:30,200
Yeah.

1788
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:31,200
I'm losing the word.

1789
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,200
I can't think of the words right now.

1790
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:35,200
I don't know what the cruise ship calls it.

1791
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:36,200
A day on the land?

1792
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:37,200
It's a port.

1793
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:39,200
It's like, oh, we're stopping here and we're stopping here.

1794
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:41,200
I think you have to pay to get off the ship.

1795
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:42,200
Off the Disney cruise?

1796
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:43,200
I think so.

1797
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:47,200
I think there's an upcharge if you want to go and do their like Tivoli Gardens day.

1798
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:48,200
Like a shore day or something?

1799
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:51,200
There is the Tivoli Gardens packet.

1800
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:54,200
It's like you get, you get driven to Tivoli Gardens.

1801
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:56,200
You get the ride thing.

1802
01:11:56,200 --> 01:12:00,200
I think you get a tour and like lunch and a beer.

1803
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:01,200
Yeah.

1804
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:06,200
So, but on that page where they were talking about the Tivoli option,

1805
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:08,200
there's this picture,

1806
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:15,200
Walt Disney wearing a bearskin hat in Tivoli Gardens while a drummer boy stands by.

1807
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:18,200
And it's about what you'd think it would be.

1808
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:19,200
It's a big hat.

1809
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:20,200
Oh, yeah.

1810
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:21,200
And he's smiling.

1811
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:22,200
It's huge.

1812
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:25,200
It's like a Buckingham Palace guard hat.

1813
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:26,200
Yeah.

1814
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:30,200
And then the drummer boy, is he, is he seated at a full drum kit?

1815
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:33,200
No, he's got like the drum they wear.

1816
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:37,200
Oh, to like be in a parade, in a marching band or whatever.

1817
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:38,200
Okay.

1818
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:42,200
And he, I believe they, I believe these two are members of the Tivoli Boys' Guard.

1819
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:43,200
Yes.

1820
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:46,200
Which is like a long, they've had this forever.

1821
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:48,200
It's just a bunch of boys that are like a marching band.

1822
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:49,200
Yeah.

1823
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:51,200
And it seems like some sort of a grand tradition.

1824
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,200
Yeah.

1825
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:54,200
And I, did you see the Tivoli Boys' Guard?

1826
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:56,200
We did not see the Tivoli Boys' Guard.

1827
01:12:56,200 --> 01:13:05,200
However, the changing of the guard in Copenhagen, I'm like trying to, you don't want to mistake

1828
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:08,200
the, the Stockholm and the Copenhagen change.

1829
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:09,200
Yeah, yeah.

1830
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:10,200
If the guard people would come for me.

1831
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,200
Right.

1832
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:12,200
So fast.

1833
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:18,200
But, so the one in Copenhagen is pretty young people and they march every day, like a long

1834
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:20,200
ways through the city.

1835
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:21,200
Okay.

1836
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:25,200
It's like the biggest waste of time.

1837
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:28,200
They seem kind of proud to be doing it, but it's like, why are you all doing?

1838
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:32,200
Like it's so antiquated, but it is just this grand tradition.

1839
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:37,200
So they love to march in formation from place to place and have it be like a daily tradition.

1840
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:38,200
Interesting.

1841
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:41,200
So they're like passing an Apple store and each and them.

1842
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:42,200
Yes.

1843
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:43,200
Yeah.

1844
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:44,200
Yes.

1845
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:46,200
It's through like the shopping district of Copenhagen.

1846
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:49,200
Well, then you can be like, hey, sorry, I was like getting back from lunch.

1847
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,200
The marching was going on.

1848
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:54,200
I got stuck by the changing of the guard.

1849
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:55,200
Yeah.

1850
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:56,200
Yeah.

1851
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:57,200
Interesting.

1852
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:59,200
I mean, Disneyland still has marching band.

1853
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:00,200
Yeah.

1854
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:04,200
There is still like a hold over like feeling of like the people want to see people march

1855
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:05,200
and play their instruments.

1856
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:06,200
It feels sinister.

1857
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:08,200
Well, that's the way I put it.

1858
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:09,200
Yes.

1859
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:10,200
Say they enjoy the music.

1860
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:11,200
They want to hear brass.

1861
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:12,200
Yes.

1862
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:16,200
They want to hear a big brass version of, I just can't wait to be king or something.

1863
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:17,200
Yeah, right.

1864
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:18,200
But yeah, the Tivoli boy.

1865
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:19,200
I don't know.

1866
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:23,200
I should have looked up like what age you have to leave the Tivoli boys guard because like

1867
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:25,200
it feels like you can't be an older man.

1868
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:26,200
Right.

1869
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:27,200
And be in the boys guard anymore.

1870
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:30,200
There's just a guy like every day shaving his like five o'clock shot.

1871
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:33,200
Please let me stay.

1872
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:36,200
They force him out and he's like shell shocked PTSD.

1873
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:37,200
Yeah.

1874
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:40,200
So he just goes and joins the French Foreign League.

1875
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:45,200
There's that one place in Paris you can just show up and knock on the door and join the

1876
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:46,200
French Foreign Legion.

1877
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:47,200
Yeah.

1878
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:52,200
There's like a gateway right from the boys guard into that.

1879
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:54,200
It's a straight line.

1880
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:55,200
Yeah.

1881
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:58,200
Another Disney connection.

1882
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:08,200
The founder of Tivoli Gardens, George Carstensen said in 1844, Tivoli will never, so to speak,

1883
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:09,200
be finished.

1884
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:16,200
And then a hundred plus years later, Walt Disney says Disneyland will never be complete.

1885
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:21,200
It will continue to grow as long as there is imagination left in the world.

1886
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:22,200
Whoa.

1887
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:23,200
So sort of stole it.

1888
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:24,200
Yeah.

1889
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:25,200
He did steal it.

1890
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:29,200
I wonder if it's it's definitely true of Disneyland.

1891
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:30,200
Yeah.

1892
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:31,200
Yeah.

1893
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:32,200
They're always tweaking that.

1894
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:33,200
They're always doing something.

1895
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:34,200
Yeah.

1896
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:35,200
Yeah.

1897
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:36,200
They're always up to no good.

1898
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:39,200
They're always keeping all the fireworks to themselves.

1899
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:46,200
I do wonder if they're like renovate like I don't know Tivoli felt done or something

1900
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:48,200
like but it is in the middle of the city.

1901
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:50,200
So there's kind of only so I guess they could like redo things.

1902
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:55,200
Somewhat recently they added a little bit, but it's like I think real estate is hard

1903
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:56,200
to come by.

1904
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:57,200
So yes, it's not.

1905
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:59,200
There's not an easy way to expand it.

1906
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:00,200
Yeah.

1907
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:03,200
You're going to run into like a monument pretty fast.

1908
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:04,200
Yes.

1909
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,200
You can't do anything about it.

1910
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:06,200
It is.

1911
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:07,200
I think it's called.

1912
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:08,200
It's called Demon.

1913
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:09,200
Yes.

1914
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:10,200
Yes.

1915
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:11,200
Yes.

1916
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:15,200
Which is like a B&M full on like metal roller coaster.

1917
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:18,200
It's a roller coaster manufacturer.

1918
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:26,200
So that is there next to like the beautiful pagoda and the pond or lake or whatever.

1919
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:27,200
Yeah.

1920
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:32,200
It's part of a whole like like Asian style.

1921
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:37,200
There's like Midway games, but it's like like Asian like it's just like this beautifully

1922
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:41,200
themed lanterns and like dragons and stuff.

1923
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:47,200
And then there's like an old west themed part like a vaguely old west part too.

1924
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:48,200
Yeah.

1925
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:50,200
Can I say something about George Carstensen?

1926
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:53,200
And I don't want to get off on a whole thing here.

1927
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:57,200
And maybe this is just because the glasses are similar.

1928
01:16:57,200 --> 01:17:01,200
But Jason, do you resemble George Carstensen?

1929
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:04,200
I think there's a picture of you.

1930
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:05,200
There's a picture of him with glass.

1931
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:07,200
You used to have small glasses.

1932
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:08,200
I think that's what I'm responding to.

1933
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:12,200
I don't think you look like him necessarily, but there is like a high school photo of you

1934
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:17,200
that I've seen where I do think you resemble Tivoli Gardens founder George Carstensen.

1935
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:18,200
Do you see what I'm saying?

1936
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:21,200
At least I'm not saying this is an exact situation.

1937
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:24,200
I unfortunately see what you're saying.

1938
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:27,200
OK, there's I think I think it's mostly glasses.

1939
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:29,200
You never had your hair like this.

1940
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:31,200
No.

1941
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:32,200
Oh, dude, did you?

1942
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:38,200
Not on purpose, but I think 2011, 2012, I let my hair.

1943
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:40,200
I just let my hair grow.

1944
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:42,200
And it kind of feathered.

1945
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:44,200
It kind of curled at the ends.

1946
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:45,200
Right.

1947
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:51,200
So I think there's an old photo that just there's a and I think really what it is is not even necessarily features.

1948
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:53,200
It's more the vibe of the photo.

1949
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:54,200
I was going to say it's the vibe.

1950
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:56,200
It's the vibe of the photo and the glasses.

1951
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:57,200
Yeah.

1952
01:17:57,200 --> 01:18:00,200
And I think we've got to put the pictures next to each other.

1953
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:07,200
You have kind of the vibe of a Danish man who died at age 44 in 1857.

1954
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:08,200
Thank you so much.

1955
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:09,200
You're so welcome.

1956
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:10,200
I did.

1957
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:11,200
But he created he created magic.

1958
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:14,200
He's the reason we have Disneyland in the current condition.

1959
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:15,200
You know what? I'll take it.

1960
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:22,200
And I looked I looked for bad stuff about him and I didn't find it because I usually when we do this, you're like, OK, what did he do?

1961
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:23,200
Yeah.

1962
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:27,200
But I don't there was I maybe I didn't dig deep enough, but it seemed like he served in the military.

1963
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:29,200
He started this. He went to the king.

1964
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:30,200
He got permission for this.

1965
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:31,200
All above board.

1966
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:32,200
All above board.

1967
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:34,200
And then 44 he died of pneumonia.

1968
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:36,200
Yeah.

1969
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:41,200
But yes, that's that's there's we'll we'll post this online and you can tell us.

1970
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:42,200
We need a picture.

1971
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:43,200
Yeah.

1972
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:44,200
Side by side.

1973
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:45,200
Yeah.

1974
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:46,200
We'll do a side by side.

1975
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:50,200
I was looking some of this park was destroyed during World War Two.

1976
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:51,200
Yeah.

1977
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:52,200
Because.

1978
01:18:52,200 --> 01:19:00,200
Well, it's old enough because I was like, wait, did either of the wars affect the Nazis?

1979
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:01,200
Sure enough.

1980
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:04,200
Denmark said we're not getting involved.

1981
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:06,200
They were probably taken over by the Nazis.

1982
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:08,200
They're too close to Germany.

1983
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:09,200
They're they're right.

1984
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:10,200
But up against Germany.

1985
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:11,200
Right.

1986
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:15,200
But then they were attacked because they were Nazi territory.

1987
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:16,200
Yes.

1988
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:17,200
Doesn't seem like a damage was great.

1989
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:18,200
They were close for like two weeks.

1990
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:21,200
It just burned down like one roller coaster or something or one.

1991
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:22,200
Yeah.

1992
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:23,200
One building.

1993
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:24,200
Yeah.

1994
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:26,200
Quickly rebuilt and reopened.

1995
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:27,200
Yeah.

1996
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:29,200
I was like, that two weeks is nothing.

1997
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:32,200
Well, one fun thing about Copenhagen.

1998
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:37,200
And this is not really about Tivoli, but is and it wasn't Nazis in general.

1999
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:44,200
But every building in Copenhagen has burned down like multiple times.

2000
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:47,200
And I don't know if this is true.

2001
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:52,200
But we went on like a tour and our tour guide said that it was a combination of like it's cold.

2002
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:53,200
You know, it's cold and dark.

2003
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:57,200
You have to like have a fire going at all times.

2004
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:58,200
It's cold and dark.

2005
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:04,200
People are drinking a lot and the water is frozen so they can't like put out the fires.

2006
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:05,200
Right.

2007
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:08,200
And so it wasn't a Nazi thing in that way.

2008
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:10,200
But at Tivoli, it was a Nazi thing.

2009
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:16,200
So one way or another, a building in Copenhagen is going to burn down and be rebuilt at least once.

2010
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:23,200
The talk of old rides was making me think about the early, early days of Coney Island.

2011
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:32,200
And some of the original Coney Island stuff is you were really taking your life in your hands.

2012
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:39,200
We're not 100 percent on the physics of like sending someone upside down.

2013
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:48,200
And some of that stuff is not around anymore just because they would just constantly burn down in Coney Island.

2014
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:57,200
There was just so many cheapy slapdash haunted houses or shoot the shoots or rollercoaster, whatever.

2015
01:20:57,200 --> 01:21:00,200
Like it's a miracle the cyclone has survived.

2016
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:03,200
Well, the cyclone is so painful to ride.

2017
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:04,200
I hear that.

2018
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:06,200
I threw my back out so badly on the cyclone.

2019
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:11,200
And when I was in New York before I went to Scandinavia, we went to Coney Island.

2020
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:14,200
We were like, should we take our lives into our hands and go on the cyclone?

2021
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:16,200
And we're like, no, we have like a two week trip ahead of us.

2022
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:18,200
Let's not throw our back out today.

2023
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:20,200
But it's the most painful ride I've ever been on.

2024
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:21,200
Wow.

2025
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:22,200
Yeah.

2026
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:23,200
Geez.

2027
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,200
Yeah.

2028
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:27,200
It seems like you love amusement parks, but they really have not been treating you well.

2029
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:32,200
I think I'm just a weak, feeble, easily rattled person maybe.

2030
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:33,200
Okay.

2031
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:35,200
So you have to like toughen up before you go to your next one?

2032
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:36,200
Yeah.

2033
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:38,200
I'm going to need to go into some training, some combat training.

2034
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:39,200
Okay.

2035
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:40,200
Before I go back.

2036
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:42,200
Can I real quick?

2037
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:43,200
Back to Carstensen.

2038
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:44,200
Just real quick.

2039
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:51,200
He obtained a five year charter to Create Tivoli by telling King Christian that when

2040
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:54,200
the people are amusing themselves, they do not think about politics.

2041
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:59,200
So that was his big sales pitch is that they're not going to hassle you, King, if they're

2042
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:02,200
on a little ride or if they're seeing like fun lights.

2043
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:03,200
Yeah.

2044
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:04,200
I guess he's right.

2045
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:05,200
Yeah.

2046
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:09,200
So I feel I don't know that he was like helping the King do anything nefarious, but it kind

2047
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:10,200
of seems like he could have been.

2048
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:11,200
Yeah.

2049
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:12,200
Throw them on the polyp.

2050
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:13,200
Right.

2051
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:15,200
They'll never think about anything ever again.

2052
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:17,200
They won't notice you stealing from them.

2053
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:18,200
Yeah.

2054
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:23,200
If they're eating a big churro or whatever version of that they had a hundred years ago,

2055
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:25,200
180 years ago.

2056
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:33,200
Let me ask, because obviously we talked about Perot and being the mascot of Bakken.

2057
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:36,200
Did you meet Rasmus Klump and his friends?

2058
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:41,200
I thought you might ask about Rasmus Klump and his friends.

2059
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:42,200
I knew it would come to this.

2060
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:46,200
I knew Rasmus would weasel his little way in here.

2061
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:52,200
And no, but we saw little sculptures of them and took a lot of pictures in like kind of

2062
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:57,200
the kids area in the Rasmus Klump area.

2063
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:59,200
And it's adorable.

2064
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,200
Yeah.

2065
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:04,200
The other thing we saw over there and I don't know when it was built and I was like trying

2066
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:08,200
to figure it out is, you know, like Monstro the whale.

2067
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:09,200
Yes.

2068
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:13,200
And there's like there's like a similar looking thing at Tivoli Gardens.

2069
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:14,200
Oh.

2070
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:15,200
And you go inside the mouth.

2071
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:18,200
It's a little like souvenir store.

2072
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:21,200
So it's not a ride.

2073
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:22,200
Right.

2074
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:23,200
Right.

2075
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:24,200
Present day.

2076
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:26,200
And I don't know how it started, but it is a giant whale where you it looks the same

2077
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:28,200
as just a different color.

2078
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:30,200
And you go in the mouth.

2079
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:32,200
So that could be a similar theft.

2080
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:36,200
It could be, although I guess it's also the story from the story.

2081
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:37,200
Pinocchio.

2082
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:38,200
Yeah.

2083
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:39,200
But I thought that was interesting.

2084
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:41,200
That was near Rasmus Klump.

2085
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:42,200
Oh, okay.

2086
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:46,200
And the merchandise in the whale's mouth did not live up to your expectations.

2087
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:48,200
No, the merch was quite weak.

2088
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:53,200
A lot of it was just general like Danish like national merch.

2089
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:54,200
Okay.

2090
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:59,200
I wouldn't need to ever buy Lego like they're really into Legos, of course.

2091
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:00,200
Oh, yeah.

2092
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:05,200
And like just like a tie with like the Danish flag on it and stuff.

2093
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:07,200
So I wanted some kitschier.

2094
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:08,200
Yeah.

2095
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:13,200
I really wanted kitschy Bakken merch, but that did simply did not exist.

2096
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:16,200
What would your dream merch have been from either place?

2097
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:18,200
Oh, that's a good question.

2098
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:25,200
Maybe like a t-shirt with like a poorly translated maybe a t-shirt with the Hans Christian Andersen

2099
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:28,200
spiel on it from the Flying Trunk Ride.

2100
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:29,200
Okay.

2101
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:33,200
Or like, yeah, I like a thing that's like specific to one ride.

2102
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:34,200
Yeah.

2103
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:35,200
I agree.

2104
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:39,200
Maybe some socks with like the whale on it or I don't know.

2105
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:43,200
There's a lot of options, merchandising options that they're not tapping into.

2106
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:44,200
Yeah.

2107
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:46,200
Would you have bought a clumsy Han action figure?

2108
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:49,200
I would have bought a clumsy Hans anything.

2109
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:51,200
I would have I would have stocked up.

2110
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:56,200
I would have bought a second suitcase to get home with just clumsy Han stuff in it.

2111
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:57,200
Wow.

2112
01:24:57,200 --> 01:25:00,200
I would have bought a series of plush like a plush Hans.

2113
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:01,200
A plush Hans.

2114
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:02,200
Yeah.

2115
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:03,200
The hobby or a hobby goat he rides.

2116
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:04,200
The goat.

2117
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:05,200
That's a no brainer.

2118
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:06,200
Goat on a stick.

2119
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:07,200
That's an easy thing to make.

2120
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:09,200
Oh, that's your carry on.

2121
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:10,200
Yeah.

2122
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:11,200
You ride that thing onto the plane.

2123
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:15,200
I would have gotten a second seat for my goat on a stick.

2124
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:16,200
Yeah.

2125
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:17,200
If they had been selling that.

2126
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:18,200
The International Flight.

2127
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:19,200
It's fine.

2128
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:20,200
You can afford it.

2129
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:21,200
Yeah, who cares?

2130
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:22,200
Who cares?

2131
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:23,200
You should.

2132
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:26,200
And do you think anyone's actively pitching a clumsy Hans TV show in America?

2133
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:27,200
Does who owns that?

2134
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:30,200
Do they own the IP of clumsy clumsy Hans?

2135
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:32,200
It must be.

2136
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:35,200
Well, the government maybe owns it.

2137
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:37,200
Is it a Hans Christian Andersen?

2138
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:38,200
That's a good question.

2139
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:40,200
It might be public domain at this point.

2140
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:41,200
Clumsy Hans.

2141
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:42,200
It might be you.

2142
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:45,200
This might be on you to pitch this.

2143
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:46,200
Well, yeah, you should pitch it.

2144
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:47,200
But I.

2145
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:48,200
I'm going to buy it real quick.

2146
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:49,200
So you have to pay me.

2147
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:50,200
Yeah, we should.

2148
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:51,200
Yeah.

2149
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:52,200
Oh, yeah.

2150
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:53,200
Hans Christian Andersen.

2151
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:54,200
Clumsy Hans.

2152
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:55,200
It is one of his stories.

2153
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:56,200
That's interesting.

2154
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:57,200
And he named him Hans.

2155
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:58,200
Right.

2156
01:25:58,200 --> 01:25:59,560
So I wonder if he felt he was clumsy.

2157
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:04,120
But then that makes a lot more sense because he's actually thinks he's like cool.

2158
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:05,120
So he's right.

2159
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:06,120
Oh, this guy's so clumsy.

2160
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:07,120
I'm so clumsy.

2161
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:08,120
I'm so quirky.

2162
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:09,920
It's probably darker in the fairy tale, though, right?

2163
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,640
Like he probably died of.

2164
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:12,640
He killed a bunch of people.

2165
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:13,640
Consumption or killed people.

2166
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:14,640
Yeah.

2167
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:15,640
Oh, his clumsiness.

2168
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:16,640
Clumsy Hans.

2169
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:17,640
Let the slaughter.

2170
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:19,880
It's a short story for children by Danish author Hans Christian Andersen.

2171
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:24,400
It was first published as part of an anthology stories, 1855, public domain.

2172
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:25,880
Oh, baby.

2173
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:29,840
You're going to have competing pitches in this room for Clumsy Hans going forward

2174
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:31,920
so we can do some.

2175
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:35,560
Jason will do like a horror movie version like those Winnie the Pooh,

2176
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,080
like those Winnie the Pooh ones.

2177
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:39,720
And then there's the Steamboat Willie, of course, now coming out

2178
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:42,440
direct to DV like he's a killer and Mickey.

2179
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:42,960
Oh, my God.

2180
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:43,560
Wait, is that real?

2181
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:44,320
Yeah, it is real.

2182
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:46,520
A killer Steamboat Willie.

2183
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:48,640
Yeah, just Steamboat Willie.

2184
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:50,480
He just is in the public domain.

2185
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:51,240
I see.

2186
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:52,960
But not the other Mickey's.

2187
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:53,760
Oh, not yet.

2188
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:54,680
But why is he a killer?

2189
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:55,360
That didn't.

2190
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:56,160
Why is he a murderer?

2191
01:26:56,160 --> 01:26:56,960
Sorry.

2192
01:26:56,960 --> 01:27:00,200
Because people are just like running with the public domain.

2193
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:02,080
Like, what if it was fucked up?

2194
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:03,160
Cool.

2195
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:03,760
Yeah, yeah.

2196
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:05,760
So you can do that with Clumsy Hans.

2197
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:07,160
OK, that's good to know.

2198
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:09,520
I have more Rasmus Klump stuff.

2199
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:14,160
Would you have bought a plush of Klump?

2200
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:15,720
No, because it's just a bear.

2201
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:16,360
Oh, OK.

2202
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:18,920
I didn't go through all 80 of the books,

2203
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:21,680
but on the website, it says,

2204
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:25,200
learn more about Pele Pelican,

2205
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:29,080
Pingo Penguin and all the other good friends.

2206
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:33,360
Discover who Rasmus Klump's ship is named after,

2207
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:38,480
what Skeeg Sea Lion's most prized possession is

2208
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:42,400
and who loves playing cards, but hates losing.

2209
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:45,000
Wait, so Rasmus Klump is a gambler?

2210
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:46,640
Well, we don't know.

2211
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:47,320
We don't know.

2212
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:48,160
There's mysteries.

2213
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:49,920
It could be Pingo.

2214
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:51,080
It could be Pele.

2215
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:52,360
It could be Skag.

2216
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:53,360
Skank?

2217
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:53,960
Skank?

2218
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:54,640
It could be Skank.

2219
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:56,520
It could be Pingo.

2220
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:57,040
Wow.

2221
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:59,000
So these are there's a series of books.

2222
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:02,280
Yeah, I think they're a beloved series of children's books.

2223
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:04,240
They're comic strips, I see.

2224
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:04,840
Oh, OK.

2225
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:06,920
They don't use speech balloons.

2226
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:07,440
Oh, interesting.

2227
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:10,120
It can be classified as a text comic.

2228
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:10,720
And it was created.

2229
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:13,080
It was 1951 when it started.

2230
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:14,680
So that is not public domain yet.

2231
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:16,560
Well, I have to say,

2232
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:22,760
Rasmus Klump was, to me, reminiscent of the like cartoons and mascots at Knotts.

2233
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:24,000
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

2234
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,760
That like bearer family and then like the like naughty

2235
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:31,560
foxes or whatever that are trying to steal their boys and berry pies.

2236
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:32,840
Yes. Yes.

2237
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:35,280
It felt that a little bit to me.

2238
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:36,720
Without the naughty foxes.

2239
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:38,960
The berry, the berry tales bears.

2240
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:41,240
The boys. Yeah, there's boys and berries and girls and berries.

2241
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:43,440
Girls and berries. Yes.

2242
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:45,800
And what's that?

2243
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:46,440
We all know.

2244
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:50,120
So maybe Mr. Knotts also paid a visit.

2245
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:52,560
Oh, Walter. Walter Knotts.

2246
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:54,920
Yeah. Walter Knotts, actually.

2247
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:56,160
Knotts. Yeah.

2248
01:28:56,160 --> 01:28:58,600
It's the apostrophe is right.

2249
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:00,360
Before the S. Right.

2250
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:01,960
Yeah. Yeah.

2251
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:04,760
I that's a good did Walter Knotts ever visit Tivoli Gardens

2252
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:07,320
because Walter also stole from Knotts. Yeah.

2253
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,200
So I wonder if Walter also did some theft.

2254
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:11,520
That's interesting.

2255
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:16,200
Like later passed on some proprietary information to both of them, perhaps.

2256
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:18,560
Yeah, that's a good question. Yeah.

2257
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:19,880
We'll have to look into that.

2258
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:22,200
There's a lot of things I got to look into now after this episode.

2259
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:27,920
So the wonders of Europe, of Scandinavia.

2260
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:30,720
I don't know anything about world history, but I do want to know more

2261
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:33,240
about Rasmus Klump and his friends.

2262
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:35,040
That is a priority.

2263
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:37,120
Nasty, weird friends.

2264
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:38,560
One of them likes to gamble.

2265
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:43,240
But you have to read all the books to find out who it is or look at the books.

2266
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:44,800
There's never words.

2267
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:47,080
No, there is. Yeah, it says there are words.

2268
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:51,560
It seems like a lot of captions, but not word bubbles.

2269
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:55,720
Not word bubbles. The words are underneath underneath the pictures.

2270
01:29:55,720 --> 01:29:58,960
They're underneath the cards. I've read the books.

2271
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:00,680
Look, the books.

2272
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:03,440
Look, I don't there's I don't know what else to describe it.

2273
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:07,040
But the book picture of the books, I go, oh, there's got to be something bad in here.

2274
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:10,880
Like it's old school, like cartoon stuff where I just started immediately going,

2275
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:12,880
oh, those feel like there's going to be something inappropriate

2276
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:14,640
or racist in one of these. Almost certainly.

2277
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:16,920
Yeah. 1951. Yeah. Yeah.

2278
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:18,560
Some children smoking cigarettes.

2279
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:20,280
Maybe they're fine. Maybe I'm maybe I'm wrong.

2280
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:22,800
Maybe I'm thinking something bad about Rasmus Klump.

2281
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:25,920
Those like all the tin tin books.

2282
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:28,240
Yeah. There's some rough stuff.

2283
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:29,760
Yeah, I'm sure there's bad stuff.

2284
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:32,160
Jason will read all these books and report back to us.

2285
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:34,960
Shit. You could you could read them so fast.

2286
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:38,160
It would only take you like three years to read all of these children's books.

2287
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:41,160
Oh, man, Jason, I don't want to say again that you might resemble a character,

2288
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:44,720
but this picture of Rasmus Klump looking at all these pancakes.

2289
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:47,520
That really gives me a Jason vibe right there.

2290
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:49,840
Yeah. So kind of like you.

2291
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:53,200
And he's got like a he's got like a knit cap on and no shirt.

2292
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:55,800
Yeah. But he's like a freshman.

2293
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:57,400
Rasmus has a cap.

2294
01:30:57,400 --> 01:30:59,280
Yeah, he has a freshman cap on.

2295
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:03,120
He's wearing I have answered to the freshman cap question that I will say at the end.

2296
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:06,680
He's wearing a Mike, Mike Nesmith from the Monkeys hat.

2297
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:10,240
That's again, a reference that's older than Gilligan's Island.

2298
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:12,840
Yeah. But yeah, he's I mean, he's fun looking.

2299
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:15,440
So it's a shame you didn't see him in person.

2300
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:21,400
Yeah, I feel like also the need to say that I didn't just go to theme parks.

2301
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:24,440
I did so much highbrow stuff.

2302
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:25,880
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2303
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:30,440
All the museums I've sure looked at from the inside.

2304
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:36,800
Was this trip anything specific you were going for or?

2305
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:39,880
It was no, no, just just for fun.

2306
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:41,200
Just visiting Europe.

2307
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:43,920
Just visiting a part of Europe I hadn't been to.

2308
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:44,920
Oh, OK. Yeah.

2309
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:47,680
What is and if you're uncomfortable saying that's OK.

2310
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:52,400
But what was the percentage of theme parks to actual museums and historical sites?

2311
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:55,280
I went to only two theme parks total.

2312
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:58,440
OK. And it was Bakken and Tivoli.

2313
01:31:58,480 --> 01:31:59,640
One day each.

2314
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:01,880
One, not even a full day.

2315
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:03,080
OK. Half a day.

2316
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:06,520
OK. Tops each because they're little, which is nice.

2317
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:09,320
Right. It's not like Disneyland or Disney World.

2318
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,680
That's better than when we when Lindsay and I went to Japan.

2319
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:15,720
And it was like half Disney, half Japan.

2320
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:18,440
Yeah, that would be a concern for me.

2321
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:21,120
Yeah, I would have to build in many extra days.

2322
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:22,280
Yeah. Yeah.

2323
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:23,040
I mean, we went to it.

2324
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:27,120
Well, I guess going to Sanrio Pearl and in my mind counts.

2325
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:28,600
That's like a museum.

2326
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:30,160
There's a museum. Right.

2327
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:31,400
Yes, exactly.

2328
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:33,080
And there was only half day.

2329
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:34,320
So that was fine.

2330
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:38,320
Yeah, we were we was a more shameful visit in a lot of ways and what you're describing.

2331
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:40,760
OK, good. Yeah, I feel great about myself.

2332
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:45,160
Yeah, because also Disney, it being I mean, on one hand, you have Tokyo Disney

2333
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:48,320
Sea, which is the best theme park in the world, supposedly even it is.

2334
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:49,920
I mean, it's amazing. I haven't been to every park.

2335
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:52,760
But then on the other hand, you're going to like an American Disney park

2336
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:54,160
in another country. Yeah.

2337
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:56,480
And even though they're very proud of it, I'm just saying it's not like

2338
01:32:56,720 --> 01:33:00,040
I went to see the sights and the culture. Right.

2339
01:33:00,040 --> 01:33:01,920
As much. Yeah, it's yeah.

2340
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:03,080
You did fine is what I'm saying.

2341
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:06,080
OK, well, I hope you're going to do some introspection about your

2342
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:08,240
his choices. Yeah.

2343
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:10,840
That's what this podcast is for in general.

2344
01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:12,520
He's saying out loud what I've done.

2345
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:14,280
Yeah. And reckoning with it.

2346
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:17,040
And Jason, what have you done?

2347
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:19,880
Oh, very little comparatively.

2348
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,160
Oh, OK. I have not been to Japan.

2349
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:26,160
Did you have and you did bring notes.

2350
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:28,480
Did we hit all of your notes, by the way?

2351
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:32,720
Oh, well, that's just because it's a lot of Danish words and stuff.

2352
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:36,080
I think we did pretty good pronunciation wise.

2353
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:38,480
I wouldn't agree with that. Oh, OK.

2354
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:41,760
Maybe I'm just at least maybe I'm not thinking quality.

2355
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:43,440
Maybe I'm just thinking quantity.

2356
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:46,920
Those Danish rappers, I know I did a bad job naming them.

2357
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:48,120
There's no way that was right.

2358
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:50,160
No, I've already forgotten what I said.

2359
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:53,920
But I think you both leapt in with fearlessness.

2360
01:33:54,680 --> 01:33:57,040
Oh, like a clumsy Hans.

2361
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:58,400
I'm proud of you both.

2362
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,640
Thank you. Wow.

2363
01:33:59,640 --> 01:34:01,160
That's rare that a guest says that about.

2364
01:34:01,160 --> 01:34:02,160
Oh, you know what?

2365
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:05,520
The main ride, I think, at Tivoli that we haven't talked about,

2366
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:08,080
like the big other than like the mountain

2367
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:10,880
coaster that you can see is the star flyer.

2368
01:34:11,240 --> 01:34:13,880
That's like the thing you would picture,

2369
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:18,400
which is the swings that swing around, you know,

2370
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:21,320
and you know what I'm talking about.

2371
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:22,480
I kind of don't.

2372
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:23,920
Yeah, like the big swing ride.

2373
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:25,920
Yeah, big swing ride where, you know, you have a little seats

2374
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:27,320
and you're outside. Oh, swing.

2375
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:29,480
OK, I I was pictured.

2376
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:30,320
No, I was pictured.

2377
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:33,000
I was trying to remember which ride you got ill on.

2378
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,840
And I thought it was similar.

2379
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:39,600
But actual swings, actual little one seat.

2380
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:41,160
Yeah, I like those.

2381
01:34:41,160 --> 01:34:43,480
It's humongous. It's so tall.

2382
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:45,240
Right. It looks scary to me.

2383
01:34:45,240 --> 01:34:46,040
Yeah, I did.

2384
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:49,720
I didn't go on it again due to my lingering motion sickness.

2385
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:52,960
But it looked even if I had been able to,

2386
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:54,560
it might have been too scary, too high.

2387
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:56,960
Because I get very stressed when my legs are dangling.

2388
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:58,680
Yeah. And especially if it feels like you're on

2389
01:34:58,680 --> 01:35:03,360
this like a rickety piece of metal hanging from a chain.

2390
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:04,920
Yes. Thank you.

2391
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:10,960
Hanging from like old chains is like dirty, old, dirty, old Tivoli chains.

2392
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:12,880
I mean, Disneyland has one of the California

2393
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:13,960
Adventures got something like that.

2394
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:15,960
And we did it a couple of years ago and I hadn't done it for a while.

2395
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:17,520
And I was like, I'm scared.

2396
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:19,480
Was it scary? Yes. Yeah.

2397
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:22,360
Like I'm flying right out into the water or on the pavement.

2398
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:26,080
This goes like twice as high as anyone's in America.

2399
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:27,560
It is high. Isn't that insane?

2400
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:30,200
I want to ride this right now.

2401
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:32,280
Really? I like to be up high.

2402
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:34,600
I like to be very high.

2403
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:36,800
You want to jump off the stratosphere?

2404
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:38,640
Well, the more.

2405
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:40,200
OK, I do.

2406
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:41,680
You declared that. I'm not lying.

2407
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:43,720
Can your app points get you there?

2408
01:35:43,720 --> 01:35:46,720
Oh, no, it's actually a different owner.

2409
01:35:46,720 --> 01:35:47,960
It's not an MGM.

2410
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:50,120
OK, all of them.

2411
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:53,240
All the big Caesars has their own app.

2412
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:55,000
MGM has her own.

2413
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,600
This is complicated.

2414
01:35:56,600 --> 01:36:01,080
The more I've learned about the stratosphere, the more it seems like.

2415
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:05,760
Real Excalibur vibes, like seen better days.

2416
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:06,720
Yeah, you know, yeah.

2417
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:09,320
So you're saying it's not a professional jumping off the hotel.

2418
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:13,160
So I'm a little more trepidations about jumping off.

2419
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:15,160
You know, bungee jumping? No.

2420
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:16,320
But you want to.

2421
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:17,640
I would consider it.

2422
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:19,560
Well, that's the same as isn't it the same?

2423
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:23,080
I know. I'm just saying I just it makes me nervous

2424
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:24,760
learning about the stratosphere.

2425
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:27,080
What element of the stratosphere, though, make you nervous?

2426
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:30,120
Stuff being broken or closed so much.

2427
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:32,360
An Elitch Gardens vibe.

2428
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:35,080
So you're saying like a like a bar closes down on the stratosphere

2429
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:39,320
and that makes you doubt the quality of the safety, safety running.

2430
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:41,360
I think just overall.

2431
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:43,120
So I look into it more.

2432
01:36:43,120 --> 01:36:45,560
Yeah, I also.

2433
01:36:45,640 --> 01:36:48,400
I would need to get contacts to do it.

2434
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:50,080
This is what he's been saying for years.

2435
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:53,480
I've been saying that this is an excuse for why he hasn't done it for years.

2436
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:54,920
I'm blind as a bat without my glasses.

2437
01:36:54,920 --> 01:36:59,080
OK, so I would want to see everything.

2438
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:03,600
Right. Because you have like a panoramic view of the city

2439
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:04,600
and the surrounding area.

2440
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:06,520
You know what it looks like. Come on.

2441
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:09,360
But I want to see what I'm falling towards, too.

2442
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:11,000
I have a new theory.

2443
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
You don't actually want to do it.

2444
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:17,600
I think this contact thing is a sneaky little excuse

2445
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:19,920
to have a big, big talk.

2446
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:22,600
The contact is not a make or break thing.

2447
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:24,960
Oh, OK. OK. The safety.

2448
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:31,400
I just think I feel like they close the rides a lot or like there's issues.

2449
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:35,520
Like, it just makes me a little more nervous than I was a few years ago.

2450
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:38,400
Would you have done the Tom Cruise end of Olympics stunt

2451
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:42,360
where he kind of like ziplined down from the top of like

2452
01:37:42,360 --> 01:37:45,000
whatever arena they were in or stadium stadium?

2453
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:48,360
Yeah, that seemed like pretty casual for him.

2454
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:53,400
Yeah. I'm wondering if he wanted it to be more hardcore.

2455
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:56,400
Well, in what way? He didn't stand on the Hollywood sign.

2456
01:37:56,720 --> 01:37:58,280
Like that was cool. Yeah.

2457
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:01,400
Yeah, but that's not as crazy as ziplining from the top of a stadium.

2458
01:38:01,400 --> 01:38:03,680
That looked kind of fun. It did look fun.

2459
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:06,320
We did. Would you go on or did you go on?

2460
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:07,840
It probably doesn't exist anymore.

2461
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:10,080
The New Jersey Six Flags, the like what was it called?

2462
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:12,040
The Kunda Ka or whatever.

2463
01:38:12,040 --> 01:38:17,400
Kingda Ka is still I haven't gone on it because every time I went there,

2464
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:19,200
it was closed, often broken.

2465
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:23,280
It's kind of a logistically difficult ride.

2466
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:28,320
It would often like shoot up and not make it all the way up.

2467
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:31,640
Which it's it's built in to like slide back.

2468
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:34,800
So, oh, good. I think that means it's working.

2469
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:36,520
Right. Built to not work.

2470
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:39,280
Yeah, it's built to occasionally work.

2471
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:41,680
They should have somebody on the ride all at all times, though,

2472
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:44,360
to like a guy with a little lever.

2473
01:38:44,360 --> 01:38:45,520
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

2474
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:50,600
I we we talked, I think, with Dan Klein about that years ago.

2475
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:55,400
Yeah. And I cannot remember if he successfully got on,

2476
01:38:55,400 --> 01:38:57,680
but it wasn't from a lack of trying. Yeah.

2477
01:38:57,960 --> 01:38:59,800
But I haven't been there.

2478
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:02,840
I think I was there when it was open and was just down.

2479
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:04,160
It just wasn't running.

2480
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:07,120
So but I would totally do that. Oh, would you?

2481
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:08,800
But it was down.

2482
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:10,080
Very convenient, very convenient.

2483
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:11,520
Very convenient.

2484
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:13,680
He lost his glasses before, too.

2485
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:14,440
So you can see where he was going.

2486
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:17,080
He wanted to see all of that big specific part of New Jersey.

2487
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:19,920
The parking lot in New Jersey.

2488
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:22,360
And then, yeah.

2489
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:24,800
I have the answer for the beanies.

2490
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:25,920
Oh, good.

2491
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:29,880
100 years ago, according to OSU, I forget what, actually,

2492
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:33,280
the, where am I in, the Lantern, which is some sort of college website.

2493
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:34,160
Who cares what it is?

2494
01:39:34,160 --> 01:39:36,720
That is probably the college newspaper.

2495
01:39:36,760 --> 01:39:42,120
The cap tradition began in 1912 and its looks changed throughout its lifetime at OSU.

2496
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:43,840
But this is what they look like.

2497
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:44,960
And it's going to load.

2498
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:46,320
These are the caps.

2499
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:47,320
That is a beanie.

2500
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:48,800
Yeah, it's a little beanie.

2501
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:52,240
Like what character on Fat Albert wore one of these?

2502
01:39:52,240 --> 01:39:54,320
I forget. One of them did.

2503
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:56,040
Yes. I forget which one it is.

2504
01:39:56,040 --> 01:39:59,280
I mean, it's literally the thing that would have a propeller, but it just doesn't.

2505
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:00,760
Exactly. Yeah.

2506
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:06,440
And then Foam Booth Stuffing was most prominent in the 1950s.

2507
01:40:06,440 --> 01:40:08,960
But it fizzled out by 1959.

2508
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:14,440
So that was the heyday when people would stuff as many people into a Foam Booth as possible.

2509
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:18,600
And sorry, were the hats so you could know who to look down upon and make fun of?

2510
01:40:18,600 --> 01:40:20,080
I believe so.

2511
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:22,440
I don't know. I think this is a, this was actually a good thing.

2512
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:24,360
I don't think it was like a, like a dunce cap.

2513
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:26,640
The hats were a good thing?

2514
01:40:26,640 --> 01:40:29,640
Like they would say, like, we're proud of you for being here.

2515
01:40:29,640 --> 01:40:31,240
We're proud of you for getting it.

2516
01:40:31,240 --> 01:40:31,800
Well, you know what?

2517
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:34,920
This says freshmen men were required to wear beanies.

2518
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:39,520
So perhaps if there was a rude upperclassman, they would make fun of the freshmen.

2519
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:41,400
Carry my books. Yeah.

2520
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:45,600
So perhaps, yeah, you could spot like a newbie that way.

2521
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:46,680
OK. But I don't know.

2522
01:40:46,680 --> 01:40:47,280
Those don't lie.

2523
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:50,960
Like this, I mean, I guess beanies were happening during Foam Booth Stuffing.

2524
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:54,240
So I wonder why it fell out of favor, Foam Booth Stuffing.

2525
01:40:54,240 --> 01:40:58,040
I just the Wikipedia says it fizzled in 1959.

2526
01:40:58,040 --> 01:40:59,600
I guess it just fizzled.

2527
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:03,360
I mean, maybe it was like we did an episode on Tunnel of Loves,

2528
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:07,520
which like still occupy such a big place and like TV and movies.

2529
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:13,640
But they fizzled out around the 50s because public displays of affection and car culture

2530
01:41:13,640 --> 01:41:18,720
just kind of you didn't have to go to a carnival and sit a dark boat ride to make out.

2531
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:22,680
Now you can be in line at a casino. Right.

2532
01:41:22,680 --> 01:41:24,240
For all to see.

2533
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:25,200
They really should have.

2534
01:41:25,200 --> 01:41:28,320
The policy was to wear masks at the time.

2535
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:30,640
So I don't know why they were doing that.

2536
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:32,640
They were in love. That's why they were doing it.

2537
01:41:32,640 --> 01:41:35,360
They were like Angelina Jolie and Billy Bob Thornton.

2538
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:37,840
You remember how all over they were all over each other?

2539
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:39,560
They were. Oh, who could forget?

2540
01:41:39,560 --> 01:41:40,640
OK, real.

2541
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:44,880
The Foam Booth Stuffing was referred to one of the all time great fads

2542
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:49,360
by the Bridgeport Post, and it but it had become regarded as passe

2543
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:50,960
by the end of 1959.

2544
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:59,040
It was akin to the meteoric rise and fall to the earlier fads of flagpole

2545
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:05,120
sitting, goldfish swallowing and panty raids and to the later fad of streaking

2546
01:42:05,120 --> 01:42:09,760
while still practiced contemporarily and has not again achieved the social currency

2547
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:12,160
it had in the late 1950s. Wow.

2548
01:42:12,160 --> 01:42:15,440
So this really makes it sound like it was a big deal to cram a bunch of people

2549
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:17,960
into a foam booth. And then there was just one day a guy was like,

2550
01:42:17,960 --> 01:42:19,360
who wants to get in the foam booth?

2551
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:21,120
And they were like, please.

2552
01:42:21,120 --> 01:42:23,280
Yeah, and they laughed at him. Hans.

2553
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:26,400
Yeah. So 1959.

2554
01:42:26,440 --> 01:42:30,400
I like this just another example of, like, the flattening of history.

2555
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:34,320
And it's like, yeah, caps were in the 1910s and 20s.

2556
01:42:34,640 --> 01:42:37,240
And then flagpole sitting was in the 50s.

2557
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:39,280
Yeah. But in my mind, you flattened history.

2558
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:40,240
Yeah, I flattened it.

2559
01:42:40,240 --> 01:42:43,120
And in my mind, it's just like, oh, the past.

2560
01:42:43,320 --> 01:42:46,200
Yeah. You must not have had your glasses on when you were

2561
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:51,440
describing those historical goldfish swallowing 40s.

2562
01:42:52,280 --> 01:42:56,720
Swallowed goldfish before every episode for good luck.

2563
01:42:57,480 --> 01:43:00,600
I feel like shit by the end of every episode, too.

2564
01:43:00,760 --> 01:43:03,280
Because the thing is still alive for the first 15 minutes or so.

2565
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:05,960
Oh, no. You're swallowing it alive.

2566
01:43:07,120 --> 01:43:10,760
So, yeah, anyway, we'll put up that George Carstensen

2567
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:16,280
photo with Jason and we'll check out the tooth horse and the tooth horse.

2568
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:19,160
Yeah, maybe you pick someone you think looks like the tooth horse

2569
01:43:19,160 --> 01:43:20,520
and put up a side by side.

2570
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:21,720
Oh, good. Yeah.

2571
01:43:21,720 --> 01:43:24,160
Who has a lot like a big toothy smile? Yeah.

2572
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:25,080
That's a good question.

2573
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:28,040
When you don't like probably. Yeah. Yeah.

2574
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:32,120
Well, we'll think about our enemies and think about who looks like the horse.

2575
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:34,760
Do we have what else? Do we have anything else?

2576
01:43:34,760 --> 01:43:38,080
Anything else? Say goodbye from your lovely trip? No.

2577
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:43,320
OK, well, then I'll go ahead and say, Beth, you survived podcast, the ride.

2578
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:45,600
Let's exit through the gift shop.

2579
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:50,080
Do you have anything you'd like to plug? Oh, no.

2580
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:55,080
OK. Well, I don't know what I would plug.

2581
01:43:55,160 --> 01:43:56,440
You can plug somebody else's thing.

2582
01:43:56,440 --> 01:43:57,240
I mean, anything.

2583
01:43:57,240 --> 01:43:59,520
A Sex Lives of College Girls is back.

2584
01:43:59,680 --> 01:44:02,000
It's back in November.

2585
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:05,040
Yes. Watch season three of The Sex Lives of College Girls.

2586
01:44:05,480 --> 01:44:09,360
Watch. I just watched Pop Star Academy, which I thought was a pretty good

2587
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:10,960
reality show.

2588
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:13,440
That's just the thing you like. Yeah, that's right.

2589
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:18,320
But yeah, watch The Sex Lives of College Girls season three in November.

2590
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:20,200
OK, great. Yeah.

2591
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:23,880
And as for us, you'll find us at podcast, the ride or

2592
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:25,800
Patreon dot com slash podcast, the ride.

2593
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,680
If you want to do more, if you want to get there's that Elitch Gardens

2594
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:30,480
episode behind the paywall.

2595
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:35,080
If you want to go back and listen to that and all the somewhat depressing antics

2596
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:39,040
that happened that day, I won't elaborate on what happened to Scott.

2597
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:41,800
But we're on all the socials at podcast, the ride.

2598
01:44:42,280 --> 01:44:45,280
And yeah, look for the comparison photos soon.

2599
01:44:45,680 --> 01:44:49,280
And if you have any video from the piano man from New York,

2600
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:53,400
I would like to see what a Danish Billy Joel show looks like.

2601
01:44:54,160 --> 01:44:55,960
So please send it my way.

2602
01:44:55,960 --> 01:44:59,320
You know, the email, I assume podcast, the ride at Gmail dot com.

2603
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:07,480
This has been a forever dog production executive produced by Mike Carlson,
