1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,980
Right now, the Club 3 executives are upstairs,

2
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,480
and they're meeting, and this meeting is going to determine the fate of this entire episode.

3
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,980
So I'm a little bit nervous. We're hearing the entire topic may be changed,

4
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,480
it might be thrown out, we might have to start over.

5
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,980
We're hearing that the Jason character may be cut altogether.

6
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,980
I don't know. We're waiting. Wait a minute, wait a minute, he's here.

7
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,980
I guess he's not cut. Jason Sheridan is here.

8
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,980
I heard they added him back in. Like 10%.

9
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,980
After some of the test screenings. Sting fought for him to be back.

10
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:02,980
And I appreciate that. I always appreciate when Sting and Trudy...

11
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,980
Put their thumb on the scale.

12
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,980
Yeah, put their thumb on the scale.

13
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:10,980
Now, like, one month I'm out, another month they're like,

14
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:16,980
oh, your part has been increased like 100%, and poof, boy, it's a swing, you know?

15
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, it's the kind of stuff that happens in a sweat box situation,

16
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:25,980
and we just have to be happy that artists like Sting and Trudy have your back,

17
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,980
and so do we, but ultimately we just follow orders here.

18
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,980
We've got to wait for the Club 3 executives to work in.

19
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:35,980
They're very opinionated. They rarely do,

20
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,980
but the amount of power the three of us have on the show,

21
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,980
especially in Club 3, is limited.

22
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:41,980
That's right, yeah.

23
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:45,980
They come in every three months, they muck it all up, they change everything,

24
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,980
and it can be stressful.

25
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:52,980
And look, I don't want to get too personal between your relationship with you and Sting,

26
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:58,980
but is there a bond when it comes to the sexual arts, the tantric arts?

27
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:03,980
Oh, well, we've all seen that picture, and someone had to take it.

28
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:08,980
Now you have immediately thrown out a reference that you said we've all seen,

29
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:09,980
and I have not.

30
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:10,980
I don't know what you're talking about.

31
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,980
Is it a Sting? Is it a picture of Sting?

32
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,980
Oh, you've got to find the picture of Sting and Trudy.

33
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,980
You've stumped us.

34
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,980
Sting, can you describe it? What would we, how would we find,

35
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,980
what's happening in the picture?

36
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:26,980
Well, one of them's like, I feel like...

37
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,980
Is it like a two lovers...

38
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,980
What are you going to type in to find it? That's the question.

39
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:34,980
Sting and Jason naked. Is that what you're typing in?

40
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,980
Is it you, it's him and Trudy, it's not you and Sting or you and Trudy.

41
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:43,980
Jason in Hour 10 of Tantric lovemaking session with Styler Klan.

42
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:50,980
Jason with notepad taking notes, watching Sting and Trudy in Hour 10 of Tantric.

43
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,980
Mentor-mentee relationship.

44
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,980
Among the notes, wow, all three of us are way past Mike and Scott.

45
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:02,980
Right. We are so much more comfortable than these two losers.

46
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,980
What are you, bring us in on your process.

47
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,980
I'm trying to find this.

48
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,980
Do you have it on your photo roll? Are you finding it in your saved photos?

49
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,980
Is it Sting? Is it of Sting? Is that what you're thinking?

50
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,980
We can get to it faster, I think, if you tell us.

51
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,980
It's Sting and Trudy.

52
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,980
Yeah, I have that typed in.

53
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:28,980
Maggie Sarota, a music writer who used to have a podcast with Tom Sharpling called The Low Times or that interview possession.

54
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,980
Got it, got it. If it's what she, that helps me, thank you.

55
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:38,980
Is it a weird Christmas card where he's holding a weird old guitar and she is in a leotard and she's very flexible.

56
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,980
That's exactly.

57
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,980
And they're in front of a bunch of candles and stuff.

58
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,980
I apologize. I apologize.

59
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:50,980
I may have, you know, Maggie may have posted it so many times.

60
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:55,980
It's just ingrained in my mind and I thought it was a little more.

61
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:01,980
You thought it was more like a John Lennon, Yoko Ono, two lovers photo.

62
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,980
I have never chanced upon this photo, but I'm glad that I have now.

63
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,980
They both look incredible.

64
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,980
I don't know what age they are.

65
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,980
It doesn't matter.

66
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:17,980
There's only mild signs in their other, in their immaculate bodies and faces that they're anywhere north of 50.

67
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,980
But they're both like true specimens.

68
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:21,980
They're so jealous.

69
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:28,980
And what a setup. My God, this like, it's like the basement of a winery and then like 25 candles in the frame.

70
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:29,980
Wait here, I'll turn it.

71
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,980
I'm not seeing it.

72
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,980
Yeah, yeah, there you go.

73
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,980
Oh, I have seen this, yes.

74
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,980
You have seen the photo.

75
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,980
I have seen the photo, yes.

76
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,980
No, it's interesting because I didn't know if the photo would be like overtly sexual.

77
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:44,980
And it is because they're gods amongst men, but they aren't having sex in it.

78
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,980
It's just kind of, this is like the ritual.

79
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,980
They do six hours of this before they do 10 hours of that.

80
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,980
Jealous.

81
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:54,980
I wonder if they are using that Steve Harvey red light that I'm kind of obsessed with.

82
00:04:54,980 --> 00:05:01,980
I haven't done it yet, but I'm very obsessed with red light as a way to like make your skin look more youthful.

83
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,980
Infrared light?

84
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,980
I don't know what kind of red light it is.

85
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,980
I bet not. If you were red, it wouldn't be infrared.

86
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,980
Those are different things.

87
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,980
Yeah, I don't think it's infrared.

88
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,980
But it's some sort of red light.

89
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:18,980
And then a friend of mine who does some PR marketing type things was working for a company that has a new red light mask.

90
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:22,980
And I saw a photo of the mask and I go, can you get me one of these masks?

91
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,980
You've already pursued the red light mask?

92
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,980
I'm interested, yeah.

93
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:29,980
And it sounded like a maybe because it's a very expensive red light mask.

94
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,980
It's like $500.

95
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:38,980
What I'm gathering from all this is that unlike Roxanne, you do have to turn on the red light.

96
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,980
That's pretty good, right?

97
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,980
Very good, yeah.

98
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,980
I'm glad I found it.

99
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,980
Tied two together. Yeah, that was really good.

100
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,980
That was really good.

101
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,980
Great, great.

102
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:55,980
Well, you know, we're going to get maybe we can go all over the place a little bit, but maybe something to talk about is any of our relationships to Sting.

103
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:03,980
Because what we are talking about here is Sting is very much the star of this, and it's a documentary made by Sting's wife.

104
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:08,980
Obviously, we have these associations with the sexual nature of things.

105
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:13,980
And to be clear, the sweat box, the topic does not refer to Sting and Trudy's bedroom.

106
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:23,980
No, I mean, the stress of working on this movie likely led to some tantric encounters when it's just like, I just need to take my mind off.

107
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,980
This is just cut the llama song.

108
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,980
I just can you just give me 14 hours, please?

109
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,980
I just need a quick 14 hours.

110
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,980
I'll that's that's I'll rush it.

111
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:36,980
Yeah.

112
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,980
And then I should be good.

113
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:42,980
But yeah, how do you feel about Sting?

114
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,980
Yeah, yeah, it's interesting with Sting.

115
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,980
I like Sting the man.

116
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,980
I like he's he amuses me in this.

117
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,980
Like, I don't like seeing him like, oh, shit, this is such a pain in the ass.

118
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,980
Like, there's such a funny energy coming from him.

119
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,980
And I know he's like, that's kind of like, oh, God, like, I don't want him to suffer.

120
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,980
But it is he's amusing me in this.

121
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:09,980
Well, he's because he's there's like a stuffy it's like, oh, boy, he's a funny character to see having to roll his eyes and write angry letters.

122
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:15,980
I mean, it's truly a great person to see in a like, you know, works on all kind of situation.

123
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,980
So I like that.

124
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,980
I like that.

125
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,980
I like that he's on the Simpson episode where he's helping save the part.

126
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,980
Oh, yeah.

127
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,980
Which was supposed to be Springsteen.

128
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,980
I read somebody on some Simpson interview.

129
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,980
And they were like, oh, we've got Sting.

130
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:33,980
And then I do like the big hit police songs.

131
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,980
I do like them.

132
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:36,980
I feel like I hear them a lot.

133
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,980
I really do like the arrangements.

134
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:43,980
So I do think I'm a fan of all three of these guys because the songs themselves sound cool to me.

135
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:44,980
Yeah.

136
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,980
Like the way I was late to arrive in any of the but yeah, some of those.

137
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:48,980
Yeah.

138
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:53,980
Driven to tears and those kind of like even then like not the three main hit like you go.

139
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:54,980
Yeah.

140
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,980
Some great ones.

141
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:00,980
But yes, then you get to 90s thing and brutal desert rose.

142
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,980
And I'm just it's less interesting to me.

143
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,980
And again, I think we've maybe touched a little bit about upon it.

144
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:12,980
But it's like maybe there's some better Sting stuff, but it's all pretty like heavy.

145
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,980
And it's ponderous.

146
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:15,980
The wondrous is a word.

147
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,980
Yeah.

148
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:17,980
Exactly.

149
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,980
I was in my head.

150
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:22,980
I mean, I think when I was trying to dissect this, like what is your why do you struggle with Sting?

151
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,980
I ended up looking at his discography.

152
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,980
And if you just say the names of his solo studio albums, it answers the question for you.

153
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:35,980
The dream of the blue turtles, the soul cages, ten Summoner's Tales, songs from the labyrinth.

154
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,980
Wait, isn't the guitars from the police Andy Sumner?

155
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:39,980
Is it Sumner?

156
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,980
Isn't Sumner is the guy's name?

157
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,980
I think Andy Sumner from the police.

158
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,980
It's not Summoner, right?

159
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,980
But it sounds close.

160
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,980
And he's not.

161
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:47,980
He's not.

162
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,980
He's not related to Alf Gordon.

163
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,980
Gordon Shumway.

164
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,980
No, no.

165
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,980
Gordon Shumway.

166
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,980
You're right.

167
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:54,980
Gordon Shumway.

168
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:55,980
Who am I thinking that is the last name?

169
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,980
Sumner.

170
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:57,980
There is a Sumner out there.

171
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,980
There is.

172
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,980
Sumner Redheart is who you're thinking of.

173
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,980
And those things aren't related either.

174
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,980
There's also someone named Joe Sumner.

175
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,980
Who is that?

176
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,980
Maybe I'm just thinking of Sumner Redstone.

177
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,980
I mean, I'm always thinking of Sumner.

178
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:14,980
Listener, if you could see the two of them furiously trying to find the name of this

179
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,980
guitar on their laptops.

180
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,980
Yeah.

181
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,980
And then Stewart Copeland is the drummer from the police.

182
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,980
I know that.

183
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,980
They all seem cool.

184
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,980
They all seem cool, yeah.

185
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,980
Yeah.

186
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,980
So I was just wondering if he named it very similar to his old guitars.

187
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:39,980
I like the police, but here's how I very late coming to my music knowledge.

188
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:46,220
In high school, I guess it would have been about 15, I saw the movie Moulin Rouge and

189
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:50,980
I recognized some of the songs and I did not recognize some of the others.

190
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,940
So you thought they were Moulin Rouge originals?

191
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,460
There is one or two in there and I knew about that.

192
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:04,460
So when it got to the Roxanne sequence, which is very starkly filmed, it's very intense.

193
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:09,460
And I was like, wow, this is a really good song.

194
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,460
You did not know it was based on anything.

195
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,460
No, it was a police song, you know.

196
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,460
That is funny.

197
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:21,460
But when they're doing earlier in the movie and they do a chunk of Nirvana, I knew that

198
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,460
song.

199
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,460
Okay, great.

200
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,460
You did know.

201
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,460
Newer song, I guess.

202
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:29,460
And now in the scheme of things, what were they, less than 10 years apart?

203
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,460
Yeah, of course.

204
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:33,460
Even though in my mind, that's like 30 years.

205
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,460
I was doing some of this.

206
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:39,460
I don't like to do this like I am old math, but I couldn't help it.

207
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,460
I was telling you guys before we started recording.

208
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,460
78 was longer than 10 minutes.

209
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,460
Thank God.

210
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:49,460
I was telling you guys before we started recording for the kids yesterday, we ended up throwing

211
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:54,460
an impromptu birthday party for Aaron's car.

212
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,460
So we ended up singing Happy Birthday, Dear Kamri.

213
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:02,460
I'm not exactly sure how this transpired, but my oldest was dead set on it, and my youngest

214
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:06,460
was bouncing around some of the most he's come to life yet, still a little guy.

215
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,460
But I was doing math based on when my youngest was born.

216
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,460
Basically, we ended up putting on a bunch.

217
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:15,460
I put on what's like a birthday celebration mix we could put on, and we ended up on the

218
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:19,460
classic, the immortal I Got a Feeling by the Black Eyed Peas.

219
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,460
Oh yeah, of course.

220
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,460
And I was like, okay, that's 2009.

221
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,460
My son was born in 2024.

222
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,460
What is an equivalent song from when I was born?

223
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,460
And what was the one that really got me?

224
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:33,460
Bridge Over Troubled Water is as old to me as...

225
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,460
I've Got a Feeling.

226
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,460
Yes, yeah, yeah.

227
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,460
Isn't that really upsetting, isn't it?

228
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,460
That is upsetting, yeah.

229
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,460
There's one more.

230
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,460
Oh, there's one that, oh, Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head.

231
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,460
Doesn't that feel, in my head, that song is...

232
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,460
100 years old.

233
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:51,460
Yeah, yeah, that's 40 years older than, which that's some of my feeling about some of these,

234
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:56,460
about like, staying to me as a kid felt like, how old was he then?

235
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:02,460
Oh, he must be 90 years old based on the kind of music he makes, which we can get into.

236
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:06,460
But you know what I should do is I should read the official submission.

237
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,460
And I wanted to say some other stuff.

238
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:13,460
I wanted to get into the topic a little bit first before I do the thing that we do every time,

239
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:18,460
or we're supposed to, which is we discuss what came in second place in the poll.

240
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,460
I can't remember what it was this month.

241
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:25,460
But given the current temperature of some of our online forums, I don't know how aware you are,

242
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:30,460
I don't know how much you've been checking this, Jason, but things are heated over in the Patreon comments.

243
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:34,460
And it's making me wonder if it's best to not say anything.

244
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,460
So that's the tack that I'm taking this time.

245
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,460
Even though it's a tradition, we've always done this.

246
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,460
We've always referred to what is the runner-up.

247
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,460
This is in the official constitution of Club 3.

248
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,460
Yep.

249
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,460
And the runner-up stays.

250
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,460
It was nominated by a person.

251
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,460
Whatever was in second place was nominated by a person.

252
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:58,460
What I think it's important to reiterate here is that no process has changed for this particular topic.

253
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:02,460
And in fact, the topic rolling over again and again has happened before.

254
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,460
It happened with the masked magician.

255
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:09,460
And things remain pretty calm, pretty civil when it was the masked magician.

256
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:13,460
But now that it's happening for the masked musician, the tenor of things has changed.

257
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,460
So that is why I'm not going to say the topic.

258
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,460
I'm not going to say the potential guest's name.

259
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,460
I'm not even going to say what kind of sauce he likes.

260
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,460
You know what it is.

261
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,460
It's on the table.

262
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:36,460
In fact, I think that this particular topic's rise from 26% to 34% in the last month says more than I would ever need to.

263
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,460
So you know what the topic is.

264
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,460
You can vote for it if you want to.

265
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,460
You cannot vote for it if you want to.

266
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,460
Nothing has changed.

267
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:52,460
And speaking of things not changing, as always, it is your right to not vote for whatever puppet Mike picks for next month in the poll.

268
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,460
It is your right to help it.

269
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,460
What did my puppet get this month?

270
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,460
8%, 7?

271
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,460
Less than 10.

272
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,460
Yeah, less than 10 for sure.

273
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,460
Or 10 or less.

274
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:07,460
I said this in a text message somewhere.

275
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:13,460
There's that quote about the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.

276
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,460
And that doesn't apply here because technically you are picking different puppets.

277
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,460
Right.

278
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,460
And who said I expected it to win?

279
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,460
Who even said?

280
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,460
That's true.

281
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:25,460
Your choice does not imply that you are imagining it going all the way.

282
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,460
8% is the number, by the way.

283
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,460
8%, okay.

284
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,460
For lamb chop, to be clear.

285
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:35,460
Because that last time we made a big thing out of the immediate plummet of madam again.

286
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,460
This time you went right.

287
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,460
You got right back up to the plate.

288
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,460
Lamb chop.

289
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,460
8%.

290
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,460
Not last place.

291
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,460
Did the weirdos get like 20% or 15% or something?

292
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,460
Weirdos did okay.

293
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,460
The weirdos did better than lamb chop.

294
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,460
The weirdos are the highest performing puppets thus far.

295
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,460
And a lot of these, by the way, will get another chance.

296
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:01,460
I think we are overdue to do one of those like we all get one of the old topics again and give it another go.

297
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,460
Sure.

298
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,460
So maybe they take it all the way there.

299
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,460
We've got so many of those things.

300
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,460
I wonder why the weirdos though versus lamb chop.

301
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:13,460
Maybe more people don't know who lamb chop is than I'm thinking.

302
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:17,460
Once again, you pin it on people.

303
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:22,460
If they knew lamb chop, they would want to hear us talk about her and the other puppets.

304
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:28,460
In his defense, I have more memories of lamb chop as a kid.

305
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:32,460
The song that never ends became a bit much at some point.

306
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,460
Certainly.

307
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,460
In the first era.

308
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,460
In the first era.

309
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,460
Yeah, it never ends.

310
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:43,460
But I mean, the weirdos might have gotten a little bump because of Coldplay.

311
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,460
People like Coldplay.

312
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,460
People of different age groups like Coldplay.

313
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,460
I suppose.

314
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:56,460
But I don't think there's a giant gap between people who like Coldplay and people who like the weirdos or have even tracked it enough.

315
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:03,460
I think that the bump may have been because I feel like that was a particularly aiming for my aggravation topic.

316
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,460
The weirdos was.

317
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:08,460
Because Coldplay mixed with puppets.

318
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,460
Weird puppets and weird voices.

319
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,460
I think possibly.

320
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,460
That might help explain that.

321
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:16,460
Did the Henson people have something to do with making the weirdos?

322
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,460
I believe so.

323
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,460
Yeah, yeah.

324
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,460
So there's some Henson shine.

325
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,460
There's some Coldplay shine.

326
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:26,460
And that may have given them a little bit of a bump.

327
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,460
There's also.

328
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,460
I guess there's something to.

329
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:34,460
I mean, maybe you're right that Coldplay's popularity is also the fact that it's like something from the last five years and not from.

330
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,460
That's possible, too.

331
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,460
I bet there's a.

332
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:43,460
For a half second, I thought you called Lambchop Glamchop, which I think is like a really good like drag name or something.

333
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,460
I bet somebody has it already at this point.

334
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:49,460
That's a potential rebranding that Mallory Lewis, Sherry Lewis's daughter.

335
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,460
Right.

336
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,460
Could and should look into.

337
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,460
Glamchop.

338
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,460
But yeah.

339
00:16:54,460 --> 00:17:00,460
But for now, we have landed on this, which, by the way, was also my choice.

340
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,460
There are people.

341
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,460
Oh, yeah.

342
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,460
There are people.

343
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:08,460
There are people in here saying, like, if Scott wants X topic to win so badly, why doesn't he?

344
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,460
But I don't.

345
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,460
Who says I want that?

346
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:17,460
I just want good topics to win the Club 3 poll and I want democracy to prevail, which is why I'm thrilled that the Sweatbox won.

347
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,460
Yeah.

348
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:21,460
That's giving me first and second place and a 75 percent share.

349
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,460
We all.

350
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,460
Of the votes this month.

351
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,460
I don't want anything so bad.

352
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,460
I'm doing great.

353
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,460
I'm on top of the world, gang.

354
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,460
Good topics.

355
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,460
Well, that's what I want, too.

356
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,460
It's just good old fashioned topics.

357
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,460
Uh huh.

358
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:37,460
With characters that are made out of felt or cloth or have a little stuffing in their cheeks.

359
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,460
Or the most creepily shaped wood that's ever been shaped.

360
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,460
That's right.

361
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,460
Or a wooden, a little wooden boy.

362
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:46,460
Well, what is the little wooden boy?

363
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,460
Anything you're you're hoping to do in the near future?

364
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:55,460
Oh, no, I was the one who was very enthusiastic about hunting this movie down.

365
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:04,460
And you hopefully said because I had only found a YouTube playlist that was doing the trick of putting the video in a real little in the corner.

366
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,460
Yes.

367
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,460
Because we talked about this a little bit ago and I was surprised you guys hadn't seen it.

368
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,460
And yeah, the only version on YouTube.

369
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,460
Yes, it's squeezed into the bottom and flipped backwards.

370
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,460
That's making it a pretty impossible watch.

371
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,460
Yes.

372
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:24,460
And and but thanks to listeners, you you passed along that you could find it on Archive.org.

373
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:27,460
Archive.org much like many great treasures.

374
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,460
So thank you.

375
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,460
Thank you.

376
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,460
Whoever figured that out.

377
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,460
Yeah.

378
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,460
Thank you to Bobby Libby, who pushed it over the edge and made it an actionable episode.

379
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:44,460
Bobby says, have the boys actually done an episode on The Sweatbox, the documentary by Sting's wife about the making of the movie that became The Emperor's New Groove?

380
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,460
It came up recently on an episode, but it's a great watch that merits a deep dive.

381
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,460
Thank you, Bobby.

382
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,460
Agreed.

383
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,460
And that sums it up pretty well.

384
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:56,460
This is technically a making of documentary about The Emperor's New Groove.

385
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:07,460
But when it began, it was about the making of a very different film called Kingdom of the Sun that had a lot of the elements that ended up in Emperor's New Groove.

386
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:14,460
Like as you join the creative process in progress, you have a lot of what we know from this film.

387
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,460
It's Eartha Kitt as Yzma.

388
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,460
It's David Spade as Kuzco.

389
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:24,460
It's about the Incans and Sting is doing music for it.

390
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:30,460
And all of that ended up in the movie, but all radically rearranged and changed around.

391
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:35,460
Some of the events of which you get to see in this film, which makes it a very fascinating watch.

392
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:49,460
Now, when it started, I was a little confused about like, wow, this is really polished in terms of the way everyone was composing themselves.

393
00:19:49,460 --> 00:20:03,460
Was that kind of weird, restrained, Disney like, oh, we're keeping, we're being professional and complimentary to the company, but you can just see the rage in their eyes.

394
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:12,460
Because I feel like everyone, but I feel like people are being pretty, you know, respectful.

395
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:17,460
But occasionally what they were saying was pretty brutal.

396
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,460
So I was quotes. There's some quotes in this for sure.

397
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:27,460
There are some quotes. And so I was like, what is the, you know, ownership of this?

398
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:32,460
And the Walt Disney Company does own the rights to this.

399
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,460
It was shot by Sting's wife.

400
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:41,460
An edited version exists on the Emperor's New Groove DVD.

401
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,460
Yes, it was.

402
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:55,460
This footage was reappropriated for a very like, I haven't watched it, but I would imagine kind of a more sanitized, like typical DVD making.

403
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:59,460
Is it, did it become about like, here's what it took to make the song in the movie?

404
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:05,460
I haven't watched it either, but they, I think it was very similar to this.

405
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:14,460
And long enough that they aired it, they showed it at film festivals and did a week long run in LA for Oscars.

406
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,460
That was of that or it was of the sweat box?

407
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:20,460
Of the edited version is what I saw.

408
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,460
Are you sure about that? Because I feel like.

409
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,460
I'm not 100% sure.

410
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:31,460
I think the sweat box did, again, I don't know what that DVD special feature is, but I imagine it's kind of like standard fare.

411
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,460
Right.

412
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,460
I feel like I do think they gave like some amount of screening to the sweat.

413
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:43,460
I think that because I think the sweat box got out there enough where there was some like murmuring about it.

414
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:50,460
And I think people involved in the making of the movie went to see it because they were like dying for the truth to be told.

415
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,460
And I think they went and they booed certain figures.

416
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,460
Yes.

417
00:21:54,460 --> 00:22:00,460
And then I think that that initial reaction caused Disney to go, OK, this is like too close to the bone.

418
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,460
I don't think we can like put out something this honest.

419
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:11,460
And they kind of sucked it back, which is why the version that you watch on Archive.org is like finished, cut, like a very clean watch.

420
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:17,460
But then at some point it goes to like ending placeholder shots of Sting singing mixed with shots of premiere.

421
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,460
Like it never fully got finished.

422
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,460
But like but mostly mostly.

423
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,460
Yes.

424
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:40,460
And this unedited version, what what I saw and again, just on Wikipedia, was that the only reason this exists is because in 2012, an animation student or animator in Europe released it on the Internet.

425
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,460
Yeah, just leaked it.

426
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,460
Wow.

427
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,460
Wow.

428
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,460
I mean, that's great.

429
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,460
There's there's some like crazy populism to this thing.

430
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:59,460
And I think that's the thing that makes it the most fascinating to me is that it is a I mean, you'd call it like a warts and all kind of movie.

431
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,460
But it's still pretty like everyone's pretty polite in it.

432
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,460
Yes.

433
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:08,460
There are not parts where as you know, as we've discussed, the legend of Tony Baxter throwing a chair or whatever, it is not like that at all.

434
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,460
Everybody got thrown at him.

435
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,460
Oh, is the other way?

436
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,460
Oh, yeah.

437
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:17,460
I'm sure thrown at him by the architect that he had to tell that we're not going with your design for Disneyland Paris, I think.

438
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,460
Oh, my God.

439
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,460
Yes.

440
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,460
That's the story he told.

441
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,460
I think so.

442
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,460
OK, Jesus.

443
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,460
I'm glad he got hit by a little wheel.

444
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,460
Eisner made him tell him too, I think.

445
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,460
This is his story.

446
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,460
Eisner goes, that's fine.

447
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,460
But you got to tell him.

448
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,460
Whoa.

449
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,460
Wow.

450
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,460
You got to tell him all this work he did.

451
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,460
We're not going with it.

452
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,460
Well, his look Eisner's face has to be on television.

453
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:39,460
He can't he can't afford to get nicked up.

454
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,460
No, he made the right call.

455
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,460
Absolutely.

456
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,460
He got to protect that.

457
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,460
You delineate that stuff.

458
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:54,460
But so anyway, it is like what I'm saying is it's it's a it's definitely a very truthful, honest look at the process.

459
00:23:54,460 --> 00:24:07,460
But by Disney standards where things are so cleaned up and anything we've ever seen about the making of the movies or the rides or whatever it is, it's always like, well, it all starts with the story.

460
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:14,460
We begin with the story and we sprinkle a little bit of pixie dust on and you never get anything close to like what really happened.

461
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:27,460
The only like they've embraced a little bit that story of that Toy Story was fucked when it was first whatever the first like assembled version of Toy Story was a disaster and Woody was mean and terror.

462
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:33,460
They've I think embraced that story a little bit just because like an empire was built on the back of those.

463
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,460
Yeah.

464
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,460
They make it really seem like, oh my God, how do they do it?

465
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:45,460
It's to go from that point to it's one of the great films of our lifetimes and one of the biggest companies of our lifetimes is grown in the back of it.

466
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:49,460
But this is like maybe they don't have the reason to embrace it.

467
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:55,460
Maybe it's just like it's like a bunch of wonkiness and fighting that led to a pretty solid movie.

468
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,460
Right.

469
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,460
It's not like a masterpiece.

470
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,460
It's not one of the greatest ones ever made.

471
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,460
Yeah.

472
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,460
But it's fun.

473
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,460
It's definitely a fun.

474
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,460
Right.

475
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:14,460
I think I've said this on the show before where like Pixar, the Pixar spin when they were hot was always, well, the Pixar process is why these movies are so good.

476
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:23,460
We are willing to throw out a complete like third, it's two acts of the movie if we need to six months before and fix it.

477
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,460
Oh, that's oh, that's really great that they recognize a problem.

478
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,460
They can fix it.

479
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:34,460
But then you really think about making a movie and how things are usually dated and they need to make a deadline.

480
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,460
And you go, that sounds like a nightmare.

481
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:41,460
That sounds like truly like being able to do that so late in the process seems like it would be awful.

482
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:49,460
And I'm sure as I got older, I was like, oh, I bet there's really like harrowing tales from people who worked on all the good Pixar movies.

483
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,460
Sure.

484
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:56,460
But it does, you know, it worked in a lot of those pictures and we know it worked in every Star Wars.

485
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,460
Trust the process.

486
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,460
That's true.

487
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,460
The process.

488
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,460
But it feels like they almost took this.

489
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:08,460
This feels like a similar process where it was just like they were like, we have to make this movie now.

490
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,460
There's so many elements that are already here.

491
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,460
We can't just scrap the movie.

492
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:19,460
Well, and literally they sort of this is a little bit in the in the documentary, but it's maybe not underlined as much.

493
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:25,460
There's an excellent vulture oral history of Emperor's New Groove that obviously touches on the sweat box.

494
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:32,460
But there's kind of some extra stuff that's fun with with people who you see in this movie, the producer Fulmer, I forget his first name.

495
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:37,460
But the after all these big shake ups and changes that happened, here's here's what he says.

496
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:40,460
We had a year literally to put that whole thing together.

497
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:45,460
There's a deadline because we got a McDonald's Happy Meal that has to come on a certain date.

498
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,460
And there are big fines to pay if you don't do that.

499
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,460
Right.

500
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:51,460
So they were boxed in by the Happy Meal.

501
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,460
Right.

502
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,460
That is driving.

503
00:26:53,460 --> 00:27:00,460
I mean, we know that these release dates are important and set in stone and they're declared years in advance in, you know, in these D23 and Comic Con type presentations.

504
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,460
Right.

505
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:04,460
But in this case, the Happy Meal drove it.

506
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,460
Well, it's incredible that it made.

507
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,460
I know what you're going to say.

508
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,460
Yeah, you're right.

509
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:17,460
I was going to say that must have changed because the Captain America Brave New World Happy Meal came out a while ago.

510
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,460
Oh, is that so?

511
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,460
Yeah.

512
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,460
Six months ago.

513
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,460
And when does the movie come out?

514
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:25,460
Valentine's Day 2025.

515
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:28,460
I looked this up because I was like, when did Captain America 4 start shooting?

516
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:31,460
And then when did the Fantastic Four movie, which comes out this summer, start shooting?

517
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,460
Fantastic Four started shooting last summer.

518
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:37,460
Captain America started shooting early 2023.

519
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,460
So they have really had to reshoot and move.

520
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,460
They moved the date on that twice, I think.

521
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:47,460
So that's like, they really, they paid the fine for the Happy Meals, I think it sounds like.

522
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,460
The Happy Meal forgot at this point.

523
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,460
Right.

524
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,460
They got enough money now.

525
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,460
This was a more precarious time for Disney.

526
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,460
Now they can pay Happy Meal fines left and right.

527
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,460
It doesn't like who care.

528
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,460
Ultimately, like that is definitely weird.

529
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:03,460
But like, you know, the world kept turning even though the Happy Meal toys were early.

530
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:06,460
They were saved by the fracturing of culture.

531
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,460
Yes, now no one cares.

532
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,460
The fracturing of monoculture.

533
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,460
No one gives a shit.

534
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,460
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

535
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:18,460
Do you think that Harrison Ford toy, Griffin and I have been talking about the likeness on these Harrison Ford Red Hulk toys.

536
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:22,460
The one that Hasbro made, we're not a fan of, the face isn't right.

537
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,460
But there's like a popcorn bucket with him.

538
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:29,460
It's a big Harrison Ford Red Hulk head and it is Harrison's face that we really like.

539
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:33,460
But I wonder what the Happy Meal toy, I should look and see if it looks like Harrison.

540
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:38,460
Because I really would like a nice, real good likeness of Harrison Ford as a Red Hulk.

541
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,460
That's the key for you.

542
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,460
If it's just a Red Hulk who cares, you need to see the Harrison in there.

543
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,460
Exactly.

544
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:46,460
Yeah, because otherwise you could just get another Green Hulk and paint it red.

545
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,460
Sure, and there's plenty of Red Hulk toys already, so.

546
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,460
Okay.

547
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,460
Oh, you're saying predating the casting.

548
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,460
From the comics.

549
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,460
Yeah, from the comics and stuff.

550
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,460
Gotcha.

551
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,460
But I'll look.

552
00:28:55,460 --> 00:29:02,460
Let me say this about why, like I don't remember when I discovered this, but I devoured it as soon as I knew this existed.

553
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,460
I knew some of this backstory.

554
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:15,460
I knew that the fun, kooky, non-attempt at, I think Embers New Groove ended up being very refreshing because it's not trying to be pillar, serious, Pocahontas.

555
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:21,460
They got so ponderous there trying to make their next masterpiece, Chasing the Lion King.

556
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:28,460
Even though The Lion King was kind of the scrappy movie that was not intended to be among the finest they ever did.

557
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:35,460
But once, you can feel that once that happened, especially Katzenberg is now chasing, like, we need to win that Oscar this time.

558
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,460
This can't be like Beauty and the Beast.

559
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,460
We're coming for the.

560
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:49,460
So I think the sense I always got, my guess was always that whatever Kingdom of the Sun is, which they had announced and Eisner would refer to it and his stockholder letters and everything.

561
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:54,460
And with the music of Sting, I was always like, that sounds like the most serious thing you've ever heard of.

562
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,460
Even though maybe not.

563
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,460
You get glimpses of it.

564
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:01,460
They're still fun because it was Earth a Kid and there's you see a recording dialogue.

565
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:04,460
So like there was obviously jokes, but you're probably a comedy.

566
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,460
Yeah, but it feels yes.

567
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,460
I think it may have gotten.

568
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,460
It was going to be.

569
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,460
Yes, probably not pure comedy.

570
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:13,460
And that maybe it was confused because there's comedy, there's pure comedy people in it and then it gets more serious.

571
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:16,460
But anyway, I always knew that story.

572
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,460
And then, wow, it ended up being extremely different.

573
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:24,460
Wow. Once I heard there was the sweat box whenever it leaked and it was available to see, I ate it up so fast and I love it so much.

574
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:37,460
And I recommend it so much because it's like I think especially as a as a creative person, seeing kind of warts and all documentaries, I just like I mainline the inject them into my veins.

575
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:50,460
And especially of this era where like the lo fi of it and the digital of it was kind of like novel and that you see like kind of a grimier look like a not so polished look at like what's supposed to be a really polished movie.

576
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:54,460
I've devoured like all of Project Greenlight.

577
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,460
I've watched all of Project Greenlight three times.

578
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,460
Oh, yeah.

579
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:00,460
The filmmaking, you know, that it used to be Damon and Affleck and isn't anymore.

580
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:05,460
The Lost in La Mancha, the Terry Gillia, the making of Don Quixote.

581
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,460
That's excellent.

582
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,460
That's really good.

583
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:12,460
That's like this except where a movie falls apart, except they don't fix it then.

584
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,460
And like there's like floods.

585
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:17,460
It like you like see like true disasters.

586
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:22,460
This is all like Emperors New Groove is all meant like mental disasters.

587
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,460
That's like, oh, the set flooded.

588
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,460
We're fucked.

589
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:31,460
And that's that's the one that where they try to make the miracle Don Quixote.

590
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,460
Is that right?

591
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,460
Is that right?

592
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,460
That's what they try.

593
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:37,460
They eventually did with Adam Driver.

594
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,460
Yes.

595
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,460
A version of it.

596
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:49,460
But a story of Don Quixote, like, you know, a lot of antics and foolishness and it's full.

597
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:55,460
The story itself is a metaphor for it's a perfect metaphor for trying to make the story.

598
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,460
Yeah.

599
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,460
Yeah.

600
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:01,460
Have you seen Burden of Dreams, the Werner Herzog movie about the making of Fitzcarraldo?

601
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,460
I have not.

602
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,460
That's good.

603
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,460
Oh, yeah.

604
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,460
I've seen that a while, but that's good.

605
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,460
Klaus Kinski was crazy.

606
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,460
I'm going to write it in my notes.

607
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,460
Burden of Dreams is the movie.

608
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,460
I won't even.

609
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:14,460
Well, it's a crazy stunt they try to do that they do not like or crazy big thing they try

610
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,460
to do that gets like stuck.

611
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,460
OK.

612
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,460
Yeah.

613
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,460
Oh, great.

614
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:23,460
It's like the movie is about one thing and the making of they're like, well, it turns

615
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:27,460
out they tried to do the one thing from the movie.

616
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,460
I guess I won't even say.

617
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,460
Oh, OK.

618
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,460
Yeah.

619
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,460
Oh, yeah.

620
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,460
Don't spoil it for me.

621
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,460
I'll come back and report if I like.

622
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,940
But it also like I'm just like trying to name check these because I love them all and they're

623
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:38,700
all kind of of a piece in their production.

624
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:43,740
That made me think I just rewatched the other night the making of Island of Dr. Moreau.

625
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:49,340
Oh, that's so insane where the director ends up fired and then sneaking around what used

626
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:54,540
to be his set dressed as a dog, man, and if he gets caught, he could get sued into the

627
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,540
ground.

628
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:59,580
So he has to all the extras are taking their masks off, but he won't because he there's

629
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,900
like giant legal trouble if he does.

630
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:07,060
So it's saying so much stuff that we like, I think, in a way like would be good documentary,

631
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:12,140
like stuff like bad stuff or weird stuff is always just like, boy, this choice was odd.

632
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:16,980
I would love a full length documentary about whatever the strange movie is.

633
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:21,460
Well, imagine, imagine if we had it in the world, if we could actually get here's what

634
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,500
it was like making Superstar limo.

635
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,540
Here's Tomorrowland 98 and Rocket Rods.

636
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,980
Here's light magic.

637
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:32,660
This is not a disaster at all, but that one there's this French made document or BBC

638
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:38,860
or something documentary about Tim Delaney making Space Mountain for Disneyland Paris.

639
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:41,980
And that's close enough to an honest, like not Disney polished.

640
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:42,980
Yeah.

641
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:43,980
That it's it's fantastic.

642
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,980
Oh, my God.

643
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:45,980
Right.

644
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:48,420
Even seeing any honesty in the Disney process anywhere.

645
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,420
Right.

646
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,420
So.

647
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,420
Yeah.

648
00:33:52,300 --> 00:34:01,260
The way everyone is in this movie, I mean, there I understand and I've tried my best

649
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,260
to do it.

650
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:04,140
I don't know, successfully or not.

651
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:08,380
But there is a certain level of polish and professionalism.

652
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:17,540
But with the Disney company, they're everyone's laying it on so thick it seems like it would

653
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:21,940
drive a person to madness or at least burn out, you know?

654
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:26,900
Well, the guy Roger Allers, who's the guy who gets fucked the most by the original

655
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:32,020
director, who was one of the directors of Lion King and a major creative figure and

656
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,180
at least beating the beast.

657
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:37,740
And I forget Aladdin or a little I want to say Little Mermaid, maybe who and who after

658
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:41,860
this left the company, did not do anything with Disney again, kept working.

659
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:46,180
But like, I mean, you see him just like on the beach and like he's just like dried by

660
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,260
the hole.

661
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:52,260
And he describes in this vulture thing like, yeah, imagine you get you get like good and

662
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,900
you get like the worst screening of my life.

663
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:59,420
And now I have to go like pull it together and like talk on camera as if I'm not having

664
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,420
a meltdown.

665
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,420
Right.

666
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:06,980
I mean, it's like it was probably not in there at the maybe now people might kind of be themselves

667
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,980
a little more.

668
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:13,580
But at the time, can you imagine like actually just like just bursting into tears in a document?

669
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:14,580
I don't know.

670
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,580
It would be crazy.

671
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,660
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

672
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,300
It wouldn't have happened back then.

673
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,780
So it's incredible how he kept it together.

674
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,340
Right. Everybody keeps it together.

675
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:25,500
And I I forget who says this now that you bring that up, because I something caught

676
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,420
me. Somebody says, I think it's after Sting sends.

677
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,260
So, yeah, we'll guess we're jumping around.

678
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:34,300
Sting sends a letter at some point being like, I don't agree with the choices in this

679
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,140
essentially. Yeah, I need to leave.

680
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,900
But he was a polite letter.

681
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,300
But it is like I don't like this.

682
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:43,460
But then one of the guys on the crew, shit, I forget who it is.

683
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,340
He says something that I don't believe he believes.

684
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:49,780
He says, well, you know, Sting isn't used to getting all these different opinions in

685
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:54,860
these voices, but we are we love to get we love to hear like all these different

686
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:58,060
opinions about everything. And I'm like, you don't believe that.

687
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:00,260
Yeah. Like, this is just how it has to be.

688
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,540
You have to talk yourself into it.

689
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,300
Right. I obviously like collaborating is good.

690
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:07,580
But like, it sounds like there's so many voices, people wanting to get their two cents

691
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:11,540
in that, like, I don't believe that guy could pass a lie detector test saying that.

692
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:16,940
I also, I mean, as someone who's been in therapy for years, like watching this, then

693
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:22,220
I'm going like, this is an absolutely terrible way to communicate.

694
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:27,500
Like, you're not no one's getting their ideas across with this many members of a

695
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,780
committee like this many cooks in the kitchen.

696
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,940
No one's getting their ideas across.

697
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,420
No one is happy.

698
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:40,940
But like Sting, I you do at the end of the documentary, you begrudgingly

699
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,700
go like, yeah, it's a lot.

700
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:46,980
But I mean, I guess it works sometimes.

701
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:51,620
I know. And it kind of does because he's performing at the Oscars.

702
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:54,980
It all did kind of work. I think there's I think there's also I wonder if it's worse

703
00:36:54,980 --> 00:37:00,100
with what you're saying about like, yeah, like being in touch with, you know, therapy

704
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:05,220
teachings or whatever that like I wonder if it was like in a way, would it be more

705
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,100
helpful? Because like this seems like a bad creative process.

706
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,300
Right. But then I'm like, well, you know, what would have been worse is like working

707
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:15,340
for like Scott Rudin or something who's screaming and throwing phones.

708
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:20,460
Probably worse. But also, there's something to be said about like like a despot.

709
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:24,660
And at least you're like, well, I hate the despot, but at least the despot is clear.

710
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,780
It's clear. It's not like 20 people being passive aggressive with each other,

711
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:32,580
because that's something I read in the vulture thing that, you know, a lot of people

712
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:36,540
in the vulture thing have very bad things to say about Jeffrey Katzenberg, you can

713
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:41,580
imagine. But they do say, look, at least it was like, here's what it is.

714
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:45,780
You're doing it's Pocahontas Shades of Romeo and Juliet mixed with such and such.

715
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:50,380
Right. And they always knew that's what it was, even if the movie wasn't working.

716
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:53,460
Right. They that had been handed down and they were making that.

717
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:58,140
This thing was like, OK, so it's Incans and David Spade's in there and it's Prince

718
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:03,500
and the Popper. But also somebody wants to rope the sun and Isma wants to be

719
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:08,860
eternally young. And in the vulture thing, somebody describes like, I was like,

720
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,580
somebody asked me on a plane. So what do you do?

721
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,540
I make Disney movies. Oh, really? What are you working on now?

722
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:16,340
And then they felt like it took the entire flight from New York to L.A.

723
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,780
to explain the movie. Yeah.

724
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:19,980
That's when they were like, maybe something's wrong here.

725
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,820
Maybe we have to.

726
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:24,860
So I think that's maybe the problem with this is that that's good.

727
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,900
We'll just no wonder. Yeah. Maybe you needed a despot.

728
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:31,980
You know what you get with what you've described about Pocahontas?

729
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,020
That's a North Star.

730
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,020
That's at least something can go back to. Yes.

731
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:41,460
And you can also like crack open Romeo and Juliet and start going.

732
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,860
There must be something in.

733
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:45,860
Something's not working out when we go back to the tools of.

734
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,260
Yeah, yeah. Right.

735
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:51,060
Or I feel we're bringing that up, though, because I hate Pocahontas.

736
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,900
The movie Pocahontas is so like pond embers.

737
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:56,540
New Groove is absolutely more fun to watch.

738
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,580
Well, it's more fun. Yeah.

739
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:01,300
My my social social studies teacher in middle school

740
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,700
despise. Well, sure.

741
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,580
That's a good reason.

742
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:09,180
Because then every she was teaching like early American history

743
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:13,340
and all these little asshole 10 year olds are coming in like, oh, I know.

744
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:16,140
I know. And I saw Pocahontas.

745
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:20,580
I have some affection for the songs, but it was a similar

746
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:23,060
and we've said this a hundred times on the show, probably at this point.

747
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,500
But it was a situation where I couldn't articulate

748
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,860
that it was different than the last four movies.

749
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,500
You know, I mean, like it wasn't like I ran out was like,

750
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,740
I'm going to play like as Miko, the raccoon.

751
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:36,660
Like I love like, yeah, I need those toys or like whatever.

752
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,820
Like it was different. Yeah.

753
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:42,260
Wasn't it weird after like being children going from whatever,

754
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,820
like five to 10 or whatever that whatever it was.

755
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:49,260
And like, oh, my God, the group that makes the cartoon movies

756
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:53,980
gets better every time there is how do they manage to top themselves?

757
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,900
And then so what's the next one? Here we go, baby.

758
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,940
Uh, OK. Well, there's

759
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,580
Flick. What's the name of the hummingbird?

760
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,620
I know Flicks from Flick is from from books.

761
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,780
Is Flick also the hummingbird, though?

762
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:09,340
Miko is the raccoon from Pocahontas, I believe.

763
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:12,660
Yes. OK. And there's another that I don't know is telling.

764
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,980
Yeah, it is. Oh, it's Flit.

765
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:17,220
Apologies. Flit, the hummingbird.

766
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:20,260
Yeah. All right. You be Miko. I'll be Flit. Right.

767
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,140
I want to be grandmother Willow.

768
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:25,420
Mother. Well, I do think my sister and I did grandmother Willow like bits.

769
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,780
Yeah, we tried. Oh, we tried to do it.

770
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,380
We have to love this, don't we?

771
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,780
It made it very convenient to hop over to Toy Story.

772
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,140
You're like, oh, good. All right.

773
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,100
There's a new one that's fun and for children. Yes.

774
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,220
And great. Yeah.

775
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:39,340
With lots of characters we want to embrace and play and have the toys of.

776
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:42,260
Pocahontas and Hunchback back to back is similar.

777
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,780
We're like, we have to see these movies.

778
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:44,820
We love these movies.

779
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,820
And here's with apologies to Jane.

780
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:49,940
I know she loved Hunchback. I hate this film.

781
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:52,380
I hate the Hunchback. I find it so unpleasant.

782
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,620
I haven't watched it in a little while.

783
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:56,020
So I would be interested because I honestly this might be controversial.

784
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:59,860
I don't think Lion King is nearly as good as the three is Aladdin,

785
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,700
Little Mermaid or Beauty and the Beast.

786
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,580
I like Lion King a lot.

787
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,660
I think a lot. Yeah.

788
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:07,020
But like we watched it a couple of years ago and I was like,

789
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:09,220
I think it's less good than those three.

790
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,100
I mean, I know it's a different song.

791
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,820
Obviously, Howard Ashman not involved in so.

792
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,420
But I was like, it's a little less.

793
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:18,460
I think I don't think I don't think there's any wrong opinion within the four.

794
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,860
I think the only wrong opinion is that the four are bad.

795
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

796
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:26,380
I don't know. I think it's a step down from those those three.

797
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:31,500
But as a kid, I know I would love they they got me back with Hercules and Mulan.

798
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,700
You know, you really like those.

799
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,700
Yes, I like Mulan.

800
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:41,300
I mean, I think what makes I think clearly the answer started to become fun

801
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:45,780
because like when you when you assess all of those, like post the Golden Age,

802
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:49,180
you know, everybody might have a different answer of what their favorite is.

803
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:53,700
But probably people's answer most likely is going to be one of the fun ones,

804
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:58,180
because like what kind of worked and resonates and what do they still acknowledge

805
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,340
and use the characters from?

806
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:02,340
There's this and there's Lilo and Stitch.

807
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:05,900
I mean, like I think once the masterpiece thing got out of there,

808
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:09,060
well, it's like you have more user friendly movies.

809
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,620
You have to I don't know.

810
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:13,780
It just feels like you can't keep chasing the exact same thing.

811
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:18,900
Also, I mean, the big thing is they is Howard Ashman dies also.

812
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,580
Like, I don't know what would have happened.

813
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,220
I mean, that's that's in there, too.

814
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,140
Not nearly as hard.

815
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:28,100
Ashman's obviously like the the heart and the literally like the heart of the songs.

816
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:28,860
Right. Characters.

817
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:31,500
So I wonder what it would have looked like if he lived.

818
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:35,100
How many of these you would have you don't like, you know, like you're watching a lot of like

819
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:39,660
there's all these like SNL 50 documentaries right now that tell these off told stories.

820
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:43,420
But what you don't have is like and then Lorne died.

821
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:48,060
Like you like it is crazy that in the height of or whoever, you know,

822
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,700
I mean, gee, Smith, it is.

823
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:53,660
What if they had lost it and never gone on as far as the analogy?

824
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,380
The heart of the show.

825
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,540
I don't know nothing against you.

826
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:58,740
Great. But you know what I mean?

827
00:42:58,740 --> 00:42:59,780
I get this tragedies.

828
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:01,460
Chris Farley dies, but people were off this.

829
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:04,940
But it's not like, well, there's no Hartman dies when he's on the show.

830
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:09,780
So that's I think it's particularly insane that like this empires ramping up

831
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:10,980
gets better and better every time.

832
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:15,580
And then like the writer of the like immaculate music dies.

833
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:16,900
It is crazy.

834
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:21,380
I guess I sometimes maybe things are over dramatized or like

835
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:25,300
importance is put on it just because it's better for whatever documentary.

836
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:30,100
But it kind of I think is true that like Howard and Al Menken,

837
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,620
of course, their songs saved the company.

838
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:35,820
Like, I don't think there's no high hyperbole there.

839
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:41,300
Like, I don't know what Disney looks like without the talent of those two guys.

840
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,780
And especially Howard, who is the driving force.

841
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:45,300
You need the songs.

842
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:49,420
The songs like the songs sell the characters which sell the toys,

843
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,660
which makes it all work and that you fall in love with them.

844
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:52,980
And then you want to go to the theme park.

845
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:57,900
So like it is the engine of and you have to go back to like,

846
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:02,180
yeah, the songs are how you know the characters and love the characters

847
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:03,900
and love the brand. Right.

848
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:06,220
And they hadn't had any in so long.

849
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:08,860
And you bring it up to like my mom and my mom just, you know,

850
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:11,300
she has kids at this point, whatever, 1989.

851
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,420
And like she was like, and we saw the little mermaid.

852
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:17,620
We were like, whoa, like, like even adults were like, oh, shit.

853
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:20,180
OK, it's a different situation now.

854
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:21,980
Yeah. And like literally that.

855
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:27,460
So so here's just the momentum of those three movies carry Disney farther, farther along.

856
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,700
But I guess I'm lost a little bit of my point.

857
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:35,980
But basically what I'm saying is just like keeping to like chasing like epic Oscar

858
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:39,820
at a certain point, you got to switch like people that like

859
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:42,380
they like because they forgot with Pocahontas.

860
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:43,580
Who do you love?

861
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:45,420
John Smith, of course. Right.

862
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:48,300
I love John Smith and Radcliffe. Right.

863
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:49,780
You got to make it.

864
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:53,660
You got you can't make you can't make the same album all the time.

865
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:55,260
You know, at a certain point, you two makes pop,

866
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,900
but they got to go back to make a different course.

867
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:01,020
You know, Sting can't make I mean, the pressure that you can't just

868
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:02,860
they already made American Idiots perfect.

869
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:04,500
They can't now. I agree with you.

870
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,660
Twenty first century breakdown.

871
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:09,220
I feel like it's a disappointment because they tried to chase the exact same thing.

872
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:11,380
It is as American Idiots.

873
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:12,820
And I think it's just less successful.

874
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:13,500
They need to go back.

875
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,140
You know, Sting can't just do another dream of the Blue Turtles.

876
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:19,060
He has to. He's got to shake it up with the last ship, right?

877
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:20,060
He has to make sorry.

878
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:22,340
He has to make an entire album with Shaggy.

879
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:25,460
Oh, I brought this up on the show before.

880
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:29,460
Yes. And they're on fucking motorcycles like the Casamigos guys.

881
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:34,180
I showed it at the one holiday show like the Disney

882
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,860
parade or Disney Christmas special.

883
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:42,340
They're like, please welcome Sting like to the stage with Shaggy.

884
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:43,940
Yeah, it's like, what?

885
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:46,540
There may have been a couple of episodes where we talked about Sting and Shaggy's

886
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:50,940
collaboration. This is a while I somehow managed to forget your club three suggestion.

887
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:54,460
I don't want to possible possible club three loser.

888
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:55,860
It sounds like one.

889
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:58,380
Was there ever a puppet in any of your music videos?

890
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,380
I don't know.

891
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,340
But here's the thing.

892
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:06,540
I'm convinced of without even reading that oral history.

893
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:12,380
Is that the movie that came after a lot of these movies before I first knew Groove is

894
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:16,380
Tarzan and so much of that is Phil Collins.

895
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:24,060
Right. So the feeling of the must have pitched to sing like, well, this would be your

896
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:25,060
Tarzan.

897
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:26,740
Well, absolutely.

898
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:30,180
And I assume. Yeah, I've always viewed this as as a trilogy.

899
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:33,380
Lion King, Tarzan, Kingdom of the Sun.

900
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:38,900
That was Disney attempting to complete the trilogy of music by stuffy old Brits

901
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:44,700
because the first one, I mean, they don't I don't think they ever achieve higher pop

902
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:50,580
heights like like like more awards and and album sales and everything than they do

903
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:51,620
with the Elton John Lion Kiss.

904
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:54,620
So that obviously they got to keep going in that mode.

905
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,220
So Phil Collins fits the bill.

906
00:46:57,620 --> 00:47:03,180
Also, also pretty big and award winning, maybe less resonate resonating culturally.

907
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,860
But yes, Sting clearly wanted that.

908
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:10,860
And I think what he was tasked with was six songs, which was becoming the standard.

909
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:15,100
But so this is them trying to it is them trying to 21st century breakdown.

910
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:16,300
Like, that's right. We this works.

911
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:20,780
All right. So we get a guy who's doesn't make fun music anymore.

912
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:24,820
So we'll get them to come make very, very serious music for us.

913
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:30,420
And it is as I add up like and we talk about our relationship to Sting.

914
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:34,380
I mean, like, as I said, when I was growing up, these people all felt 90 years old.

915
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:40,460
Now, since then, I've I've I like a ton of Elton John Phil Collins completely my shit,

916
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:44,460
not less the Tarzan stuff, but the pop Phil Collins Sting.

917
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:46,100
Well, I like the police.

918
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,020
So listing pretty ponderous.

919
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:51,140
And it's like and then you wait.

920
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:56,580
The glimpses you get in this definitely are odd, right?

921
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:57,620
Of Sting. Yes.

922
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:02,220
The Sting when you because you kind of get some demos of what the kingdom of the sun

923
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:04,100
Sting music is going to be. Right.

924
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:07,100
Yes. Some of these are a tad hard to swallow.

925
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:08,780
Let me and again, maybe jump.

926
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:11,420
There's probably a cleaner way we can like tell the story of this.

927
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:12,980
Well, here I'll just do it.

928
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:14,900
Basically. Yeah. What you said.

929
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:16,420
I think it makes sense. Of course.

930
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:18,820
Like like like complete the pattern.

931
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:20,740
Elton John Phil Collins Sting.

932
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:26,820
They get him. There's immediate concern about like apparently they clocked even

933
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:28,340
before the documentary.

934
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:31,900
Well, you know, he might he might think he's just going to sail in,

935
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:35,940
write six masterpieces, collect his Grammys and Oscars.

936
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:37,420
And that is how this works.

937
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:40,820
I think they knew that it was going to be a bumpy ride and that they were at Disney

938
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:42,940
was a little bit more all over the map at this point.

939
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:46,980
So Tom Schumacher, executive who appears in this film, thought,

940
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:50,500
oh, well, if because they're proposing this documentary thing, we should do it

941
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,540
because that keeps Trudy Styler around.

942
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:56,580
And that makes it more likely that Sting will not bail when this process gets hard.

943
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:59,580
Because, spoiler, he kind of tries to leave in the movie.

944
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:04,220
Apparently he tried to quit the movie five times over the course of two and a half

945
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:07,300
years. But the documentary was part of like keeping him there.

946
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:09,300
And she's a filmmaker.

947
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:12,420
This was co-directed by Trudy Styler and John Paul Davidson,

948
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:16,500
director in their camp, who also directed a movie that Sting is the star of

949
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:19,300
with the very odd title Gentlemen Don't Eat Poets.

950
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:23,900
I don't know much about Gentlemen Don't Eat Poets, but neither a previous Sting

951
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:25,900
director. So that so that gets you here.

952
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:28,540
And it kind of cuts to like midway through the creative process.

953
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:31,140
It's not for the you don't watch them invent the movie from whole cloth.

954
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:33,140
It's like, here we go. We're at the Disney studio.

955
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:34,620
We're in Burbank.

956
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:38,540
You know, we're working up storyboards and Sting is all over the globe

957
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:40,060
making up these songs.

958
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:40,980
And then you'll start to.

959
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:43,300
And they do have the llama thing figured out.

960
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:45,540
They know that there's an element of somebody turning into a llama,

961
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:49,660
which results in getting to hear a little bit of this llama song.

962
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:51,060
Llama song is the highlight.

963
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:52,820
Yeah. Do you want to do do you want to do it?

964
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:55,060
I can sing a little bit of my memory of it.

965
00:49:55,060 --> 00:50:00,060
You do a little bit. I you get it's like it's Sting and there's like his piano guy.

966
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:01,620
And I know this is demos, right?

967
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:04,780
So it's not going to sound like Rich and Liv, but it's like very like keyboardy.

968
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:07,940
A ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

969
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:11,900
And then and then like a bunch of like like six like kind of cheesy session

970
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:16,140
people singing and they're all singing this song about like a llama, llama,

971
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:20,780
a llama, llama, taking the panorama, a llama, llama,

972
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:24,180
put on a green pajamas, a llama, llama.

973
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:27,820
Like, oh, this is what we're like a children's song.

974
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:30,380
It is for like babies, a song for babies.

975
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:35,660
It's it's like Raffy, Raffy would go a little bit cheesy.

976
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:36,700
Yeah. I don't know.

977
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:40,020
Llama, llama, boba, banana, fan, a pho, banana.

978
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:45,180
What you said about Sting being all over the world leads to one of my favorite,

979
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:49,180
if not my favorite line in the movie.

980
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:50,740
Go ahead.

981
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:53,220
Good luck, gentlemen.

982
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:55,260
I'm going to the Himalayas.

983
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,660
Oh, yeah, yeah, that is great.

984
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:57,980
Doesn't he keep going, doesn't it?

985
00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:00,860
Like, we'll see if I return.

986
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:02,060
Right. There's a lot of that.

987
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:03,660
There's a little bit of. Yeah.

988
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:06,140
The whole thing is, yeah, he's somebody's in the Himalayas.

989
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:09,420
And then he's in like he's in like the, you know, the deep British countryside.

990
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:13,300
The vulture thing said he lived out, you know, in the out in the countryside,

991
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:15,180
kind of near Stonehenge. Right.

992
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:18,100
And then you see him like he's even I mean, you see him like,

993
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:22,900
is he playing the literal Coliseum or did they just drive by the Coliseum?

994
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:24,460
But he's like globetrotting.

995
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:27,460
The first time the first time you ever see him in the movie, he's

996
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:34,180
playing chess, sipping tea while holding an acoustic guitar in his lap

997
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:36,700
and in the most like English garden, kind of.

998
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:40,100
It's it's so getting the slices of Sting's life.

999
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:41,980
He's sitting by the.

1000
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:43,780
Yeah, he's sitting by the ocean.

1001
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:46,100
Oh, well, yeah, because he's got a Malibu house as well.

1002
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:48,220
Yeah, he's in the Himalayas.

1003
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:49,220
In the Himalayas.

1004
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:51,940
They keep cutting the people in hot springs.

1005
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:53,220
What am I forgetting? Tuscany.

1006
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:55,860
He goes to Tuscany. He goes to Tuscany. Yeah.

1007
00:51:55,860 --> 00:52:00,420
Thinking about the like anecdotes about Bono writing Spider-Man

1008
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:05,460
Turn Off the Dark, Sting makes Bono look like he has no pretension at all.

1009
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:08,180
Just a guy. You know, you catch him at Sabaro.

1010
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:11,420
Like Bono seems like kind of more excited during that and reading that book.

1011
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:15,580
Well, I ran into I ran into I ran into Bono just ordering from Kane's Chicken.

1012
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:16,660
Yeah. Right.

1013
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:18,060
Saw to the Earth guy.

1014
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:20,860
Oh, yeah. Like George Lucas at the food court.

1015
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:24,420
Oh, wait, when he called John Chu, is that what you're talking about?

1016
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:25,220
Oh, no. That's a different.

1017
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:27,380
That's a different food court.

1018
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:29,740
But he did call Wicked's John Chu.

1019
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:31,740
I'm at the food court. I just saw the movie.

1020
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:35,580
Yeah. Yeah. He went to a movie theater by your animal.

1021
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:38,340
There's no there's a photo of him, which is like

1022
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:42,540
two items and noodles and a diet Coke.

1023
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:43,140
He's alone.

1024
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:46,340
And a newspaper just sitting in a food court.

1025
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:49,420
There's a great one of the greatest George Lucas clips is that he accidentally

1026
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:53,140
walks in the frame of a documentary or a news you've seen that before.

1027
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:54,740
It's kind of goes like that's fascinating.

1028
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:56,980
Oh, oh, oh, oh, sorry. Sorry.

1029
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:02,460
But yes, thing is so it couldn't seem more comically pretentious.

1030
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:06,260
Yeah. For again, versus Bono, who is comically pretentious already.

1031
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,180
Yeah. Defined by comic pretension.

1032
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:10,780
No adult. All the globetrotting just made me like,

1033
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:14,980
you know, that next they're going to cut to him like, well, gentlemen,

1034
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:19,260
I'm heading to the lost city of Atlantis for only Bono and I know where it is.

1035
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:23,140
So I'll be I'll be breathing through the gills I had.

1036
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:28,260
I took a number of pills in order to make me last for 16 hours in the bedroom.

1037
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:32,740
And at the same time, I had a gill gill surgery.

1038
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:36,980
Performed a ritual where the ancient king of the fish came to me

1039
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:41,180
and granted me certain powers that will allow me to breathe.

1040
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:45,060
What I'm saying is I don't have cell service down there.

1041
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:49,740
You'll have to you'll have to send a ship in a bottle.

1042
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:51,260
That's the only way to reach me.

1043
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:53,540
And even that's probably going to take four months.

1044
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:56,460
You'll have to prick a hole in it for it to fill up very slowly

1045
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:59,340
and then drop all two miles down to the bottom,

1046
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:01,940
where I'll be residing with the king of the fishermen.

1047
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:06,300
And then he does a 15 minute version of message in a bottle with on a loop.

1048
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:11,700
Oh, yeah, I'll I'll be unreachable.

1049
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:14,820
I'm going to Santa's private villa at the North Pole.

1050
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:18,620
Saint Nicholas is what he calls him.

1051
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:21,620
I actually people don't know I bred Donner.

1052
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:26,340
That's that's Donner is co-owned by Santa and I said, do you want

1053
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:27,500
do you want to help raise a reindeer?

1054
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:30,460
And I said, yes, well, I've always been concerned about deforestation

1055
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:32,700
and the melting of the North Pole.

1056
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:33,980
And so I helped breed.

1057
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:37,140
I chose a sire to breed Donner.

1058
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:39,700
Santa, no, Santa and I go way back.

1059
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:46,780
What you were saying earlier, Scott, about the three like

1060
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:51,020
the stuffy Brits, the stuffy Brits, like even those movies.

1061
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:53,460
Again, they had no stars to go back to.

1062
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:55,460
I always heard Lion King.

1063
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:57,660
Well, it's pretty similar to Hamlet.

1064
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:59,580
It's not an exact one to one.

1065
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:02,780
But there's a lot of this thing, Kimba, that we're ripping off.

1066
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:04,700
Right. It's Hamlet meets the thing we're stealing.

1067
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:08,740
Yeah. So you got a hamlet to go back to.

1068
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:10,340
Worst case, then Tarzan.

1069
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:12,020
Well, there's tons of Tarzan.

1070
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:13,220
So you got to have Tarzan.

1071
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:15,420
You got to have Jane. You can blow it out.

1072
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:20,020
It seems like that was missing if it's taking a full plane ride

1073
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:23,540
to explain what kingdom of the sun. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1074
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:24,580
And that's what it is.

1075
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:28,380
It's interesting that they would like that they had all these elements

1076
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:32,460
and they just weren't like cooking them correctly.

1077
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:33,660
I related to it.

1078
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:35,660
And it's funny that I like watching these things

1079
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:39,580
because it's also like stress inducing in a weird way, too.

1080
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:42,380
Oh, I felt it. I felt it. Yeah, yeah.

1081
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:45,860
But it flashed me to there was there was this is such a small potatoes

1082
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:48,580
in comparison to a big movie that millions are being spent on.

1083
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:50,180
But I do remember

1084
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:55,340
a movie city, my show I was making like the first round went pretty good.

1085
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:55,940
We're like everybody.

1086
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:57,940
We got our head around the first set of episodes.

1087
00:55:57,940 --> 00:55:59,780
And then there was one we're like, what if we did something with this?

1088
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:01,940
And I had this and this and this. Yeah, that sounds good.

1089
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:05,580
And then it was like it was just not jealous.

1090
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:08,340
There was no it was just not gelling.

1091
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:09,580
There was no core.

1092
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:11,940
It was like it was like what's described in this movie, like why?

1093
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:15,260
It seems like a story with this and this and aiming for this guest

1094
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:19,500
and all this shit that it would all and it just doesn't turn into anything.

1095
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:22,460
It's like and it gave me those panics.

1096
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:26,100
And and and that I just related to it in that, like, well,

1097
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:31,140
you can't be too heady about it because they they need a draft of this next week.

1098
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:33,060
Like we can't take forever.

1099
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:36,940
And then extrapolate that with like like, yeah, well, we're back

1100
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:40,700
to a happy meal deal and we've spent 40 million dollars.

1101
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:44,580
Another thing that's not in the documentary is Tom Schumacher,

1102
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:48,580
one of the executives going to forget who one of the writers

1103
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:49,900
or somebody on the creative team.

1104
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:52,940
And and like he has to he's going to meet Eisner.

1105
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:54,980
They're in the animation building.

1106
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:57,900
It's the fun over here with the hat and it's kooky.

1107
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:01,180
Oh, he's got to go across the street and go talk to Eisner.

1108
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:03,100
And he's he's close to tears.

1109
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:05,860
And he's saying, I have to talk to this man.

1110
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:09,220
And we've spent 40 million dollars and we have nothing to show for it.

1111
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:10,940
What can I tell this?

1112
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:13,420
And this is after some of the events of the film. Right.

1113
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:15,620
This is how close to the bone they were.

1114
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:18,260
One one thing you got a fortunate thing about the movie.

1115
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:21,060
Almost no Eisner. You see his back at one point.

1116
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:23,460
I was going to say, yeah, I George Steinbrenner.

1117
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:26,460
Yeah, yeah, it's too bad.

1118
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:29,420
Getting some candid Eisner definitely would have been great.

1119
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:30,580
You get some Roy Disney.

1120
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:34,780
And what you get is I don't want to go too far without talking about Tom Schumacher.

1121
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:36,500
And there's another guy.

1122
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:39,060
Now I'm forgetting the other name.

1123
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:42,660
But either way, there's these two guys who are like the same

1124
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:44,900
and they're the same as all executives are.

1125
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:47,100
And this was these guys.

1126
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:49,420
Look, I'm sure they've all done some good things

1127
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:51,540
and they've contributed to these movies.

1128
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:54,780
But like, boy, these are some executive executives.

1129
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:57,420
They come off pretty bad.

1130
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:02,260
They are because they're they just seem so like silver spoon

1131
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:05,380
elitist. And you're like we were watching like direct this.

1132
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:07,340
Roger Alex just pours hard into it.

1133
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:12,140
And it all stems from his like desire to like get the Incan culture correct.

1134
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:15,700
And then forgive me, I might butcher the name, but Andreas Deha.

1135
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:20,500
The and that's a cool facet of this is that before the conflict starts,

1136
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:24,020
you get to see some of the people involved in the Golden Age just raw

1137
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:27,020
and looking at their process and watching, seeing how excited they are

1138
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:28,740
to talk about their art. And that's the guy.

1139
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:32,660
He was doing Yzma in this and before that, he was like Mr.

1140
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:35,140
Villain. He was Gaston. He was Scar.

1141
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:37,340
He was Jafar. Yeah.

1142
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:40,140
And he was really excited to do a female and a larger than life.

1143
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:43,740
And then like he's just the rug is pulled out from under him.

1144
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:47,700
And this look ultimately, I don't know, maybe somebody could tell me

1145
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:51,100
what Tom Schumacher has done that I'm supposed to be excited about.

1146
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:54,220
Yeah, I'm looking at the guy who fucking drew Gaston.

1147
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:58,580
Yeah. Like who then this went in another direction.

1148
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:01,580
And this is in there a little bit that he's like, I just don't think you want

1149
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:04,580
what I'm selling here, even though Yzma stayed in the movie.

1150
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:07,380
And there's a period where they're like, where all the characters might be cut.

1151
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:10,900
Yzma stayed. But he's like, you don't want my Yzma.

1152
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:14,860
I'm going to go find a movie better suited to my talents, something that I believe

1153
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:16,300
is going to turn out better. Right.

1154
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:18,900
He moved to Florida where they were making Lilo and Stitch.

1155
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:23,540
And I believe he was the supervising animator of Lilo, I think.

1156
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:26,340
So that all worked out.

1157
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:29,820
But I'm like, I just look at this like things.

1158
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:31,900
They all seem pretty happy, right?

1159
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:36,180
It's a very it's a very different documentary for the first 45 minutes.

1160
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:42,140
And then there's a screening and these two uppity guys show up and then everything's

1161
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:44,620
toast. It's scorched earth after.

1162
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:47,180
And I'm kind of like, where were you guys?

1163
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:50,300
You get to come in and just say, you know, it didn't work for me.

1164
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:52,100
It's not working. Cut. It doesn't work.

1165
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:56,180
Well, the artists just bleed onto paper and earth.

1166
00:59:56,300 --> 01:00:01,700
The footage of Earth Earth Kit recording and then right after that,

1167
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:07,900
it might be who you're talking about goes like, and she just adds like a life to

1168
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:10,420
this character. She has her own take on it.

1169
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:14,420
And it really magnet everything, everything with her, which all seems like stuff

1170
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:15,820
that's not in the movie. Right.

1171
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:19,460
I rewatched the movie the other night and it all seemed unfamiliar to me.

1172
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:21,700
Entire song sting or a song for her.

1173
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:24,700
And she seems like she seems like the coolest person.

1174
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:26,180
She's still with us. She passed away.

1175
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:28,740
No, she passed away a couple of years, a while ago, I think.

1176
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:32,940
But yes, she's just like, I don't know if it's just her voice, but the energy like

1177
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:36,380
she just always has her energy, like her Earth, a kid energy where she's like

1178
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:40,260
completely magnetic in addition to just having an unusual voice.

1179
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:41,900
But still, yeah, you're watching this.

1180
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:43,020
You're like, why isn't Earth a kid?

1181
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:44,420
Why wasn't she more stuff?

1182
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:46,340
The other person were like, they should have.

1183
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:47,620
People should have used her more.

1184
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:50,420
I mean, this is a that's a very cool use of her.

1185
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:51,500
It is great. Yeah.

1186
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:59,380
Yeah. And they that said the walk around Yizma at the end is terrifying.

1187
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:00,460
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

1188
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,820
And they send the well, that's a fun thing, too.

1189
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:07,140
That's a funny thing, too, that they like they like there's bits of it that seem

1190
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:09,660
fun, even in the even in the torturous periods.

1191
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:10,980
Yeah. And they see at some point.

1192
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:13,700
All right. The theme park characters are ready and they do a little walk around.

1193
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:14,820
And yes, that's very scary.

1194
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:18,980
There's a part where they install like a big stone gateway, which reminded me a lot

1195
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:20,900
of what we got to see when we went to Mattel.

1196
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:23,660
That's what Mattel is. A lot of Mattel is just like an office.

1197
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:27,780
But then, like, oh, here you get to enter your cubicle, but it's through like

1198
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:30,620
Barbie land or, you know, whatever.

1199
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:32,340
Or the He-Man or whatever.

1200
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:34,380
So that was cool to see.

1201
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:37,940
But I like that people I like that people are having absolute panic attacks while

1202
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:43,060
walking under a big ink and still like pillar door every day.

1203
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:49,300
That that does bring up a couple that the thing seeing at the end

1204
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:55,220
says something. This isn't the exact quote, but he refers to Daisy

1205
01:01:55,540 --> 01:02:00,340
taking the best parts, the best of different cultures and grinding up like

1206
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:02,820
hamburger. And I did.

1207
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:07,660
I was like, oh, it's pretty, pretty good line.

1208
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:11,980
And then you look at this, this everyone interviewed.

1209
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:14,740
And I'm like, I thought of that.

1210
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:16,060
There's a stand up.

1211
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:20,140
I forget who said it at the beginning of a set, said, like, wow,

1212
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:24,780
a lot of guys here tonight that look like me.

1213
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:28,020
And I got that kind of ice.

1214
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:29,700
Felt like that.

1215
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:33,340
Looking at this movie like, oh, a lot of guys who look like me there.

1216
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:35,340
I did not see.

1217
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:39,980
I mean, that's a lot of dopey white guys with beards and that's the enjoy.

1218
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:43,020
Yeah. Once they open it up to the full creative brain trust.

1219
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:44,340
Yeah, it's entirely that.

1220
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:50,180
And there's no one of this lineage to like give the real deal in the history.

1221
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:54,860
And then there's like there's maybe one woman interviewed on camera.

1222
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:56,180
Maybe so. Yeah.

1223
01:02:56,180 --> 01:02:59,900
It's also funny that they're like when we need we want kind of like a Cuban beat

1224
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:02,780
to it. Who should we get? Sting Sting.

1225
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:06,420
Well, and they're like, they might move it to Jamaica.

1226
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:10,580
And I'm like, Jesus, I'm like, yeah, this wouldn't fly today.

1227
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:16,580
But now today they just take the best of different intellectual properties

1228
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:18,980
and try to cobble something together.

1229
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:23,220
They just bought Marvel and Star Wars and try to figure it out

1230
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:27,180
because it's not appropriate to dissect cultures.

1231
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:31,660
I feel like really nearly it's there's like hints in the early part of the documentary

1232
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:34,420
that like they're like, yeah, you know, Sting's in use recording songs.

1233
01:03:34,420 --> 01:03:35,820
But like, we don't really know what this is.

1234
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:38,540
Like there's a mention of there's a couple of mentions of like,

1235
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:40,580
we're not it's not quite coming together.

1236
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:43,780
But like we have a lot of elements and you're like, do you already have Sting?

1237
01:03:43,780 --> 01:03:48,940
Like I would be so nervous to bring Sting in until it was like set.

1238
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:50,500
Right. Go. Yeah.

1239
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:54,060
The confidence of maybe the studio at that point or the people involved.

1240
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:59,020
Like I like I'm trying to think like I haven't worked with that many famous people.

1241
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:01,860
Pauly Shore, Bing Crosby's widow.

1242
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:05,140
But when you're dealing with a Pauly Shore, Bing Crosby's widow.

1243
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:07,380
Yeah. I mean, how that ups everybody's game.

1244
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:11,900
Yeah. But I will say I was stressed out like if I had to show them a thing I did.

1245
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:15,900
Like, so like that, just the idea of like Sting's coming in here.

1246
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:18,900
And there's a chance that like we're going to really have to rework this.

1247
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:23,260
The stress, that's the biggest stress I felt early on, knowing that like

1248
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:26,220
you're going to have to have these uncomfortable conversations with Sting.

1249
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:29,580
Well, look, Sting is Sting and Sting's done what he's done.

1250
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:33,980
But Tom Schumacher is Tom Schumacher and he studied theater in college.

1251
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:37,140
That no, that is what Tom Schumacher was thinking, probably.

1252
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:40,020
So it's a I hear I get it.

1253
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:43,780
But that part of it, I'm like, oh, my God, Sting should come in six months

1254
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:48,780
before this comes out once the movie's like done and just be like, Sting here, here, here, here.

1255
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:50,300
Yeah. Write your songs, write your.

1256
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:53,100
But they write them with the Howard Ashman model is the

1257
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:55,740
yes, the composer writes the movie, too.

1258
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:57,860
I guess that's the problem.

1259
01:04:57,860 --> 01:05:01,660
But there should be like a crash course.

1260
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:04,460
There should be a fixer gets one hour.

1261
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:08,060
It take it goes to lunch with Sting and goes, OK, listen,

1262
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,700
here's how this stuff gets done.

1263
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:15,580
We recognize that you're like a top selling recording artist.

1264
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:19,420
And we're willing to work with you on making bingo, baka, baffo.

1265
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:22,100
Let me talk turkey with you, pal.

1266
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:23,540
Here's how this shit's going to go.

1267
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:25,260
You're going to be on this for like years.

1268
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:28,380
Yeah. That like, I don't know.

1269
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:30,820
I think there is going to pop in and pop out.

1270
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:32,900
Get your Oscar, pal. OK.

1271
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:34,460
You're going to be in the shit.

1272
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:35,340
You're sorry.

1273
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:37,540
The brand new day tour.

1274
01:05:37,540 --> 01:05:41,540
It's going to be a brand new millennium by the time you cancel that shit.

1275
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:43,340
Yeah, thing. All right. You're in here.

1276
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:47,460
Move next door to this studio because we're going to need you here from nine to five,

1277
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:50,060
nine to ten every day. All right.

1278
01:05:50,060 --> 01:05:51,820
Get a little duplex in Burbank.

1279
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:54,140
I'm sure you and you and Trudy can make it work.

1280
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:56,500
Get used to jerking off really fast.

1281
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:59,460
You ain't having sex for a long time with your wife, OK?

1282
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:01,620
You're going to have to speed tantric. Five minutes.

1283
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:02,700
There's a room for it.

1284
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:03,700
Drill a hole in the wall.

1285
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:05,740
There's a room for the animators. Go in there.

1286
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:06,940
Go at it like a woodpecker.

1287
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:09,900
None of these guys have had sex with their wives in ten years.

1288
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:13,100
They've been hitting out, putting out classics.

1289
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:16,900
These work days are tantric.

1290
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:19,620
These are 18 hour sessions, OK?

1291
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:21,420
That's how it works here.

1292
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:23,420
Pick what you like for lunch.

1293
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:28,500
Paquito Moss or Ribs USA, because that's what's closest, Trudy.

1294
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:32,140
There's a wiener schnitzel over by NBC.

1295
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:35,660
Everyone gets sick there, but they keep getting it.

1296
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:38,060
Let me go into the actual.

1297
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:40,500
That's like weave the tale a little bit and say some things.

1298
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:41,580
You know what's interesting?

1299
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:43,300
This is not referred to out loud.

1300
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:46,900
This is just you have to catch it and you have to hear the iconic voice,

1301
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:49,860
the now iconic voice in order to get that it's happening,

1302
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:53,500
because you see some clips of the old movie of Kingdom of the Sun

1303
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:55,980
and you see that it's a Prince and the Popper situation.

1304
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:59,380
And it's the names of the characters that ended up in there.

1305
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:04,140
It's Kuzco and it's Pacha and Pacha

1306
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:08,180
in what ends up being John Goodman,

1307
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:13,380
a like a much taller, stockier sort of a father figure

1308
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:16,900
to Kuzco in this.

1309
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:18,620
It's the same name.

1310
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:21,540
Yet the character, it's a Prince and the Popper situation

1311
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:23,580
where they look similar enough that they could switch places.

1312
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:26,220
And that Pacha is voiced by Owen Wilson.

1313
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:29,420
Yes, that is an Owen Wilson performance cut from.

1314
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:32,460
And I think when they hired him, he had not.

1315
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:35,780
There had not been the full wave of Owen Wilson work yet.

1316
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:38,220
I think this might have been some animators going, hey,

1317
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:40,460
this movie bottle rocket is cool.

1318
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:42,020
We should get this guy.

1319
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:42,900
So it's kind of interesting.

1320
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:46,700
It's a false start of Owen Wilson Disney before.

1321
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:51,100
Kachow. Imagine that it's the year.

1322
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:55,420
How many years before the I mean, six before it's released.

1323
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:57,460
But I don't know when they start making it or whatever.

1324
01:07:57,460 --> 01:07:59,340
So you catch some Owen Wilson.

1325
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:05,260
The you know, like you said, like things are like

1326
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:08,060
you'll occasionally catch that things are fraying a little bit.

1327
01:08:08,060 --> 01:08:10,420
And I think they're all pretty honest about the fact that,

1328
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:13,820
you know, you get what you think is working.

1329
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:16,460
You think it's it's coming together.

1330
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:19,020
But then we do these screenings and the screenings

1331
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:21,820
might kind of like rock the boat a little bit.

1332
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:25,140
And in the fateful meeting halfway through,

1333
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:27,460
where they go into the sweat box proper,

1334
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:29,380
which they define at the top of the movie,

1335
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:31,860
it's a reference to a Walt era thing

1336
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:35,580
where wherever they screened all the animation or the final products

1337
01:08:35,860 --> 01:08:39,420
was a very poorly ventilated room that made all of the animators.

1338
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:43,660
No air conditioning, no air conditioning, which is kind of crazy.

1339
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:47,020
It's like, oh, you know that one thing about the movies

1340
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:50,740
that we try to get people to go to air conditioning.

1341
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:54,020
You see, well, that's for the people enjoying the movie.

1342
01:08:54,180 --> 01:08:57,900
Yeah, for the people who have to be scared of

1343
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:00,380
Walt putting a cigar out on their forehead.

1344
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:01,420
Walt's not hot.

1345
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:04,420
He's got an unlimited supply of scotch and ice.

1346
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:05,820
So he's good to go.

1347
01:09:05,820 --> 01:09:09,620
Was his room where he got the massage from Hazel George,

1348
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:12,340
was that air conditioned?

1349
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:13,420
Was that a sweat box too?

1350
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:15,380
I'm not sure. Was that kind of was it kind of an early

1351
01:09:15,380 --> 01:09:19,100
like sweat yoga? Maybe that would like help him.

1352
01:09:19,340 --> 01:09:22,260
Perhaps exfoliate by getting getting it super hot in there.

1353
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:24,660
That helps. Yeah. Getting sweaty. Hazel.

1354
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:29,540
You know he said it, Jason.

1355
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:30,660
Don't act naive, Jason.

1356
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:34,180
Your tea cakes from Martinos are starting to melt.

1357
01:09:35,660 --> 01:09:37,820
Finishing is chilly.

1358
01:09:37,820 --> 01:09:42,180
Yeah. Chilli cigars and no ventilation.

1359
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:43,940
Give me one of those tea cakes.

1360
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:45,620
I've got to sop it up. Hazel.

1361
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:49,660
But anyway, they they everybody enters the screening

1362
01:09:49,660 --> 01:09:51,260
and they even kind of say like, so who knows?

1363
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:53,300
We might go in here and it all comes apart.

1364
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:55,300
And they have no idea that this might be one of the worst

1365
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:57,260
in the history of the company. It's wild.

1366
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:00,860
It is alluded to because somebody says somebody

1367
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:04,380
who kind of runs the screenings says every week

1368
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:07,260
people pull their pants down in front of me. Yes.

1369
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:10,820
And also somebody that person quotes somebody else saying

1370
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:13,100
that it's like these screenings are like having someone

1371
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:16,620
chop your hands off and pull your pants down in front of a crowd.

1372
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:18,900
So you just have stumps that are bleeding.

1373
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:21,140
So you're incapable of pulling your pants back up.

1374
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:25,820
That is what it's like to screen a fun cartoon for the fun executives.

1375
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:30,860
This is this is one of the like is the term dramatic irony.

1376
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:34,500
But it's one of the things when you hear about some of the behind the scenes stuff,

1377
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:37,180
it's like that's an insane way to make stuff.

1378
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:39,340
Well, they have made a lot of hair.

1379
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:45,380
Like it's one of the things, the weird things that I think does make Disney interesting.

1380
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:50,860
But then what it but what happens when but like but here we're getting into

1381
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:53,140
this is our tried and true process.

1382
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:58,140
And this is how you get Treasure Planet, Atlantis, Home on the Range,

1383
01:10:58,940 --> 01:10:59,900
Hunchback of Notre Dame.

1384
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:04,700
Like what is the justification of this process when when those are the movies?

1385
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:08,380
Yeah. And again, and again, look, this did result in Emperor's New Groove,

1386
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:11,660
which I can confirm from the other night is is pretty delightful.

1387
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:13,340
So I guess you can't. I don't know.

1388
01:11:13,340 --> 01:11:15,700
But there has to be another way, right?

1389
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:19,300
Well, there's an opening shot and there is a sign of like

1390
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:22,620
what the projects currently are, what the offices are.

1391
01:11:22,940 --> 01:11:27,340
And it says, does it say Emperor's New Groove in Atlanta?

1392
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:29,500
I would whatever it said, I would.

1393
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:33,180
Oh, well, that's the point where, yes, in production,

1394
01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:36,740
one is Atlantis and one is Kingdom in the Sun Kingdom in the Sun.

1395
01:11:36,740 --> 01:11:39,540
And you're kind of doing a double take, like I thought it was Kingdom of.

1396
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:41,180
And then they explain it to you that.

1397
01:11:41,180 --> 01:11:44,300
All right. So one change we've made is it's now Kingdom in the Sun.

1398
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:47,460
And what that is supposed to connotate, I don't know.

1399
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:50,380
I mean, is that like because now we're basking in this.

1400
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:54,380
Does that somehow from of to end, does that make it more fun in some way?

1401
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:55,740
Maybe. But that's one of the big day.

1402
01:11:55,740 --> 01:11:57,540
All right. Disaster screening.

1403
01:11:57,540 --> 01:11:59,460
No more of now it's in. Yeah.

1404
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:01,220
I good question.

1405
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:06,180
I like with with big corporations, big companies doing animation like

1406
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:09,620
it does feel like there's no other way to get around it.

1407
01:12:09,620 --> 01:12:13,740
But having a ton of people put eyes on things way too early.

1408
01:12:14,060 --> 01:12:17,860
Yeah, like it just that's the nature of it, like because it has to be storyboarded.

1409
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:21,460
Like there's so many more opportunities for people to get involved

1410
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:25,100
versus like just reading a script or like even looking at dailies

1411
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:29,100
from an executive or a producer, you're like, well, I can say it looks OK.

1412
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:31,220
When it's cut together, I'll see.

1413
01:12:31,820 --> 01:12:34,220
I feel like you can get farther along in the process

1414
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:36,940
before you get more interference.

1415
01:12:37,340 --> 01:12:41,340
Yeah, maybe I'm wrong about that, but it feels like there's so many more steps

1416
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:42,580
along the way of like.

1417
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:45,660
Are you saying it's worse that there's more points of check in

1418
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:47,420
so it can be noodle with it all time?

1419
01:12:47,420 --> 01:12:48,380
That's what I mean. Yeah.

1420
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:54,540
And later check ins like I feel like if early on, everyone got together and went,

1421
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:58,020
OK, we're going to be frank, but not cruel.

1422
01:12:58,340 --> 01:13:00,540
And I will not get my feelings hurt.

1423
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:03,180
That is the agreement we're working off of.

1424
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:08,420
OK, everyone good break, but that doesn't often happen

1425
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:12,500
because it's hard to get everyone on the same page.

1426
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:16,580
And also, it's not just like, what's your endgame here?

1427
01:13:16,740 --> 01:13:20,820
There's 12 different endgates because marketing has to worry about one thing.

1428
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:23,260
Executives have to worry about one thing.

1429
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:25,980
The McDonald's reps have to worry about one thing.

1430
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:28,060
It seems like a common thing.

1431
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:32,620
It's like, all right, if we assess what came out of this process, pretty strong.

1432
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:35,180
Lion King, Toy Story.

1433
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:39,140
I think Leland Stitchmack qualifies this like a common thing you hear

1434
01:13:39,140 --> 01:13:42,300
about a lot of movies that succeeded is that like it's there's this

1435
01:13:42,820 --> 01:13:45,460
is this aspect of nobody knew what we were doing.

1436
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:48,420
We didn't have a lot of oversight because they were paying attention to the other thing.

1437
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:52,020
So we're just these scrappy guys in the bungalows and maybe some of the early ones, too,

1438
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:54,620
because like, you know, they think Disney animation is dead.

1439
01:13:54,620 --> 01:13:55,340
We're trying. All right.

1440
01:13:55,340 --> 01:13:57,940
Let's try a little mermaid before we burn the entire thing down

1441
01:13:58,180 --> 01:14:00,420
and then and then ended up working.

1442
01:14:00,460 --> 01:14:03,780
But it does seem like an important facet

1443
01:14:03,780 --> 01:14:08,140
that things get to operate in sort of a bubble where there's not a zillion

1444
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:10,780
people weighing in at all times.

1445
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:14,340
It does seem like a lot of great things come out of that.

1446
01:14:14,580 --> 01:14:16,140
Yes. Yes.

1447
01:14:16,140 --> 01:14:18,140
And then, like, if there is, yeah, I don't know.

1448
01:14:18,140 --> 01:14:21,060
Obviously, I'm sure there's great things have been made with a ton of input.

1449
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:25,020
And in some ways, I feel like newer Pixar stuff that works,

1450
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:29,820
maybe like a Toy Story 4 in some ways, I feel like I can feel a committee of like

1451
01:14:29,820 --> 01:14:32,180
everyone is like the jokes.

1452
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:34,100
I don't know. It's packed full of stuff.

1453
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:37,620
And I or Simpsons or early Simpsons works.

1454
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:41,220
And it's from what I've heard, it's like everybody threw in

1455
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:44,780
joke punch ups like there are 20 voices in that room.

1456
01:14:44,820 --> 01:14:45,780
But there's that committee.

1457
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:49,020
There's not. But it's a literally no executive type of committee.

1458
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:52,260
That's another thing, too, is that when you look at it, let's take TV.

1459
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:53,100
What are some what are we?

1460
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:55,180
What do we agree are some of the best shows ever?

1461
01:14:55,180 --> 01:15:00,140
Simpsons, Seinfeld, South Park, zero executive notes on any.

1462
01:15:00,220 --> 01:15:01,660
Right. Yes, true. Yes.

1463
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:04,620
At least not past the very, very early.

1464
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:05,660
Right. Point.

1465
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:09,940
Which is why I am staring at this Tom Schumacher like, all right, buddy.

1466
01:15:10,220 --> 01:15:12,220
Right. Yes, of course.

1467
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:17,700
Yeah, because like it's every every all those shows have different processes,

1468
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:19,900
as far as I understand.

1469
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:23,140
Like Larry and Jerry are the ones who just did the final pass

1470
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:26,580
and made everything seemingly better or punched everything up.

1471
01:15:26,620 --> 01:15:28,700
You need your internal despotism. Right.

1472
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:29,780
I think. But you.

1473
01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:33,460
But it has to come from people who know how to make the right to make a thing.

1474
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:35,300
But it does sound like when Conan's talking about like writing

1475
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:38,300
monorail episode of The Simpsons, he's like, yeah, I wrote it.

1476
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:42,140
But you have to understand that all these great comedy writers.

1477
01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:45,020
Oh, that's very true. Yeah. So much stuff into.

1478
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:47,020
And I almost feel like I took the reverse with Seinfeld.

1479
01:15:47,020 --> 01:15:49,100
We're like, you got a good writer who gave them a script.

1480
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:52,460
And then Jerry and Larry finished finished it. Oh, sure.

1481
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:54,140
So it feels almost like reverse.

1482
01:15:54,140 --> 01:15:58,660
By the way, eventually credited with screenplay by or written by,

1483
01:15:58,660 --> 01:16:02,060
I forget, is a guy, Dave Reynolds, who worked on a lot.

1484
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:03,780
He was he ended up part of the brain trust.

1485
01:16:03,780 --> 01:16:05,900
I think ended up writing on writing.

1486
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:07,460
Did he get the credit on finding Nemo?

1487
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:08,940
He's one of the main writers on finding Nemo.

1488
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:14,580
But original Conan writer late night in 93, he's in there with Smigel

1489
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:17,420
and Louie and Dino Stamatopoulos and Odenkirk.

1490
01:16:17,420 --> 01:16:20,380
And there's a photo of Michael Gordon, who I crossed over with,

1491
01:16:20,380 --> 01:16:21,780
who was the masturbating bear.

1492
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:23,980
It was always the same Conan trivia.

1493
01:16:23,980 --> 01:16:26,580
If you don't know, the masturbating bear was always the same guy.

1494
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:28,540
That's great. All those years.

1495
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:31,700
When another star struck, if I met him and knew that

1496
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:37,060
Tress McNeil, I would just feel like the bear.

1497
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:40,020
I think he was pretty, you know, because like we can all picture

1498
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:41,940
the motion, right?

1499
01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:45,180
And I think sometimes other people would do it and he'd go, no, no, no, no.

1500
01:16:45,380 --> 01:16:46,900
As it was, there's like a particular way.

1501
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:49,300
There's a cupping and then a pause,

1502
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:51,780
like a kind of a pause for for dramatic impact.

1503
01:16:51,780 --> 01:16:54,220
And then, but, but, but, but, but, but, but.

1504
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:56,100
And it's not even really a proper jerk off.

1505
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:58,220
It's kind of this like wild.

1506
01:16:58,220 --> 01:16:58,980
Yeah, yeah.

1507
01:16:58,980 --> 01:17:00,940
It's a very odd motion.

1508
01:17:00,940 --> 01:17:02,420
And with circus music.

1509
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:03,820
Hard to do in a bear suit.

1510
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:06,620
So credit to the great Michael Gordon.

1511
01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:09,060
But anyways, but yeah, you know, like comedy,

1512
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:10,500
royalty, original Conan guy writing it.

1513
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:11,740
And he seems delightful.

1514
01:17:11,740 --> 01:17:14,700
He seems like one of the people who's like part of the rescue mechanism.

1515
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:17,420
I will say that after the schism happens, big scary screen,

1516
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:20,260
then you go to a meeting where people are just saying

1517
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:22,420
that didn't work for me. It's not funny.

1518
01:17:22,420 --> 01:17:24,460
It's not everybody's against this thing.

1519
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:28,500
Except it stings in there because he went and he's just like

1520
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:31,980
kind of like staring at the wall and like, oh, I don't know.

1521
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:34,420
I liked it. I quite liked it.

1522
01:17:34,420 --> 01:17:38,020
And then clearly, that's one of the junctures where you think he's going to bolt.

1523
01:17:38,260 --> 01:17:40,980
And while they're all meeting and they're all like

1524
01:17:40,980 --> 01:17:43,860
and what I was doing at the top of the episode, like everything might be gone.

1525
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:46,460
What you say might be in Jamaica now.

1526
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:48,500
Like like all the characters might be gone.

1527
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:50,500
New movie and all the casting might be different.

1528
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:51,900
Like nobody knows.

1529
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:56,500
And I guess what really happened here was that the team was split in two.

1530
01:17:56,700 --> 01:18:00,140
They took the entire story department and they said, all right,

1531
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:02,820
first half goes with Roger Allers, the original guy.

1532
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:07,660
Everybody else goes under another guy named Chris Williams,

1533
01:18:07,660 --> 01:18:11,780
who ended up being one of the primary people on Bolts and Big Hero 6 and Moana.

1534
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:13,300
Huge Disney career after that.

1535
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:15,700
And Chris Williams cracked the new path

1536
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:18,700
that's more about like buddy, buddy.

1537
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:21,420
And Pacha is a very different guy.

1538
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:23,100
And what about this guy, Kronk?

1539
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:24,180
He might be in there.

1540
01:18:24,180 --> 01:18:29,300
I think no Kronk in the beginning, who ends up being very important to the movie.

1541
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:32,420
But so like they pitted two sides against each other.

1542
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:36,020
And from the vulture thing, everybody said this was harder than the movie made it.

1543
01:18:36,180 --> 01:18:40,180
This was like somebody who's lived with this for two and a half years has to like

1544
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:45,660
he knows that in the room next door, his friends are competing against him.

1545
01:18:45,980 --> 01:18:49,260
And ultimately, before the die was even cast, he just said, like,

1546
01:18:49,580 --> 01:18:52,020
I see where it's going. I don't want to disrupt.

1547
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:53,300
I don't want to be in anyone's way.

1548
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:55,220
I'm just going to bow out.

1549
01:18:55,220 --> 01:19:00,100
And then he's just like sad and walking the beach as you see Sting as well.

1550
01:19:00,220 --> 01:19:03,780
This thing, this this documentary just watches all these people just get

1551
01:19:03,980 --> 01:19:08,740
hit by the Disney wrecking ball, one big ball and then two little balls on top.

1552
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:12,020
Oh, that's your ball.

1553
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:13,980
That has to have been a joke that you somewhere, right?

1554
01:19:13,980 --> 01:19:15,140
Yeah. Yeah.

1555
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:17,140
Somebody must have drawn that on the wall at some point.

1556
01:19:17,140 --> 01:19:17,860
Yeah. Yeah.

1557
01:19:17,860 --> 01:19:20,860
People devastated and then the middle in the middle of this

1558
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:24,820
David Spade trying to toss off off the cuff.

1559
01:19:24,820 --> 01:19:27,740
Joe, oh, the cop that he probably worked on.

1560
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:31,700
Well, well, they they also say that he was like always stellar

1561
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:33,900
and it would whatever version Spade brought it.

1562
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:36,900
The only thing that he could just improvise and improvise

1563
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:39,100
and the only thing that I have to say is like, well, no, wait, hang on.

1564
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:41,780
You can't joke about Michael Jackson.

1565
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:42,660
This is it.

1566
01:19:42,660 --> 01:19:44,860
And this is not technically a pop culture.

1567
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:47,460
Although it got a little bit more that way.

1568
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:49,060
Shrek coming.

1569
01:19:49,060 --> 01:19:52,260
Yes. You'll have your place when Shrek is here. Yes.

1570
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:59,100
But anyway, new, new, more fun, silly deconstructionist movie

1571
01:19:59,580 --> 01:20:01,140
is is built up.

1572
01:20:01,140 --> 01:20:06,460
Suddenly, Warburton on the scene, the revelation of Warburton at this time.

1573
01:20:06,740 --> 01:20:09,780
He clearly just like that they just like

1574
01:20:10,460 --> 01:20:14,660
from not a character to like the main thing you remember

1575
01:20:14,780 --> 01:20:16,900
to the point where I forgot that there was a straight to video

1576
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:18,820
called Kronk's New Groove.

1577
01:20:18,820 --> 01:20:20,940
They just gave they gave it fully to Kronk.

1578
01:20:21,660 --> 01:20:24,260
And it got everybody back to every everyone's.

1579
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:26,300
That's one of those straight to videos that everybody's in.

1580
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:28,900
It's Spade and I think Eartha.

1581
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:30,220
And yeah, they're all still there.

1582
01:20:30,220 --> 01:20:34,700
There there is a point where someone says like and they there he is,

1583
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:37,020
I guess, he's my boyfriend.

1584
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:41,540
And I'm like, do you didn't remember that being the relationship?

1585
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:43,060
I want it's in there.

1586
01:20:43,060 --> 01:20:45,580
There's a part where there's this kind of awkward small talk.

1587
01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:49,060
And I think Spade says like he's a how old is he?

1588
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:50,220
A little younger than you.

1589
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:53,900
Oh, OK. They talk about it in kind of like a meeting a new boyfriend.

1590
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:56,300
It's never like explicitly said. OK.

1591
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:58,900
But there's that flavor. It's a good watch.

1592
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:00,700
I forget. Are you guys fond of this movie?

1593
01:21:00,700 --> 01:21:03,220
Or I am. I remember seeing it, Chris.

1594
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:07,260
It would have been like probably went with all my family, Chris.

1595
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:12,260
Yes, I think I saw this in Hercules and I was I liked them.

1596
01:21:12,260 --> 01:21:15,420
But I almost was like, where's the epic? Where's the epic nature?

1597
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:20,420
Yeah. Well, and it is it is like a weird like I think critics felt that way, too,

1598
01:21:20,420 --> 01:21:24,220
that it's like a weird trifle of a movie. Yeah, it's like really fun.

1599
01:21:24,540 --> 01:21:26,940
But when you're in the mode of like the Disney movies,

1600
01:21:26,940 --> 01:21:29,860
I go to the Disney movies and they change my life. Yeah.

1601
01:21:30,020 --> 01:21:30,940
And it's not that.

1602
01:21:30,940 --> 01:21:34,420
But in a way, I was also watching like, well, you know, it's the old ones

1603
01:21:34,420 --> 01:21:37,620
weren't like that, you know, they do an aristocats or something.

1604
01:21:37,620 --> 01:21:39,660
It's just like a bunch of silly fun.

1605
01:21:39,660 --> 01:21:42,820
It's almost a throwback to like 60s animated.

1606
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:44,980
You know, it's not important. It's just a bunch of fun.

1607
01:21:44,980 --> 01:21:47,900
Here's a fun comic of the day. Here's a fun singer of the day.

1608
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:50,580
Yeah. You go to all these places and you have a little fun time.

1609
01:21:50,580 --> 01:21:53,500
I was wrong because I should have just been like, oh, it's a different tone.

1610
01:21:53,860 --> 01:21:56,740
Yeah. But I so it was funny because I think as a kid, I was like,

1611
01:21:56,740 --> 01:21:59,140
oh, these are a little less important.

1612
01:21:59,260 --> 01:22:01,380
I wouldn't have articulated that, but I think I almost felt

1613
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:03,060
they were like more frivolous.

1614
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:06,340
I love that John Bolton's song, Go the Distance, though.

1615
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:10,260
John Bolton, John Bolton, John Bolton, your secretary of

1616
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:13,820
MSNBC contributor.

1617
01:22:13,820 --> 01:22:16,260
What is the who am I Michael Ball?

1618
01:22:16,260 --> 01:22:19,380
Michael Ball, not not the former ambassador to the UN.

1619
01:22:19,620 --> 01:22:22,380
I the guy that the guy that we were taught was like a monster

1620
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:25,060
during the Bush administration, but now MSNBC brings him out

1621
01:22:25,060 --> 01:22:26,620
as if he's like one of their best friends.

1622
01:22:26,620 --> 01:22:30,100
It was like because Trump said he didn't like him anyway.

1623
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:33,460
I was strong of a voice.

1624
01:22:33,460 --> 01:22:35,940
I love the Michael Ball.

1625
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:38,260
I will go the distance.

1626
01:22:38,260 --> 01:22:40,100
He's got the big funny mustache.

1627
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:42,860
Look at a picture of him and imagine who John Bolton is.

1628
01:22:42,860 --> 01:22:44,100
We all know John Bolton.

1629
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:45,260
We, of course, I know.

1630
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:47,540
But Trump took us to security clearance away.

1631
01:22:47,540 --> 01:22:49,100
Oh, that's right. Yeah.

1632
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:52,500
I have often dreamed of a far off place.

1633
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:54,540
That is really good.

1634
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:56,140
I know. I know.

1635
01:22:56,140 --> 01:22:57,980
I understand the humor.

1636
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:05,060
I put a little something like this, don't you think?

1637
01:23:05,060 --> 01:23:08,140
If I I was proud of myself for getting Bolton.

1638
01:23:08,140 --> 01:23:09,500
So I got half of it.

1639
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:10,540
Yeah, I got to have it.

1640
01:23:10,540 --> 01:23:11,620
That's half a name.

1641
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:14,900
So we had to be with the VHS.

1642
01:23:14,900 --> 01:23:19,060
I think at least there was a version that came with a single of

1643
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:20,580
sure. Yeah.

1644
01:23:20,580 --> 01:23:24,060
And maybe one of his other songs he did for it on the side.

1645
01:23:24,860 --> 01:23:26,340
And then just a speech he did to the UN.

1646
01:23:26,340 --> 01:23:27,340
Right.

1647
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:30,500
You know who I you know, I'd never heard.

1648
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:32,140
This is another fine friend, the Vulture thing.

1649
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:34,060
Credits of Vulture for this great piece.

1650
01:23:34,060 --> 01:23:35,460
Not shown in the movie.

1651
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:36,740
Cut from the second.

1652
01:23:36,740 --> 01:23:38,420
This is post revamp.

1653
01:23:38,420 --> 01:23:39,260
Yeah, West.

1654
01:23:39,260 --> 01:23:42,580
Adam West did a whole character for this that was fully cut.

1655
01:23:43,340 --> 01:23:47,740
He was a he was a strange conspiracy theorist in the town

1656
01:23:47,740 --> 01:23:53,100
that the John Goodman is so could we extrapolate that maybe

1657
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:57,020
and say there were 60s bat fans because the kit was Catwoman.

1658
01:23:57,020 --> 01:23:57,900
Yeah, yeah.

1659
01:23:57,900 --> 01:23:58,460
West was in there.

1660
01:23:58,460 --> 01:24:00,820
That feels like too much of a coincidence, but maybe not.

1661
01:24:00,820 --> 01:24:03,940
I would admit. Well, and if I don't know who is a fan of the guy

1662
01:24:03,940 --> 01:24:06,620
from Conan's original writer's room, I would guarantee is that

1663
01:24:06,620 --> 01:24:08,420
that's a good point is a bat fan.

1664
01:24:08,420 --> 01:24:13,980
And then Seth MacFarlane plucks him to be the mayor of Coahog.

1665
01:24:13,980 --> 01:24:15,140
The family guy.

1666
01:24:15,140 --> 01:24:18,220
Yeah, his animated rewards are waiting for him.

1667
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:20,540
Yeah, I watched this in chunks.

1668
01:24:20,540 --> 01:24:23,380
And I for like a couple of days, I kept having the feeling like

1669
01:24:23,380 --> 01:24:26,220
what does this whole like process remind me of something that starts

1670
01:24:26,220 --> 01:24:28,780
kind of straightforward, maybe more straightforward,

1671
01:24:28,780 --> 01:24:31,580
and then ends up kind of being a light, silly take on the material?

1672
01:24:31,580 --> 01:24:33,980
Like you take the bones of it or whatever and you make something out of it.

1673
01:24:34,420 --> 01:24:38,340
And I realized what I kept trying to think of was Conker's Bad Fur Day

1674
01:24:38,980 --> 01:24:40,060
for the Nintendo 64.

1675
01:24:40,060 --> 01:24:42,020
Scott, I don't know if you know what this is.

1676
01:24:42,020 --> 01:24:46,100
So Rare was the company that made GoldenEye, Perfect Dark,

1677
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:47,100
Donkey Kong Country.

1678
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:49,820
Yeah, you collect you collect R.A.R.E.

1679
01:24:49,820 --> 01:24:51,300
Right. Which was not.

1680
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:54,660
I was so excited about Donkey Kong Country 64, not as fun to me

1681
01:24:54,660 --> 01:24:58,180
as Donkey Kong Country was originally the Super Nintendo version.

1682
01:24:58,820 --> 01:25:01,340
But still, I liked it and I played it.

1683
01:25:01,340 --> 01:25:03,540
And I remember, you know, you get Nintendo Power.

1684
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:05,060
They would say these are the games that are coming.

1685
01:25:05,060 --> 01:25:10,300
And Rare was making Banjo Kazooie, which is was a fun platformer.

1686
01:25:11,060 --> 01:25:12,860
I know they've done one in a while.

1687
01:25:12,860 --> 01:25:14,980
And then they were also making something called Conker.

1688
01:25:14,980 --> 01:25:17,980
I don't know if it was Conker 64, but it was a cute little squirrel

1689
01:25:18,340 --> 01:25:20,740
game that looked like Banjo Kazooie.

1690
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:21,940
And I remember people being like,

1691
01:25:21,940 --> 01:25:24,300
oh, they're making like kind of the same game with a different,

1692
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:25,780
like cute little character.

1693
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:29,780
So all of a sudden, like I guess no one had heard about Conker

1694
01:25:29,780 --> 01:25:31,100
and update for a while.

1695
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:34,860
And all of a sudden, Rare was like, we are changing what Conker is.

1696
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:37,620
Now it's called Conker's Bad Fur Day.

1697
01:25:37,820 --> 01:25:40,020
And he's now a dirty squirrel.

1698
01:25:40,340 --> 01:25:44,780
And there will be like a flower with a big boobs now.

1699
01:25:44,860 --> 01:25:47,540
And it's rated and now it's rated S.

1700
01:25:47,540 --> 01:25:51,500
And that Conker is spelled, not like they're like Conker and C-O-N-K-U.

1701
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:54,500
Yeah. And then they released like dirty

1702
01:25:54,820 --> 01:25:58,380
Nintendo 64 game with Conker.

1703
01:25:58,380 --> 01:26:00,220
So they take took what was there.

1704
01:26:00,220 --> 01:26:03,900
They determined, OK, we are not going to do this like straightforward version of it.

1705
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:06,900
We're going to turn this into a mature game

1706
01:26:07,380 --> 01:26:11,140
that I don't know that I like love so much or anything.

1707
01:26:11,260 --> 01:26:12,180
This is sorry.

1708
01:26:12,180 --> 01:26:14,700
There's a there's a sexy sunflower.

1709
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:19,420
Yes. And Doja Cat dressed up as the sexiest sunflower for Halloween.

1710
01:26:19,420 --> 01:26:23,580
Oh, wow. Yes, that is a really obscure reference.

1711
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:26,940
But they had had they were already like all in on Conker

1712
01:26:26,940 --> 01:26:31,180
so much so that I had a straightforward Conker game for Gameboy, I believe.

1713
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:34,900
Like they were already doing like they made up like the non nice con.

1714
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:38,220
Yeah, they did make it like that was already like far enough in production.

1715
01:26:38,220 --> 01:26:40,020
And then they just ended up releasing.

1716
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:42,340
Well, you must have been you must have felt very betrayed

1717
01:26:42,340 --> 01:26:45,340
when your innocent Conker shows up all body.

1718
01:26:45,340 --> 01:26:46,700
I was on some level, yes.

1719
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:51,020
But then also like like uncomfortable with a human female,

1720
01:26:51,020 --> 01:26:53,740
but more comfortable with a sexy flower female.

1721
01:26:53,740 --> 01:26:56,740
So on some level, there's a layer of protection.

1722
01:26:57,140 --> 01:27:02,380
Is the title also bad for Day itself is kind of suggestive?

1723
01:27:02,620 --> 01:27:06,380
Oh, perhaps. I assume I assume so, but maybe not.

1724
01:27:06,380 --> 01:27:09,860
I don't know. There's a there's a sexy squirrel on the I don't know.

1725
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:12,020
Yeah. So I mean, yeah.

1726
01:27:13,140 --> 01:27:15,380
That is what was nagging me in my brain.

1727
01:27:15,380 --> 01:27:16,780
I was like, what does this feel like?

1728
01:27:16,780 --> 01:27:18,740
And the answer was Conker's bad for Day.

1729
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:22,900
I had heard about the, you know, nice conquer.

1730
01:27:23,220 --> 01:27:27,740
But then a few years later, I bought a Nintendo power

1731
01:27:27,740 --> 01:27:30,660
and I had mostly Nintendo systems.

1732
01:27:30,660 --> 01:27:33,860
We had Genesis and then we went to N64.

1733
01:27:34,180 --> 01:27:37,140
So I'd buy Nintendo power pretty regularly

1734
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:40,620
and would read cover to cover,

1735
01:27:40,620 --> 01:27:43,820
like would read playthroughs through for games.

1736
01:27:43,820 --> 01:27:45,820
I'm like, you didn't have I don't really have this.

1737
01:27:45,820 --> 01:27:47,940
And I don't think me or my brother are going to have this.

1738
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:51,780
But I remember getting one and reading the playthrough

1739
01:27:51,780 --> 01:27:55,980
for Conker's bad for Day and going like, oh, my God,

1740
01:27:56,580 --> 01:27:59,060
no way my mom would ever let me get

1741
01:28:00,660 --> 01:28:02,420
her day to hide this.

1742
01:28:02,420 --> 01:28:04,820
Well, as you're as you're telling that story,

1743
01:28:04,820 --> 01:28:07,500
I found the summary of the story.

1744
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:08,500
This this is the wiki.

1745
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:09,660
And I know what you're talking about.

1746
01:28:09,660 --> 01:28:10,780
Here's just a random part.

1747
01:28:10,780 --> 01:28:13,020
The dung beetle near the entrance offers Conker

1748
01:28:13,020 --> 01:28:15,980
poo balls if he can make the farm cows excrement

1749
01:28:15,980 --> 01:28:17,060
in the pasture.

1750
01:28:17,060 --> 01:28:19,900
Doing so involves Conker on the poo cabin's pasture,

1751
01:28:20,060 --> 01:28:22,420
turning on a big spigot to activate the prune juice,

1752
01:28:22,420 --> 01:28:25,860
which gives the cows diarrhea and using a bowl to open gates

1753
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:29,220
for the cows to get out as well as as well as to kill the cows

1754
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:31,700
once each one finishes defecating.

1755
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:34,140
You make a bunch of cows diarrhea and then kill them.

1756
01:28:34,220 --> 01:28:38,420
It seems. Yeah, I will say potential club three

1757
01:28:38,820 --> 01:28:40,940
Conker. Yeah, I'd say so.

1758
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:44,220
Yeah, you seem excited by suggesting new topics.

1759
01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:47,740
I don't want anyone to vote for anything that their heart doesn't desire.

1760
01:28:47,940 --> 01:28:51,260
If you want Conker's bad for a day, Conker's bad for a day.

1761
01:28:51,380 --> 01:28:52,340
Right. I got to find it.

1762
01:28:52,340 --> 01:28:54,620
Well, can I play I guess an emulator? I could find it.

1763
01:28:54,620 --> 01:28:55,900
I don't have the actual cartridge.

1764
01:28:55,900 --> 01:28:58,100
I have my N sixty four. Don't do all your mom's over.

1765
01:28:58,740 --> 01:28:59,900
You know, a good point.

1766
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:02,780
I was afraid to try. Probably goes for a lot.

1767
01:29:03,380 --> 01:29:05,340
I think that one might be a little more expensive than

1768
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:07,300
yeah, than some of the other ones.

1769
01:29:07,460 --> 01:29:10,140
But you could probably you could find it at like a vintage video game store,

1770
01:29:10,140 --> 01:29:11,860
but you got to go behind the beaded curtain.

1771
01:29:11,860 --> 01:29:12,980
Oh, yeah. Good point.

1772
01:29:12,980 --> 01:29:16,420
And there's these poo balls are too sexy to put in the front.

1773
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:21,740
It's like 10 installments of Leisure Suit Larry and then Conker.

1774
01:29:21,740 --> 01:29:24,900
And that's and ones that aren't even allowed in America.

1775
01:29:25,020 --> 01:29:28,980
Yeah. Was there maybe there's a full like catch all of like

1776
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:32,420
horny video game characters that aren't that popular.

1777
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:36,860
Leisure Suit Larry and Conker and trying to think there was one other.

1778
01:29:37,260 --> 01:29:40,500
Was one other one we had talked about that's like a Leisure Suit Larry rip off.

1779
01:29:40,580 --> 01:29:43,220
Oh, Spoogey the Dick. Oh, yeah.

1780
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:45,780
From Neo Geo.

1781
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:47,980
Jackie, the balls Neo Geo system.

1782
01:29:51,100 --> 01:29:53,940
I guess the Duke Nukem is popular, but he he was horny,

1783
01:29:53,940 --> 01:29:58,860
but he was also just regular to I bought a Duke Nukem rip off

1784
01:29:59,340 --> 01:30:01,540
when I was a senior at high school.

1785
01:30:01,540 --> 01:30:04,340
Ten dollars called Serious Sam.

1786
01:30:04,940 --> 01:30:06,860
Was serious, Sam. I never heard of this.

1787
01:30:06,860 --> 01:30:09,860
It was just also a violent first person.

1788
01:30:09,860 --> 01:30:12,780
Was there was there light nudity like there was in Duke Nukem?

1789
01:30:12,820 --> 01:30:15,660
I feel like more of a maybe a bikini.

1790
01:30:15,660 --> 01:30:17,740
Scott, you ever play Duke Nukem?

1791
01:30:17,740 --> 01:30:20,980
No, I never had whatever Duke Nukem is because I whatever I download

1792
01:30:20,980 --> 01:30:23,700
a version of Duke Nukem and you would go to like a lady in a bikini.

1793
01:30:23,700 --> 01:30:25,100
And I think she would flash you.

1794
01:30:25,100 --> 01:30:28,940
But it was like the graphics were not sophisticated.

1795
01:30:28,980 --> 01:30:32,180
You felt comfortable because they were realistic enough nipples.

1796
01:30:32,580 --> 01:30:33,420
It was pixels.

1797
01:30:33,420 --> 01:30:37,100
It was not anything that was so does its own pixelation.

1798
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:38,300
As far as that was the big.

1799
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:41,940
Yeah, it was there at Duke Nukem, like Chinese democracy

1800
01:30:41,940 --> 01:30:44,340
had a game that took forever to come out.

1801
01:30:44,340 --> 01:30:46,300
Oh, yeah. Later. And when we talked about that in the show,

1802
01:30:46,300 --> 01:30:49,740
I think, yeah, for some reason, it just it took forever.

1803
01:30:49,740 --> 01:30:52,340
And it sunk a company like an entire company.

1804
01:30:52,740 --> 01:30:56,460
And then it just came out to like silence on the on the flip side.

1805
01:30:56,460 --> 01:31:00,500
Last night, a friend of the show, Kevin Tully, exposed me

1806
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:03,300
to a video game I'd never heard of called Pebble Beach Golf Links.

1807
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:05,220
That's a very dry title.

1808
01:31:05,220 --> 01:31:08,100
It's about golfing at Pebble Beach up in northern California.

1809
01:31:08,300 --> 01:31:12,740
But what's notable about it is that there's a video contributions

1810
01:31:12,740 --> 01:31:15,580
from the golfer, Craig, the walrus, Stadler,

1811
01:31:16,220 --> 01:31:18,580
who is like a big stocky guy with a mustache.

1812
01:31:18,780 --> 01:31:20,980
And he hears a here's a here's a photo of him.

1813
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:23,500
And he appears in CD-ROM form and like,

1814
01:31:24,100 --> 01:31:26,260
like you're going to have to try harder with that pudding.

1815
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:30,020
You think you think it's a weird phrase that sounds kind of dirty,

1816
01:31:30,020 --> 01:31:31,980
like you're never going to beat me on the inside.

1817
01:31:31,980 --> 01:31:33,620
Yeah, I forget what it is.

1818
01:31:33,620 --> 01:31:35,020
But it's the it's the dullest.

1819
01:31:35,020 --> 01:31:37,940
It's just the opposite of the Duke Nukem you're describing, where like it's

1820
01:31:38,220 --> 01:31:41,540
it's it's just playing golf and like you're not working on your pudding, are you?

1821
01:31:41,740 --> 01:31:45,460
And then at some point in the game, there's what's called a coffee break.

1822
01:31:45,780 --> 01:31:48,460
And it's just go it's just like smooth jazz playing.

1823
01:31:48,660 --> 01:31:52,340
And it just shows you the outside of the real clubhouse at Pebble Beach.

1824
01:31:52,700 --> 01:31:54,260
This might be the tamest video game.

1825
01:31:54,260 --> 01:31:58,460
This is literally Lou Carvello's putting putting challenge.

1826
01:31:58,700 --> 01:32:00,620
But yeah, it's a real life.

1827
01:32:00,620 --> 01:32:03,620
There's this maybe there's also a CD-ROM catch all because we do.

1828
01:32:04,540 --> 01:32:05,900
But how do you catch all?

1829
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:08,940
I think that's because the catch all becomes a nine hour episode.

1830
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:10,940
No, I think we got to break it up.

1831
01:32:10,940 --> 01:32:13,340
So much CD-ROM stuff out there.

1832
01:32:13,340 --> 01:32:16,660
I knew I couldn't wait many episodes to talk about Craig the Walrus.

1833
01:32:17,020 --> 01:32:18,580
It's great. Yeah.

1834
01:32:18,580 --> 01:32:21,540
Anyway, let's let's wrap this up.

1835
01:32:21,540 --> 01:32:25,260
So so they do start like turning the ship around on this thing.

1836
01:32:25,260 --> 01:32:27,980
And then those those persnickety executives come in

1837
01:32:27,980 --> 01:32:32,580
and they say, no, now this group may have come in with reduced expectations.

1838
01:32:32,820 --> 01:32:35,540
And everybody's like, oh, boo, boo.

1839
01:32:35,820 --> 01:32:39,220
And then they proceed to offer a lot of praise for the new comedic direction.

1840
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:41,860
But it's still like, God, you like looking.

1841
01:32:41,860 --> 01:32:44,380
Why don't you draw the movie like the way the movie?

1842
01:32:44,380 --> 01:32:46,620
Why don't you write the jokes, dude?

1843
01:32:46,620 --> 01:32:48,460
It's just regardless of where they got it.

1844
01:32:48,460 --> 01:32:49,780
I just are these guys.

1845
01:32:49,780 --> 01:32:54,020
There's early on in the movie where I thought this was their direction.

1846
01:32:54,060 --> 01:32:58,460
They were going, someone says, like, yes, maybe it's Sting.

1847
01:32:58,460 --> 01:33:01,820
Yes. Well, fucking say that in the first place.

1848
01:33:01,860 --> 01:33:04,020
Like, oh, yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1849
01:33:04,020 --> 01:33:06,740
Yeah. Well, I'd say I'll say that to begin with. Yeah.

1850
01:33:09,380 --> 01:33:11,740
He's just not built for this process, seemingly.

1851
01:33:11,740 --> 01:33:12,740
Another weird thing.

1852
01:33:12,740 --> 01:33:17,340
I started texting Kevin because a very in our aesthetic wheelhouse thing.

1853
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:19,820
Sting had done a soundtrack before.

1854
01:33:19,820 --> 01:33:22,060
You can find this on Spotify. Never heard of this in my life.

1855
01:33:22,220 --> 01:33:27,700
He did a full soundtrack to an IMAX movie in 1994 called The Living Sea.

1856
01:33:28,180 --> 01:33:31,580
Confusingly, much like The Pavilion, but unrelated.

1857
01:33:31,780 --> 01:33:35,260
It's just like a movie with a lot of nice footage of like the tide rising

1858
01:33:35,260 --> 01:33:40,420
and falling in the Bay of Fundy and and then Meryl Streep narrates it.

1859
01:33:40,420 --> 01:33:41,420
And it's very pleasant.

1860
01:33:41,420 --> 01:33:44,780
But it's a full album of like kind of new agey,

1861
01:33:44,980 --> 01:33:48,780
maybe sometimes veering on Donkey Kong aquatic ambience.

1862
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:50,980
I mean, it's lame as hell.

1863
01:33:50,980 --> 01:33:52,460
No one don't it.

1864
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:54,580
I let me not as good as the Donkey Kong.

1865
01:33:54,820 --> 01:33:56,020
No, no, no, not even close.

1866
01:33:56,020 --> 01:34:00,020
I'm just saying it's like a it's very it's Sting doing mostly instrumental music.

1867
01:34:00,020 --> 01:34:04,180
That's very much like DCA 1.0, like noodle mixed with like

1868
01:34:04,420 --> 01:34:07,260
it's the kind of like like weird,

1869
01:34:07,740 --> 01:34:09,860
cheesy sense that you might hear on a video game.

1870
01:34:09,860 --> 01:34:12,660
You know what that that reminds me I'm cutting off.

1871
01:34:12,660 --> 01:34:14,100
Do you know? No, no, no, no.

1872
01:34:14,100 --> 01:34:15,620
No, check out The Living Sea.

1873
01:34:15,620 --> 01:34:19,460
Sting keeps making these like little remarks about water slides,

1874
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:21,660
like insulting theme parks.

1875
01:34:21,660 --> 01:34:22,780
He does, because yes.

1876
01:34:22,780 --> 01:34:24,700
Well, because the context is that

1877
01:34:26,540 --> 01:34:29,860
Cusco is David Spade's trying to build.

1878
01:34:29,860 --> 01:34:31,340
Yes, it's in the movie guest house.

1879
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:32,140
Yeah, that all stay.

1880
01:34:32,140 --> 01:34:34,940
He's trying to build like a like a summer home

1881
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:39,420
and kick John Goodman's family out to build a nice house

1882
01:34:39,420 --> 01:34:40,940
with water slides and stuff.

1883
01:34:40,940 --> 01:34:43,540
And he is digging at them about.

1884
01:34:43,540 --> 01:34:47,580
Yeah, that the message because the original ending was

1885
01:34:47,740 --> 01:34:50,540
he just built his house with a big, crazy water slide

1886
01:34:50,540 --> 01:34:52,940
next door to John Goodman.

1887
01:34:52,940 --> 01:34:55,660
And then he wrote a strongly worded letter saying, yes.

1888
01:34:56,300 --> 01:34:58,300
Why is the ending still about water slides?

1889
01:34:58,300 --> 01:35:01,340
All right. He should learn to live without water slides.

1890
01:35:01,340 --> 01:35:04,380
And I don't know how to this is Sting's letter and everything

1891
01:35:04,380 --> 01:35:06,940
he says about culture and grinding it up like hamburgers.

1892
01:35:06,940 --> 01:35:09,420
I don't know where this leaves us because everything he says

1893
01:35:09,420 --> 01:35:13,900
I agree with, but I'm like, we do a podcast about theme parks,

1894
01:35:13,900 --> 01:35:15,420
water slides and hamburgers.

1895
01:35:15,420 --> 01:35:16,780
Well, that's what I was getting at.

1896
01:35:17,580 --> 01:35:19,500
And we don't like Sting's music very much.

1897
01:35:20,380 --> 01:35:21,740
So I don't know what to think.

1898
01:35:23,100 --> 01:35:25,740
Because he keeps he has more to life than water slides.

1899
01:35:25,740 --> 01:35:27,340
And I'm like, water slides are cool, man.

1900
01:35:28,380 --> 01:35:28,940
Yeah, I know.

1901
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:31,660
There's a way to have you have your cake in it, too.

1902
01:35:31,660 --> 01:35:34,460
There could be water slides in places that respect the sea.

1903
01:35:35,340 --> 01:35:39,340
They also show Sting a portion of the completed

1904
01:35:39,340 --> 01:35:40,620
Emperor's New Groove.

1905
01:35:40,620 --> 01:35:42,860
And he's laughing and laughing.

1906
01:35:42,860 --> 01:35:43,420
He is.

1907
01:35:43,740 --> 01:35:47,340
And I'm like, OK, it was fun movie.

1908
01:35:47,340 --> 01:35:51,820
But I don't know if you might have just not seen a cartoon

1909
01:35:51,820 --> 01:35:54,940
in a while if you're not watching a lot of cartoons.

1910
01:35:54,940 --> 01:35:59,020
Yeah, from the Himalayas to Tuscany, you know, he's reading

1911
01:35:59,020 --> 01:36:00,220
ancient scrolls.

1912
01:36:00,220 --> 01:36:01,820
That's exactly what I was about to say.

1913
01:36:01,820 --> 01:36:04,140
I was about to say he's reading scrolls.

1914
01:36:04,140 --> 01:36:06,540
That is mostly how he gets his stories these days.

1915
01:36:07,740 --> 01:36:10,940
Yes, yeah, you know, he's like he's translating

1916
01:36:11,340 --> 01:36:15,740
copies of the Latin Bible that that are like like only only

1917
01:36:16,700 --> 01:36:20,700
three only three czars have read this before.

1918
01:36:21,740 --> 01:36:23,180
I took it out of their tombs.

1919
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:26,620
I went and exhumed these these Bibles that haven't been unearthed

1920
01:36:26,620 --> 01:36:27,900
in fifteen hundred years.

1921
01:36:29,660 --> 01:36:31,340
Has he ever seen an episode of The Simpsons?

1922
01:36:31,340 --> 01:36:32,300
That's a good question.

1923
01:36:33,260 --> 01:36:34,140
That's how they got him.

1924
01:36:34,140 --> 01:36:34,940
Right.

1925
01:36:34,940 --> 01:36:35,820
And what is this now?

1926
01:36:35,820 --> 01:36:37,420
It's a culturally enriching piece.

1927
01:36:38,380 --> 01:36:39,420
But hey, he hosts.

1928
01:36:39,420 --> 01:36:41,900
Look, he was in the first Richmeister sketch.

1929
01:36:41,900 --> 01:36:42,860
So that's true.

1930
01:36:42,860 --> 01:36:43,900
And he's funny in that.

1931
01:36:45,020 --> 01:36:46,380
Stingling a ding dong.

1932
01:36:46,380 --> 01:36:46,940
Yeah.

1933
01:36:46,940 --> 01:36:48,140
Yeah, I like him.

1934
01:36:49,180 --> 01:36:52,460
Bono does that Mr. Burns impression in the and when he's

1935
01:36:52,460 --> 01:36:54,300
making Spider-Man turn off the dark.

1936
01:36:54,300 --> 01:36:54,860
He does.

1937
01:36:54,860 --> 01:36:55,180
Yeah.

1938
01:36:55,180 --> 01:36:57,420
There's a part where he goes like excellent or something.

1939
01:36:57,420 --> 01:36:59,100
He does like Mr. Burns voice.

1940
01:36:59,820 --> 01:37:00,220
Wow.

1941
01:37:00,220 --> 01:37:04,460
I was like, he does Simpsons impressions just like Ted Cruz.

1942
01:37:04,460 --> 01:37:05,740
Yeah, that's a very good point.

1943
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:07,580
Bono seems so chill, you know?

1944
01:37:07,580 --> 01:37:09,260
He seems like such a cool guy now.

1945
01:37:09,260 --> 01:37:09,740
Yeah.

1946
01:37:09,740 --> 01:37:10,060
Yeah.

1947
01:37:10,060 --> 01:37:12,220
Sting's cool, but he's like in his own little world.

1948
01:37:12,860 --> 01:37:13,900
Bono is one of us.

1949
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:15,020
Literally, he's in his own.

1950
01:37:15,020 --> 01:37:17,340
I'm going to my little world that was built for me.

1951
01:37:18,220 --> 01:37:19,820
The scientists built me a planet.

1952
01:37:20,700 --> 01:37:23,180
I've asked for it to stay off of the solar system map

1953
01:37:23,180 --> 01:37:26,060
so that it's not taught in schools and people can't find me.

1954
01:37:26,060 --> 01:37:27,420
But it's just past Neptune.

1955
01:37:28,060 --> 01:37:30,220
If I wish hard enough, I can teleport there.

1956
01:37:32,540 --> 01:37:34,380
I just want it badly enough.

1957
01:37:34,380 --> 01:37:35,260
And I do.

1958
01:37:35,260 --> 01:37:36,780
Days are much longer.

1959
01:37:36,780 --> 01:37:39,740
That Tantra session seemed never ending.

1960
01:37:39,740 --> 01:37:44,940
The gateway is I can only get there if I have sex for 18 hours without ejaculating.

1961
01:37:45,660 --> 01:37:50,540
I have to edge for that long in order to transport across the Milky Way.

1962
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:54,220
There's another song.

1963
01:37:54,220 --> 01:37:55,980
We can't end it without talking about the other song.

1964
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:57,900
This is like, OK, so now it's a comic.

1965
01:37:57,900 --> 01:37:59,100
So throw out all the songs.

1966
01:37:59,100 --> 01:37:59,820
Start again.

1967
01:37:59,820 --> 01:38:01,500
And then he's kind of going on.

1968
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:05,820
It really reminded me, actually, of what happens before Bono and the Edge,

1969
01:38:06,460 --> 01:38:08,860
before the Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark Letterman performance,

1970
01:38:08,860 --> 01:38:10,540
where they're going on about Tin Pan Valley.

1971
01:38:10,540 --> 01:38:11,340
Oh, right, right, right.

1972
01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:16,060
Just a long set up to get to where, and it's a lot like that, where Sting's like,

1973
01:38:16,060 --> 01:38:18,140
and I started thinking about the great movie musicals.

1974
01:38:18,140 --> 01:38:21,020
And I thought about Rex Harrison and My Fair Lady.

1975
01:38:21,020 --> 01:38:25,660
And that's how I thought about the song, Why Can't a Man Be More Like a Rock?

1976
01:38:25,740 --> 01:38:31,100
And then you and then you pause and you get a big, like, bad Yamaha intro, like,

1977
01:38:34,380 --> 01:38:35,980
Why can't a man be more like a rock?

1978
01:38:37,820 --> 01:38:38,380
He just sits.

1979
01:38:38,380 --> 01:38:39,500
He just doesn't move around.

1980
01:38:39,500 --> 01:38:40,220
He doesn't talk.

1981
01:38:41,180 --> 01:38:44,060
This song seems I don't I don't think maybe he just wasn't a fit.

1982
01:38:44,780 --> 01:38:46,780
These songs are brutal.

1983
01:38:46,780 --> 01:38:50,540
When he mentions that movie, I think Jane and I were both like,

1984
01:38:50,540 --> 01:38:51,820
where is this going?

1985
01:38:51,820 --> 01:38:52,940
Where is he going?

1986
01:38:52,940 --> 01:38:54,060
What song could he possibly?

1987
01:38:54,140 --> 01:38:57,340
He's going for the actual song, but he makes about a rock instead.

1988
01:38:58,620 --> 01:39:03,980
Yeah, I went at the very end of the movie when he plays the song of his dad.

1989
01:39:07,020 --> 01:39:08,620
It's over the credits.

1990
01:39:08,620 --> 01:39:09,340
Yeah, right.

1991
01:39:09,340 --> 01:39:10,220
That's where it ended up.

1992
01:39:10,220 --> 01:39:14,380
That was their single, and it was nominated for an Academy Award.

1993
01:39:14,380 --> 01:39:19,100
When like I think Jane went like, that's what they got.

1994
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:22,060
Like she was like, this is not great.

1995
01:39:22,060 --> 01:39:23,500
No, because even that.

1996
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:27,740
Yeah, it's I mean, look, yes, he does end up he's performing on the Oscars.

1997
01:39:27,740 --> 01:39:29,500
He's nominated for what that was.

1998
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:31,580
That song was nominated for everything.

1999
01:39:31,580 --> 01:39:34,700
It could have been nominated for and lost everything as well.

2000
01:39:34,700 --> 01:39:37,100
Lost the Oscar to Bob Dylan song.

2001
01:39:37,100 --> 01:39:39,500
Things have changed from Wonder Boys.

2002
01:39:41,420 --> 01:39:45,340
So he did get his song, but that song is not a hit by any means,

2003
01:39:45,340 --> 01:39:48,860
despite that they tried to do like kind of an adult contemporary.

2004
01:39:48,860 --> 01:39:51,820
They were like aiming for the pop charts because I saw on the credits.

2005
01:39:51,820 --> 01:39:54,780
Oh, it's by it's produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis.

2006
01:39:54,780 --> 01:39:55,180
Oh, yeah.

2007
01:39:55,180 --> 01:40:00,620
It's by like the maestros of all of Janet Jackson's best music

2008
01:40:00,620 --> 01:40:02,220
and they're members of the time.

2009
01:40:02,220 --> 01:40:03,740
They're fucking awesome.

2010
01:40:03,740 --> 01:40:05,340
They weren't on this.

2011
01:40:05,340 --> 01:40:08,460
They do that kind of they do that production where it's just like all it is is like

2012
01:40:10,300 --> 01:40:13,660
that's how you make it for R&B radio is a little bit of shaker.

2013
01:40:13,660 --> 01:40:14,620
It's so boring.

2014
01:40:16,460 --> 01:40:18,700
And it doesn't really feel like the movie.

2015
01:40:18,700 --> 01:40:21,660
Now, he did do the song Perfect Day.

2016
01:40:21,660 --> 01:40:23,500
That's a that's a part I like to where they love.

2017
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:27,100
They go in level with them and they're like there are we are sorry, Sting.

2018
01:40:27,100 --> 01:40:30,300
There is there are two spots for your songs now.

2019
01:40:31,420 --> 01:40:33,100
Maybe the credits, maybe.

2020
01:40:33,100 --> 01:40:35,260
And then we've had they've had an idea if it's kind of two songs.

2021
01:40:35,260 --> 01:40:37,660
It's the song you hear at the beginning and so you're at the end.

2022
01:40:37,660 --> 01:40:40,620
It's just working title Perfect Day cut to the song.

2023
01:40:40,620 --> 01:40:41,820
Well, it's a perfect day.

2024
01:40:41,820 --> 01:40:45,340
And like Sting would probably at that point, just like that's that's to quote Simpsons,

2025
01:40:45,340 --> 01:40:48,220
like, you know, something like poochy, but more proactive.

2026
01:40:48,460 --> 01:40:50,220
The guy is so poochy.

2027
01:40:50,220 --> 01:40:52,620
Then I like it.

2028
01:40:52,620 --> 01:40:56,140
I think Sting Sting by then is like Perfect Day, whatever you want.

2029
01:40:57,420 --> 01:40:59,980
They ask him to sing it, too.

2030
01:40:59,980 --> 01:41:01,180
They're like, well, you want to sing the song?

2031
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:03,340
And he says, I don't think I'm right.

2032
01:41:03,340 --> 01:41:05,260
I think you want somebody younger and hipper than me.

2033
01:41:05,260 --> 01:41:08,780
Then they go with Tom Jones, significantly older.

2034
01:41:08,780 --> 01:41:09,820
And that's good.

2035
01:41:09,820 --> 01:41:11,420
That is good.

2036
01:41:11,420 --> 01:41:11,980
He's good.

2037
01:41:11,980 --> 01:41:15,740
That's a very in a movie that's been full of like misery and depressed people staring

2038
01:41:15,740 --> 01:41:18,700
at waterfalls, pondering the rest of their creative life.

2039
01:41:18,700 --> 01:41:22,620
Then you go to Vegas, like the perfect world and creation.

2040
01:41:24,140 --> 01:41:26,060
You see Vegas at that time.

2041
01:41:26,060 --> 01:41:28,860
Yeah, because Tom Jones is playing at the MGM Grand,

2042
01:41:28,860 --> 01:41:31,580
which is currently hosting FX, possibly with Tommy Tune.

2043
01:41:32,380 --> 01:41:32,940
All right.

2044
01:41:32,940 --> 01:41:36,380
I think I don't know who is in FX by then, but it could have been Tune,

2045
01:41:36,380 --> 01:41:37,260
could have been Cassidy.

2046
01:41:37,260 --> 01:41:41,820
Some great mini DV tape footage of Vegas.

2047
01:41:41,820 --> 01:41:42,300
Yeah.

2048
01:41:42,300 --> 01:41:43,740
Yeah, you see it all.

2049
01:41:43,740 --> 01:41:49,020
You see the Luxor before it looked like absolute shit is a prime 90s Vegas.

2050
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:50,140
That's an exciting part.

2051
01:41:50,140 --> 01:41:52,460
Kuzka, what's his name?

2052
01:41:52,460 --> 01:41:53,260
That's all great.

2053
01:41:53,260 --> 01:41:53,980
That's a blast.

2054
01:41:53,980 --> 01:41:58,780
And what you do get fun in this, you get like, because what I gather from the Vulture

2055
01:41:58,780 --> 01:42:03,820
thing and for Dave Reynolds, like they were having fun and what this all ended up at.

2056
01:42:03,820 --> 01:42:07,180
Sure, there was the pressing timeline of this has to come out in a year because of Happy Meals,

2057
01:42:07,180 --> 01:42:11,660
but also it created a fuck it kind of atmosphere where they're like, I don't know.

2058
01:42:11,660 --> 01:42:16,460
What if cronks into spinach puffs?

2059
01:42:16,460 --> 01:42:17,420
Great, in.

2060
01:42:17,420 --> 01:42:19,180
What if he does jump rope with kids?

2061
01:42:19,180 --> 01:42:19,980
Great, in.

2062
01:42:19,980 --> 01:42:23,340
Everything suddenly was like, yeah, we have no time to question that.

2063
01:42:23,340 --> 01:42:28,300
It got reduced to a not over thought movie due to the crazy timeline.

2064
01:42:28,300 --> 01:42:31,020
And you get some of that fun in the movie a little bit.

2065
01:42:31,580 --> 01:42:33,500
I think there hits a point where it's working.

2066
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:34,220
Everybody likes it.

2067
01:42:34,220 --> 01:42:35,340
Executives having fun.

2068
01:42:35,340 --> 01:42:36,780
We're looking at the Happy Meal toys.

2069
01:42:36,780 --> 01:42:38,460
Everybody's happy except for Sting.

2070
01:42:38,460 --> 01:42:39,260
Except for Sting.

2071
01:42:39,260 --> 01:42:45,020
Sting is just, and there's more great where he's just like, the amount of time I'd allotted

2072
01:42:45,020 --> 01:42:45,820
for this is gone.

2073
01:42:46,460 --> 01:42:50,300
I'm not a quitter, but it's not an ideal situation for me to be in.

2074
01:42:50,300 --> 01:42:54,860
And you do get the context when it loops back around to the fliers and like, oh,

2075
01:42:55,660 --> 01:42:57,260
because he's working on a brand new day.

2076
01:42:57,260 --> 01:43:00,540
He knows he has desert rose up his sleeve.

2077
01:43:01,740 --> 01:43:07,180
He's got Chib Mommy in the tank ready to change the world.

2078
01:43:07,180 --> 01:43:09,420
Didn't those all like win tons of Grammys?

2079
01:43:09,420 --> 01:43:13,180
I'm sure those are made to demolish at the Grammys.

2080
01:43:13,180 --> 01:43:13,740
Yeah, yeah.

2081
01:43:14,540 --> 01:43:14,620
Yeah.

2082
01:43:14,620 --> 01:43:17,740
So he was right on some level, but also it's.

2083
01:43:17,740 --> 01:43:23,740
Yeah, that stuff was those were.

2084
01:43:23,740 --> 01:43:23,980
Yeah.

2085
01:43:25,100 --> 01:43:25,420
Yeah.

2086
01:43:25,420 --> 01:43:27,900
How many maybe I'll go back and listen to.

2087
01:43:27,900 --> 01:43:29,420
I'll try to be a brand new day guy.

2088
01:43:30,140 --> 01:43:33,500
I have to admit I came around on if I ever lose my faith in you.

2089
01:43:33,500 --> 01:43:37,020
It took me a lot of Kevin New Age type CD

2090
01:43:37,020 --> 01:43:40,460
rom type music for me to realize, oh, it's kind of like all that.

2091
01:43:41,020 --> 01:43:42,380
I admit it's not.

2092
01:43:42,380 --> 01:43:43,020
It's lame.

2093
01:43:43,020 --> 01:43:46,060
It's very, very lame in its production, which is why I.

2094
01:43:46,060 --> 01:43:50,220
He won best pop vocal album and best male performed.

2095
01:43:50,220 --> 01:43:50,780
Presumably.

2096
01:43:51,580 --> 01:43:52,620
Here, I'll try to look it up.

2097
01:43:52,620 --> 01:43:55,580
Talk amongst yourselves, but I bet this beat.

2098
01:43:56,300 --> 01:43:58,060
This must have beat like in sync.

2099
01:43:58,060 --> 01:43:59,980
No strings attached, right?

2100
01:43:59,980 --> 01:44:00,620
Oh, yeah.

2101
01:44:00,620 --> 01:44:00,860
Yeah.

2102
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:01,580
I guess.

2103
01:44:01,580 --> 01:44:02,060
Yeah.

2104
01:44:02,060 --> 01:44:02,620
Yeah.

2105
01:44:02,620 --> 01:44:03,020
What did it?

2106
01:44:03,020 --> 01:44:03,340
Oh, yeah.

2107
01:44:03,340 --> 01:44:06,700
It beat it beat Backstreet Boys, Millennium and Ricky Martin.

2108
01:44:06,700 --> 01:44:10,380
Brand new day beat Livin' La Vida Loca.

2109
01:44:10,380 --> 01:44:13,260
And the next the next year, no strings attached.

2110
01:44:13,260 --> 01:44:15,340
And oops, I did it again in the same category.

2111
01:44:15,340 --> 01:44:17,420
Beaten by Steely Dan.

2112
01:44:17,420 --> 01:44:19,260
Oh, I remember that.

2113
01:44:19,260 --> 01:44:20,140
I remember that.

2114
01:44:20,140 --> 01:44:21,260
That's insane.

2115
01:44:21,260 --> 01:44:24,780
I love I live and breathe Steely Dan, but I'm still like bye bye.

2116
01:44:24,780 --> 01:44:27,420
Bye was beaten by.

2117
01:44:29,420 --> 01:44:31,260
What is the song nature?

2118
01:44:31,260 --> 01:44:34,940
Oh, you know, Cousin Dupree and Jack of Speed.

2119
01:44:35,580 --> 01:44:37,980
Look, I'd rather listen to Jack of Speed than bye bye.

2120
01:44:37,980 --> 01:44:38,220
Sure.

2121
01:44:38,220 --> 01:44:39,660
But I'm insane.

2122
01:44:39,660 --> 01:44:39,980
Right.

2123
01:44:41,260 --> 01:44:45,980
I feel like, you know, Chaperone or Shaboosie.

2124
01:44:45,980 --> 01:44:46,860
There it is.

2125
01:44:46,860 --> 01:44:50,460
When you were gone, we commented on how you bring up Chaperone in every episode.

2126
01:44:50,460 --> 01:44:52,380
Now, OK, I'm glad you're back.

2127
01:44:54,060 --> 01:44:56,860
I you know, I like that.

2128
01:44:56,860 --> 01:44:57,420
Sure.

2129
01:44:57,420 --> 01:45:01,660
What I'm getting at is the Grammys this year as we're recording are tonight.

2130
01:45:01,660 --> 01:45:08,700
And I don't think that anyone's going to be covering brand new day or desert.

2131
01:45:08,700 --> 01:45:09,340
You never know.

2132
01:45:09,340 --> 01:45:09,900
You never know.

2133
01:45:09,900 --> 01:45:12,780
Don't count the Grammys out of being the lamest thing you've ever seen.

2134
01:45:12,780 --> 01:45:16,060
Cynthia Revo might not do a wicked song.

2135
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:18,940
She might do Desert Rose.

2136
01:45:18,940 --> 01:45:19,900
Yeah, yeah, it's possible.

2137
01:45:19,900 --> 01:45:20,380
OK.

2138
01:45:20,380 --> 01:45:22,140
Well, there was another 25th anniversary.

2139
01:45:22,140 --> 01:45:22,860
You got to acknowledge it.

2140
01:45:22,860 --> 01:45:27,260
There was this big fire benefit and now all the biggest stars came out to do their hits.

2141
01:45:27,260 --> 01:45:28,860
Red at Chili Peppers, blah, blah, blah.

2142
01:45:28,860 --> 01:45:30,300
But then Gracie Abrams.

2143
01:45:30,380 --> 01:45:33,820
You just see what she did in Long December by Counting Crows.

2144
01:45:34,460 --> 01:45:35,180
Don't know.

2145
01:45:35,180 --> 01:45:38,060
You must have been patting yourself on your 90s back.

2146
01:45:38,060 --> 01:45:38,780
I was in heaven.

2147
01:45:38,780 --> 01:45:44,140
Yeah, Gracie, Gracie Abrams, a young lady, new music artist, daughter of J.J. Abrams.

2148
01:45:44,140 --> 01:45:44,300
Yeah.

2149
01:45:44,300 --> 01:45:46,300
Doing Counting Crows December.

2150
01:45:46,300 --> 01:45:46,940
Yeah, very cool.

2151
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:50,620
It's also Billy Eilish with Billy Armstrong.

2152
01:45:50,620 --> 01:45:51,020
Yes.

2153
01:45:51,020 --> 01:45:53,900
But with doing a 21st century breakdown song, I believe.

2154
01:45:53,900 --> 01:45:54,460
Wow.

2155
01:45:54,460 --> 01:45:54,700
Wow.

2156
01:45:55,820 --> 01:45:58,380
I didn't see it, but if I had to venture to guess, perfect.

2157
01:45:59,180 --> 01:45:59,500
Perfect.

2158
01:45:59,500 --> 01:46:00,300
I would agree with you.

2159
01:46:00,300 --> 01:46:01,420
A perfect day.

2160
01:46:01,420 --> 01:46:03,980
It was when this song was performed.

2161
01:46:03,980 --> 01:46:09,500
I clicked on a couple Red Hot Chili Peppers links and all of a sudden my algorithm thought

2162
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:12,540
that I was I mean, I guess I am the biggest Red Hot Chili Peppers fan, but I was going to say

2163
01:46:12,540 --> 01:46:14,700
all of a sudden it's but it said to me.

2164
01:46:14,700 --> 01:46:16,540
Stupid algorithm thought I like the chili.

2165
01:46:16,540 --> 01:46:22,140
I started I started getting like John Frusciante like like love posts like,

2166
01:46:22,140 --> 01:46:23,820
oh my God, look what John's wearing.

2167
01:46:23,820 --> 01:46:28,220
Like I got so many different posts than people comparing like his striped shirt to like Chris

2168
01:46:28,220 --> 01:46:31,980
Kurt Cobain's striped shirt from whatever the smells like teen spirit.

2169
01:46:31,980 --> 01:46:37,580
So I got in a weird like Stan culture like Red Hot Chili Peppers algorithm.

2170
01:46:37,580 --> 01:46:41,820
And I've just been getting pummeled with it for like a day or two.

2171
01:46:41,820 --> 01:46:44,300
This sounds this sounds like such a chore for you, Mike.

2172
01:46:44,300 --> 01:46:44,860
I'm sorry.

2173
01:46:44,860 --> 01:46:45,660
It wasn't happening.

2174
01:46:47,580 --> 01:46:50,460
Just like what is Anthony Kiedis' skincare routine?

2175
01:46:50,460 --> 01:46:52,700
And they're showing like his right up right up in his face.

2176
01:46:54,060 --> 01:46:56,380
I mean, look, those guys got good buds.

2177
01:46:57,340 --> 01:46:58,300
Flea was in his underwear.

2178
01:46:58,300 --> 01:46:59,660
Everybody they show it off there.

2179
01:46:59,660 --> 01:47:00,540
Everybody's in fantastic.

2180
01:47:00,540 --> 01:47:04,380
Flea was in his underwear with like a little belt, but everybody else had clothes on.

2181
01:47:04,940 --> 01:47:06,300
So there was a benefit.

2182
01:47:06,300 --> 01:47:06,860
You got to be.

2183
01:47:06,860 --> 01:47:07,340
Yeah.

2184
01:47:07,340 --> 01:47:08,940
And then fleas got a flea.

2185
01:47:08,940 --> 01:47:12,060
And he played with Stevie Wonder and Sting.

2186
01:47:13,020 --> 01:47:14,940
Sting, I think, sang higher ground.

2187
01:47:15,580 --> 01:47:16,780
Flea played bass.

2188
01:47:16,780 --> 01:47:17,660
That's so lame.

2189
01:47:18,300 --> 01:47:19,580
Stevie Wonder didn't sing.

2190
01:47:22,140 --> 01:47:25,740
Stevie, you would have preferred Anthony Kiedis singing with the

2191
01:47:25,740 --> 01:47:26,940
red hot chili peppers.

2192
01:47:26,940 --> 01:47:27,580
Maybe.

2193
01:47:27,580 --> 01:47:28,380
Yes, I would like.

2194
01:47:28,380 --> 01:47:29,100
Yeah, yeah, yes.

2195
01:47:31,420 --> 01:47:32,220
Brand new day.

2196
01:47:32,220 --> 01:47:34,060
The song is kind of a Sting.

2197
01:47:34,060 --> 01:47:35,740
Sorry, a Stevie ripoff in a way.

2198
01:47:35,740 --> 01:47:36,860
Harmonica.

2199
01:47:36,860 --> 01:47:37,900
Yeah, yes, yes.

2200
01:47:37,900 --> 01:47:38,400
Yeah.

2201
01:47:39,420 --> 01:47:42,220
Anyways, so look, it all works out.

2202
01:47:42,220 --> 01:47:44,620
Tom Jones, it works out for everybody.

2203
01:47:45,580 --> 01:47:47,420
The brief Eisner, not enough.

2204
01:47:47,420 --> 01:47:50,780
It's like getting it's like a new Star Wars giving you one Darth Vader scene.

2205
01:47:50,780 --> 01:47:52,220
You're like, oh, but come on.

2206
01:47:52,220 --> 01:47:53,740
Don't just give me an Easter egg.

2207
01:47:53,740 --> 01:47:54,860
Give me the whole.

2208
01:47:55,820 --> 01:47:57,500
But you get a lot of Roy Disney.

2209
01:47:58,140 --> 01:48:00,620
Sting writes a letter about how it shouldn't be waterslides.

2210
01:48:00,620 --> 01:48:03,020
And it has a impact on the movie.

2211
01:48:03,740 --> 01:48:05,980
They do give it a better ending.

2212
01:48:06,700 --> 01:48:12,060
So Roy Disney and Sting join arms and do a great collaboration.

2213
01:48:13,500 --> 01:48:19,260
Then you see him doing that song wearing a sleeveless black shirt and a pork pie hat.

2214
01:48:20,540 --> 01:48:21,020
Sting.

2215
01:48:21,020 --> 01:48:21,980
Oh, my God.

2216
01:48:21,980 --> 01:48:25,260
Oh, but on the way out here, just a couple of things on the way out the door.

2217
01:48:26,220 --> 01:48:27,580
They do a test screening.

2218
01:48:27,580 --> 01:48:31,180
The test screening I recognized as a man theater in Westlake Village.

2219
01:48:31,180 --> 01:48:33,980
That is but a parking lot away from it's the same

2220
01:48:34,620 --> 01:48:41,420
Rick Caruso shopping center that once was home to Club Disney, one of the only club Disney locations.

2221
01:48:41,420 --> 01:48:45,980
Episode coming soon as a guest who was interested in doing that.

2222
01:48:47,420 --> 01:48:48,940
So that was just like that.

2223
01:48:48,940 --> 01:48:50,700
That's a good little Disney block over there.

2224
01:48:51,660 --> 01:48:53,580
Then there's you do it all again.

2225
01:48:53,580 --> 01:48:57,260
It cuts to composer Mark Shimon.

2226
01:48:57,900 --> 01:48:58,540
Mark Shimon.

2227
01:48:58,540 --> 01:48:58,860
Shimon.

2228
01:48:58,860 --> 01:48:59,580
Shimon.

2229
01:48:59,580 --> 01:49:02,300
And he's doing the music.

2230
01:49:02,300 --> 01:49:03,740
And I was like, wait, I just watched the movie.

2231
01:49:03,740 --> 01:49:06,060
I didn't see his name in the credits because he gets fired.

2232
01:49:06,060 --> 01:49:07,260
They do it again.

2233
01:49:07,260 --> 01:49:08,620
Mark Shimon, a genius.

2234
01:49:09,420 --> 01:49:13,020
He's Billy Crystal's guy and Martin Short's guy and a zillion things.

2235
01:49:13,020 --> 01:49:15,420
And he gets fired by Tom Schumacher.

2236
01:49:16,300 --> 01:49:19,020
They bring in a new guy, John Debney, who I didn't know.

2237
01:49:19,820 --> 01:49:23,020
John Debney is who did the Disney Studios logo.

2238
01:49:23,020 --> 01:49:28,380
Like the one with the one that started all of these great films.

2239
01:49:28,380 --> 01:49:30,620
So credit to him because I love that little guy.

2240
01:49:30,620 --> 01:49:32,540
But yeah, it's thing heartbroken.

2241
01:49:32,540 --> 01:49:33,100
Mark Shimon.

2242
01:49:33,100 --> 01:49:34,780
Mark Shimon is such a pro at this now.

2243
01:49:34,780 --> 01:49:37,260
He just cackles at it seemingly.

2244
01:49:37,260 --> 01:49:37,820
Whatever.

2245
01:49:37,820 --> 01:49:40,220
He's just on the next job immediately.

2246
01:49:41,820 --> 01:49:43,580
You see the Happy Meal toys.

2247
01:49:43,580 --> 01:49:45,580
You get a taste of the video game.

2248
01:49:45,580 --> 01:49:46,860
I Googled the video game.

2249
01:49:46,860 --> 01:49:50,300
Immediately found the Reddit thread calling it the worst game I'll ever have.

2250
01:49:50,300 --> 01:49:51,580
The displeasure of finishing.

2251
01:49:53,900 --> 01:49:57,900
Then you see the marketing people going through what might a funny tagline be.

2252
01:49:57,900 --> 01:50:01,180
And you get this great funny guy who's like, so we're thinking, you know,

2253
01:50:01,180 --> 01:50:03,340
looks like royalty smells like llama.

2254
01:50:04,380 --> 01:50:04,860
Thank God.

2255
01:50:04,860 --> 01:50:07,660
This is why posters are terrible.

2256
01:50:07,660 --> 01:50:07,900
Yeah.

2257
01:50:07,900 --> 01:50:09,020
And that's such a 90s.

2258
01:50:09,020 --> 01:50:10,460
Like night's 90s, too.

2259
01:50:11,020 --> 01:50:12,380
Smelly stuff was 90s.

2260
01:50:13,260 --> 01:50:15,660
And they, yeah, well, like stinky cheese man kind of thing.

2261
01:50:15,660 --> 01:50:17,420
Like kids like stink and smell.

2262
01:50:17,420 --> 01:50:17,740
Yeah.

2263
01:50:17,740 --> 01:50:18,780
90s Nickelodeon.

2264
01:50:18,780 --> 01:50:19,740
All that was gross.

2265
01:50:19,740 --> 01:50:20,620
Hey, real quick.

2266
01:50:20,620 --> 01:50:26,060
Mark Shimon, another Disney connection, did that short-lived Steve Rogers musical

2267
01:50:26,060 --> 01:50:27,740
that was at California Adventure.

2268
01:50:29,740 --> 01:50:31,900
Also started in the Hawkeye show.

2269
01:50:31,900 --> 01:50:32,940
Smash.

2270
01:50:32,940 --> 01:50:37,420
My beloved TV show currently going to Broadway.

2271
01:50:37,420 --> 01:50:40,540
They're finally doing it 14 years later.

2272
01:50:40,540 --> 01:50:41,020
Is it?

2273
01:50:41,020 --> 01:50:42,140
When does it open?

2274
01:50:42,140 --> 01:50:43,820
I might already be.

2275
01:50:44,300 --> 01:50:45,740
Smash is beloved.

2276
01:50:45,740 --> 01:50:47,420
I don't think I knew you were a big smashhead.

2277
01:50:47,420 --> 01:50:52,940
I would leave Harold Knight most Mondays and go watch Smash.

2278
01:50:52,940 --> 01:50:53,980
Wow.

2279
01:50:53,980 --> 01:50:57,980
I don't want to say I particularly liked it, but I liked parts of it.

2280
01:50:57,980 --> 01:50:58,700
I see.

2281
01:50:58,700 --> 01:51:02,140
Well, this will give us plenty to talk about down the road because Smash with Cat McPhee,

2282
01:51:02,140 --> 01:51:04,380
eventual bride of David Foster.

2283
01:51:04,380 --> 01:51:04,780
Of course.

2284
01:51:04,780 --> 01:51:05,420
My hero.

2285
01:51:06,460 --> 01:51:08,380
We'll have to address all of that somehow.

2286
01:51:09,580 --> 01:51:13,100
But we're sort of getting, I don't know, any other observations about this,

2287
01:51:13,100 --> 01:51:20,300
about Sting, about Craig Stadler, or what's the name of the squirrel again?

2288
01:51:20,300 --> 01:51:20,780
Conker.

2289
01:51:20,780 --> 01:51:21,340
Conker.

2290
01:51:22,300 --> 01:51:22,940
Yeah, I have none.

2291
01:51:22,940 --> 01:51:24,780
I have Red Hulk pictures.

2292
01:51:26,220 --> 01:51:27,420
How does it look?

2293
01:51:27,420 --> 01:51:28,700
Well, it's just like, it's a plush.

2294
01:51:28,700 --> 01:51:29,660
It's really not.

2295
01:51:29,660 --> 01:51:31,180
It's like, it's a very generic face.

2296
01:51:31,180 --> 01:51:34,060
No, there's no, oh, you got no, no Harrison in there.

2297
01:51:34,060 --> 01:51:36,780
So far, the best Red Hulk is the popcorn bucket.

2298
01:51:38,700 --> 01:51:42,620
It's not as good as it could be, but you get like a real actual Harrison.

2299
01:51:42,620 --> 01:51:44,380
Maybe his facial scar is on there.

2300
01:51:45,900 --> 01:51:51,980
But yeah, somebody send me a picture of what they think the best Harrison likeness is on

2301
01:51:51,980 --> 01:51:54,460
one of these Red Hulks because I do want it.

2302
01:51:54,460 --> 01:51:55,420
I want to own it.

2303
01:51:56,300 --> 01:51:57,260
I won't be available.

2304
01:51:57,740 --> 01:51:58,780
I'll be hulking out.

2305
01:51:59,980 --> 01:52:01,580
It's an actual drug you can take.

2306
01:52:02,860 --> 01:52:07,580
You can physically hulk out, which allows you to last even longer in tantric lovemaking sessions,

2307
01:52:07,580 --> 01:52:11,180
which become very demanding for your wife because you are now giant and red.

2308
01:52:11,180 --> 01:52:12,700
They don't make it available to the public.

2309
01:52:12,700 --> 01:52:14,540
It's only to me and Elvis Costello.

2310
01:52:15,980 --> 01:52:17,740
It's a natural growing drug.

2311
01:52:17,740 --> 01:52:18,700
It's in the mountains.

2312
01:52:20,700 --> 01:52:21,580
It's like ayahuasca.

2313
01:52:21,580 --> 01:52:23,660
From the poppies of Colombia.

2314
01:52:25,820 --> 01:52:28,940
He was on that Elvis Costello short-lived show.

2315
01:52:28,940 --> 01:52:31,180
I was trying to find it because he actually was.

2316
01:52:31,180 --> 01:52:34,300
Yeah, because he performed with the police, which I thought was really good.

2317
01:52:34,300 --> 01:52:36,460
Oh, yeah, because that was around the same time with the reunion.

2318
01:52:36,460 --> 01:52:38,140
Also performed with Bono on the Edge on that, which was.

2319
01:52:38,140 --> 01:52:38,700
I love that show.

2320
01:52:39,500 --> 01:52:42,220
Springsteen episode of that Elvis Costello show.

2321
01:52:43,340 --> 01:52:48,380
Costello is obviously of a piece with all of these stuffy British Brits, but he's fun.

2322
01:52:48,380 --> 01:52:49,900
His music is very fun.

2323
01:52:49,900 --> 01:52:53,020
And he was never dumb enough to do a fucking Disney movie.

2324
01:52:53,020 --> 01:52:53,900
That would have been a catastrophe.

2325
01:52:53,900 --> 01:52:55,500
I wonder if he was even ever approached.

2326
01:52:55,500 --> 01:52:57,340
It does feel like something he would have tried.

2327
01:52:57,340 --> 01:52:58,060
Yeah, maybe.

2328
01:52:58,060 --> 01:52:58,860
I think he would have tried.

2329
01:52:59,580 --> 01:53:01,260
He's done a bunch of different stuff.

2330
01:53:01,260 --> 01:53:04,140
I feel like, am I crazy?

2331
01:53:04,140 --> 01:53:08,620
But was there a certain strain of music writing when he was first starting out,

2332
01:53:08,620 --> 01:53:13,020
where he was kind of like, and this guy, he's a little out there.

2333
01:53:13,020 --> 01:53:14,460
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes.

2334
01:53:15,340 --> 01:53:16,700
So that was in my mind.

2335
01:53:16,700 --> 01:53:18,620
You know, rebellious, anti-authority.

2336
01:53:18,620 --> 01:53:21,020
He was kind of the green day of his time.

2337
01:53:22,700 --> 01:53:24,860
Elvis Costello did a musical last year.

2338
01:53:24,860 --> 01:53:25,580
Oh.

2339
01:53:25,580 --> 01:53:26,540
Face in the Crowd.

2340
01:53:27,660 --> 01:53:30,300
Based on the short story and 1957 film of the same name.

2341
01:53:30,300 --> 01:53:30,860
Really?

2342
01:53:30,860 --> 01:53:31,500
Oh, the...

2343
01:53:33,820 --> 01:53:35,900
Who is the star of that movie?

2344
01:53:38,300 --> 01:53:39,340
That's the Andy Griffith.

2345
01:53:39,340 --> 01:53:39,820
That's the...

2346
01:53:39,820 --> 01:53:41,260
Yeah, it's the Andy Griffith.

2347
01:53:42,540 --> 01:53:44,140
Trump kind of.

2348
01:53:44,140 --> 01:53:48,380
Only it's a version of it where the guy gets his comeuppance in any way, shape or form.

2349
01:53:48,380 --> 01:53:49,020
That's a good question.

2350
01:53:49,580 --> 01:53:49,900
I don't know.

2351
01:53:49,900 --> 01:53:50,860
Is this still happening?

2352
01:53:50,860 --> 01:53:51,340
Maybe.

2353
01:53:51,340 --> 01:53:54,940
It's the story of what would have happened to Trump if anything had happened after the first.

2354
01:53:56,860 --> 01:53:57,580
Wow, good news.

2355
01:53:57,580 --> 01:53:58,860
Larry Rhodes is back.

2356
01:54:01,180 --> 01:54:01,980
He learned nothing.

2357
01:54:01,980 --> 01:54:02,940
He's worse than ever.

2358
01:54:03,580 --> 01:54:04,700
Face in the Crowd 2.

2359
01:54:05,740 --> 01:54:07,260
Well, anyways, I think that does it.

2360
01:54:07,260 --> 01:54:08,860
I think you survived podcast The Ride.

2361
01:54:08,860 --> 01:54:10,300
Thanks for subscribing to Club 3.

2362
01:54:10,300 --> 01:54:12,060
Your bravery saved the podcast.

2363
01:54:12,060 --> 01:54:13,260
Well done, Freedom Fighters.

2364
01:54:13,260 --> 01:54:15,900
A lot of good morsels there and things we can throw out next time.

2365
01:54:16,460 --> 01:54:19,980
But especially, I thank Bobby Libby for the great suggestion.

2366
01:54:19,980 --> 01:54:20,780
Wait a minute.

2367
01:54:20,780 --> 01:54:25,100
I found another comment that Bobby made elsewhere on our Patreon.

2368
01:54:25,100 --> 01:54:26,860
I think on the poll post.

2369
01:54:26,860 --> 01:54:28,220
Whoa, Bobby Libby.

2370
01:54:28,220 --> 01:54:34,460
Let the record show that I, the person who nominated the Sweatbox, ultimately voted for

2371
01:54:34,460 --> 01:54:36,620
Bug Buzz Buzz Pudding Sauce.

2372
01:54:36,620 --> 01:54:37,660
Oh, no.

2373
01:54:37,660 --> 01:54:38,460
Discourse.

2374
01:54:38,460 --> 01:54:39,020
No, no.

2375
01:54:39,020 --> 01:54:40,460
Turn the recording off.
