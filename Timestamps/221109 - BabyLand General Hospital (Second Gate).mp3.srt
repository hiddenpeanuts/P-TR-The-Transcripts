1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,640
Welcome to what I would venture to guess

3
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,640
will be a rather icky podcast ride, the second gate.

4
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,880
Scott Garen or Mike Carlson seems to agree.

5
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:32,720
Yeah, I am here.

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,400
I'm here and I am feeling icky.

7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,800
It's a really, it just shivers.

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,440
You gotta shiver.

9
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,440
We'll introduce the third guy.

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,080
And then I think there's something though I have for you,

11
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,000
both of you that'll make this better.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,280
This whole situation better.

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,120
Yeah, yeah.

14
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,440
So it'll make the little spoonful of sugar

15
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,280
make the medicine go down.

16
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,120
Funny you say that actually.

17
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:50,960
Ooh, interesting.

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,800
Go ahead.

19
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,080
I was driving over and I was trying to find the right word

20
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,280
and Scott, you hit the nail on the head.

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,960
Yeah, it's not disgusting.

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,080
It's not perverse.

23
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:07,080
It's just this today's topic, baby land general hospital,

24
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,080
which not to, you know, I won't dive in

25
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,600
if you have some stuff, but real quick.

26
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,440
Yeah.

27
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,280
Yes.

28
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,480
Yeah, just the cliff notes is it's the,

29
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,080
well, it's really the like the hub,

30
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,600
the epicenter of the cabbage patch doll,

31
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,760
the cabbage patch kids universe.

32
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,520
It's like the tourist attraction of cabbage patch kids,

33
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,280
but mainly to understand the ickiness

34
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,680
we're referring to it as a place where you can see

35
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,440
cabbage patch kids get born.

36
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,280
Yeah.

37
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,120
And it is.

38
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,960
It is the main show.

39
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,040
It is as good as you imagine, I think,

40
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,200
as far as just the terminology they use

41
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,920
and the visuals and everything else.

42
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,680
Real quick though, I'd like to, let's get the,

43
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,400
again, like that's, speaking of sugar,

44
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,320
let's get the holiday season started off right here,

45
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,800
even though I guess, you know, it's holiday November.

46
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,480
We're almost at Thanksgiving.

47
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,960
But we should because I have got you guys both

48
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,040
Oh.

49
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,760
Boxes of Pandora flakes.

50
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,600
Yeah.

51
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,800
Wow.

52
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,360
Geez, you found it.

53
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,200
I found Pandora flakes at Target in Burbank over here.

54
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,520
I have, of course have a box as well.

55
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,680
And this, if you haven't heard us talking about this,

56
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,040
Tony the Tiger is, it's frosted flakes

57
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,880
with basically blueberry Captain Crunch pieces inside,

58
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,080
like the Crunch berries.

59
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,360
Sweeties are, no, they, well, they wouldn't be marbets.

60
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,640
Not marbets, they are sweeties, I suppose.

61
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,520
And then they're flakes and sweeties.

62
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,360
Okay.

63
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,180
Is what the deal is.

64
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,020
And Tony has.

65
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,040
Oh, it kind of illustrates the difference

66
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,240
between flakes and sweeties, yes.

67
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,560
Though the flakes are sweet, they are sugary sweet.

68
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,400
They're frosted, but.

69
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,320
Frosted flakes, excuse me.

70
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,160
Wow.

71
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:54,160
Captain, frosted flakes with blue Crunch berries in it.

72
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,880
I mean, that's like a game changer for me.

73
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,720
Is it?

74
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,920
Well, I remember when Crunch berries were.

75
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,960
The game has been changed.

76
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,760
When Crunch berries were just red

77
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,400
and then they're like, guess what?

78
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,160
They're also blue and purple now.

79
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,160
I was like, let's fucking go.

80
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,800
Yeah, no, I mean, that's good.

81
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,680
I certainly, I'd like that low energy, let's fucking go.

82
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,520
Let's go.

83
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,320
Jason invented the phrase as an eight year old.

84
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,680
Low energy, eight year old.

85
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,800
Let's fucking go.

86
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,640
My parents were like,

87
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,840
can you not use that word, you are eight years old.

88
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,680
And you're like.

89
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,120
So you were grounded for a year.

90
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,960
But you had the cereal, so it was worth it.

91
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,840
Some details now that I'm seeing this up close.

92
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,920
The box is crawling with Ekrons.

93
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,760
Oh yeah.

94
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,580
Lots of those.

95
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,020
I think I'm gonna say, we're gonna learn all about this

96
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,640
in Feliz Navidad, The Way of Winter,

97
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,800
but pronunciation, we may have been saying it wrong.

98
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,600
I feel like having just seen the movie again.

99
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,600
Might be Ekron.

100
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,840
You might have a strong start.

101
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,940
Yeah, Ekron.

102
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,820
So there's, yeah, tons of those.

103
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,520
Nice to see him.

104
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,320
It's a real just resolute, determined Tony.

105
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,620
Yeah, he's stoic, heroic,

106
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,640
whatever you would use to describe him.

107
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,040
More going on subtly.

108
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,760
It's the face we know, but the eyebrow pose.

109
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,440
He's just, he's ready for war.

110
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,960
Brow is furrowed, ready for adventure.

111
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,640
He's not again been avatard.

112
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,320
He's seemingly on Pandora with a new,

113
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,320
like multi-colored bandana,

114
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,280
and he's up for some sort of adventure.

115
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,080
Yeah, well, which you gotta be concerned

116
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,620
because one of the main reasons that Earth beings,

117
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,920
I can't say humans, because he's a tiger,

118
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,560
people from, not even people, I'm sorry, I was right.

119
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,560
Earth beings go to Pandora to pilfer and mine and pillage,

120
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,360
and I hope he's there to help them.

121
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,160
I hope he's not a Parker Selfridge.

122
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,760
Miles Quaritch, you dropped the ball.

123
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,320
You dropped the ball.

124
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,580
The company sent me to take over.

125
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,480
He's worse?

126
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,320
Yeah, he's worse.

127
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,200
I mean, he's a tiger, so yeah, he might like,

128
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,280
he's got some higher ferocity

129
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,240
than just like some mean army guy.

130
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,560
I'm going to export flakes from Pandora.

131
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,620
The Pandora is full of flakes,

132
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:17,060
and I will rob them of all their natural resources.

133
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,780
Their flakes are 3% sweeter.

134
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,060
This is a little goofy.

135
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,380
Yeah, I don't have a Tony, so.

136
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,220
Well, I should be able to do it

137
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,660
because I do the other Thorough Ravens grift.

138
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,480
The Bro-y, yeah.

139
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,660
Yeah, yeah.

140
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,260
Mike, I just want to say.

141
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,100
Bellowy, I meant.

142
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,140
That's right.

143
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,020
Great group, mine.

144
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,260
Before you even revealed these,

145
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:40,260
I had pulled up the fandom page on the Avatar Wiki

146
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,700
because I couldn't pull the term tree of souls.

147
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,740
I was going to say Babyland General Hospital.

148
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,740
Sort of like the tree of souls for the Cabbage Patch world.

149
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,580
Well, there's a tree in this.

150
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,420
Oh, that's true.

151
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,260
There's a tree involved here.

152
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,260
Yeah, there's a nasty ass tree in this.

153
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:57,500
I think, we'll talk more about Pandora Flakes

154
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,660
as we get closer to December, I think,

155
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,140
because you will have to have a full review.

156
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,660
We'll all review it, obviously.

157
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,580
Yeah, so let's stay away just from personal experience.

158
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,900
Let's stay away from the calling it snack or whack

159
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,740
or anything related to.

160
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,700
Okay, that's fair.

161
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,980
I've been through the wringer lately.

162
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,100
I bet, legally, yeah.

163
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,620
Let's leave podcast segment division lines up.

164
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,340
Okay, very excited to have these.

165
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,500
This has given me the spirit of Civico.

166
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,060
Well, just one more thing.

167
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,020
Just this bandana that's covered with the design of,

168
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,200
that's another Avatar specific that we will learn,

169
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,200
but those kind of like billowy, the little insect

170
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,320
insect that are sort of like flying jellyfish

171
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,960
that are so slight and petite.

172
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,800
There's just like. You see them in that quiet moment.

173
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,840
Basically, yeah, yeah.

174
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,680
Quiet moment on the ride.

175
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,760
I love those guys.

176
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,600
Yeah.

177
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,560
Thought about buying a Christmas ornament of those

178
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,560
and it was like the cheapest plastic for like $30.

179
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,400
To make what you,

180
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,640
like you just gotta make it out of dental floss.

181
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,480
That's what you gotta do.

182
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,760
Yeah, you're right.

183
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,080
And like a scoop of jelly, you know?

184
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,440
All right, well this is among the things.

185
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,240
We will have this all down pat.

186
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,160
We will know the names of everything, all the mythology,

187
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,920
as the world might in successive way of water.

188
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:24,520
But today we go from, not to somewhere as exotic

189
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,040
as the world of Pandora, but to Cleveland, Georgia.

190
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,320
That is, it's Cleveland, Georgia.

191
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,680
And we are sent there.

192
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,200
This has been on the topic list for a long time

193
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,120
as suggested by Amanda Hasaka.

194
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,040
Thanks, Amanda.

195
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,840
Sorry it took a minute to get to it,

196
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,920
but now that we have,

197
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,800
I'm like, well, this should not have taken so long

198
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,560
because this is some PTR ass shit.

199
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,440
It is very strange.

200
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,040
It is very unsettling.

201
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,480
And it's, you know, you gotta love anything

202
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:04,000
that is an excuse to dive into a pop culture mythology

203
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,520
that we have never done.

204
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,400
We just talked about monster cereals.

205
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,600
Yeah, it's somewhere between that

206
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,880
and like the specificity of it,

207
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,600
that it's a weird product that hasn't had a lot of like,

208
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,760
I mean, there are like animated specials

209
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,680
and stuff I'll get into.

210
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,760
It's somewhere between that and like in a Barney.

211
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,080
Right. Oh yeah.

212
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,200
So with that said.

213
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,320
I was gonna say there's also a guy.

214
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,160
There's a new guy here.

215
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,400
There's definitely a guy.

216
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,400
There's a new guy who kind of don't even tread around.

217
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,760
It's like, he's kind of a thief.

218
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,320
Yeah, yeah.

219
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,680
I, well, the only thing that holds me back

220
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,120
from giving him full guy credit

221
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,800
is just the lack of information about him.

222
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,120
I feel like if we knew, he seems to like stay in the shadows

223
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,560
to stop us from knowing the extent of his guyness.

224
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,800
Well, did you watch,

225
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,480
I watched a little vice piece on this that interviews

226
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,800
one Martha Nelson Thomas's husband.

227
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,000
Yes, yeah. We've watched that.

228
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,280
So they're all pretty clear on what they feel.

229
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,640
I think they would all label this gentleman a guy for sure.

230
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,480
I think he's a guy.

231
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

232
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,560
No, no, for sure he is.

233
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,120
I just like, we're missing out on,

234
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,120
because he's essentially been silent since like 1986.

235
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,920
So we don't really know how much guyness.

236
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,680
I wish there's probably a treasure trove of stories

237
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,720
if only we knew.

238
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,480
He's a smart guy.

239
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,000
Yeah. Guy in quotes,

240
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,200
because most of these guys,

241
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,080
after they do their guy stuff,

242
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,760
they keep talking and doing other guy stuff.

243
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,160
And they, yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

244
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,320
They have to reset entirely.

245
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,800
He had a court case and they settle out of court

246
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,880
and he's like quietly disappeared from the public eye

247
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,440
with his millions of dollars.

248
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,400
Shocking, shocking to just go quietly into the night.

249
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,160
Is it, well, let me suggest this,

250
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,680
not to like sub, sub define or disagree,

251
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,280
because Guy has been in my head since we started talking

252
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:03,240
but Xavier Roberts, the creator of Cabbage Patch Kids.

253
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,360
The definer maybe of it.

254
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,480
That's a good, he under, like he added some mythology to it,

255
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,520
but yes.

256
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,760
Is it possible?

257
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,600
That's true.

258
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,320
I didn't know that the Cabbage Patch Kids had enemies

259
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,920
until I sat down and listened to their album, of course.

260
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,720
Oh boy, okay, well that's a tease.

261
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,840
That's something I don't know.

262
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,680
Oh boy.

263
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,720
Not to disagree with the guyness,

264
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,000
but is it possibly a disqualifier from him being a guy

265
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,880
that he hasn't just run his mouth to his own ruin?

266
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,240
Is that, well.

267
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,080
Let me suggest this.

268
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,640
Is it possible that he was a guy

269
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,480
and then he got smart unlike most guys?

270
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,280
Well, he's, that's a good point.

271
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,920
What defines a guy?

272
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,360
Is it that a guy has to just not,

273
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,720
can they not be stopping until they're dead?

274
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,040
Do they have to continue doing guy things until they're dead?

275
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,960
Or can you be a guy once?

276
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,520
And then kind of like learn from your mistakes.

277
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,760
Right, now we don't know if he's been redeemed or anything.

278
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,000
It's just that he did a thing once

279
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,080
and then made a lot of money off of it.

280
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,400
Yeah.

281
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,880
But yeah, he's not as well documented as the other guys

282
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,280
who are constantly need attention.

283
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,600
I think probably for the best.

284
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,920
Maybe we should talk a little about

285
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,600
broader Cabbage Patch Kids stuff

286
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,640
and then we can land in this tourist hub,

287
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,400
Cabbage Patch Kids Central.

288
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,680
Probably if you're familiar with Cabbage Patch Kids,

289
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,840
it's always presented as major 80s thing.

290
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,400
It is like, cause there's always,

291
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,240
when you're defining eras, you always gotta go to the toy.

292
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,200
It's the Tickle Me Elmo, like the giant fad.

293
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,800
And it's a very early 80s fad.

294
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,720
And that was huge, but it still remains around.

295
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,720
But the main go-to probably a lot of people have is violence.

296
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,840
Yes.

297
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,680
In my head, it's always,

298
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,080
this has been presented my whole life

299
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,600
that this didn't just get popular.

300
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,600
It got to be vigilante mob insanity.

301
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,840
Local news.

302
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,960
The lack of availability of the, yes, news thrived on.

303
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,120
Local news, the shot of people banging up.

304
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,360
Screaming.

305
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,200
People upset, there's a picture of one,

306
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,320
I don't forget which video it is,

307
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,280
but like close up on someone's like a big cut on their leg

308
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,240
from the violence that they endured

309
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,640
during one of these like openings of a store.

310
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,080
Yes, this has been mythologized, I feel like at this point,

311
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,400
but it is true.

312
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,200
Oh yeah, I mean, we saw the later waves.

313
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,160
I remember the Tickle Me Elmo craze

314
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,120
and certainly the Power Rangers craze.

315
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,800
I was more directly invested in it.

316
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,640
Oh yeah.

317
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,480
Yeah.

318
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,320
People going nuts.

319
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,560
My question is like,

320
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,600
was there a Cabbage Patch Kids Stampede three times

321
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,440
and we've just seen this footage milked for all it's worth?

322
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,280
It's a good question.

323
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,400
Or did it happen hundreds of times?

324
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,080
Are there listeners who like lost a loved one

325
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,800
in a Cabbage Patch Stampede?

326
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,280
I'd like to introduce, there's a character,

327
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,920
I don't know, a person I should say,

328
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,240
and he's a character, but he has a fun character name

329
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,360
that's a guy I watch on YouTube and his name is Pixel Dan.

330
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,600
He's one of my toy guys.

331
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,880
Guy meaning good guy, not guy.

332
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,720
Like when we say guy.

333
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,000
Well this to me is like,

334
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,840
yeah, if there's some just character we wanna introduce,

335
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,440
it's not always guy with a capital G.

336
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,760
Like the one we just talked about,

337
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,560
Georgia Clooney's hairdresser.

338
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,840
Sometimes it's just a name that you, the listeners,

339
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,480
need to be aware of to understand the show.

340
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,480
You need to understand, yeah.

341
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,440
The inflection when we say guy,

342
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,440
we need to make sure we underline what we're talking about.

343
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,880
Yeah, because Pixel Dan is kind of a different beast

344
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,920
than Waldo Sancho.

345
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,760
Yeah, Pixel Dan is a toy blogger.

346
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,680
He's been around forever, vlogger.

347
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,680
He wrote a book on Masters of the Universe.

348
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:01,080
He just wrestled Matt Cardona on a show.

349
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,920
Implicable.

350
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,720
Bloodiest thing I've ever seen.

351
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,940
Pixel Dan was bleeding, profusely.

352
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,440
But he was interviewing his mother who worked at Venture,

353
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,920
which I've talked about before,

354
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,200
which is a like targetty type place

355
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,880
that we used to go to in the Midwest.

356
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,880
And she had a story about Cabbage Patch,

357
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,520
very similar to the news stories

358
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,040
of people aggressively outside.

359
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,400
So I think there's probably,

360
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,360
truth is maybe it wasn't like constantly everywhere,

361
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,240
but it probably wasn't just, you know.

362
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,080
Once or twice.

363
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,900
Once or twice.

364
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,740
Yeah.

365
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,560
Maybe the violence was only in a few places.

366
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,560
It was just like a crowd worked into a lather.

367
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,400
Yes.

368
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,300
Yeah, it kind of doesn't happen nowadays,

369
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,940
because one, you can just winter anything off the internet,

370
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:53,940
or even secondary aftermarket on the internet secondhand.

371
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,460
The other thing is that,

372
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:00,460
I've talked with people with kids above five or six nowadays,

373
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,640
they're just like, they just want Roblox gift cards.

374
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,300
They just want Fortnite gift cards.

375
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,100
So there's unlimited amount of those, you know?

376
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,420
Right, sure.

377
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,020
I'm trying to think, yeah, what was the last thing?

378
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,900
People still will camp out kind of to get video games

379
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:21,020
that would line up at a GameStop or a Best Buy,

380
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:21,860
but it's not like-

381
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,060
It's about getting things first.

382
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:23,900
Yeah, it's not.

383
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,080
Not necessarily, you're gonna get it.

384
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,380
You're gonna get it.

385
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,980
And yeah, I'm trying to think,

386
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:31,100
the toys I buy, certainly when they started

387
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,860
the Turtles neckline, they were making a lot less of them.

388
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,060
So sometimes you would walk into a Target,

389
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,740
and you would see a guy that's like

390
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,580
in a Camp Crystal Lake shirt that's about your age,

391
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,140
and you'd make eye contact with him,

392
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,820
and you knew you were both headed to the same section.

393
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,660
Oh boy.

394
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,380
I've had this happen a few times.

395
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,220
Wow.

396
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,540
You'd like fake him out and go buy some paper towels.

397
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,380
No, you can't.

398
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,220
You don't have time.

399
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,660
You don't have time to fake him out, Jason.

400
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,540
You gotta head back to that electronic section

401
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,500
in a Target to go look at the NECA section.

402
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,180
So you get the big thing of paper towels,

403
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,620
and you accidentally throw it at him.

404
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-huh.

405
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,100
Whoops.

406
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,060
So I've seen, there's a little minor versions of like,

407
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,340
yeah, we're both, okay, and then like,

408
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,860
we both are like kind of like circling,

409
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,940
like kind of hunting through the shell,

410
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,300
go ahead, there's nothing here, there's nothing.

411
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,140
Okay. And can you like,

412
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,260
cause you can sort of go like the North aisle above

413
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,100
or the South aisle above.

414
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:18,940
Yeah, which way do you go?

415
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,100
Cause sometimes you can cut through like

416
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,860
the women's clothing section or something,

417
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,380
and that'll kind of cut down on some time

418
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,420
if you're not just gonna go on the normal,

419
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,420
whatever store lanes.

420
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,700
Cause if you do, yeah, you can make a straight line

421
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,500
from the entrance to the electronic section,

422
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,740
or you can actually go around.

423
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,500
Throw a bunch of stuff on really quick,

424
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,540
disguise yourself as like a dowager,

425
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,980
and now he's like, oh, that's just like a grandma

426
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,540
shopping for a grandson I don't have to worry about.

427
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,260
And then you toss it all off and psych,

428
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:50,580
I am an older 30 something looking for a toy.

429
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:54,860
Do they have Toko and Razor's animated figures here?

430
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,340
Oh, I must get these for my grandson.

431
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,220
Oh, okay, well, here you go miss.

432
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,620
It's for your grandson then.

433
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,940
Oh, you go all the way, you talk to him as the character.

434
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,380
I do a characterful character.

435
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,380
You know, I was here for the last one,

436
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,260
but maybe I ought to have some heart

437
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,300
and give this bearded older woman,

438
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,220
this tall bearded older woman.

439
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:17,100
Sonny, do you have, is that a chrome dome deluxe figure?

440
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,580
My grandson really, he must have it.

441
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,500
Is it okay if I, I'll galpay you something.

442
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:28,100
I'll make you a cup of porridge in exchange for it.

443
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:28,940
Oh yeah.

444
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,780
So you're from England then?

445
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,300
Yes, I am, porridge.

446
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,420
So yeah, that's a version.

447
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,420
So I've seen minor versions of Panic.

448
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,340
When you know something's limited, there is a thing,

449
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:44,180
but yeah, mostly it's guys pushing 40

450
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,900
that are running back to electronic section.

451
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,780
You are passive aggressive,

452
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:49,340
who never exchange words and certainly not blows.

453
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:52,900
These southern moms in the early 80s,

454
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,780
they're like, they can't wait

455
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,620
to scratch each other's faces off.

456
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,460
This is like wrestling.

457
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,580
Current 30 something men are like,

458
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,220
oh God, I made eye contact or shit.

459
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,060
Yeah, you're right.

460
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,020
The 80s southern moms were like cutting

461
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,500
wrestling promos on each other in the aisles.

462
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,580
Like with so much profanity.

463
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,620
The ones who get it are so just like gloaty.

464
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,060
I got it.

465
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,060
I got it.

466
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,340
Like they're in shoving it in the other one's faces.

467
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,940
Was this a better time when America's Eid

468
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:22,180
was focused on getting new popular toys?

469
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:27,180
And then later on, it's just like turns towards politics.

470
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:31,220
We had a new toy every year that every kid was like insane

471
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,700
for and the parents had to like spend months

472
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,100
trying to acquire.

473
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:35,940
Would that have been better?

474
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:39,700
All the negative energy, all the hateful energy into that.

475
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,580
Yeah, yeah.

476
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,260
Well, cause there are an argument to be made

477
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,420
that the Cabbage Patch riots are the original January 6th.

478
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:50,420
Someone's working on their documentary filmmaking.

479
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,820
They didn't storm the baby land hospital.

480
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,260
Or did they?

481
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,140
Free the baby.

482
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:01,780
Well, that's, you also like, I mean, if you're,

483
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,500
a whole thing of the QAnon thing is like

484
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,260
babies getting drained for their, what's the,

485
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,180
Adrenochrome?

486
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,020
Adrenochrome.

487
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,020
I had ivermectin in my head.

488
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,620
That's a good conspiracy thing.

489
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,460
That's the dewormer medicine.

490
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,060
That's what, that helps you.

491
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,740
Adrenochrome is the thing that's in baby.

492
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,700
If I, I mean, you know, if I were in Georgia

493
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,300
and I was obsessed with this stuff,

494
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,780
I might start putting my eyes on Cleveland, Georgia

495
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,820
and that hospital because like, they have a lot of like

496
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:35,020
fancy made up tonics and medicines.

497
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,860
They're putting Imagesillin.

498
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,700
They're putting Imagesillin in the dolls.

499
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,980
They're putting Imagesillin into the mother cabbage.

500
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,860
Wait, isn't it Magicsillin?

501
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,980
I saw, I've definitely seen Imagesillin.

502
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,020
It's both.

503
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:46,940
I thought it was magic.

504
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,780
Wait, hold on.

505
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,500
I thought it was like imagination.

506
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,780
Or it could have changed at some point.

507
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,020
Magicsillin does not seem unfamiliar,

508
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,660
but I for sure saw Imagesillin with an eye.

509
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:59,140
They're saying Imagesillin doesn't hurt these dolls.

510
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,780
I don't believe it.

511
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:05,100
That is a weird, that is a very weird thing to say.

512
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,460
Now this Imagesillin is not going to hurt

513
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,500
or harm the cabbage.

514
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,540
Now they're talking about the COVID vaccine

515
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,540
as gene therapy.

516
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:16,060
They're doing gene therapy at the baby land hospital

517
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,980
with the Imagesillin and they're telling you

518
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,980
they're doing all sorts of experiments here.

519
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:25,060
They're putting TLC in these babies.

520
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:25,900
Okay.

521
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,460
I think they're putting three other words,

522
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,780
MKU, MKUltra, and then they'll be activated.

523
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,860
We need to see these babies grow up.

524
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,100
Let's see if they turn into,

525
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,220
you never see them grow up because maybe they don't,

526
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:42,220
because maybe they were taken into a back room,

527
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,940
drained of the Adrenochrome and the TLC.

528
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,020
The TLC is reused.

529
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:50,380
Brand it, brand it with Xavier Roberts initials.

530
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,220
Oh God.

531
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,060
Yeah, yeah.

532
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:52,900
Okay, okay, okay.

533
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:53,820
So yeah, we got to step back, step back.

534
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,260
To keep barreling ahead, where did this come from?

535
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:02,740
And also, basically with Cabbage Patch Kids,

536
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:06,780
we have a new element to the G rated version

537
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,700
of where babies come from.

538
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,940
Storks are involved.

539
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,940
There are storks in this too,

540
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,780
but this adds a big new step,

541
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:17,020
which is that babies come out of cabbages,

542
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:20,780
that they are grown out of the earth like plants.

543
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,820
Instead of the head of a cabbage, it's a baby's head.

544
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,380
It's a baby's head.

545
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,660
And at some point in the process,

546
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:32,580
the baby is shorn of its leaves, presumably.

547
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:36,660
Although actually, the tourist place we're talking about

548
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,980
clarifies the difference,

549
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,300
where the leaves aren't on the baby.

550
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,260
We'll get into it, we'll explain it.

551
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:46,820
But so crazy mythology, these things blow up,

552
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:51,820
maybe primarily just on the basis of they are cute

553
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,740
and everyone is different,

554
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:58,740
and this cloth style is new and appealing to people.

555
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:04,100
And it all comes in theory from Xavier Roberts,

556
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,660
who was referred to in all of their media

557
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,260
as a soft sculpture artist.

558
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,180
Well, he was a soft sculpture artist

559
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:16,180
who started designing these little people.

560
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:20,180
And it's all a little hazy.

561
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:23,020
They don't got a lot to say about Xavier Roberts,

562
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,700
because, Mike, as you have implied,

563
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,100
and which is illustrated in this vice thing,

564
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,740
he stole it from a nice woman.

565
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:33,260
A very unassuming nice woman

566
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:36,660
who didn't want anything mass marketed or commercialized

567
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,540
named Martha Nelson Thomas.

568
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,700
Who wanted the opposite of what happened.

569
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,540
Yes.

570
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:45,500
She wanted to make nice custom dolls for people.

571
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,700
Not for a mod of profit or anything.

572
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,540
She liked to paint and do things.

573
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,940
She was an art teacher and a folk artist.

574
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:57,100
And Xavier Roberts comes to town and sweet talks her

575
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,460
and is like, I'm gonna sell some of these dolls for you.

576
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,020
And I guess for a little while she let him do it.

577
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:05,420
He was working at some sort of park type setting

578
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,460
and either ran the gift, perhaps did not run the gift,

579
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,100
maybe worked in the gift shop.

580
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,980
He might have been a lower tier gift shop employee

581
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,980
who took these things they sold very quickly.

582
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:21,820
Then he asked for more.

583
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,940
And she said, I don't know if I feel comfortable with this.

584
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:28,460
I think this man is going to steal the idea.

585
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,300
Yes.

586
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,140
And then he did.

587
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:30,980
And that's what happened.

588
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,180
She was right.

589
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:36,340
And pretty quickly, yeah, he just took it

590
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,012
and took the design.
