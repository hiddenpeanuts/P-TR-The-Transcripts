1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:13,400
Warning, the following podcast contains complimentary high brow candy, new rules, a sandwich squatter,

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:19,800
and a Texas sized grab bag of topical theme park topics like new universal parks and new

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,160
Disney red tape.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,560
Yay.

7
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,200
It's podcast the ride.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:51,240
Welcome to podcast the ride where one of my co-hosts has slipped by for months without

9
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:57,360
me noticing that his Twitter bio reads, the little wooden messy boy of podcast the ride.

10
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,940
I'm Scott Gardner.

11
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:03,500
I will let the listener guess who, which of as I introduced Mike Carlson.

12
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,500
I'm here.

13
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,100
Mike, was that your bio?

14
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,660
No, that's not my bio.

15
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:11,060
I did not write that I'm a little wooden messy boy.

16
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,500
That would, I would not do that.

17
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,100
Well then that leaves only Jason Sheridan.

18
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,740
Yeah, that's right.

19
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:23,220
Well for years it said the messy boy of podcast the ride and then maybe when we were on blank

20
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,340
check or when Griffin was on our show, I was called the little wooden boy.

21
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:28,740
Yes.

22
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,940
So I just, you know, peanut butter and jelly to great tastes that tastes great together.

23
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,100
Peanut butter and chocolate.

24
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,700
I guess this is, this is peanut butter and poison.

25
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,580
This is, this is a ghastly phrase that you've just had.

26
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:48,220
You've publicly will it like used as the primary way to get to know you.

27
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:52,460
You have used this, this, this insane concoction.

28
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,860
I just don't, it's been right under my nose this whole time.

29
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,380
I didn't see it till earlier today.

30
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,340
Like, well, we got to get right into this.

31
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,060
I also included this audio program as well.

32
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,260
You mean the link to what we're doing?

33
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,260
Yeah.

34
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,260
Oh sure.

35
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,260
Well that's good news.

36
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,940
But this is, I don't know.

37
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:13,140
Here's what, because I wasn't a big fan of the messy boy.

38
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,980
I think I've spoken about this on the show.

39
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,980
You're anti messy boy.

40
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,740
Little, little wooden boy made me laugh.

41
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,980
This I liked, but then you put it all together and you know what's weird is that I think

42
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:28,220
if it was the other, I think if you switched it, if it was the little messy wooden boy,

43
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,820
then wooden boy is the primary aspect.

44
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:37,460
But the way you've structured this keeps messy boy the main thing and then wooden and messy

45
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,060
next to each other.

46
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,780
There's just some like, there's some connotations to this.

47
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,540
If it's keeping you up at night, I'll gladly change it.

48
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,540
I don't think I was thinking that hard.

49
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,100
Hey Jason, don't back down.

50
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,100
Oh, okay.

51
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,100
Hey, stand your ground here.

52
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,580
Oh, you want me to not change it?

53
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,060
Well, I'm just saying we're starting this.

54
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,300
This is the start of this discussion and we don't know how it's going to come out on the

55
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,300
other side.

56
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,300
I don't want you to give in just yet.

57
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,020
And I haven't lost sleep about it yet.

58
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,060
I've only found out about it an hour ago or so.

59
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,500
You like something and I saw it and like, wait a minute, this has been waiting for me

60
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,500
here.

61
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,220
I think you should add a couple more words to it.

62
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,220
Oh really?

63
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,220
Do you have any pitches?

64
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,580
What could even be in the league of these words?

65
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,220
Messy and wooden, yes.

66
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,260
Okay.

67
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,580
Let's see.

68
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,180
Is it like naughty maybe?

69
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,620
Well, naughty, I don't know.

70
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,620
We're getting awfully risque.

71
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,140
The naughty, messy, wooden boy.

72
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:34,940
Yeah, but I like naughty better than rambunctiousness in this regard.

73
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,940
You recently-

74
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:41,140
Wait, but there was, don't forget your lifelong go-to word, Ramy.

75
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,140
Ramy.

76
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,180
Ramy might get into here pretty well.

77
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,700
Yeah.

78
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,220
The phrase is unnerving.

79
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,220
That's true.

80
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,980
Support, great.

81
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,420
But I do like it when, I like it on Jason's profile.

82
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,620
So I guess I'm not saying I don't necessarily.

83
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,620
Okay, all right.

84
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,060
I just needed to air it out.

85
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,580
I needed to like get everyone's feelings.

86
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09,580
Here's what, I'm trying to remember how messy boy came around.

87
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,100
Yeah, I really don't remember.

88
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:15,220
I've forgotten twice as much as I've remembered on this podcast.

89
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,100
Is that even from the show?

90
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,380
Is that something you just invented on your own or was that something-

91
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,540
Where it was from the show?

92
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,540
Maybe it is.

93
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,540
It feels like it must have been.

94
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,540
I think I added wooden recently.

95
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,540
Yeah, well you had-

96
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,540
Pinocchio, we all loved.

97
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,540
Yeah.

98
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:36,540
How about I'm a widow stinker after, in like kind of baby voice.

99
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,540
Parenthetical, like in parentheses?

100
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,540
Yeah.

101
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,540
I'm a messy little-

102
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:45,540
The widow wooden, Ramy, messy stinker.

103
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,540
Yeah.

104
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:51,700
The boy thing is, you're hold up on that.

105
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,700
That is, yes.

106
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:58,700
I've spoken, I've been, wherever this came from, I'm a little something boy.

107
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,700
You do it, it's out there in the world.

108
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,020
I mean, I could easily do it with my interests.

109
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,940
I'm a little wine boy.

110
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,900
I don't like the sound of that.

111
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,540
I am a person who likes to drink some wine from time to time.

112
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:17,620
This is an adult way of presenting thoughts and ideas.

113
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,620
What about-

114
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:22,540
The little something boy just implies you're like, you're like, driving in it.

115
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,140
In this case, I don't know, that you're like, rolling around in mess.

116
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,140
I'm a little sippy wine boy.

117
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,140
No.

118
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,140
Me drink.

119
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,140
Oh, sippies.

120
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:38,140
You manage to, you keep finding ways to punch these.

121
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,140
Yeah.

122
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,660
It's not punching up or down.

123
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,940
It's like a hard straight right.

124
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,940
Yeah.

125
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,060
Punching them into disgusting corner.

126
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,060
There's a-

127
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,060
Punching them into the gutter.

128
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,060
It gets into a weird territory.

129
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:57,620
It's adult, yeah, it's adult baby talk, which I think is generally unnerving.

130
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:05,900
I think that's what we're going for and that's why I'm pushing it even more towards, I think.

131
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,860
But Jason's, yeah, Jason's profile is the most-

132
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,300
You looked up what my profile is recently?

133
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:19,700
Yours is a call to, it's part of your effort to get a Batman Forever sequel made.

134
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,700
Oh yeah.

135
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,540
My profile on Twitter recently has changed that I asked if anyone's a producer, please

136
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,540
get in touch with me.

137
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,540
Atria, small business hero.

138
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,180
No, no, that's not.

139
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,460
You're looking at the wrong Michael Carlson.

140
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:35,580
It says, please contact me at michael at batmanforever2.com.

141
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,580
Do you have that address?

142
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,580
Do you have that domain?

143
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,100
Is that an email address I own?

144
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,100
Really?

145
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,100
Yeah.

146
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,100
Well, this hasn't been talked about.

147
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,100
No, it hasn't, yeah.

148
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,100
Wow, wow.

149
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,740
Does that mean, so you, do you then own the domain, batmanforever2.com?

150
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,380
I own the domain of Batman Forever 2 right now.

151
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,380
Geez.

152
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,380
Wow.

153
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,180
That is a thing I own.

154
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,660
I did it, it was maybe late one night.

155
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:03,780
Is your thought at this point, let's, here's a dark thing to address, the current state

156
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:09,500
of Val Kilmer, which is very sad, but it led to this real moment of heart that I think

157
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,940
people really liked in Top Gun Maverick.

158
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:17,300
Do you think that is it dealt with in a way, like, do you have to do the same?

159
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,940
Do you just maybe like, okay, well now that scene happens 10 times.

160
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:26,340
If it worked for Top Gun Maverick, then we just blow it into infinity.

161
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,740
It's a good question.

162
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:33,820
I think really what I was thinking is that we would sort of reassemble like, dialogue,

163
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:38,980
Val dialogue, like the Mark Hamill Mandalorian scenes where he's young Luke Skywalker.

164
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:39,980
Oh, sure, yes.

165
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,980
Just deep fake it.

166
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:41,980
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

167
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:46,100
So, cause I want everyone, honestly, maybe everyone is young and then my Batman Forever

168
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,180
2, just deep fake everyone so they look like they're from like 1997.

169
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:55,780
Well, another kind of elephant in this room is Nicole Kidman, who is just like forever

170
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,860
now associated with the AMC.

171
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,860
That's right.

172
00:07:58,860 --> 00:07:59,860
That's true.

173
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,460
That's her most iconic, it managed to top Dr. Chase Meridian.

174
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,460
Right.

175
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,060
As the main thing Nicole Kidman will be known for.

176
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,180
Which do you find that, do you think that helps or is it distracting?

177
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:13,340
Like do you need to get her back into the 1995 look?

178
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,760
Well that's what, yeah, that's what the deep fake will be for because yeah, I don't think

179
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,340
people will be confused now.

180
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,540
They'll be like, well, what's this, a psychiatrist?

181
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,540
But this is the AMC lady.

182
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,980
And they will be just very confused at that.

183
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,300
So yeah, I want it.

184
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:32,220
I mean, the movie will be have so much tech, like so much CGI, it'll technically be a cartoon.

185
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,820
It's really what my vision for it is.

186
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,780
It could be nominated for best animated.

187
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,780
Best animated.

188
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,780
Yeah.

189
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,980
Even though technically it's live action, it's actually more technically a cartoon.

190
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,920
So everyone will look just like fresh from 1996.

191
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:51,580
So we'll have to like scan in everybody's face, like via movies, like from that era,

192
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,580
like whatever.

193
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,900
Human show Jim Carrey was at 97.

194
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,620
So scan his face in there because he's coming back.

195
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:03,820
You got a tough gambit with Tommy Lee Jones and Two-Face because the scan works for one

196
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,820
half of him.

197
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:10,020
But how do you apply makeup to a digital deep fake face?

198
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,580
How do you do the dark side of Two-Face?

199
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:16,060
I think you get to have a little creative liberty.

200
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:21,980
Like the Into the Spider verse, you know, some characters had more artistic flourishes

201
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,340
that were like nods to comic book artists.

202
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,820
Oh yeah, there's characters in totally other styles.

203
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,820
I see.

204
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,820
Yeah.

205
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,780
I'll say this though, in my Batman Forever Two, Two-Face is dead.

206
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,780
Really?

207
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,780
Because he dies in the movie.

208
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,780
Oh wait, does he?

209
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,780
I don't remember that.

210
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,780
What happens at the end?

211
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:43,820
He's going to like, I forget, he puts Chase and he puts Robin on two sides of like a big

212
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,860
contraption and drops them both.

213
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,380
And then Batman decides he can save both of them.

214
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:52,900
So he's like shooting down the whole like this long sort of tunnel thing and he saves

215
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,200
both of them.

216
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,260
And then I believe Two-Face like kind of on like he's about to shoot Batman.

217
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,900
He's going to, Harvey, you got to use your coin, Harvey.

218
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,900
And he goes, oh yeah.

219
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,500
And he does a coin and then Batman throws a bunch of coins at him.

220
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,500
Oh, that's right.

221
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,500
And he's like, that's the silliest.

222
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,900
And then he like flips and he falls.

223
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:16,940
So I guess he could have survived it, but it is not an option to not catch any coins.

224
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:20,260
That is more important than my own life.

225
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,940
He gets very confused.

226
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:28,500
Two-Face, an arch master criminal, very confused when like seven coins are thrown at him.

227
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,980
He falls to his death.

228
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:36,460
And then there's like a big Chris O'Donnell like, yes, vengeance has been served.

229
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,460
But the whole thing is that he wanted to kill him before, but now he didn't kill him, but

230
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,380
he gets to see him punished.

231
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,500
So maybe he's conflicted now because he learned whatever.

232
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,660
So that's what happens.

233
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:51,420
So Batman luckily in uniform went to like a sandwich place on the way to all of this.

234
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,420
Yes.

235
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,420
He just had a pocket of which to change.

236
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,420
He went to a laundromat.

237
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,420
Yeah, he's had a laundromat.

238
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,420
Yeah, so we know.

239
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,420
Or an arcade.

240
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,420
It could have been an arcade, sure.

241
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,420
He stopped by for a little fun.

242
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,420
Yeah, exactly.

243
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:04,020
He knew he had a big night of work ahead of him.

244
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,020
Yeah, right.

245
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,020
So he knew this might come up.

246
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:10,940
This place has tokens, not coins, but that'll do.

247
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:11,940
Doesn't really matter.

248
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,940
He knew this.

249
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,940
Yeah, he knew this came up.

250
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,060
No, in my version of Batman Forever 2, Two-Face is dead.

251
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,060
He is dead.

252
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,660
I don't have a plan to bring him back.

253
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,660
Okay.

254
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,660
There will be a new villain, a Scarecrow is in Batman Forever 2.

255
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,660
Played by either...

256
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,660
These are big reveals.

257
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,980
Played by either the rumors of the time, Jeff Goldblum or Howard Stern.

258
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,980
Oh, it has to be.

259
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,980
Yes.

260
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,580
I think you got to go with Stern.

261
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,580
Because it's more bizarre.

262
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:40,180
It's more bizarre and it'd be one of the only films that Howard Stern acts in.

263
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,180
Yeah, like the second movie.

264
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,660
That did not keep going after Private...

265
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,660
Yeah, yeah.

266
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,260
That was Stern movie number two.

267
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,260
Yep.

268
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,740
Over 25 years after the first one.

269
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,740
Again, deep fake.

270
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,340
He looks like he did in Private Parts.

271
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,340
So that was...

272
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:59,180
Because if you weren't alive when we were alive, these were the rumors of the day.

273
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,700
Even though Burton didn't do those forever in Batman and Robin, they were still technically

274
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,580
all four in the same universe.

275
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:08,820
But the rumor was, oh, the fifth one is going to have Scarecrow and it's going to be Jeff

276
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:12,940
Goldblum or it's going to be Howard Stern playing the character.

277
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:19,340
Egghead can be played by Rudolph Giuliani after his star hosting stint on Saturday Night Live.

278
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:23,580
He's going to be in office and he was also going to be Egghead.

279
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:29,220
If we use Rudy Giuliani for maybe Batman Forever 3, we will not deep fake him.

280
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,460
He will look as he is now.

281
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,540
It might be a problem because he definitely looks a little bit like Danny DeVito Penguin

282
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,540
from Batman Returns.

283
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,540
It'd be confusing.

284
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,540
It'd be kind of confusing.

285
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,540
So yeah.

286
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,780
Look, I'm glad we started uncovering.

287
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,660
There was a lot in the bio situation.

288
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,260
What does your bio say?

289
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,820
I think I say things that I've worked on.

290
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,820
Oh, OK.

291
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,820
I don't have a...

292
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,820
That's fun.

293
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,340
No, not as much.

294
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,900
But I say Steely Dan and wine in there just to get out two of the...

295
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:05,180
Because I guess I'm a little Steely Dan boy.

296
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,180
Everyone happy now?

297
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,740
Are you happy?

298
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:13,900
My little earsies makes me a little Steely Dan boy.

299
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,980
My little earsies enjoyment.

300
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,980
My little...

301
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:22,500
Steely Dan is a treat for my little earsies.

302
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,500
That's what it is.

303
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,500
OK, good.

304
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,580
Sometimes I'm a little gaucho boy, but mainly I'm a little night flight boy.

305
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,580
Great.

306
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,580
All right.

307
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,580
We're doing the parlance.

308
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:35,540
Listener, if you have suggestions for words to add to Jason's bio, knowing that it's in

309
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,540
flux.

310
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:41,540
Email them to Michael at Batman Forever 2.

311
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,540
Batmanforever.com.

312
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,180
You email me at it.

313
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,780
I don't know that I'll email you back, but...

314
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:46,780
What is it?

315
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,780
Full?

316
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,780
At Batmanforever2.com?

317
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,340
Yeah, and then it's the number two.

318
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,340
The number two.

319
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,340
Batmanforever2.com.

320
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,340
OK.

321
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,340
Yes.

322
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,340
Great.

323
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,340
OK.

324
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:01,140
Well, now that all that is out of the way, we can get to some important news that's been

325
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,580
occurring in Theme Park World.

326
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,900
There were a lot of drops, I feel like.

327
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:11,220
I feel like one particular day or a few particular days, there was just a ton that we have not

328
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,500
gotten to address.

329
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:18,900
Well, one, I mean, between the two big companies, Disney and Universal, one went for quantity

330
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,980
and one went for quality.

331
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,340
Mm hmm.

332
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:29,180
I mean, are you saying that there is not quality to the recent announcements of the Walt Disney

333
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,180
company?

334
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:37,380
I feel like they got the news that Universal was about to announce stuff.

335
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,380
So then they're like, oh, we got to do something.

336
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,060
We got to do some stuff.

337
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,340
That stuff we were working on.

338
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,340
Release the stuff.

339
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,340
Release the stuff.

340
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:49,940
Well, which, I mean, let's get to it, guys.

341
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:53,340
Parking is free at Disney World Hotels again.

342
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,340
Holy shit.

343
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:58,260
Like, why were you guys bullshitting for so long at the beginning?

344
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:03,340
You're holding back the earth shattering news.

345
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:07,300
Listeners surely all know the cost situation of hotels.

346
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,300
Oh, yeah.

347
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,300
They were free and now they're not.

348
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,300
Wait, were they free?

349
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,300
They were free for a long time.

350
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,660
For decades they were free.

351
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:19,020
And if you're a hotel guest, a Disney hotel guest, you could park at the parks for free.

352
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,020
That was the other thing.

353
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,700
So it's just like, oh, we're staying really far from Animal Kingdom.

354
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,700
Let's drive over.

355
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,700
Oh, I see.

356
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,700
Right.

357
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,140
And not for, when did it shift?

358
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,420
Reopening, I think, for the pandemic.

359
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,660
Oh, yeah, that's a good question.

360
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,660
Around then, I think.

361
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,260
I don't know if it was that specific, but I think so, yeah.

362
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,260
It is recent, though.

363
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,540
Jason's double checking it.

364
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:46,420
But yeah, there was another one of those like, it's all designed to be like, we're going

365
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:51,020
to do a little away with a little of the Mr. Chapex stuff.

366
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:55,700
We're going to go backwards three years when things were also crowding and annoying.

367
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,700
Oh, I take that back.

368
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,780
And then in 2018, they started charging for it.

369
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,780
Well, there you go.

370
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,780
It's a Mr. Eiger decision.

371
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,780
Yeah.

372
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,780
Wow.

373
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,780
How about that?

374
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,780
I was wrong.

375
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,780
Shuddering.

376
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,780
His baby, the parking payment program.

377
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,100
What do you mean?

378
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,620
This isn't my company anymore.

379
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,620
Why did I come back?

380
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:16,220
Here's what my guess then is that with that new information.

381
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:20,260
My guess is that they looked at the numbers and said, should we bring down, because hotel

382
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,460
prices are insane at this point.

383
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,300
I wonder if they looked at the numbers and went, well, should we bring those down or

384
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:28,340
should we just like bring the $10 charge down?

385
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,780
And they went, oh yeah, the $10 to whatever $20 charge.

386
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,780
That would be my guess.

387
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,780
Yeah.

388
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,980
Because they're because we'll see.

389
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,940
These are like encouraging things.

390
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:42,660
But I still, as I said before, I still have the feeling that like some of the annoying

391
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,460
changes they're like, we like those and we're going to keep those like they're going to

392
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:51,860
like and they've then all of these announcements sort of to me feel like we're going to like

393
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:56,860
play a little bit of a shell game, a little three card Monte with you and you'll like

394
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,820
kind of go, oh yeah, that sounds good.

395
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,060
But really a lot of the annoying things are still around.

396
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,060
Yeah.

397
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,020
What do you mean?

398
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:11,740
Don't forget the, I mean, I've been like shivering with excitement about the news that the park

399
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:16,980
hopping hour at Disneyland is moving from 1 p.m. to 11 a.m.

400
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:20,340
You can jump between parks now two hours earlier.

401
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:25,700
Yeah, we should have like dropped everything and started recording one at 3 a.m.

402
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,580
Whatever it took when this news dropped.

403
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,780
I know. Very exciting.

404
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,100
Why have we been sleeping?

405
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,220
Doesn't it feel like a shell?

406
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:35,260
The shell game, the three, the Jason played in New York, I think.

407
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,060
Right. To play the show.

408
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,820
I'm a former three guard.

409
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:39,980
I'm a dealer.

410
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,100
My story.

411
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,300
Three card Monte.

412
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,380
OK, the table.

413
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,860
There was something else.

414
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,700
It was. Oh, they were selling weed.

415
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:51,980
But they were selling the fake weed and they said it wasn't fake, but you you knew it was

416
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,140
fake because you smelled it.

417
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,820
Fake. This doesn't seem real.

418
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,540
The little weed skeptic boy.

419
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,900
Yeah. Sniff sniff.

420
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,060
I'm the little weed skeptic boy.

421
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:03,300
OK, yes. So in Florida, you are in California.

422
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,860
You can go. You can park up at 11.

423
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:12,300
But in Florida, you're forgetting you are if you are an annual passholder, you don't

424
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:17,020
have to make a reservation for what park you're going to if it's after two p.m.

425
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,060
We're at risk of me not making it through some of these sentences.

426
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:24,740
Unless I'm like I'm like I'm drifting as they're in motion.

427
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,740
This is the stuff I really wanted to see if blood would finally like trip out of your ear.

428
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:32,180
We're trying to say, OK, so at Disneyland, it's 11 a.m.

429
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,860
But at Disney World, it's two p.m.

430
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:38,220
but only for annual pass holders, unless it's the weekend and you're going to the Magic

431
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,220
Kingdom, then you still have to rest.

432
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:45,980
This is like you're throwing a bunch of quarters up in the air and I'm yelling,

433
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,100
I'm going to trip and fall.

434
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,980
This will be my demise.

435
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:54,220
Disneyland, you get all ticket holders now get free photo pass photos.

436
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:59,420
But at Disney World, you get free photo pass photos if you bought Genie Plus that day.

437
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,060
I got a lot of nice bottles in the house.

438
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:06,540
We I was just talking about wine and now I want to go inside.

439
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,580
Maybe I need to. I'll have one, too.

440
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:13,740
I don't I shouldn't make leaving the episode so regular.

441
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,540
It'd be funny though.

442
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,020
Jason, I'll talk. We can get it.

443
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,020
We'll finish the rest of this.

444
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,300
It was one of us has left an episode.

445
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,220
Yeah, I'm back. Well, I think about it.

446
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,620
I'm good. I'm all right.

447
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,260
We'll see where this goes.

448
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,660
I OK, look, all right.

449
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,660
We can come back to these things.

450
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,900
I feel like we need to let's let's talk about.

451
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,820
Well, now that you know, the tenor of what Disney's announcements were

452
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,260
in the face of the universal announcements,

453
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:43,580
which are new parks at weird places that parks aren't.

454
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:48,020
Yeah, like brand new as their news has been for the last couple of years.

455
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:48,940
What are we doing?

456
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:53,860
We're thinking about shifting the universal frequent globers program.

457
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:57,060
The price is going to go from now.

458
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,540
You can park for instead of $30.

459
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,660
It will be 28.

460
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:04,740
No, they're building a new fucking theme park with Frankenstein and Mario.

461
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,660
And like it's already that's where they've been at.

462
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,900
And now it's moving to their move.

463
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,340
They're going to Texas. Universal is going to Texas.

464
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,860
Yeah, they've shifted the focus like I think Epic Universe

465
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:20,220
pretty much like ready to go, at least creatively.

466
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,100
Still some plenty of construction to be done.

467
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,700
Uh huh. But and there's and they are set on Fantastic Beasts still.

468
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,740
They are committed to fantastic.

469
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,260
They have not announced exactly.

470
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,540
Well, I think the head.

471
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:38,620
The theme, but I'm a big YouTube watcher of theme park stop.

472
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,380
I don't know if Alicia Stella, who's a very active ghost.

473
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,740
A lot of the land.

474
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,420
Yeah, she narrates these videos because they go through and they dig

475
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:51,140
and find like patent patents and they find like,

476
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,140
I guess plans, what do you call them?

477
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:57,380
Plan like literally like to file something with the.

478
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,140
Yeah, they go through that and find stuff.

479
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,500
So I've probably stolen information from this

480
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,980
and not cited my source before about Epic Universe.

481
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,060
But so I apologize for that.

482
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:06,460
But I.

483
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,700
V.S. is the Riddler.

484
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,380
It's a look.

485
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,300
Or two face.

486
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,100
He's my guy.

487
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,780
And spice sugar.

488
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,340
Look, I love all those villains.

489
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:16,060
So, yeah, they probably infected my personality to some degree.

490
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:21,660
But she has all these videos about each separate land, long videos

491
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,900
about like what the actual layout of the land is and what's a restaurant.

492
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,740
And what's this?

493
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:30,980
And I believe Fantastic Beasts only might be represented in the exterior

494
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,380
of the ride and maybe the area.

495
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,860
But the ride is not Fantastic Beasts based.

496
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:39,260
OK, and they will not be called Fantastic Beasts.

497
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:42,260
No way. Yeah, it's going to be ministry of magic.

498
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,700
It's going to be I forget the lady in pink bad guy from Harry Potter.

499
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,620
J.K. Rowling. Oh, yeah.

500
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,300
J.K. Rowling herself is the villain in the ride.

501
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,140
Oh, I'm never going to that one.

502
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:56,820
You just have to.

503
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,700
Yeah, it's a virtual reality thing.

504
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,780
We have to just try to avoid the tweets.

505
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,140
You just have to look away.

506
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:05,740
I remember everything before 2003 or so.

507
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,420
Yeah, you're fighting against something called Mumsnet.

508
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,940
And you're like, what the fuck?

509
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,660
Why is the most

510
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:14,740
of the worst hate organizations in the world?

511
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:17,700
It's going to be a scarier ride than the monsters ride.

512
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,140
That's what they say.

513
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:23,500
No, but so, yeah, I think the Fantastic Beasts, it's quietly.

514
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:27,300
While some of the exteriors are still like the French Ministry of Magic,

515
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,420
which is the ministry magic in those movies.

516
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,380
It's really call it Wizarding World Part Three.

517
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,580
I guess, yeah.

518
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,220
So well, seems smart.

519
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:39,020
It's been sitting there as but in my head, not knowing all this

520
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:43,940
as potentially the least sound universal decision for recent.

521
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:46,540
But this seems good if they're shifting away.

522
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,740
Yeah, it's very cursed franchise.

523
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:52,380
Yes. I don't think Grindelwald is in the land.

524
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,420
I don't think there's crimes of Grindelwald attraction.

525
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:01,180
And they won't be playing the Johnny Depp Jeff Beck album.

526
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,820
Well, they will be doing that.

527
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,820
They will be doing that for a couple of years.

528
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,900
In tribute. Jeff. Yeah.

529
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,020
So anyway, those videos are if you want.

530
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,580
I mean, there's a lot of spoiler type stuff, but I probably

531
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,180
you'll forget a lot of it by the time the land opens up.

532
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,380
But that's great.

533
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:18,620
There's some I was just watching a Donkey Kong explanation

534
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,620
of what that mine cart coaster is going to be.

535
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,340
It sounds amazing.

536
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,420
Sounds so good. It sounds great.

537
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,420
Yeah, she also she posted a picture.

538
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,700
She's like, I spent on the cork board for a while.

539
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,940
I didn't get very far on it.

540
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:33,340
Like the day all the Texas stuff broke and it says like

541
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:36,420
additional universal parks, Texas, question mark.

542
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,820
Oh, right. Right. Yeah. Wow. Wow.

543
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,380
Well, now we're here.

544
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:45,700
There is a there's no name to say, but they universal is building a.

545
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,060
Well, it's not I don't even want to say small.

546
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:52,900
I think the property they have is almost as big as Islands of Adventure

547
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,060
is what I saw.

548
00:23:54,060 --> 00:24:00,660
So it is sizable and it is a a kid oriented or kid or family

549
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:04,780
oriented theme park that is a different premise and feel

550
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:08,500
than the existing universal parks, which this is pretty new

551
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,700
because they've had kind of a template that they've used.

552
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:14,980
Even the international ones are still it's the studio gates.

553
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,020
And here is right.

554
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:20,540
Transformers are here is Simpsons or what have you.

555
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,860
Here's what you would.

556
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,820
Here's what porous what?

557
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:27,100
Yeah, they're they're letting go of the face of the organization.

558
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:32,220
So, yeah, it's and it's it's beautiful concept art.

559
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,820
It looks great.

560
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,500
It's like in the vein and color.

561
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,180
Yeah, it looks would be the word.

562
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:41,900
It's like in the vein, I think of like a Lego land or something where

563
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,420
it's primarily for kids things.

564
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:47,500
But I mean, from the art, it looks like it's themed.

565
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,460
It doesn't look like it's light on theming.

566
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,940
But obviously anything can change.

567
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:55,580
But yeah, it looks like it looks like maybe it's like five different

568
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,900
sort of kid land stitched together or something.

569
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,580
Yeah, yeah.

570
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:03,180
And you could kind of infer vibe wise

571
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:09,180
what some of them are like trolls seems pretty clearly like one of them.

572
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:14,300
And maybe there's a I mean, I saw a list that was just name checking.

573
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:18,180
I don't is it despicable me more of that is there Shrek is there

574
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,620
Kung Fu Panda?

575
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,660
Is there the bad guys?

576
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,860
They've got a lot to work with with this.

577
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:26,100
This Dreamworks situation.

578
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:30,020
And it's cool that Dreamworks is willing to use these characters outside of

579
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:33,540
you know, where they got it right and perfect,

580
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,980
which is the the waterpark in the American Dream Mall.

581
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:40,780
It's cool that they're willing to like deviate from the gold standard

582
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,180
of how you use their characters.

583
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,940
You know, if you think about it, like the American Dream Mall is like the

584
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,860
generation, you know, the beta testing, you know.

585
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,380
Getting the kinks out, you know.

586
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:54,740
Not to me, not to there's there's there's not a kink to be found in that place.

587
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,060
There's not a lot to be found in that zero.

588
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:00,300
King can be. Yeah, that's why there's less room for kinks

589
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:03,260
when the place is less than half occupied.

590
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,900
It looks like there's in the back left.

591
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,660
It looks like Jurassic Park ish.

592
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:13,100
So, I mean, there's like kids kid dress camp crustacean,

593
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:16,980
because I always say crustacean, which is, of course, a crab or a sea life.

594
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,860
But crustacean is the word on Netflix.

595
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,220
Right. It's like a kid's cartoon.

596
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:24,460
So I wonder if there's like a dinosaur encounters or something back there.

597
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:30,340
I don't know. End of Jurassic Park, a non terrifying dress experience.

598
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,980
Yeah. So there's like a big.

599
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,700
This is seemingly long, like boat ride of some kind in there.

600
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:39,740
Yeah. The centerpiece of it seems like a big lagoon with a boat ride.

601
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,860
Yeah. So it like it's this is not.

602
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:46,500
Yeah, this is not just some cheap bunch of.

603
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:49,020
I mean, some of the rides are going to definitely be maybe like off the shelf

604
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:52,740
stuff, but as far as theming, it looks like they're doing their due

605
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:58,660
diligence of like giving the parents like us what we want, which is theming

606
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,820
lots of trees, water.

607
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,820
This is what we want in the park.

608
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,900
We don't want just flat in these cheap rides.

609
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:09,860
Give us a little finesse, you know, size wise.

610
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:15,700
I have 97 acres, which is about a quarter of the full universal

611
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,940
Orlando resort property.

612
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,460
OK, I don't know how far out that goes.

613
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:24,260
Like how far does that include like Habana Bay?

614
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,260
I'm assuming includes that first stretch of hotels.

615
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:30,460
I don't know if includes the big like super hotels.

616
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,700
Yeah. Well, that's pretty major.

617
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,260
That's a big footprint.

618
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:37,860
And I think expansion plans are caked into it.

619
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:42,260
Like they'll start with a certain amount, but keep building from their hotel

620
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,180
at the front. Hotel is the entrance, seemingly.

621
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,140
Yeah, it's got that.

622
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:50,260
They have it in Disneyland Paris, where you have like sort of the hotel

623
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:53,620
right at the front of the park, which is also going to be, which I guess

624
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:57,260
is like a holdover idea from Westcott, where they were going to have all the

625
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:00,620
all the hotels sort of around it, like in their world showcase.

626
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:03,380
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that is the berm of the hotels.

627
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,140
I mean, it sounds great.

628
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:10,540
And it's it seems innovative to do a different kind of park

629
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,900
in a different kind of market.

630
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:16,020
I guess one question is, though,

631
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,500
just try to picture 20 years ahead.

632
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:22,260
Is this thriving in 20 years because they've committed to it

633
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,060
and they pull it off well?

634
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:27,380
Or is this like a defunct land topic?

635
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:32,780
Like, is it possible that they just cannot get people to this location?

636
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:38,380
Like to think of this part of Texas, it's part of the Dallas Fort Worth area.

637
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:41,820
I think Texas, the suburb of Dallas. Frisco.

638
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,340
Do they what if they can't get people to Frisco?

639
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:49,380
I'm trying to think of like usually what does this type of thing in is

640
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,300
it looks like shit.

641
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,700
It's embarrassing and it fails within a year.

642
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,540
I feel like. Yeah.

643
00:28:56,540 --> 00:29:00,300
Now, I guess Disney Quest lasted forever, like for a long time

644
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:05,380
or a pretty long, pretty long time limped along, but within the confines.

645
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,020
Yeah. Disney property.

646
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,620
But this looks better than Disney Quest. Yeah.

647
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:12,740
Yes, because we because like we I knew Disney Quest wasn't

648
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:15,420
what I thought it was the first time I went.

649
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:19,300
Well, a lot of the ones that crash and burn are indoors.

650
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:25,500
This does to I was people have been alerting us to to Sega World Sydney,

651
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,780
something I didn't know about.

652
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:31,500
And I watched the review time video about this attempt at an indoor

653
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:35,980
Sega theme park in Sydney, Australia, that looked really cool.

654
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:39,380
But it also completely seemed like something you go to once and then never again.

655
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:44,100
Right. And I think the indoor nature of indoor just lends itself to.

656
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:47,940
It's never going to change. That is the same lies with like a lot of Epcot

657
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,420
pavilions. Yeah.

658
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:53,260
Something where indoor is weird. Yeah. Yeah.

659
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,500
Indoor. I'm trying to think of a good indoor.

660
00:29:55,860 --> 00:30:00,500
Well, I mean, I think the things people think of is like Dave and Busters.

661
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:05,660
Right. Because that's what a lot of this stuff gets like, you know, cheap.

662
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,580
And the budgets gets cut so much.

663
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:10,100
You essentially have a family entertainment center.

664
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,700
Yeah. The Dubai Warner Brothers, Dubai World, which I think has some cool stuff

665
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,460
in it is indoors.

666
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,100
So maybe working or not.

667
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:17,900
I don't know.

668
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,940
This one of those where they like they'll never say, yeah, this is a streaming

669
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:22,980
platform like that.

670
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,780
It is not in their interest to it.

671
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:28,700
Nobody's going to if you're dealing with a sovereign will fund.

672
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,900
I like I don't know how much they ever admit fault.

673
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:34,740
I don't think we're going to I mean, we could send an email,

674
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:38,220
but I don't know if we're going to be able to tell any time I've ever seen a video.

675
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,100
It looks like there's seven people in there.

676
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,860
Yes. Yeah. But maybe.

677
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:45,860
And there's no carefully spread even with stuff to do.

678
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:50,260
It hides the north of 20000 visitors every day.

679
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,140
I think that's very possible.

680
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:56,180
I remember it took like a year or two to find a video of the Batman ride.

681
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,820
We're just like, this has been open for a couple of months.

682
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:01,900
And I'm like, oh, obviously, somebody's going to have a ride through video soon.

683
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,820
And the answer was no.

684
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,380
They that's not that took forever to happen.

685
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:06,860
Not a good sign.

686
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:11,060
So, yeah, any time I see video of it, it does not look like it's packed.

687
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,820
But I don't know.

688
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:15,100
But indoor is weird if you're trying to do something.

689
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:20,220
There's a feeling of there's a feeling of it being I'm trying to think like

690
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:25,460
depressing, depressing or limited, like limited in a way.

691
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:28,780
Like it doesn't feel when the open sky is there.

692
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:33,780
Maybe your imagination is able to easy, like easier think that it's.

693
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,060
I don't know. What am I?

694
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,820
I'm searching for the answer here.

695
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,620
Or water parks.

696
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:41,260
Great Wolf Lodge certainly seems to be expanding.

697
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:46,580
But that also, as we've heard, drives the adults insane.

698
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:50,100
Yeah, no, but I smaller stuff indoors is fine.

699
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:53,980
But I think the attempt to do something that feels like it's on the scale of Disney

700
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:57,180
or some universal. Yeah, that's that's when it fails.

701
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:02,340
Yeah, it's between the Great Wolf Lodge size and and bigger theme park.

702
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:06,940
Yeah. So I wonder if it'll help it that it's not that they aren't attempting a

703
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,860
do think it will have a theme park at once.

704
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,900
I don't know. Maybe it works.

705
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,180
Yeah, I think so.

706
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:17,060
I mean, this area is being built up, as we mentioned

707
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,580
before we start recording.

708
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:24,780
I was joking about like the PGA of America is moving their headquarters

709
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:29,340
to this Frisco, Texas, like area that's being built up.

710
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,220
This is professional golf, you're saying.

711
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:34,020
Yeah. It will be the headquarters of of Propeller.

712
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:37,300
A lot of you know, a lot of guys moved away to Texas over the pandemic

713
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,620
for free speech. Is that what this is?

714
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:42,020
Yeah. Well, that what Universal's doing.

715
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,460
Is that what Universal's doing?

716
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,460
I think they're doing I think it's a very business friendly state.

717
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,980
And I think it's got a lot of land that's still cheap.

718
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,460
Yeah. And I don't know.

719
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:55,060
I feel like if a company the size of Comcast or Disney

720
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:59,700
is committing to a full sized theme park, they know like, all right,

721
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:04,500
we can't close it like our stock will just eat shit if we close.

722
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,740
You would think so.

723
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:09,140
So, yeah, that's why I think they're going to put the budget into it.

724
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,860
And it'll work because I'm trying to think, is there an example

725
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:16,980
of something where like it looks like it was the theming budget

726
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:20,020
of a major theme park that completely ate shit?

727
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:22,260
That's so you're saying not Hard Rock Park.

728
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,900
Not Hard Rock Park.

729
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,740
No. Yeah.

730
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:28,100
It kind of all depends on how it yeah.

731
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,380
Does it feel authentic? Right.

732
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,420
Like it a fully imagineer?

733
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,380
Not in this situation or whatever you call it.

734
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:40,460
Yeah. But like, yeah, is it as high end of an experience as those?

735
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,740
And I don't know.

736
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:44,100
Concept. I think it could be. Do they get by?

737
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:47,420
I don't know if they do get budget slashed because this is the company

738
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,980
that isn't. Yeah, they're spending money right now.

739
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:54,940
And yeah, so so I would hope somebody at the top of this faceless

740
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:57,900
multinational corporation realizes that we have to pump a bunch of money

741
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,460
to make it look OK so people keep coming back.

742
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:06,740
Now to flip over back to the other side, I say this already.

743
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,780
I hate it. Yeah, I am more than OK for now.

744
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,620
Just for a quick check in.

745
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:13,180
I'm just because on this topic of spending money,

746
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:18,020
Josh, tomorrow, daddy, tomorrow, he's quoted the last couple

747
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:22,260
days as saying we have no shortage of money.

748
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:26,100
We want to make sure we do the biggest things, the coolest things,

749
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,700
the things that represent the future.

750
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:32,900
I mean, the same thing you said at the tease of a D23

751
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:36,820
speech where then you announced to nothing about the land that's about the future.

752
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:39,940
Yeah, you have no shortage of money and want to do the biggest things.

753
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,980
What's where those announcements?

754
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,580
I'm going. I hear that.

755
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,780
I don't know. I'm not sure.

756
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:49,820
He took the public speaking course that like Obama and Pete Buttigieg

757
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:54,380
took where it's like you are optimistic, but in a confusing way.

758
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,540
Like if you think about it in a general way.

759
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,940
Yeah. Like what?

760
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:00,260
What? What did they say?

761
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,380
The very generalized optimism.

762
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:07,180
So, yeah, you know, I what this company has is a generalized optimism.

763
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:10,060
And the pause makes you think that I'm

764
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,220
carefully considering every word that I'm saying.

765
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,220
Yeah, absolutely.

766
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,060
And through the word storytelling in there,

767
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:17,820
you put some of that Disney flair on.

768
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:21,060
That's how his tomorrow's speech writers, he just says like,

769
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:25,420
put storytelling in 24 more times and then I'll go out.

770
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,540
Yeah, it's yeah, I don't.

771
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:31,460
It would have been nice if when they were trying to announce fun stuff,

772
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,860
they had an actual fun thing to announce

773
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:39,380
because there was a couple days of news cycle of just like basic, like

774
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,620
there'll be like changes to the fine print on the

775
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:46,580
agree the agreement you sign when you buy your ticket,

776
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,460
like the fine print is changed.

777
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:51,100
All these announcements are the most boring.

778
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:56,860
Like you have to be dry in the weeds in a way that not all of the hosts

779
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,940
of this theme park podcast are.

780
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,740
Look, even I needed to brush up a little.

781
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:08,340
I was reading like the the author Arthur Levine, the regular

782
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:09,980
is that his name, the regular

783
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,740
and the wrong guy.

784
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,340
My man.

785
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:16,500
He wrote for USA Today for a long time and about.com

786
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:21,460
about theme parks is his substack newsletter you can subscribe to.

787
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:25,660
So I read his coverage of a lot of this stuff and I read the Disney

788
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:30,060
tours blog coverage and then I was like, wait, let me see what Disney,

789
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:32,460
how Disney is describing this.

790
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,300
And sure enough, they had posts on the Disney parks blog.

791
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:38,140
And it was I had never seen this before.

792
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:41,100
It was like the post about Disney World went, by the way,

793
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,780
this is just for Disney World.

794
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:45,180
Click here for the post about Disneyland.

795
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,700
And then the Disneyland one had the same that had the like, by the way,

796
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,620
this is Disneyland.

797
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,100
Make sure to click Disney World.

798
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:55,620
And they are just different enough to be very annoying.

799
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:00,300
Yeah, because what we want is just like a reservation is gone.

800
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:04,580
No, like that would have been like something that would have been worth us,

801
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:08,060
you know, get going to each other's houses, shaking us out of bed

802
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,020
and going, let's do the podcast right now.

803
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,140
Reservations are gone.

804
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:16,060
That's something that's happening excited about anyone come harass me.

805
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:18,340
We can do the pop in through my window.

806
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:21,500
Our beloved pop in to Disneyland that are gone.

807
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,700
Yeah, yeah.

808
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,500
But yeah, that's not what happened.

809
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,300
Or how about like Avengers ride?

810
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,540
Oh, how about it?

811
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:31,100
Like, let's maybe I'll go above reservation.

812
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,940
Hey, don't get greedy.

813
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:37,740
Yeah, there's a lot of contracts aspiring for that sort of thing.

814
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,980
As Jason said, you ain't racing yet.

815
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,500
You know, calm down.

816
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,340
We're just getting started here.

817
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,300
I'm looking for reserves.

818
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,140
Sorry to be blue sky.

819
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,340
We got a 10 year plan here.

820
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,020
Number one, end of year five.

821
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,580
Reservations gone.

822
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,540
End of year 10.

823
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:55,020
Parking still remains free.

824
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,620
And the park hopping time is 10 a.m.

825
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:03,700
Wow. That's what I'm looking for in a 10 year plan for the Disney parks.

826
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:06,060
Well, some may say you're a dreamer.

827
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,940
Not the only one.

828
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:08,460
Yeah.

829
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,420
So, yes, John.

830
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:16,620
Now, Daddy Tomorrow did say there's going to be more changes.

831
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:21,420
So he's also teasing more changes to what we're talking about.

832
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:26,460
Times you can park hop confusing parking situation like all of this.

833
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:29,700
I think there's going to be more announcements, new colors on our calendars.

834
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,300
Right.

835
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:38,180
A different maybe a different prompt to enter your credit card to buy things on the app.

836
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,740
You know, maybe stuff like that.

837
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:45,340
Changing out characters who appear when it says, oops, something went wrong with our website.

838
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,140
New character.

839
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,260
Right. New characters.

840
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,980
The newest Marvel character will be the one that says, oops, now.

841
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:50,980
Wow.

842
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:54,540
It'll be like a character who was on a show that very week.

843
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,540
Right.

844
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,060
Wow.

845
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:59,660
Yeah. So like Loki's variant, if it's the new season of Loki,

846
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,940
he's going to be on when he's going to have like his finger up on his mouth like, oopsie.

847
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,220
I'm a little oopsie boy.

848
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:08,700
He's going to say, sorry, we don't take Apple Pay anymore, but we do take Zell.

849
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:10,780
Check out Zell.

850
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:14,380
They might take maybe that's going to be an answer to their partnering with Zell.

851
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:19,740
Or maybe there'll be announcement about the potato balls at the Portos that's going to open in

852
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:22,140
downtown Disney, which this is news.

853
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:24,060
And maybe I'm transitioning too early here.

854
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,260
The Portos, I believe, is.

855
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,180
Wait, no, the Portos.

856
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:27,900
Excuse me.

857
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:28,780
False alarm.

858
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:31,580
The Portos is where we got to buckle up here.

859
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,420
La Brea Bakery is closing.

860
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:35,740
It's closed.

861
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,380
All of a sudden.

862
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:40,780
The time you're hearing this, La Brea Bakery is no more.

863
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:45,900
Downtown Disney, Anaheim, La Brea Bakery.

864
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,420
It's been there since day one.

865
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:48,940
Sector one.

866
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:52,620
I'm hearing you will be hearing this for the first time and you'll be,

867
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,660
you know, going through a lot of emotions here.

868
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:58,380
No more okay sandwiches, everybody.

869
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,780
But okay sandwiches.

870
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,940
Guess what's moving in for a temporary fix.

871
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,860
The king of okay sandwiches.

872
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:09,820
The king of couch surfing at downtown Disney.

873
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:15,100
Earl of Sandwich coming in to La Brea Bakery.

874
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,740
I briefly forgot and I thought Portos moving in there.

875
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,700
That is not the case.

876
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,300
They have not announced the Porto location.

877
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,660
That's much too interesting.

878
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,900
Robert Earl is throwing his backpack down.

879
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:27,100
He's like, is it cool if I hang out here for a little while, my man?

880
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:27,600
Uh-huh.

881
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,140
Scott, could you do the voice in that line?

882
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:32,060
Just for a couple months.

883
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,900
That's all it will take.

884
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:37,900
Then we will find our next exciting location

885
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:41,740
where we could feed all the hungry construction workers.

886
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:46,060
So enough time to set up the Coke Freestyle machine

887
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:49,660
and then also disassemble the Coke Freestyle machine.

888
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:55,980
Yeah, so that's my little hands have been clapping and clapping all day.

889
00:40:55,980 --> 00:41:01,820
Not actually making contact because my arms are too little for my hands to connect.

890
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:05,340
Now, this is actually not a Disney decision.

891
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:08,620
This is the La Brea Bakery Company closing.

892
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,740
Interesting. I did not know that.

893
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,940
They're closing the one on La Brea to the original one.

894
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:13,580
Really?

895
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:17,660
Yeah, and they're just focusing on like supplying other places.

896
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:18,160
Wow.

897
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,740
The brand will exist.

898
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:22,380
You will still be able to get La Brea bread.

899
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:22,880
Mmm.

900
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,060
Your airport routine is unchanged.

901
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,860
Scott rolled his eyes so hard.

902
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:34,300
Yeah, I just realized like the false energy I had.

903
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:34,860
Yeah.

904
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:37,500
Powering through that sentence just sputtered out.

905
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:40,220
Yeah, so there's a lot of exciting.

906
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:43,100
Oh, oh, oh, I guess this is sort of close.

907
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:49,580
San Fransokyo is starting to be built at California Venture as well.

908
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,980
There's the first signs of some construction.

909
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,420
Yeah, they drained the lagoon.

910
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,220
So they drained.

911
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,140
Dry lagoon, everybody.

912
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,900
You think the universe is doing stuff?

913
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,900
Universal, you have a whole new theme park?

914
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,020
Well, yeah, well, guess what?

915
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,380
We have a dry lagoon.

916
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,380
Take a look at that.

917
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:07,500
You can't have a future wet lagoon without a dry one.

918
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:13,500
You can't get the wet lagoon that was already there back and wet again without dry.

919
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,860
That is a Disney quote.

920
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:18,140
That's a Walt quote that they're going to put on the construction walls.

921
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:20,540
You can't have a wet lagoon before a dry one.

922
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:25,580
There's something that Walt Disney said that gave me a lot of comfort in the darkest days

923
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:26,380
of the pandemic.

924
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,460
Yeah, you can't have a dry lagoon.

925
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:32,540
Wait, you can't have a wet lagoon without he messed it up in his speech.

926
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:33,580
He could remember either.

927
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:37,180
So that's that covers the Disney news, right?

928
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:39,260
I think that might be all of it.

929
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,020
Some quick hits.

930
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:46,460
Right away, Railway is opening with everyone's favorite, a virtual queue at 7 a.m.

931
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:47,020
That's right.

932
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,220
Virtual queue, baby.

933
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,340
We're back.

934
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:52,780
Lord is Riser Resistance still virtual queue?

935
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:56,220
No, no, it's not lightning lane.

936
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,340
But is there a standby?

937
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:59,420
I think there's a standby.

938
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,100
So it's standby and lightning.

939
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:06,780
OK, the lightning lane, the tweets above funny lightning lane stuff I like, and sometimes

940
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,060
maybe it's being misrepresented.

941
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:11,980
I don't know, but it would be like the lightning lane for Big Thunder is 50 minutes long or

942
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:15,660
something and it's like stretched all the way back to Galaxy's Edge.

943
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:18,700
And you're like, that's not that seem like this is working very well.

944
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,740
Uh, it's all working fantastic.

945
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,980
All of these new terms that we've had to learn.

946
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:29,500
I was the one who was wrong in all of the episodes where I had to learn all the terms

947
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:33,020
because now the terms are terms that we love and terms that work.

948
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:33,520
Yeah.

949
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:36,380
Well, how could I have scoffed?

950
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,340
Genie plus lightning lane.

951
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:42,540
It's like they become part of the just the woodwork.

952
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:43,900
It's everything.

953
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:50,860
We love our magic key system, which is available for four hours or so several months ago.

954
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:56,620
And then you do not have the ability to pay Disney to be there all the time anymore.

955
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:56,940
No.

956
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,060
Well, I'll say this.

957
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:00,220
They put them on sale yesterday.

958
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,380
Again, we're showing everyone how the sausage is made.

959
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:06,300
So now you can figure out exactly when we're recording this, which is really exciting.

960
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:09,260
But they put magic keys on sale yesterday.

961
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:11,100
I'm back in the program, baby.

962
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:12,300
I did it.

963
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:13,100
I'm back.

964
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:13,660
You're back.

965
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:19,500
Now for this, I just had to scream grab the Scott Gustin tweets because I could not understand

966
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,420
what was happening.

967
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:26,140
It just seems so I mean, I already have one, but it already seemed like so confusing.

968
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:28,940
I just want to read this one verbatim.

969
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:31,980
New past sales are available online only.

970
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:37,420
Note new past sales will be paused each night at 10 p.m. Pacific time.

971
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:41,180
Guests will remain in the queue overnight as long as they

972
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:47,260
as long as they remain connected to the network and keep their browser window open.

973
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:51,420
Sales resume the following day at 9 a.m. Pacific time.

974
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:52,380
Here's the funny thing.

975
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:57,420
I read all of that and I didn't realize how absurd it was until you just read it again

976
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:59,100
because that is ridiculous.

977
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,540
You have to stay.

978
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:01,660
Queue is paused.

979
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:02,060
You have to camp out.

980
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:03,340
But it goes overnight.

981
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:05,660
You have to camp out by your computer.

982
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:08,380
First off, don't do this on a tablet or a phone.

983
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,020
Get a desktop or laptop.

984
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:15,420
And then put turn off all of the like sleep.

985
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,180
Put hard drive to sleep.

986
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:18,780
Put screen to sleep.

987
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:21,420
Just leave it on to use all your power.

988
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:21,740
Really?

989
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:22,300
Or the night?

990
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:24,620
Yeah, I don't think this is necessary.

991
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:26,620
It's a lot.

992
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:33,260
This is a we're describing a queue to get a pass to be just to have an it.

993
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:37,580
This is a thing that that we used to just you want when you get one.

994
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:38,220
Right.

995
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:44,060
And now you have to camp out all night digitally camp out in the metaverse.

996
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:47,020
Maybe that is what we talk about metaverse stuff.

997
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:49,820
Maybe that'll be the future where you have to camp out in the metaverse.

998
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:53,100
This is what we want the biggest best stuff.

999
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:59,420
Like now we are introducing digital tents for all of our devoted guests waiting in the

1000
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:00,380
digital queue.

1001
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:03,500
It'll be like the old days of like concert tickets where you'd have to camp out in front

1002
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,780
of tower records or something.

1003
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:07,900
We have enough digital tokens.

1004
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:10,300
You can get digital s'mores, right?

1005
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,060
Bring your own digital campfire.

1006
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,700
You got to get enough slurp juices to earn that annual pass.

1007
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,540
So that's the thing I know on the Internet.

1008
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:20,540
But I don't I consider myself reasonably tech savvy.

1009
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:25,660
Anytime I try to leave my computer running overnight to do an update or file transfer,

1010
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:27,260
I always fuck it up.

1011
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:32,860
So I don't know how they expect normal people to keep connected to.

1012
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:36,300
Okay, keep your browser open, but also be connected.

1013
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:41,420
You can't get disconnected, but I guess you can turn the screen brightness way down so

1014
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:43,660
you can if you're sleeping in the same room.

1015
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:49,820
Is the company just trying to see what they can make their the hard cores do?

1016
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:50,220
Kind of.

1017
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:53,500
Is it just like I mean, is it sort of like a weird?

1018
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:57,260
Is it like a humiliation kind of situation?

1019
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:58,780
Like, let's see what we can.

1020
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:01,660
Let's see how much of our guests time we can waste.

1021
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:02,700
Look, they're doing it.

1022
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,380
And they're doing that and they're doing that.

1023
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:11,740
I think they're I think they're getting off on like dominating dominating their audiences

1024
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:14,940
lives and making them do humiliating things all the time.

1025
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:17,500
Disney is our Dom is what you're saying.

1026
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:21,180
If you want to simplify it Dom tomorrow, I'm on to it.

1027
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:22,380
I'm on to his ski.

1028
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:26,940
Whatever stop using guest and just started calling us nasty pay pigs.

1029
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:31,420
You know, you found your next bio financial domination.

1030
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:33,020
I am not a pay pig, sir.

1031
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:36,220
Are you a messy little pay?

1032
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,500
Are you a messy little pay?

1033
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:40,860
Little messy pay pig, a little messy wooden pay pig.

1034
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:42,700
Only for the Walt Disney Company.

1035
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:45,500
There's also we're saying all this.

1036
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:52,060
There's like 20 empty ticket booths just right when you walk up to the Esplanade at Disneyland

1037
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:55,180
and like maybe one or two of them have people in them now.

1038
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:59,500
What there are those ticket booths for years like there were ticket booths

1039
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:01,740
right next to the La Brea bakery.

1040
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:02,620
No, they're still there.

1041
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:04,380
There's just closed.

1042
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:05,900
So it just looks like shit.

1043
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:09,180
I mean, I just went in the queue.

1044
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,300
The queue took one minute.

1045
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:12,460
There's still three passes available.

1046
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:15,340
So I guess they definitely opened up more.

1047
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:21,980
Whatever the the chapec limit was that's probably been at least expanded.

1048
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:27,020
Okay, so that's something I guess you can you can buy them online.

1049
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:32,220
So far from the orbit of when was the last year that things weren't like this?

1050
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:34,540
I feel it must have been when we started the show.

1051
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:36,540
Yeah, it's been like this when we started the show.

1052
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:38,220
I wouldn't have wanted to start the show.

1053
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:40,940
I hate this place.

1054
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:41,820
I'm never going again.

1055
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:46,540
That's the arc that's happened over this six years, whatever it is.

1056
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:49,900
It kind of had like I started to I am going soon by the way,

1057
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:53,660
but I like I'm not dying to get an annual pass at this.

1058
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:59,100
Like universal, I signed up for I took a little break, but I got right back to it.

1059
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:01,180
But I'm into I'm not.

1060
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:02,060
We all got it now.

1061
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:04,780
First time in years, we all have universal passes.

1062
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:06,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1063
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:09,740
Because they're what are they they're opening the place where you meet Mario.

1064
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:15,740
And it's open early and now and everybody's taking pictures and happy and power bands

1065
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:19,580
and one ups that's their headlines are all those words.

1066
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:28,060
Disney is all like systems and calendars and cues and loading and waiting and patience.

1067
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:31,100
Yeah, yes, that's true.

1068
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:35,340
We're all universal back in universal again.

1069
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:41,820
And even like obviously like price universal is not as good as Disneyland, but much cheaper

1070
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:43,980
and for a lot more perks.

1071
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:47,100
And I look I have free parking at universal.

1072
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:48,140
Yeah, I got free parking.

1073
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:52,940
Yes, yeah, it's not like a crazy upgrade to do it.

1074
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:59,100
It's still not the top tier that get like the mid tier gets you free parking.

1075
00:49:59,100 --> 00:49:59,500
Right.

1076
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:04,700
The other thing they're inadvertently doing by doing all these soft opening technical rehearsals

1077
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:11,500
for Nintendo land when annual pass holder previews kick in, you will be able to do

1078
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:17,500
most of the stuff in the land because people will have already seen it.

1079
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:20,380
I'm sure the annual pass previews will be plenty busy.

1080
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:21,260
Don't get me wrong.

1081
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:25,500
But it's like you're taking pieces off the board.

1082
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,060
Like, you know, there's going to be people like, oh, yeah, I went one day.

1083
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:28,540
I saw it.

1084
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:30,220
Now I don't have to go back for a while.

1085
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:33,740
They don't have to like just camp out in there for a long, long time.

1086
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:34,380
Yeah.

1087
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:34,780
Yeah.

1088
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:35,020
Yeah.

1089
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:39,500
My family, my family's planning on coming out like later in the year in the fall at some point.

1090
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:40,460
And it's like, oh, good.

1091
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:45,020
It'll probably be manageable and they'll be able to get into it, you know.

1092
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:47,180
And they don't have to wake up at 7 a.m.

1093
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:49,900
to reserve a pass to maybe get it.

1094
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:52,140
No, the 7 a.m. thing, too.

1095
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:57,580
If you live in Los Angeles, like you, you're really rolling the dice because it's like if

1096
00:50:57,580 --> 00:51:02,220
you get in the queue at 7 a.m. and it's like, okay, you're going on at 8 15.

1097
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:03,660
Like you have to floor it.

1098
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,020
And depending on where you live.

1099
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:05,180
Yeah.

1100
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:06,140
You might not get there.

1101
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:08,620
And yeah, it takes forever from the parking garage.

1102
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:10,780
Is it a virtual queue for Mario Kart, though?

1103
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:12,300
Or am I wrong?

1104
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:13,420
I don't know the answer to that.

1105
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:15,340
I think there's something like that for Mario Kart.

1106
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:16,460
Maybe I'm totally wrong.

1107
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:18,140
And credit where credit is due.

1108
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:21,500
The Universal Studios website does suck shit.

1109
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:22,060
Oh, yeah.

1110
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:25,260
It was so bad that they had to cancel the entire.

1111
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:26,620
Everybody got a mailer.

1112
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:31,500
If you live around here, there's a thing in the mail like, okay, so go to the website.

1113
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,500
At this time, we were mailed about this.

1114
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:39,740
And then you go there and it had crashed long before the a lot of time had even started.

1115
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:41,100
Yeah, no, they're never going to upgrade.

1116
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:44,380
None of these companies apparently will ever upgrade their theme park websites.

1117
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:51,020
But then I so a week later, it did go up and you guys seem to get in there easily.

1118
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:55,820
And I was very out of it and busy that day.

1119
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:57,340
So I really didn't understand.

1120
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:00,860
I thought you already had annual passes and that's how you're able to do this.

1121
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:02,860
And then I texted Mike the next day.

1122
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:05,020
I was like, what do I do?

1123
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:08,620
And he's like, just buy an annual pass and you can schedule a preview.

1124
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:09,500
And I did.

1125
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:14,540
And there was only a few days left, but it all worked and I got in.

1126
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:15,580
Now out of it and busy.

1127
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:21,500
Were you lost in a lollipop store or a chewable caramel store?

1128
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:25,580
No, it's funny that you say that because I right before I came here, I did do a thing.

1129
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:30,540
I don't want to say I do it every week, but every week CVS sends me $4.

1130
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:37,660
And if I don't have any $4 coupon, like they send me every week for whatever reason.

1131
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:39,660
I can send it to you in the mail?

1132
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:42,860
No, like an email and you add it in the app.

1133
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,700
Oh, but it's anything goes basically.

1134
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,380
It's just $4 off your purchase.

1135
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:47,420
Is there a minimum purchase?

1136
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:48,860
No.

1137
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:49,340
Really?

1138
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:51,340
I mean, I have not.

1139
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:54,620
I think I spent under $4.

1140
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:55,740
I don't know why I got this.

1141
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:58,380
Maybe because I have like pick up prescriptions there.

1142
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:00,140
Class action lawsuit or something you involved in?

1143
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:05,020
I don't think so, but every Thursday they say $4 coupon.

1144
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:08,620
And if I don't need anything at CVS that week and I'm going by one,

1145
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:11,340
I usually just go in and buy $4 worth of candy.

1146
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:18,300
Did that happen on the day where you just described being out of it and busy?

1147
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:20,060
No, that didn't happen.

1148
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:20,380
Okay.

1149
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:21,580
Can you send me?

1150
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:23,980
I'll tell you, but I did get a symphony bar.

1151
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:25,020
Whoa, symphony bar.

1152
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:26,380
Symphony bars are back.

1153
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:27,180
They're really pushing.

1154
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:29,020
Mr. Fancy over here.

1155
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:30,060
Extra large size.

1156
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:32,620
Little wooden symphony boy.

1157
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:33,980
Do you conduct with that thing?

1158
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:34,860
Symphony boy.

1159
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:38,940
I just remember that they had a pretty aggressive push in the early 90s.

1160
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:41,740
Can you send me the email where you get $4 off from CVS?

1161
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:44,220
Because I'm seeing get $4 off your $20 purchase.

1162
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:45,100
I don't get that.

1163
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,300
I want to see what it looks like.

1164
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,180
I'll send it to you.

1165
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:47,740
Yeah, for sure.

1166
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:48,940
Yeah, find it right now and send it to me.

1167
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:49,900
You mean now?

1168
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:50,540
I do mean now.

1169
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:51,980
Mike means now.

1170
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:52,540
I mean, no.

1171
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:53,820
He doesn't mean later.

1172
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:57,260
Yeah, we got to dissect this online because I want to know how you're getting this.

1173
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:59,100
I have no idea.

1174
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:01,500
I want to buy a symphony bar for free.

1175
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,660
I want to get a comped symphony bar.

1176
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:05,900
A weekly comp symphony bar.

1177
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:07,020
Or is it an accident?

1178
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:08,160
To me.

1179
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:11,740
You're like on some, I don't, what would it be?

1180
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:14,620
Jason was the one billionth customer of CVS.

1181
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:17,100
He won the golden ticket.

1182
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:19,500
Well, the golden ticket is $4 a week.

1183
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:21,980
So he's a little Charlie Bucket boy.

1184
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:30,060
That is like $4 a week for, that's like, they're giving you a couple hundred bucks a year.

1185
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:30,940
Yeah, wait a minute.

1186
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:33,020
Yeah, do you have to start reporting this on your taxes?

1187
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:34,380
Yeah, I don't know.

1188
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:35,340
This is like a job.

1189
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:38,860
You earn a salary from CVS without having to work there.

1190
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:41,180
Did you do some sort of testing for them?

1191
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:43,580
I don't know.

1192
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:44,300
You're, oh, okay.

1193
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:45,260
This one's 20%.

1194
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:48,380
It's to make up for they gave him the wrong prescription one time.

1195
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:50,780
It caused him brain damage and they knew it.

1196
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:53,100
It's why he's forgetting everything lately.

1197
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:54,060
Yeah, but.

1198
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:58,380
I think we might, are we going to reveal that you're not actually getting $4 off

1199
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:00,140
and that you've been misreading the coupons?

1200
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:03,500
I wouldn't even tell you if I was just buying my regular candy a lot.

1201
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:04,300
No, I know, but I'm saying.

1202
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:05,020
I don't even need this candy.

1203
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:06,620
I got stocking stuffers still.

1204
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:08,620
No, I know you don't need the candy.

1205
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:11,420
I'm just saying, is it possible you're misreading the coupon

1206
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:15,980
and you haven't been getting the discount and somehow you're paying?

1207
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:17,740
No, no, because they say, oh, you have $4.

1208
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:22,380
Now there's a couple things happening here.

1209
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:26,220
There's Mike wanting to discredit Jason, but I think it's all, it's jealousy.

1210
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:27,740
Yes, it is jealousy.

1211
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:33,660
There is a big deal happening that is being pulled by somebody in this room.

1212
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:33,820
Yes.

1213
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:36,540
And you're baffled that you haven't achieved it yourself.

1214
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:37,580
That is absolutely.

1215
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:39,100
It's like 25%.

1216
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:44,940
I'd love Jason to have misread it and it's an accident and he's been shoplifting for years.

1217
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:51,820
I would love that, but mostly I'm just like, I'm up $4 free to CVS every week.

1218
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:52,140
Geez.

1219
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:56,780
You're playing in the, you're paying, you're playing the penny slots with all of your like.

1220
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:57,100
Yeah.

1221
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:00,700
With your 300 emails a day about deals on toys you don't want.

1222
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:01,420
Oh yeah.

1223
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:01,820
Yeah.

1224
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:03,500
So I'm fascinated by this.

1225
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:04,780
This is, I'm, this is exciting.

1226
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:06,220
I'm surprised you didn't tell me this earlier.

1227
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:13,660
While everyone goes through their emails, we've insanely late in the episode.

1228
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:16,060
We should say one of the other big announcements.

1229
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:16,620
Oh yeah.

1230
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:21,980
Switch back to the universal side because they have announced a Las Vegas experience.

1231
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:22,860
Yes.

1232
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:27,660
That is the, the opposite end of the spectrum of the family place in Texas.

1233
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:32,940
This is a year round horror experience just north of the strip.

1234
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,220
Totally radical, completely new idea.

1235
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:36,860
Yes.

1236
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:44,380
This is part of a 20 acre expansion of area 15, which already has like a lot of weird,

1237
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:52,300
like immersive stuff and restaurants and the Omega Mart, the I Wolf's Omega Mart.

1238
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:57,340
Now here's where I need to say I've never heard of area 15 until this news broke.

1239
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:58,300
Were you guys familiar with it?

1240
00:56:58,300 --> 00:56:58,700
I didn't know.

1241
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:00,780
Did you know area 15?

1242
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:02,700
I heard of Omega Mart, but I didn't know about this.

1243
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:02,940
Yeah.

1244
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:03,180
Yeah.

1245
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:04,700
Same district.

1246
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:08,940
Well, I, for the, because for the last few years I've been a little Vegas boy.

1247
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:09,260
Okay.

1248
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,100
I've been a little gambling boy too.

1249
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:18,380
So it was big deal when area 15 because it's a massive like development.

1250
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:21,100
It's really close to the strip, but is off strip.

1251
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:21,820
Have you been?

1252
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:22,860
I have not been.

1253
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:26,780
No, it is not a big enough deal to go, but a big deal.

1254
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:31,020
Well, the last time we were there, it was Jane's birthday and she's like, I really,

1255
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:33,660
I don't want to go see a themed experience.

1256
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:35,900
I don't want to, I really don't want to do this.

1257
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:36,460
What?

1258
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:37,740
All right.

1259
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:41,420
But the next time we go, we have said like, that's the first thing we're going to go see

1260
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:44,140
Omega Mart and it's been getting good reviews.

1261
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:44,460
Yeah.

1262
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:47,900
Omega Mart sounds very cool and like something we should do this.

1263
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:51,580
I didn't know any of this thing that has been there since September,

1264
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:55,820
2020 and it's this really odd grab bag.

1265
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:57,420
Now here's, I'm, I'm curious.

1266
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:00,940
We now get back into indoor with all this.

1267
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:01,180
Right.

1268
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:08,700
I'm really curious how this thing is and how it will go forward and succeed for a long time.

1269
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:15,100
So it's, there's, there's this Omega Mart thing, this sort of like trippy immersive experience,

1270
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:19,980
lost spirits distillery, which we've grown is cool in LA, but a closing LA, I believe.

1271
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:22,540
They had a fire, I believe.

1272
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:23,260
Oh boy.

1273
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:23,740
I don't know.

1274
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:25,020
So they might still be an opera.

1275
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:25,820
I don't know.

1276
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:27,100
They did have a boat tour.

1277
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:28,940
They did have a themed like.

1278
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:29,500
Yeah.

1279
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:30,380
Boat ride.

1280
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:31,020
Yes.

1281
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:31,260
Yeah.

1282
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:33,020
Wish we could have done it.

1283
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:33,740
We should have done it.

1284
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:36,300
I think we were invited to it and then there was a fire.

1285
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:39,100
I think Doug Jones got us tickets to it and we didn't do it.

1286
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:39,420
Oh no.

1287
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:40,220
That's what happened.

1288
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:43,580
We had Doug, if you're listening, apologies for, we didn't jump on it.

1289
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:43,900
Right.

1290
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:44,220
Right.

1291
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:45,260
We had time.

1292
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:49,660
But yeah, then there's all these VR rides and there's something called

1293
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:56,620
Birdly where you lie in your chest and there's big bird wings under your arms that flap.

1294
00:58:56,620 --> 00:59:00,860
So you get so with VR goggles, it's like you're flying like a bird.

1295
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:04,940
And then there's also a zip line thing, but where you hold onto it onto handlebars.

1296
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:08,540
So it's sort of like hang gliding, but that moves through the middle of this

1297
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:08,940
campus.

1298
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:09,820
It's all of these odd.

1299
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:12,620
You could buy packages seemingly to do a bunch of them.

1300
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:12,940
Right.

1301
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:16,860
But also you could just piecemeal these experiences.

1302
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:21,340
There's something called Wink World.

1303
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:27,100
Wink World is of course, a psychedelic art house created by Chris Wink.

1304
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:32,060
I needn't tell you that Chris Wink from Wink World is one of the original Blue Men,

1305
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:33,420
one of the first men.

1306
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:39,500
And he's now the chief creative officer of Blue Man Group and he has spun off the very strong

1307
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,740
Wink brand into Wink World.

1308
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:44,060
So we got to check out Wink World.

1309
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:45,100
You have to check.

1310
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:47,820
I mean, this 2023 they're saying is the year of the Wink.

1311
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:51,660
So we're definitely going to cover more on the show this year.

1312
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:53,420
A lot of we promise more Wink.

1313
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:58,620
I also knew, I mean, I was, I had read about area 15 for the Omega Mart

1314
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:04,780
installation, but I also was delighted to learn they have a location of EMAC and Bolio's,

1315
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:13,900
the Boston based ice cream establishment that is, but kind of was more fun in the

1316
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:16,140
Hard Rock Hotel at Universal Orlando.

1317
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:22,220
And I think the thing is a lot of musicians would stop in the one in Boston.

1318
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:23,340
I think it was open late.

1319
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:26,220
So after shows, they're like, what's open?

1320
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:31,740
And this is, it kind of has like a Ben and Jerry sort of vibe, but it's good ice cream.

1321
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:35,900
So that will be my second stop after Omega Mart.

1322
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:38,140
You're not going to Wink World first?

1323
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:40,220
I mean, I'll check out Wink World.

1324
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:41,580
Big dis of Wink.

1325
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:45,580
Blue Man Group in Manhattan, like 20 years ago or something in their

1326
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:47,180
lot's changed.

1327
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:47,340
Yeah.

1328
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:48,940
What have you done for Wink lately?

1329
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:52,380
Wink wasn't the chief creative officer of Blue Man Group by that back then.

1330
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:55,820
I, well, I've got to look into the Wink.

1331
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:57,820
I will look into the Wink brand.

1332
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:58,860
It's really, doesn't it?

1333
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:01,260
Cause it's the, it's the format of Disneyland.

1334
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:06,220
Disneyland opens and Walt Disney is one of the primary celebrities on earth.

1335
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:09,100
And now we have Wink World and it's the same deal.

1336
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:09,980
It's Chris Wink.

1337
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:11,020
We all know Chris Wink.

1338
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:11,580
Yeah.

1339
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:12,060
Same deal.

1340
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:17,980
And also now here's, let's get really topical with, okay.

1341
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:21,260
This episode comes out on January.

1342
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:23,420
Wait a minute.

1343
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:24,380
No, it's out on the 20th.

1344
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:24,940
Oh, wait a minute.

1345
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:27,340
This is, I think maybe the night that you're, you're hearing this.

1346
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:33,100
If okay, if the episode comes out January 20th, then tonight, if you're in the Vegas area,

1347
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:38,460
you can go to this area of 15 and you can experience something called Shrek rave.

1348
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:40,460
Shrek themed rave.

1349
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:41,820
Oh, I've heard about these.

1350
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:43,260
You've heard about the Shrek raves?

1351
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:46,060
Yeah. I think this is a thing that's happening throughout the country.

1352
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:46,380
Yeah.

1353
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:48,140
This is a trend that's sweeping the nation.

1354
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:48,700
That's right.

1355
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:49,260
Yeah.

1356
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:51,180
It's, is there a company that's doing it or?

1357
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:55,580
Uh, I don't know that this might be an independent Shrek rave.

1358
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:59,820
I don't know if there's a, uh, one conglomerate behind the Shrek raves.

1359
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:01,340
The poster says it's dumb.

1360
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:02,620
Just come have fun.

1361
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:04,220
And cool is dead.

1362
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:04,940
Who cares?

1363
01:02:05,740 --> 01:02:08,300
I mean, I can't argue with either of those statements.

1364
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:09,900
So there's a Shrek rave.

1365
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:11,980
Yeah. Is that, wait, this one's in Riverside.

1366
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:15,820
There's a Riverside on the 27th Shrek rave.

1367
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:18,780
Could this be the same Shrek rave or is it a different one?

1368
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:21,820
Is this an organic movement across the country?

1369
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:22,780
That's a good question.

1370
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:25,820
Well, if you want to go to a Shrek rave.

1371
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:28,380
Yeah, I think maybe a Shrek rave.

1372
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:30,300
Wow. This is good.

1373
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:34,060
There's a couple different, there was a thing and I can't think of the name of it now,

1374
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:39,820
but there were like these traveling raves that I think I would mention when Eva was here last.

1375
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:45,260
One of them seemed to be like, I'm trying to think, maybe that was more of an avatar,

1376
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:46,940
like a generic avatar rave.

1377
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:51,500
But it wasn't for the vibe, but it wasn't affiliated with the enterprise.

1378
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:53,740
I can't remember if they had like a specific Shrek rave.

1379
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:58,060
I don't think they did, but it looks like Shrek rave is a common thing right now.

1380
01:02:58,060 --> 01:03:03,980
Wow. Well, here we got to, I'm, I'm, I'm myself, I'm nervous about this.

1381
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:06,380
Not really caring for Shrek or raves.

1382
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:08,620
Mike, on the other hand, I don't know your feelings about Shrek,

1383
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:11,180
but I know your feelings about douchey Vegas pool party.

1384
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:11,740
That's correct.

1385
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:14,140
So you'll be in, you'll be in hog heaven.

1386
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:16,620
Donkey heaven.

1387
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:17,420
Yeah.

1388
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:20,060
Yeah. No, I love that. I said that.

1389
01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:24,460
Are these, is it going to be like, I'm a believer remix and all-star remix?

1390
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:26,780
It better only be those Rufus Wainwright,

1391
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:27,500
how you're here.

1392
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:27,980
Yeah.

1393
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:29,820
Better be only Shrek rave,

1394
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:31,500
yul song, whatever that was.

1395
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:33,980
Right. Shrek rave, you buy tickets on Ticketmaster.

1396
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:36,060
Wow.

1397
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:40,140
$22 for GA standing at the Riverside Shrek rave.

1398
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:45,180
So I can go, I can go to a Shrek themed rave and give my money to Ticketmaster.

1399
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:49,020
Well, so the ticket costs as much as the fees.

1400
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:50,140
Nice, nice, nice.

1401
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:50,700
Wow.

1402
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,540
Only $400.

1403
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:55,980
I'm going to the next stage to see how much the fees are for the Shrek rave.

1404
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:59,740
Oh, the app has redirected me to the website as all good apps do.

1405
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:03,660
Yep. As our beloved theme park apps do.

1406
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:07,420
And I'm going to see, yeah, well, because $22 relatively cheap for a ticket.

1407
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:12,700
They're trying to give us, oh, do you want to buy fast lane access to the Shrek rave

1408
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:16,060
or VIP club access to the Shrek rave for $25?

1409
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:18,620
This is, the Disney people would be salivating.

1410
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:21,420
These are the kind of upshot, this is the,

1411
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:24,620
why can't Disneyland think like the Shrek raves?

1412
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:28,940
God damn it. They've got Shrek in First Go Texas and they got Shrek traveling the country.

1413
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:32,700
What the fuck has Mickey done lately? What has he done for me lately?

1414
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:36,860
Real pandemic in Shrek. Shrek is popping up everywhere.

1415
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:38,460
Everyone's getting infected.

1416
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:43,820
Each ticket is a $9 fee. It's $22 and then $9 service fee.

1417
01:04:43,820 --> 01:04:44,540
Could be worse.

1418
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:44,780
Okay.

1419
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:45,420
Could be worse.

1420
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:48,780
Well, and the fact that you're making progress with this, this is, but you know,

1421
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:53,500
it's not the Taylor situation. I guess Shrek raves aren't as popular as Taylor Swift.

1422
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:54,140
Not yet.

1423
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:54,620
Yeah.

1424
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:58,380
On the way though. Anyway, what's Universal doing over here?

1425
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:03,980
They are doing unique, immersive, fantastic horror centric experiences

1426
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:09,100
along with daytime food and beverage spaces that will turn into haunting bars and eateries by night.

1427
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:12,300
So I don't, well, that seems like they don't know. So it's just,

1428
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:15,420
it's a restaurant during the day. Then they put up some cobwebs.

1429
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:16,780
Yeah, I guess that's what it is.

1430
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:24,220
On this blog, Vital Vegas that I was reading, I've read Vegas stuff on, they point out that like,

1431
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:31,420
look, Vegas is a lot of people in town, a lot of people spending money. So it kind of makes sense.

1432
01:05:31,420 --> 01:05:37,020
On the other hand, the fear of the walking dead attraction at the Fremont street experience

1433
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:42,940
and Eli Roth's Goratorium on the strip did not really last very long.

1434
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:44,940
No, Eli Roth's Goratorium.

1435
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:47,500
How were the reviews of the Goratorium?

1436
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:50,460
I don't know. We'll have to go back in there. It's like 10 years ago.

1437
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:52,380
That opened and closed.

1438
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:57,900
Interesting. Because like it sounds, I bet that the escape rooms that they've been doing

1439
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:01,500
at CityWalk Orlando, that's sort of maybe a soft test for...

1440
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:05,420
A lot of the commenters on this blog have been like, they just opened escape rooms.

1441
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:07,420
And I have to think that's easy to clone.

1442
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:09,580
I've heard good reviews of the Back to the Future one.

1443
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:15,500
And then there are like bar areas, themed bar areas that are part of this as well,

1444
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:16,700
the Orlando escape rooms.

1445
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:21,980
The Coconut Club is by that? Like this thing at CityWalk that it's a bar, but they keep

1446
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:25,820
changing it for every season. It was like Halloween, then it was Christmas.

1447
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:29,180
So I wonder, yeah, if it's going to be like a highly themed restaurant bar

1448
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:34,700
and then they can like shuffle in and out like mazes and stuff.

1449
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:36,940
Sure. They got a tooth. I mean, they could build a tooth.

1450
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:39,740
So they certainly could build a tooth.

1451
01:06:39,740 --> 01:06:42,620
They have 110,000 square feet they're working with.

1452
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:44,140
That is a lot of space. I was going to say though,

1453
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:46,540
toothsome probably doesn't fit the horror.

1454
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:49,900
Toothsome, I think they might want to keep like wholesome.

1455
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:51,260
Sure.

1456
01:06:51,260 --> 01:06:58,940
You know, you don't want to drag the mythology of Dr. Toothsome and Jacques and the dog.

1457
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:00,540
Yes, these are characters we love.

1458
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:03,820
Yeah. So you don't want them to be like dismembered. We don't want that.

1459
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:08,620
You couldn't make them go through the motions and the plot of Freaky

1460
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:12,460
because they would just continue to be delightful if they swapped bodies.

1461
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:14,940
It would be, yeah. No. Wait, what is Freaky?

1462
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:15,440
Freaky?

1463
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:21,040
That's the horror Freaky Friday with Vince Vaughn and a teenage girl.

1464
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:24,640
Vince Vaughn is a serial killer and he swaps bodies with a teenage girl.

1465
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:25,920
That's a couple years ago already?

1466
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:30,000
Pretty recent. Yeah. I think it was at one of the horror nights.

1467
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:31,920
There was a maze?

1468
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:37,360
It's a Blumhouse movie. I think it was in one of the Blumhouse houses.

1469
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:39,920
Oh, it was like represented in the Blumhouse.

1470
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:42,560
Okay. We've slept on Freaky.

1471
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:44,000
We slept on Freaky.

1472
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:50,320
Goratorium, which was, this was open in 2013. It filed for chapter 11 after facing,

1473
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:54,640
it was open for a year, faced complaints of high prices and poor customer service.

1474
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:59,920
And it was sued by a design firm who alleged they had not been paid for work done on

1475
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:01,920
Goratorium's branding and website.

1476
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:06,000
Seemed like there might've been other problems with the Goratorium other than just interest.

1477
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,600
I guess Vegas doesn't like themed experiences.

1478
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:12,000
Goratorium proves it once and for all.

1479
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:18,240
I, the coverage of a lot of new development in Vegas, new entertainment stuff is like

1480
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:20,720
they're slapping immersive on anything.

1481
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:24,320
Yeah. That's a, it's a trendy thing. But this, I feel like the same thing will have,

1482
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:31,360
like if this is done well, because like, because the horror nights mazes are often done very well,

1483
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:36,640
but they're temporary. So if you could put up even more like highly themed version of these,

1484
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:40,960
that's a little more permanent because they don't have to like pull it down to reassemble

1485
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:45,760
a new thing. I mean, I don't know. People love this shit. And I've been saying for a long time,

1486
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:49,520
I'm not sure why they don't, they had that walking dead maze, but before that was,

1487
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:54,480
it was house of horrors. I'm not sure why they don't have like some more like permanent horror

1488
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:59,600
nights things, but I guess this makes sense to do it in Vegas. I think it's a strong idea.

1489
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:05,680
The concept art that they released, I mean, there's like, you know, actually there's like the

1490
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:11,120
concept art with shadowy monsters emerging from the smoky depths, but then there's

1491
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:17,600
the physical plant concept art and seeing a huge building that says universal on the side,

1492
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:25,520
right off the main freeway. That's cool. I, that, that sounds cool. That'll be eye catching. I also

1493
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:32,240
think these regional experiences maybe get people excited about the universal brand who were not

1494
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:37,280
before and maybe make some, want to try going to Hollywood or Orlando. Yeah. I mean, if they could

1495
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:43,760
do something that's even a little longer too, cause those mazes at horror nights, you know,

1496
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:50,320
they're not super short, but they're just, you're just rolling, like you're walking so fast through

1497
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:53,920
those things. Cause they're trying to just get people in and out. If you could like slow it down

1498
01:09:53,920 --> 01:10:00,240
even a little bit and you could appreciate it more like, like a delusion or something. Yeah.

1499
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:05,600
In between the regular maze and like a delusion, which is more of a narrative, like you could do

1500
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:10,400
some pretty cool stuff. And again, I think it all comes down to just like, is it good?

1501
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:15,680
Yeah. Yeah. Just do they pull these off? Do they spend the money? Do they, they commit?

1502
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:21,520
Yeah. But it seems like the company that's doing that right now. Yeah. So that, yeah, that is cool.

1503
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:25,440
Does this, uh, did it say when that opens potentially? I don't think so. And we got

1504
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:30,160
that in the far-ish future. I think they're both a little far out. Yeah. Yeah. But that one's

1505
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:36,000
seemingly would be easier to construct. I would think, but who knows? Yeah. Um, meanwhile,

1506
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:42,160
Epcot has opened figments inspiration station, a place to stand in a line to get popcorn buckets.

1507
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:50,960
There are chunks of the original journey into, uh, imagination, like little stuff on display there

1508
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:58,000
museum, as if it were, as it were a Pelford civilization. Oh, and then there's a light show

1509
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:05,200
with the spaceship earth ball and sometimes it flashes figments colors. Wow. So that's much

1510
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:12,880
better than fixing what has been, uh, one of the bottom five rides maybe on earth for the last

1511
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:19,760
20 years. Yeah. Uh, so there's that, um, I haven't thought unless you guys have any more to say,

1512
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:25,200
I, uh, going back to the Texas universal park, I think, you know, it's potentially very promising.

1513
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:31,360
Uh, it seems like it could be very fun, but let me pose this question as a thought exercise. Yeah.

1514
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:36,240
And I'm sure we agree this would be better, but what would here, let me just present it.

1515
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:44,720
If they did this 25 years ago, we wouldn't be getting dream works, Shrek stuff. We would be

1516
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:52,240
getting more of the classic universal, but kid rides. Uh huh. Uh huh. So I'm, I pose the question

1517
01:11:52,880 --> 01:12:00,080
what little kid versions of classic universal rides would we want in this park? Little backdraft,

1518
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:05,600
little backdraft. You put on, you get to put on little fire helmets and blast with a hoe. Like

1519
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:11,200
the thing that you liked where you save Santa's house from a fire in Santa's village. Right.

1520
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:16,000
Little backdrop. And you may, but I think you keep it all the same too, where you, there's also an

1521
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:21,920
intro from little Ron Howard. Okay, great. They get a little red haired kid, turn around in a little

1522
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:27,520
director's hat. That's good. Talk about how little movies are made. Right. Well, you know,

1523
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:33,920
Cinderella man. I get ready to meet Cinderella kid. Was Cinderella man in the parks?

1524
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:40,960
Cinderella man is not in the parks, but it is a notable poster on the studio tour that always

1525
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:47,360
stuck out to me. Cause I was like, did Cinderella man make a big impression and did it make money?

1526
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:53,520
So you're saying this poster will be in this hypothetical 25 years ago. It's a roller coaster.

1527
01:12:54,240 --> 01:13:01,280
Child boxing experience. It's a ride. It's a coaster with so many inversions that it makes

1528
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:08,400
you delirious. Like you're a boxer who just got hit in the head a bunch. Okay. And it's for children.

1529
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:16,640
Yeah. It's sort of like the Jedi training academy at the Disney parks, but it teaches you how to

1530
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:22,320
do a cigarette punch, which is where, uh, if you're a guy, it seems like he wants to fight,

1531
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:26,800
you try to make peace and you offer him a cigarette. And then when, cause when people

1532
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:31,840
put a cigarette in the mouth, they inevitably open their mouth. So as he's doing that, you uppercut

1533
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:37,200
him under the jaw and he breaks a bunch of teeth. Is this something you learn in the movie Cinderella

1534
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:45,680
man? No, I learned this in a Jack Reacher book. Too violent for the movies. I, uh, maybe the Amazon

1535
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:52,560
show might have it. Is this something that was named by Jack Reacher author or is this something

1536
01:13:52,560 --> 01:14:01,040
child child? Yes. I don't know. I feel like this is like a street fighting. Like this is like a,

1537
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:05,840
I'm sure it's a tough guys have been doing this move. I just wonder if the cigarette punch has

1538
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:11,200
sort of been like branded before that. I don't know. I don't know. I mean, so we have little

1539
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,960
backdraft, little Cinderella man. That's a great start.

1540
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:22,480
20 years ago, they were still pushing for what he would. Yeah. There would be a giant

1541
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:28,480
nut house coaster if this was 25 years ago. For sure. Yeah. All that stuff. Um, there would

1542
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:34,800
definitely be little, I love Lucy babies. There would be, they would be like Muppet babies,

1543
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:39,760
but the I love Lucy and there would be like Lucy attribute, but they'd all be babies. Uh,

1544
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:45,920
it would all be baby versions. We've made a decision here, which is that that unilaterally

1545
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:52,000
it is baby versions of movies that they have property. Yeah. We all decided on that,

1546
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:58,640
which is, I don't think what they're going to do in Frisco. However, um, that maybe they should.

1547
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:03,280
Well, it makes sense. These are adults. I love Lucy's an adult property. So it'd have to be

1548
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:08,080
kidified and what better way to do it by just adding babies to it. So I love Lucy babies,

1549
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:13,680
little backdraft. Well, I like the idea that the I love Lucy gang all met when they were little,

1550
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:18,960
like that Flintstones cartoon implied. Oh, I liked that cartoon. I remember that.

1551
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:25,360
Cartoon. You liked the Flintstones babies. Yeah. I liked it. Okay. I got to see my

1552
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:30,720
favorite characters as kids. Was there a Scooby Doo one? Yeah, there was. I forget the name of it.

1553
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:35,120
A pup named Scooby Doo. Oh yeah. A pup named Scooby. So yeah, I love Lucy. It would have been

1554
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:39,440
perfect with this. Um, so yeah, I mean, there would have to be back to the future.

1555
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:50,800
Little vertigo. Yeah. A child obsessed with what would he be? He wouldn't be obsessed with like

1556
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:55,840
making a woman look like his dead wife or girlfriend. He would be obsessed with something

1557
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:00,720
like making a, uh, making a teddy bear look like a different teddy bear.

1558
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:10,480
Yes. Okay. So little vertigo is a little boy loses his teddy bear and then he gets a new

1559
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:14,800
teddy bear, but he's obsessed with the old teddy bear. So he keeps taking the teddy bear to like

1560
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:22,000
build a bear and he's like making demands. It's like, no, the fur isn't right. The fur isn't right

1561
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:29,680
part the fur here. Die the fur darker brown. It's not right. Now where this dress,

1562
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:36,320
where this dress bear stunningly accurate baby. Yeah. It's what a baby sounds like.

1563
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:40,720
That's exactly what your baby sounds. Yeah. She's talking already.

1564
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:50,080
Five months. Oh, dude. Go, go, go, go. So what's crazy about that? Beloved SNL character. Oh yeah.

1565
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:55,840
A brief run on Nick at night too. Totally perplexing. Mr. Bill was on Nick at night.

1566
01:16:55,840 --> 01:17:01,840
Yeah. I don't remember that Scott. Do you remember that? Um, no. Oh really? You're a huge Mr. Bill

1567
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:09,040
fan. It's weird. I, I even, I remember the, the pizza hut character that was ripped off from Mr.

1568
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:15,360
Bill. I remember that. Sure. Um, so well, yeah, that's okay. Little vertigo that closes it out,

1569
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:22,720
I guess, as far as ideas. I mean, yeah, they were pushing Apollo 13. Yeah. I, you know,

1570
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:27,280
you don't even have to like babyify it could just be like, well, you know, it's the, the,

1571
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:34,880
what would have been the title is Apollo 13 and a half. That's good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What about,

1572
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:38,880
this is made for that straight to video. They should, they could do that today. The Munsters

1573
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:44,400
division does a half. Well, this is what I want. I want somebody to send me a list of what they got

1574
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:49,760
and just add a half to some of these titles. There was also a horror movie. Bring it on.

1575
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:56,800
Was it on? Yeah. That was on sci-fi channel. Yeah. Do you know what it was called? Uh, I can look it

1576
01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:02,720
up. Okay. Bring it on horror movie. So this is a thing that's happening is a horror rising of,

1577
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:12,960
I guess more benign properties of 2000s era. Bring it on colon cheer or die. Really? Okay. I don't

1578
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:21,040
know if it's in Canon. Okay. We're getting very fractional with our reboots. Yeah. Really. Um,

1579
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:26,560
so Apollo 13 and a half, um, Missy Pyle plays the principal. Okay. Fun.

1580
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:33,440
Are we still recording? I think we've died.

1581
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:40,640
I think so. I think there's actual. What was it? Missy Pyle plays the principal. That's right. Yes.

1582
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:47,840
Yes. Very good, sweet Jason. Now enter eternal bliss. Uh, Tron light cycle run officially opening

1583
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:55,040
April 4th at Disney World. We're still doing that. That actually is happening. Tiana's place

1584
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:59,040
replacing the French market, which has seemed like an out of date cafeteria for a long time,

1585
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:04,080
although the food's been fairly solid. It's okay. Yeah. Food's okay there. Is that the list?

1586
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:11,600
You got anything else? Oh, happily ever after is coming back. Uh, harmonious ends April 2nd

1587
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:18,240
and Epcot forever is back on April 3rd. So a lot of what Disney's rolling out is this thing's back.

1588
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:25,440
We did not come up with a suitable replacement. So this thing's back. Okay. But my question really,

1589
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:31,440
where's the coupon? Oh wait, the coupon hasn't been produced in all this time.

1590
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:36,960
Well, look, he had a list to go through. Oh yeah. That's true. I have, uh, lost my email.

1591
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:43,680
I guess Scott rapid. Oh, I've lost. I happen to have lost my email. One, if you get one coupon a

1592
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:48,480
week, this should be the easiest search in the world. They usually come on. Well, no, cause I

1593
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:54,640
delete. I've been trying to like get space back on Gmail. So we're fascinating. Deleting the paper

1594
01:19:54,640 --> 01:20:00,160
trail. Is it in the trash? Reminds me of how our government officials just keep finding documents.

1595
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:05,600
So where did these documents show up in, uh, in, in my home? Biden was holding a bunch of

1596
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:12,240
$4 coupons to CVS in his home. That's what they found. We're onto him and we're onto you. Uh,

1597
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:16,080
wait, you don't have the most recent, what's not Thursday yet. Wait a minute. The date is very

1598
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:21,120
convenient too. It's Wednesday. So you should have tomorrow's coupon. Huh? You should have

1599
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:28,720
come in on Thursday. What time? Can't follow up question. Can Mike be in your house when it

1600
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:34,160
shows up between midnight and 6 AM? I get the email. Then I have to activate it. Okay. And then

1601
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:41,120
it goes, uh, so by the time this episode comes out, we will be able to, on our Twitter post a photo

1602
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:47,520
of your $4 CVS coupon. And I think, I think he has to produce that and the purchase,

1603
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:52,400
whatever the purchase was, we need to know what you got with the $4 candy. Here is an older one.

1604
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:58,800
Okay. Okay. Yeah. The $4. No, this is a receipt. You can see the $4 off in this receipt. That's

1605
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:02,800
close, but not quite what I'm looking for. You get emails with your receipts. Well, yeah,

1606
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:06,960
cause you can select it. You can't select. You don't get those crazy long receipts anymore. You

1607
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:11,200
can just get your receipts. But the crazy long receipts are so much fun. I mean, print them out

1608
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:15,440
and then you got a fun paper scarf to wear. I'm going to walk over and look at this, look at this

1609
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:19,120
receipt to just see what it even says. See if I can discern. Oh, I just forward it to you. Okay.

1610
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:26,240
I was moving, but okay. You guys sort out the physical, uh, you can see there's a $4 receipt.

1611
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:31,120
There's a $1 off a Hallmark card. I was buying Christmas cards. Okay. Yeah. Scott, you can

1612
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:37,120
wrap it up. Okay. Okay. Everyone get everything into position that you need to, but, but for now

1613
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:42,720
you survived podcast, the ride, uh, you can find us on the socials at podcast, the ride,

1619
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:14,880
invented Jason's coupon situation. Well, it does say, I'm looking at his receipt now.

1620
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:20,560
He bought a shoe box birthday card, because he also had a dollar off Hallmark coupon.

1621
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:27,120
And then he bought a Hershey Kit Kat crisp wafer, dark chocolate. And it does say, uh,

1622
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:31,520
on the discount, there's four discounts applied. So he stacked discounts, which I love to see

1623
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:37,520
2% back in extra bucks, 2% back in extra bucks, $4 off your purchase, then a dollar off Hallmark

1624
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:44,160
coupon. So it does say $4 off your purchase. It's just, I'm how I don't understand how you

1625
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:48,480
would get such a good deal with no strings attached. I don't either. Wow. And how long

1626
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:56,240
have you been getting this? I would say at least six months, not a year. Okay. Well, this is,

1627
01:22:56,240 --> 01:23:01,040
this is opening up Jason to such scrutiny. People are going to start like, uh, showing up,

1628
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:06,320
like trying to find you to bother you thinking you're a philanthropist, like Mr. Moneybags here,

1629
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:12,480
saving $4 a week. Then surely you can finance my short film or help my relative who's sick.

1630
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:17,200
I'm worried that we're making this public. That's the best deal. And they've already changed it.

1631
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:21,680
But for a while I was going and buying two boxes of movie theater candy, cause those were two for

1632
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:29,680
$4 or two through $3. So, you know, get some snow caps, get some Sour Patch Kids. Okay. Hold on.

1633
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:38,320
I have, okay, here we go. I have the offers that I didn't see before $2 off your purchase,

1634
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:48,960
but not for. You're not a CVS VIP. Why? Why not? I don't, because, uh, maybe, I don't know,

1635
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:53,520
maybe you could go in there and you could smile more. You could have a chipper attitude like Jason

1636
01:23:53,520 --> 01:24:01,040
has. I think a cashier saw Jason with a pep in his step, buying a bunch of boxes of movie candy

1637
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:07,120
at once and thought I'm going to do a kindness for this young man who brightened my day with his

1638
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:14,320
smile. Jason was like whistling candy man from Willy Wonka. They're like, look at this nice young

1639
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:18,960
man. He like clicked his heels together when he came into CVS. They're like, you know what?

1640
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:26,720
Let's give him free candy every week. You sir have the golden ticket. Wow. This is crazy. I

1641
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:30,480
got to figure this out. I got to figure this out too. We'll see if one comes tomorrow. I've

1642
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:38,640
been waiting for it to cut off. Wow. Well, hold on. Hold on. No, no, I have $4 off your $20 purchase.

1643
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:43,680
I do not have the $4. Just a $4 with no strings attached. Yeah. I do not have a no strings. I'm

1644
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:50,160
going to be combing through this all night, but wow. Okay. Say partner who listens to podcast

1645
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:55,120
the ride and I don't, how was their newest episode? Oh, it's good. They talked at one point about how

1646
01:24:55,120 --> 01:25:00,720
Disney's shifting their park hopping time from 1 PM to 11 AM. And then towards the end, they went

1647
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:06,640
through Jason's CVS receipts as if they were doing his taxes. This is why I didn't bring this up

1648
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:10,960
sooner because I'm like, well, this is going to be like a third of an episode. If I talk about my

1649
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:16,080
free candy trips. Little and little did you know that your bio would come into question for,

1650
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:22,320
for so long, right? There's been a lot to comb over someone to mention that, but I don't know.

1651
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:28,480
I forget it's been messy boy for a long time and wooden got added during the Pinocchio craze. I

1652
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:34,240
still got to watch the del Toro one. That one looks good. Yeah. That's what's the biggest deterrent

1653
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:39,280
getting us to watch something. Is it being good? That puts it at the back of our queue.

1654
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:45,280
Um, all right. Well, I think you've been audited sufficiently and unless Mike has more Mike,

1655
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:50,960
you've said, hold on. And then said more numbers several times. Now, do you need to do that again?

1656
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:56,560
I have a coupon for $3 off Listerine mouthwash. This isn't about you. This is about Jason's

1657
01:25:56,560 --> 01:26:01,200
bonds. You're right. Jason's coupon shine. You're going to get a better deal at target or Walmart

1658
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:05,040
on that. I'm Listerine. Yeah. Yeah. I agree. Bye.
