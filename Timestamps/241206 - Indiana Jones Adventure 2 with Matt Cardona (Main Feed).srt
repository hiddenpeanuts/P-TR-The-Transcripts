11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Everyone has been asking for

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Indiana Jones Adventure 2

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Intro Music

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
A theme park podcast that has to remind you

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Do not look into the eyes of our hosts

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Or else

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
They will take that as an invitation

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
To talk to you about all the weird

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Annoying stuff the Disneyland app does

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
My name is Mike Carlson

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Joining me as always, Jason Sheridan

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Where did that one come from?

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Have you been sitting on that?

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I completely invented it off the top of my head

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Like five minutes ago

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That's why you're the best

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Look, we've done so many of these dumb intros

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
At this point it's like

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Pulling teeth to get something out of my head

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
That's not the same shit

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So there I got, I came up with something clever, right?

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We have a lot to do today

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And we have a very important guest

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
He's returning to Podcast The Ride

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And most importantly

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
He is the Indie God

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Which is very appropriate for the topic today

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Matt Cardona

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Oh, thank you very much

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Deathmatch King, always ready

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Internet Champion, the complete

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
But most importantly for this episode

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The Indie God

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Thanks for having me guys

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Matt, some of the history

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The recent history is that Scott

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Is on hiatus for now

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So we've been doing these Scott free episodes

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm a listener of the show

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Sure, but sometimes you'll text me

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And you'll say like for instance

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
At Tomorrowland where we sort of redid what we thought

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Tomorrowland should be, you said like

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What is this fantasy booking crap or something

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You'll text me things

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So you'll be like, I'll be like

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Okay, sometimes he doesn't listen, that's fine

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I tried to get you to listen to McGruff one and two

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And we're like, no, not interested

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I skip

65
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I skip the City Walk stuff

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That's fine, some people say that's the high

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Watermark of the podcast, that's fine

68
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Some people say that's the good stuff

69
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And the rides are bad, you know, it all depends

70
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You're right, it all depends

71
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'll listen to the City Walk, the Orlando

72
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
City Walk stuff, but when you're going into

73
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The Hollywood City Walk, I'm not even familiar

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
With that

75
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I get that, that makes sense

76
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So have you gone to the piano bar

77
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Orlando City Walk? Many times

78
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Okay, so has it packed in there

79
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Because when Scott and I went, we literally were

80
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The only two people in the room that closed it down

81
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I've been in there when

82
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It was, I wouldn't say packed, but it wasn't

83
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It wasn't just two people

84
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Okay, well that's good because I was worried

85
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
About it. So here's the thing, and I know

86
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
We're here to talk about Indiana Jones

87
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But I

88
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Listen, I live in Orlando, okay

89
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And it's great, I feel

90
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Very lucky, very fortunate, blessed

91
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's great to be living in Orlando during this

92
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Theme park renaissance, Disney vs. Universal

93
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Who's gonna top who, you know

94
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's a lot of fun, but

95
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I will leave my house

96
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
To go to Disney

97
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Springs, I will leave my house to go eat

98
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Somewhere on Disney property

99
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I will not leave my house

100
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
To go to

101
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Cowfish

102
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You know what I'm saying?

103
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yes, cowfish is

104
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Awful to find

105
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Cowfish sucks

106
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I don't think anything on universal property

107
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Food wise is good, if I'm in the park

108
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'll stop on the way out

109
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But I'm not leaving my house

110
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
To go to the NBC grill, you know what I'm saying?

111
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I will leave my house to go to the California grill

112
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Sure

113
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
See, this makes sense

114
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
But the problem is we have

115
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Where we live in Burbank, City Walk

116
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Is very close, so that's the closest

117
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
We can get there in 15 minutes

118
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
To get to downtown Disney, depending on the time of day

119
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Our hour 15 could be 90 minutes

120
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So we have to take what we can get

121
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So that's I think why we end up spending more time

122
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Just at City Walk

123
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Than at downtown Disney, but I do understand what you're saying

124
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Disney in general

125
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Higher quality restaurants

126
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
More scenic, more interesting

127
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Stuff

128
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
That being said

129
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The Margaritaville has a lovely porch

130
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The Jimmy Buffet Plane is there

131
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The Hemisphere Dancer is there

132
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So there are things that I would once in a while

133
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Navigate to

134
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I would make a point to go there

135
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
If I'm not at the park

136
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I will not go to any of those places

137
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
If

138
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You would not even meet a friend

139
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
At City Walk, would you insist they go to

140
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Disney Springs?

141
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The parking situation for City Walk is atrocious

142
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You know that

143
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
We didn't actually have to park

144
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
There

145
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The Uber is even worse

146
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
If I'm going there, I'm drinking

147
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I have the annual pass so I can do the valet

148
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
But I can't drink and drive

149
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So I can't even valet

150
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So I'm going to take an Uber like a sucker

151
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And you're all the way at the top

152
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Of that garage

153
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Oh my god, it's like 20 minutes

154
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's a big walk, and it is a big walk to get in

155
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
That is true

156
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But I guess we didn't have that

157
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Really what we should have done for the City Walk Saga

158
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Is we should have done a simulation of your life

159
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
To know what a local is experiencing

160
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I should have slept

161
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
In your toy room

162
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And then I would have taken a lift over alone

163
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
To City Walk

164
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Gotten hammered

165
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And then taken the lift back at like 3am

166
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And of course slept again

167
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
In your house

168
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And then I would have known what a local is experiencing

169
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So maybe we just have to do the whole City Walk thing again

170
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
To really figure out what it's like

171
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Another trick I do

172
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
If I'm going to the darks

173
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I will Uber to the Hard Rock Hotel

174
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And then I will walk

175
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You know

176
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Or if it's perfect timing

177
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Take the water taxi

178
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Right, yes I've done that

179
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I had to negotiate with the bus

180
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
This is repeating stories

181
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
But I had to negotiate with the bus driver

182
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Who was taking me from

183
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Accidentally me going to Volcano Bay

184
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And he didn't understand what I was telling him

185
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I was like I'm going to Hard Rock but I can walk from Hard Rock

186
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
To City Walk and he's like no you can't do that

187
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And I was like dude I've done it

188
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I know what I'm talking about

189
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Bro I know

190
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And then he told me to get off at the wrong hotel

191
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And I was like is it this guy's first day

192
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
He seemed like an older guy

193
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
He seemed like he had been there a while

194
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
But then he realized I was right and he let me off the bus

195
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So yeah that trick

196
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Can I ask about California Grill

197
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Do you ever do the frowned upon trick

198
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Of doing a lift to Contemporary

199
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Getting out

200
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And then walking over to Magic Kingdom

201
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
No comment

202
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
But I will say yesterday

203
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I don't know when this is airing

204
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But Chelsea and I we had an early Thanksgiving

205
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Because we're not going to spend Thanksgiving together

206
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So we had dinner at the Liberty Tree Tavern

207
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
In Magic Kingdom

208
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And I took

209
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I knew I would be having a couple cocktails

210
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So I took an Uber to the ticket

211
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And transportation center

212
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
But I had to

213
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I feel dirty lying to the people

214
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
To get into Contemporary

215
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'll admit the only time I've ever done that

216
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Is when I was running so low on time

217
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It was the only option

218
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And I had a reservation

219
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And then I ended up for Contemporary

220
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
To eat at Chef Mickey's

221
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But then I ended up having to cancel it

222
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And yes I will admit I'm bad boy

223
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
They can ban me if they want

224
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But I will always from Magic Kingdom

225
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Walk to the Contemporary

226
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
To get my Uber home

227
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Always

228
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Why not

229
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And then you have to go to Contemporary and smell the lobby

230
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Right

231
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Last night we had a little after dinner drinks

232
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
At the California Grill

233
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
There's nothing better

234
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Have you guys dined at the California Grill?

235
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Yes

236
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Is that your number one?

237
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What's your number one?

238
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I haven't done everything possible at Disney World

239
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Neither have I

240
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
But I've done all the hits I believe

241
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
As far as

242
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
We did more of a pizza

243
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And drinks at the California Grill

244
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Pizza?

245
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
That means you sat at the bar

246
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It does mean I sat at the bar

247
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I didn't do a full meal

248
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Wait so you've never sat

249
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You've never been to California Grill

250
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
There's a price mix menu

251
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Oh you were talking about the whole

252
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
They tell you what you're eating

253
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Well that's how it is

254
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm not just sitting at the bar like a Gironi

255
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You went to California Grill on pizza?

256
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
But isn't part of it

257
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
The ambiance isn't part of it

258
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
The service

259
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You can't be looking out if your back is

260
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
If you're facing the bar

261
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You're going to be the weird guys turning around

262
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Watching people eat dinner

263
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
There's an area where you can sit in couches

264
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That's not just the bar where your back is to the view

265
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's in between

266
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You're still getting some of it

267
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You're still sniffing the experience

268
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
No wonder California Grill is not your favorite restaurant

269
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You only had a pizza there

270
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I guess

271
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Jason have you done it?

272
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Honestly it was a good pizza

273
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I did

274
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
10 years ago

275
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
10 years ago

276
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Guys

277
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
What are we doing?

278
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
The last time I was down there with family

279
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
We ate at the Topolino Terrace

280
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I like that a lot

281
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I like it a lot

282
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You can see the fireworks

283
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You can see some of the Epcot night time show

284
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's great

285
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
To use a wrestling reference

286
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I refer to Topolino's as

287
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
NWO California Grill

288
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You know what I'm saying?

289
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
NWO Sting

290
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It was like Sting but it wasn't Sting

291
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's California Grill but it's not a California Grill

292
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
A little different

293
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
A little edgier

294
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's rooftop

295
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's not the same guys

296
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's just not

297
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Have you ever been to a real restaurant

298
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
At Disney World?

299
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Do you consider Ohana?

300
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Malaysian?

301
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
That's a real restaurant

302
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's not in my top 5

303
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I've had it 3 times in the last decade

304
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I feel like the first time was amazing

305
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
10 years ago

306
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Then it's gotten worse since

307
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I've done Liberty Tree

308
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I very famously on the show ate a meal for one

309
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
At Liberty Tree Tavern

310
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I packed it in

311
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Right before a plane

312
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Like 4 rolls

313
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Just trying to shove it in

314
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
But I was trying to

315
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Join the Clean Plate Club

316
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You're a big Boathouse guy

317
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
We both agree

318
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Boathouse

319
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
That might be my number 2

320
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I like paddle fish

321
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
A lot

322
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Whatever we do

323
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
With Disney Springs

324
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You're pegged for the Boathouse episode

325
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I think you need Ricky too

326
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
This is also part of it

327
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
There's a guy you know

328
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Ricky that you keep talking about

329
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
The best waiter there

330
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You mentioned Ricky

331
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I hope we're not doxing him

332
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
He's like 265 pounds jacked

333
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I don't want to get him in trouble

334
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
But he always gives me extra potatoes

335
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
This sounds like your guy

336
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Good potatoes

337
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Extra potatoes

338
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I didn't make it down there

339
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
The last trip

340
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Have you done the little car in the water?

341
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I have not

342
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I've never done that

343
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
That feels like an important part of the Boathouse

344
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's one of those things

345
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'll do it next time and you never do it

346
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I lived in New York

347
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
For 30 plus years

348
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I never went to the Statue of Liberty

349
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I live here

350
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'll do it eventually

351
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
So you've never done it

352
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's kind of tiny though

353
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's kind of unimpressive

354
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I haven't been over there

355
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
But every time I'm in New York

356
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's kind of small

357
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You're seeing it from a distance

358
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Just watch Ghostbusters 2

359
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
That's true

360
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Then it moves and it's doing cooler stuff

361
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
That is very true

362
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
That doesn't upset me

363
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It upsets me more that you haven't been in the little boat in the water

364
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Than see the Statue of Liberty

365
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Honestly

366
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I did once eat at the Boathouse with

367
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm going to name drop Lentesta

368
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Now we're talking

369
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Now we're talking

370
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
That's like a power meal

371
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
They recognize Lent

372
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And they come to the whole meal

373
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Wow

374
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Oh my god

375
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Wow

376
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
That's like a power

377
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
If somebody listens to Podcast the Ride

378
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Dave and Buster's

379
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
They're like have a free drink

380
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
That's more than enough

381
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I don't think we've ever had

382
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
The meal is on us Mr. Testa

383
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
That's impressive

384
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
He has a reputation

385
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
For being a nice man

386
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Everywhere

387
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
He's very nice

388
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Next time

389
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You and Len were both out of town

390
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Last time we were in Orlando

391
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
This is the tragedy

392
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
We did the big Orlando trip

393
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You were wrestling and Len was

394
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Lecturing at MIT

395
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Len was giving

396
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Some sort of symposium somewhere

397
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
On something smart

398
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It might have been theme parks

399
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
But it was from a smart angle I'm sure

400
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
So I don't know

401
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Hopefully fingers crossed

402
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Epic Universe time

403
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm very excited about that

404
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm excited and nervous

405
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It's kind of safe

406
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Explain why you're nervous

407
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I don't know why

408
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Well anytime

409
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Any company opens

410
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
A brand new ride

411
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Let alone a whole new park

412
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And a park that is being sold

413
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
All this technology

414
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
All these advanced rides

415
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I feel like

416
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I'm just hoping they work

417
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Hoping they work operationally

418
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And then crowd wise

419
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It seems like they're

420
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Managing crowds

421
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
In a smart way

422
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You're thinking everything can just

423
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Break down

424
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It'll be original, universal, Orlando

425
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Where nothing worked

426
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I don't think it'll be that bad

427
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
But I remember the opening summer

428
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Of Diagon Alley

429
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Waiting 3 or 4 hours

430
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
To do Gringotts

431
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
That's a little too long

432
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Hopefully it's spread out

433
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
People are spreading it out

434
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Because it's a whole new park

435
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
But yeah

436
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I'm just trying to be realistic

437
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And manage expectations

438
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And again this is not a shot at universal

439
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
This is just like

440
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Any company that opens

441
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
A new thing

442
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
There's going to be growing pains

443
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
They should invite us

444
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
To tour

445
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
With a hard hat on

446
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Before it opens

447
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
We can see it running

448
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Before it breaks down

449
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
When all the crowds come

450
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Do you guys get invites as media

451
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
To do stuff like that

452
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Six Flags invites us

453
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
To a lot of stuff

454
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And god bless them

455
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
They're so nice

456
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
But for some reason Nats Berry Farm

457
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Kicked us off the list this Halloween

458
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I don't know what the hell is going on

459
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Universal out here

460
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Is still good to us

461
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Horror nights

462
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Not the red carpet events

463
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
But they'll get us into horror nights

464
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
We did a Mario press event

465
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
But

466
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Universal Orlando a little quiet

467
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And Disney

468
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Disney would

469
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Never acknowledge that we exist

470
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Wow

471
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'd like to think that's because

472
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
We're like the edgiest theme park podcast

473
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
But there's a good chance

474
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
They just have never heard of it

475
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It could be a little of both

476
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It could be a little of both

477
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
But I'd like to think that they're like

478
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Oh man we can't let those wild men in here

479
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
They're going to tear our new stuff up

480
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Oh my god

481
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Institutionally now we've talked

482
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Plenty of people who've worked for the company

483
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
In various departments

484
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And wings and stuff

485
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Who listen

486
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
But yeah as an institution

487
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
No

488
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
We'd love to get on the list

489
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I mean I've begged

490
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Most of this podcast is me begging

491
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
To get into press events

492
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
That's a majority of what I do in the seven years

493
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
But yeah

494
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
So we'll see

495
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I've emailed Orlando

496
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
They know we're there

497
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
So we'll see

498
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
And we know some people around too

499
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
So we'll see what happens

500
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
But I would like to enjoy it

501
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Before the crowds break it

502
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Well good luck guys

503
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Thank you

504
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Thank you

505
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
So today I mean

506
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Man we're already off topic here

507
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I was going to talk about Muppets closing

508
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
But I don't even know if we have time

509
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
So let's not talk about Muppets closing

510
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Real quick let's go around and say what we think about it

511
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Closing

512
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I will say this I don't like that it's closing

513
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
But for some reason I feel more bothered

514
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
By Rivers of America closing

515
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Anyway Jason what do you think?

516
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'm a little bummed out

517
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I

518
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I think I understand

519
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
The logic if they're trying

520
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
To save money

521
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Because a lot of the Monstropolis stuff

522
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Is going to be redecorating

523
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
And re-themeing what's already

524
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
There

525
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
So when I realized that was what was happening

526
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm like oh that's why they're not

527
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Building at Star Wars

528
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Launch Bay or Animation Courtyard

529
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Oh

530
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
So they can re-theme the theater

531
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
And the restaurants and everything

532
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
So you like it or you don't?

533
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
No not really

534
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I mean I hate

535
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Always left Muppet Vision 3D

536
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And my family specifically always left

537
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Mama Melrose so that's gone

538
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Sure

539
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
And I

540
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Think I'm just in the camp

541
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
That's like Disney World is so

542
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Much land

543
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
There's such a giant

544
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Parking lot outside of MGM

545
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Outside of Hollywood Studios

546
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
That

547
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Like they could build fresh

548
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
So re-themeing

549
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Doesn't

550
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Make as much sense to me and also

551
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Like there is

552
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
A theater next to Rock and Roller

553
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Coaster just put Muppet's Vision

554
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
In there

555
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I feel like would quell some people's

556
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You know being upset

557
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I think they're putting in

558
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Some sort of villains

559
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Show which does seem a little

560
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Silly as they're building

561
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
A whole new villains land at the Magic Kingdom

562
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
So

563
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Yeah I mean I'm not

564
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Happy about it but it was

565
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Going to happen you know it was bound to happen

566
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I am kind of

567
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
You know they're giving us the Muppets

568
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
The Rock and Roller Coaster which

569
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Another one of my favorites gone

570
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
But

571
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
You know it's not a museum as

572
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Walt said or did he ever actually

573
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Say that I'm not sure but I don't know if he said

574
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
That but somebody said it somebody said

575
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It someone said Walt said it but listen it was

576
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Going to happen Star Wars Launch Bay I don't know

577
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
What the fuck it's still doing in either park

578
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Oh I know like what do we do

579
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Well if you listen to our episode where we

580
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Imagine different scenarios where

581
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Star Wars Launch Bay went away I think you would

582
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
See we agree with you no yeah so

583
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Listen it is what it is I also

584
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Love Momma Melrose

585
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
But that wasn't quite Muppet

586
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Themed anyway so

587
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Pizza Rizzo is gone

588
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Pizza Rizzo I mean that

589
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Come on that needed to go let's go come on

590
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Now that I know is a fighting

591
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Words for many people not necessarily us

592
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
We haven't done an episode but that is

593
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
People are very protective of Pizza Rizzo

594
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
So well I mean

595
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
We'll look I don't know how long this is

596
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I don't know if we're going to get a chance to do it before it closes

597
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Both Rock and Roller Coaster and

598
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Muppet Vision

599
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
But we will continue talking about this

600
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And debating I honestly

601
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I don't think Rock and Roller Coaster is the right ride

602
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
For the Muppets

603
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Like it's too fast it goes too fast

604
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It's not a whimsical ride vehicle

605
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It's too like

606
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
What you're going to blow by a big neon

607
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Kermit head I mean I'm not against that but

608
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It just doesn't feel right to me

609
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I feel like they're going to do something fun with the

610
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Pre-show sure the

611
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Pre-show that'll be the queue will be probably fun

612
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And fine but the ride itself is like

613
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It's kind of forcing a

614
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Round peg in a square

615
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I was going to say a round peg in a square hole

616
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
But you understand what I'm saying but I'd rather

617
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
The Muppets than some

618
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Other random band

619
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I think

620
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I agree with that but I think

621
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It depends I could be swayed

622
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I could be swayed depending

623
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It's a good question we've talked about

624
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
This the

625
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I mean it would be funny because

626
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
You want the band in the intro

627
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
You want the band in the intro video

628
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
So like if you do the Beatles

629
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Two of the members are dead

630
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
And the Beatles don't have the high energy music you want

631
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
For that either

632
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
But like the Rolling Stones

633
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Here's what I want

634
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I want old men to replace

635
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Old men

636
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
So I'm trying to think of what old men

637
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Even like Kiss is kind of

638
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Interesting just from the perspective

639
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Of there's a bunch of old men

640
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
And it's like they have some fast

641
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Songs like that's what

642
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I want to I want to preserve the oldness

643
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Of the music in some way

644
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I mean you could go new you could go

645
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
With some like I mean it's hard

646
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Because there's not really many big new rock bands

647
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And you can't predict that they're going to

648
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Stand and test the time like Aerosmith did

649
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
That's true

650
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
So I mean people have thrown out Taylor Swift

651
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
But that music isn't high energy

652
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Necessarily like it's not the high energy of the

653
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
You want for the rock and roller

654
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
So I really it's hard like

655
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Coldplay come on

656
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
God stop it

657
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
That's what I'm fine with the Muppets

658
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Would you want like a Backstreet Boys

659
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Overlay on the rock and roller coaster

660
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I love the Backstreet Boys but come on

661
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Let's get serious here

662
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Well their music is a little more like sexy

663
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Yeah well there's some upbeat songs

664
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Larger than life

665
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Yeah yeah but that's I mean does that feel

666
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Would that feel right going 60 miles an hour

667
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
In that limo

668
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I don't think so either

669
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
They need a more like sensual ride

670
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Not their high energy stuff but you want some of the sexy

671
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
The sexiness of some of their

672
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Ballads as well

673
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
So again a different ride system for Backstreet Boys

674
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
The ride would be

675
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Appropriate alright let's get

676
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
On to the topic at hand because there's

677
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Too much to talk about we're all over the place already

678
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
We are doing

679
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Oh go ahead Mike

680
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Announce what we're doing before I

681
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Comment on it

682
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
So for years now I've

683
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Been suggesting to Scott

684
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
To do Indiana Jones Adventure 2

685
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
And he has been resistant

686
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I'm not quite sure why I think on some level

687
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
He wants to finish all the other rides there's been

688
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Big rides we haven't done yet Space

689
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Mountain Mr. Toad but I said

690
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I bet if you go back and listen to it was

691
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Our second episode ever I bet if you

692
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Go back and listen we did

693
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
A bad job we didn't go thoroughly

694
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Through everything we kind of

695
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Glazed over and I went back and

696
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I listened and boy was I right we

697
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Padded this thing out we barely talked

698
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
About the ride I was telling Jason yesterday I go it sounds

699
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Seems like we talked about the ride for like 30 minutes

700
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And we basically just highlighted

701
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
A couple things we liked and then we did a bunch

702
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Of other crap and I think it's not

703
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Right I think we needed to go back

704
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
And we need to talk more about this great

705
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Ride and that's why we're

706
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Here today now that Scott is gone

707
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
We were able to be naughty

708
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
And do Indiana

709
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Jones Adventure 2

710
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
And that's what we're doing here today

711
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And look we were young we were

712
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Inexperienced you know we were not

713
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
We didn't know how to make love

714
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Back then we knew how to

715
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Have sexual

716
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Intercourse but we didn't know how to take

717
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Our time you know what I'm saying? Something on your

718
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Mind today Michael?

719
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
What do you mean because I was talking about how sensuality

720
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
The Backstreet Boys

721
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
The Backstreet Boys just

722
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Wound me up I think and then

723
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
It sort of just permeated into this analogy

724
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
That must be what happened

725
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Is the

726
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Show me the meaning of being lonely or whatever

727
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
That Backstreet Boys song is came into my head

728
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
And now here I am being

729
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Creepy that's what happened

730
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
So anyway

731
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
We have a lot of stuff to talk about

732
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Let's just go over in

733
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
General our thoughts

734
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
On this ride now because it's been seven years since we did

735
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Our Indiana Jones episode

736
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Does this ride still hold up?

737
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Do we still like it? Is it

738
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Better or worse? Is it the same?

739
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Let's go with Jason first

740
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Oh

741
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Yeah I

742
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I think it's great I haven't been on it

743
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
In a while and they

744
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
This is one that they continually

745
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Do

746
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Upgrade I mean I think

747
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
They have to do maintenance on it because

748
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
It's such an involved ride

749
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
So I'm happy to see

750
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
They do regular maintenance on it

751
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
There's been a lot of projection

752
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Effects and like they've

753
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Changed some of the scenes around a little

754
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Yeah that's a big reason

755
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
We have talked today because there's new effects

756
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Now on the ride since we've talked

757
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
About it the first time

758
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Some might call them minor but they are there and

759
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
They do need to be discussed

760
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Matt how do you feel about this?

761
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Now okay you guys are California

762
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I'm Orlando but even before that I was

763
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
New York so this is not

764
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Something I get to go on that often so it's

765
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Much more special to me when I do

766
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Might be my number one

767
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
In all of California

768
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Yeah that's including

769
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
California Adventure

770
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
It might be my number one and that's

771
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
That's not even you know taking into account

772
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
That I'm the indie god which is a play off of Indiana Jones

773
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Like put that aside

774
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I just think the

775
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
You know no screens

776
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Animatronics

777
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Huge set you know

778
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
And like I don't think you need to be a fan of Indiana Jones

779
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
To be a fan of this ride there's thrills

780
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
It's fun it's exciting

781
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Yes it is

782
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Yes seven years later I feel

783
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
The same way it's kind of still

784
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
In my mind the ultimate ride

785
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
It's like I still

786
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I mean I know I have a contentious relationship

787
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
With Rise of the Resistance but

788
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Even though Rise of the Resistance is a great ride

789
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
This ride I still

790
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Like it better than that ride

791
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
This ride is so

792
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Awesome from start to finish

793
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
And I've only loved it

794
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
More going on it's like I have

795
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
It hasn't dwindled at all

796
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
In my what at this point 15

797
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
To 20 years going on it

798
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
It's only gotten better to me

799
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
It's amazing it really is

800
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
You bring up Rise

801
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I think Rise might be

802
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
The best theme park ride

803
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Ever if you did every theme park

804
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Ride once and compared them

805
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I don't know if the rewrite ability is

806
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
There with Rise

807
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Not very thrilling

808
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
You know some of the cannons don't even work anymore

809
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Sometimes Kylo doesn't work

810
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Sometimes the lightsaber doesn't come from the ceiling

811
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Yeah

812
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
You know what I'm saying

813
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I could go on Indiana Jones over and over

814
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
And over and over and over

815
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
And Indiana Jones like they'll break

816
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Stuff isn't working

817
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
All the time there's like shit that's supposed to happen

818
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Your jeep is supposed to round the corner

819
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
And fire is supposed to shoot up

820
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I've certainly been on it plenty of times when the fire doesn't

821
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Shoot up through the skull

822
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
And like lasers don't shoot at you

823
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Stuff doesn't always work on it

824
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
For some reason it doesn't hurt it

825
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Like it does for Rise the Resistance

826
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
And I think there's just so much shit going on

827
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
At once

828
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
That it doesn't matter as much

829
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Talking about modern theme park stuff

830
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Like Honda Mansion you're in the graveyard

831
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
And if something's not working in the graveyard

832
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
It's fine there's ten other things to look at

833
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
And it's similar with Indiana Jones

834
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Where even if the snake's not working

835
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
A snake's big and it's there

836
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
But when you get into that big throne room

837
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
If stuff isn't working it's not as big of a deal

838
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Otherwise it's like you're supposed to focus on one thing

839
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
And if that's not working

840
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
That's a bummer

841
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Absolutely I agree

842
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
It's very much like

843
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
The Pirates of the Caribbean style

844
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Where like yeah if you pack

845
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
A giant room with stuff

846
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Everyone in the boat

847
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Could catch a different

848
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Story beat

849
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
They catch little bits here and there

850
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Because it's just so packed

851
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
You might not have the same

852
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Thing you focus on you know

853
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
There's a room on the ride where there's

854
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Tons of skulls

855
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
And I don't even know that I knew how many

856
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I didn't know the scope

857
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Of how many skulls were in there until a couple years

858
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Going on it where you finally take a look to the left

859
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
You see more skulls

860
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
And then there's a big projection on the wall

861
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
It would be so easy to miss

862
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
A ton of details when you're on this thing

863
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
And we missed a ton of details talking

864
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
About it initially

865
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
That projection I feel like they've upgraded

866
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
A few times over the years

867
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
To the point where I forgot about it

868
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Watching different

869
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I watched a few different ride throughs

870
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Throughout the years just to try and

871
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Catch

872
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
What's changed

873
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Now let's go back to the start

874
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
A little bit because like the queue itself

875
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
And now Matt I also brought you

876
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
On today because

877
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
You're a little bit of a

878
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Scott stand in

879
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Because you and Scott often times have a similar

880
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Opinion about queues

881
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Waiting for things

882
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Yeah not going to happen pal

883
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
You're both like all action guys

884
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
You know you and Scott are

885
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Similar dudes in that way

886
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
So you feel free to contradict

887
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
What I'm saying or what Jason and I say

888
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Listen I can appreciate a great queue

889
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
You just won't find me

890
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Waiting on it

891
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Right now this

892
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
This queue forces you

893
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
To go through it

894
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Right

895
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I'm not standing there

896
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Waiting like a sucker

897
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Looking at everything

898
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Now I think once in a while

899
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Standing looking like a sucker is nice

900
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I think it can be

901
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Very nice to look like a sucker

902
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
And wait

903
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
But let me ask you this

904
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Do you have a feeling

905
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I say this specifically at night

906
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Have you ever come out of this thing at night

907
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Or gone in at night

908
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Yes Jason do you know what I'm saying

909
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
The atmosphere and the vibe

910
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Of just the exterior portion

911
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Of the line at night

912
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Is unbelievable

913
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Now the last time I was there

914
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Maybe not maybe not the last time

915
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
The second to last time I was there

916
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
It was cold and it was a little chilly

917
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
So not across the street but across the way

918
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I bought

919
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
An Indiana Jones hat

920
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
And leather jacket

921
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
And then went on the ride

922
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Anyway those are the ones I wear anyway

923
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
So it was perfect

924
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
And then I wore the jacket

925
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
And then I went home put logos on it

926
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I wore it to the ring

927
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
You can write that off

928
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
It was an investment piece right

929
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
But I really felt like Indiana Jones

930
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Because I put the jacket on the hat

931
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
And then rode the ride

932
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I mean that rules

933
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
That's next level

934
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I'm trying to think is there any other ride

935
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Where I've dressed

936
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
He's never dressed like Mr. Toad

937
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
And then gotten on the Mr. Toad ride

938
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Though I would like to see it happen

939
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Sometimes my normal

940
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Attire is reasonably close

941
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
But not that close

942
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I don't usually have like a cravat

943
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Or something

944
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
You don't have driving gloves in general

945
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
You don't wear driving gloves

946
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
No but it's worth considering

947
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Because it does get pretty

948
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
It can get very cold at the right time of year

949
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Christmas is coming though maybe I'll get you driving gloves

950
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
The same one

951
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
With the

952
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
You mean fingerless gloves or like

953
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Whatever Toad wore

954
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I'm going to buy you

955
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
His pantaloons

956
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
And his driving gloves whatever they were

957
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
He has goggles

958
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
An ensemble yeah

959
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
No that is

960
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I can't think of an example

961
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Where I was wearing the actual outfit from it

962
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I want to do it now

963
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Now that you've said that such thing I didn't even consider wanting to do

964
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Now but now I want to do it on some ride

965
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
And I don't know which

966
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I don't want to do it in Indy because you did it first

967
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
But I want to do it on a different ride

968
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
And I can't think of I don't know

969
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
We'll see we'll come up with a better

970
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I mean I guess dressed like Spider-Man on the Spider-Man

971
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Ride in Orlando

972
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
They would probably call

973
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
One of that if you showed up in a full

974
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Spider-Man costume like

975
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
If you weren't just in like

976
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Spider-Man pajamas and then you put the mask on

977
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Right before the ride started

978
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I think you'd be fine

979
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Maybe yeah I mean you'd have to

980
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Manage

981
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
The 3D glasses certainly

982
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I think

983
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Sometimes by happenstance

984
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I've ridden Revenge of

985
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
The Mummy in Florida and been dressed

986
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Like Brendan Fraser

987
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
In the queue by which I mean

988
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Casual slacks and like a button

989
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Up over a t-shirt

990
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I thought you were going to say you were wrapped in toilet paper like a mummy

991
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
That's what I was thinking

992
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
What's going on here

993
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
You said like a couple times too and I was like

994
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
What scenarios

995
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Were you dressed like a mummy

996
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Well that's the listeners too

997
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Have you ever dressed like the character on the ride

998
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
You're going on

999
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Have you ever dressed like Imhotep

1000
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
At Halloween Horror Nights

1001
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
And ridden the mummy ride

1002
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Well I feel like at Universal

1003
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Parks during

1004
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
For the Harry Potter rides there's always people

1005
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Yes that's true the robes

1006
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Which I would never

1007
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Be caught dead wearing because just the heat

1008
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Alone

1009
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Not so much in California but in Orlando

1010
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Oh my god

1011
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
It depends but no I'm not going to do that

1012
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
But we'll see

1013
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I don't know maybe I could dress like Frankenstein for Epic Universe

1014
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I mean it's just a suit

1015
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Honestly

1016
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
But the ride

1017
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Especially at night they're playing the

1018
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Kind of like old time music

1019
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
The lights are flickering

1020
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
The greenery

1021
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Is around you it's like

1022
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
We often ask where you would want to like live

1023
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Or you would want to sleep in the park

1024
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
We've said like oh pirates in like the

1025
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Bed or something but like that's kind of a joke answer

1026
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Honest to god

1027
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I think setting up a little bed in the

1028
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Out exterior queue right

1029
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
By Jungle Cruise is the

1030
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Premier place to sleep

1031
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
At the park not that it's

1032
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
It's an easy way but if you were to be able

1033
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
To construct a bed and do it

1034
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
It's so good out there

1035
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
At night well it is kind of like an

1036
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Expedition base camp you

1037
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Know it is yes there's there's

1038
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
It's thematically it makes sense

1039
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
But I'm just saying I don't feel

1040
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Other than maybe Big Thunder at night at

1041
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Disneyland which is we got the lights

1042
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Going around just there's that really

1043
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Good vibe going on there this

1044
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Is my number one like vibe

1045
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Spot and I wish I could hang out in it more

1046
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Because you got to leave once you're done with the ride

1047
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
You can't hang around

1048
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
But if we could like you could have a drink in this zone

1049
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Ooh ooh ooh

1050
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
This would be good

1051
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Now have you ever done like the jock lindsey's

1052
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Hanger bar at

1053
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Dizzy Springs

1054
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
To me that doesn't feel

1055
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Indiana Jones enough I know I agree

1056
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I was like I was really excited to do it a couple

1057
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Years ago and I was like it's not

1058
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
It's fine but it's like oh you can

1059
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Look at oh it says Indiana

1060
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Jones on this clipboard on the wall

1061
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
And you're like well is that

1062
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
What is the theming here

1063
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I mean yeah it's better than nothing but

1064
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
It's not it doesn't satisfy

1065
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
My craving for being

1066
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Near Indiana Jones shit there was a pop

1067
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Up bar I think it's gone in

1068
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Hollywood studios

1069
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Like in Indiana Jones I think it's gone I never

1070
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Got to go yeah

1071
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I mean you know we're not going to talk about the show

1072
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
With the show is fantastic I'm sure you both have done

1073
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
It yes of course yes

1074
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Show's still going too

1075
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Timeless that thing should never get

1076
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Torn down yeah would you

1077
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Let's say

1078
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Say you were to choose Muppets goes

1079
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Or Indiana Jones stunt show goes what would you

1080
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Pick oh man

1081
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I'm a sucker for Muppets

1082
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Man I love the Muppets I still think

1083
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
It holds up and I think there's a lot of things

1084
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
That people don't realize like what's

1085
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Really going on you know there's a

1086
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Lot of attention to detail that gets missed

1087
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
It's just one of the classic Disney attractions

1088
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Is a shame that it's leaving yeah

1089
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
But it is what it is I pick saving

1090
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Muppets unfortunately but I agree

1091
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Indiana Jones should stay around Jason what do you think

1092
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Uh that's tough

1093
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Oh yeah that's really

1094
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Tough oh he's thinking it over this isn't

1095
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
A slam dunk the one time

1096
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
We went down there we were in Hollywood

1097
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Studios and everyone was kind of splitting up

1098
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
And I'm like who wants to go see

1099
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
The Indiana Jones stunt show with

1100
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Me and no one the

1101
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Answer was no one everyone just wanted to go

1102
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
For once everyone else

1103
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Was going to take a nap and I'm like

1104
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
The show's about to start

1105
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
There's like hardly anyone here

1106
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
And so

1107
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Sounds like you've made a decision

1108
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Might be Indy yeah

1109
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Not a bad choice

1110
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
But you know you would rather see that

1111
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Than the legend of Jim Hansen live on I understand

1112
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Oh my god

1113
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I knew I was going to get that

1114
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Well okay let me say something that will make you happy Jason

1115
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I looked up the names of the old time

1116
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Songs that play in the exterior

1117
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Part of the queue at Indiana Jones

1118
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Did you do this? You did you sent me a playlist

1119
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Yes okay I did send you that already good

1120
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
And a lot of it is by Glenn

1121
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Miller

1122
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Glenn Miller had an orchestra a hundred years

1123
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Ago oh my god

1124
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
And this is a type of music

1125
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Jason likes uh he's

1126
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
From a different era but the

1127
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Thing you know Moonlight Serenade is

1128
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Like the song that you've heard in like

1129
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Movies forever that usually plays and it plays in

1130
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
A lot of these these loop videos but

1131
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I think that is actually that's like almost

1132
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
A background piece of the atmosphere you're not

1133
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Even noticing is that kind of old time radio

1134
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Sound while you're listening to

1135
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Something that like somebody from

1136
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Some person from 1920

1137
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Was listening to

1138
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Like that's a big part

1139
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Of making this authentic

1140
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Which is also a big

1141
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Part of a lot of different ride queues is

1142
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Making like use

1143
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Of old music to give you

1144
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
A different atmosphere like Radiator Springs

1145
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Racers is playing 80 year old

1146
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Country music to give you a different vibe

1147
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Because it feels like you're in a different part of

1148
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
You're in a different time essentially

1149
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
And it is smart I feel like it's a thing that's used

1150
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
In a lot of different lines

1151
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
To make you feel like you've been transported somewhere

1152
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Yeah it's a pretty

1153
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Like low key

1154
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Like clever trick that

1155
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Immediately changes

1156
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
The vibe yes from area

1157
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
To area yes

1158
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I will say this

1159
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I generally don't like to wait

1160
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
If the ride is like the line is stretching

1161
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Back all the way to this point

1162
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
In the actual exterior

1163
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Queue I don't necessarily

1164
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Like to wait in an hour and

1165
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
10 or 20 minutes

1166
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
But if it's like you see

1167
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Indian it's like 45ish minutes

1168
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
You get a little time

1169
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Outside then you kind of breeze through

1170
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
The actual themed

1171
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
The really themed interior queue

1172
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
That's closer to what I'm looking for

1173
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Obviously you know

1174
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
The dream is at the end of the night when no one's

1175
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
If no one's there

1176
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
You can take your time going through the exterior

1177
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Queue and go through

1178
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
That's ideal

1179
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Now I'm going in a couple weeks for a

1180
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I don't want to you know

1181
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Don't dodge yourself

1182
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I have a VIP tour

1183
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
So I won't be

1184
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
You know I'll be waiting a little bit

1185
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
But not on the main queue

1186
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
We'll probably go through the exit

1187
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Is that what they do?

1188
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I think they just go through the

1189
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Maybe they just cut the line

1190
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
In the lightning lane

1191
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
You don't go to the very very front

1192
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Maybe for Cody Rhodes but not for Matt Cardona

1193
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Oh well

1194
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
He's a champ

1195
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
There's a special entrance

1196
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
For champs

1197
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I'm an internet champ but that doesn't count

1198
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
But it's also like it is so hard

1199
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Because they built this ride

1200
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
And it was a logistical problem

1201
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Because they needed to build a long queue

1202
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
To get to the actual building that houses

1203
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
The ride

1204
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
So the reason it's so long was just a logistical problem

1205
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
That they went well let's just build a long

1206
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Cool line

1207
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
To take you all the way

1208
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
To where you're going

1209
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Which is why it's not an easy

1210
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
There's not an easy way in there

1211
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
You have to walk that length

1212
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
And even still like there's

1213
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
You walk all that length and you've got to go upstairs

1214
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
And you've got to walk downstairs again

1215
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I know a lot of lines are like that but

1216
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
It does feel like you walk a mile

1217
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Total

1218
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
To get to the ride

1219
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
And sometimes if it's the end of the day

1220
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
And your legs are tired it's like

1221
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Couldn't I just be on the ride

1222
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
But I do think

1223
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Psychologically you feel like

1224
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
You're way far away from Disneyland at that point

1225
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
There's something that it does

1226
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
That makes you feel like oh shit

1227
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
We're literally nowhere near Disneyland

1228
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
At this moment

1229
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I've done so much physical effort

1230
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
I've exerted so much effort

1231
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I must be in a different place

1232
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I'm in a different country by now

1233
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
But it's worth the wait

1234
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
It's absolutely worth the wait

1235
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
And they do single rider sometimes

1236
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
On this thing and I think they

1237
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I don't know

1238
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I think if you do single rider they often times

1239
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Put you up in the elevator

1240
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I've never done the elevator no

1241
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
You should ask the guide if you can do the elevator

1242
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
But there is an elevator there

1243
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
And sometimes you can take that up

1244
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Go over and then maybe take another elevator

1245
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
It's very confusing but

1246
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
You take the elevator up

1247
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Go a little

1248
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
And then you take the elevator

1249
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
The second one down

1250
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
So you're crossing over the track

1251
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Basically

1252
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
The other thing you should do is ask the VIP guide

1253
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
If you can use the Star Tours bathroom

1254
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Really

1255
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I wasn't on my list to even go on that ride

1256
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
We'll see if they'll let you do

1257
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
The Star Tours bathroom

1258
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
What's special about the bathroom?

1259
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
It's just a bathroom that's not open to the public

1260
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
It's a shitty looking bathroom

1261
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Is there like a bidet

1262
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
But it's like a light saber and it's like red water

1263
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Or something like that?

1264
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
It's R2D2's head opens up and you pee

1265
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Into his head

1266
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
And he beep beep

1267
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
He gives you like a happy beep beep

1268
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
That was good

1269
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
It's just a normal bad

1270
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
To okay bathroom

1271
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
That's

1272
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
When I did my one VIP tour

1273
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I was like oh hey did you want to do the Star Tours bathroom

1274
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
And I was like fuck yeah I want to do that

1275
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Whatever that is

1276
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
And then it was a very normal like single stall bathroom

1277
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
But

1278
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
There is a bathroom in the queue for

1279
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Indiana Jones too

1280
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Really

1281
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
They built a bathroom in

1282
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I've never used it

1283
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
That's a good point

1284
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I've never seen it honestly

1285
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I always miss it

1286
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
That is something that I haven't even thought about

1287
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
You're right there's something in there

1288
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
They did that with Avatar too because it's such a long

1289
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Flight of passage

1290
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
It's such a long queue

1291
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
That I have used

1292
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Multiple

1293
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Number one or number two?

1294
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Just number one

1295
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
But it's like

1296
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
That's a long

1297
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Can be a long queue

1298
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Like and

1299
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Like two hours

1300
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Can you imagine opening weekend or opening year

1301
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
How many people probably had to go number two

1302
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
In the flight of passage

1303
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Bathroom

1304
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Probably a lot

1305
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Jane got out of line

1306
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
At the river journey

1307
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Because that had a long queue

1308
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
And they gave her a card

1309
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
They gave her like a return ticket

1310
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
So

1311
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
They could prevent people jumping

1312
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
A line so they gave it to her when she left

1313
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
And when she came back she just gave back to him

1314
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
And she got out with us

1315
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
In line

1316
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
That's nice I don't know I feel like some rights

1317
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Do that but a lot don't

1318
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
But it makes sense I mean everybody has seen the

1319
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
People who cheat and like pretend

1320
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
I don't like cheaters

1321
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Yeah I mean it's the phone you put the phone

1322
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
To your I've never done that you put your phone

1323
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
To your head you go oh you pretend that like

1324
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
There's a person up ahead

1325
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
And I mean have you ever put a

1326
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Like I've never said anything

1327
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Or like show me the person up ahead

1328
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Let me walk with you

1329
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I've never done that no

1330
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Because it's hard like

1331
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I swear somebody did this to us

1332
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
We took my daughter to meet Minnie Mouse

1333
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
And it was a short line that was just not moving

1334
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
It was like 14 to 17 people

1335
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
And somebody did that

1336
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
And I'm pretty like I'm pretty sure

1337
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I'm not 100% they did it

1338
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
But I'm pretty sure and I was like if they are

1339
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
In a line that's the ballsiest move

1340
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Ever because when it's a long line

1341
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
They'll be gone by the time

1342
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
You don't notice but I swear

1343
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
They like went into Minnie's house and maybe

1344
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
They did meet family there but there's a chance

1345
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
They just skipped 17

1346
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
People in line and did it

1347
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
And it pulled them off which I guess kudos to them

1348
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
For doing it but

1349
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Cutting a two year old is like

1350
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Yeah that

1351
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Takes a lot

1352
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
They had a two year old with them so they were cutting

1353
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
A two year old

1354
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
No excuse

1355
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I agree there was also a weird situation

1356
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Because it was like

1357
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Minnie's house

1358
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
It said like 20 minutes or something so we were like

1359
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Let's wait and we were like to my daughter

1360
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
You want to meet Minnie? She loves meeting characters

1361
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
And then Minnie would like meet two people

1362
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Take photos and then leave

1363
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
And I swear it felt like she was going to the bathroom

1364
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
That's I swear I

1365
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Said this I said it feels like Minnie

1366
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Has diarrhea

1367
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
And something

1368
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Is preventing her from just

1369
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Finishing these 12 people

1370
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
And then like closing the meet and greet for now

1371
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
She kept coming back and going

1372
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
And I was like something is wrong with Minnie

1373
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
She should just go home but she's a trooper

1374
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I hope it didn't happen in the costume

1375
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
If that is what was happening

1376
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
But something was up

1377
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Maybe they had to switch Minnie's

1378
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Like somebody had to go home and they had to find a new Minnie

1379
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
But it felt like there was a start and stop to it

1380
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
And then like

1381
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
My daughter like runs up and meets Minnie

1382
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
And I'm like oh man I hope Minnie isn't like

1383
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Really sick

1384
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
That would be a bummer

1385
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Although I guess you know any germs aren't coming through the snoot

1386
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Or the costume

1387
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Or diarrhea isn't coming through the costume

1388
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
So I don't know

1389
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Obviously no one is going to tell us that

1390
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
But that was my speculation

1391
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
But yeah we should try to figure out

1392
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
The Indiana Jones I should have done that before this episode

1393
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
We're going to have to do Indiana Jones 3

1394
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I'll be back

1395
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
In a couple weeks maybe I'll check it out

1396
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Ask the guide

1397
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
And post a picture

1398
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
And you yeah

1399
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Make sure you save up though

1400
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
As far as urine to go

1401
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
In these bathrooms I'm talking about

1402
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
In Star Tours bathroom and Indiana Jones

1403
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
I drink a lot of water so I'll probably be okay

1404
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
That's great

1405
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
The Tiki room bathrooms

1406
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Are right by the entrance

1407
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Anyone can use those

1408
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
But those are like single occupancy

1409
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
They look like the 60s kind of

1410
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I like that

1411
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
They've changed them a little bit though

1412
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
I tried changing my daughter in these the other day

1413
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
And they don't have changing tables

1414
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
But there's only just two sort of family

1415
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
It's good

1416
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Privacy but there used to be a little bit

1417
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
I think there was like a stall and a urinal

1418
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
And now they're just two

1419
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Lock the door you have the whole bathroom of yourself

1420
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
But that is a good bathroom to go to

1421
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Because most people don't do that

1422
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
The entrance right before you go in a Tiki room

1423
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
You left two bathrooms

1424
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
You have total privacy there

1425
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
That's a good place to go to the bathroom

1426
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
And that's what you get from listening to podcast

1427
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
That's right

1428
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
All these secret bathrooms

1429
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Exposed

1430
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Secret bathrooms exposed

1431
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
We have been threatening to do a full bathroom

1432
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Episode and maybe that comes next year

1433
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Maybe we do that

1434
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
We rank bathrooms

1435
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
You rank how private they are

1436
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
How comfortable, how nice they are

1437
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Guys

1438
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
It's year seven

1439
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
We got to stretch this thing out

1440
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
More and more

1441
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Carthy circle though is maybe my favorite

1442
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
In park bathroom off the top of my head

1443
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
So let's go

1444
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Let's go back

1445
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Enter the temple, the temple of the forbidden eye

1446
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Mara is the god

1447
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Is the character in the ride

1448
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
It's the big head

1449
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
But Mara is also represented a lot of places in the queue

1450
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
And I didn't realize this that the big stone skull

1451
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
That's the big reveal of the temple

1452
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
That is Mara as well

1453
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
It's a decaying skull of Mara

1454
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Of the god itself

1455
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Who is angry at you

1456
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
For looking into its eyes

1457
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Let me pull up a picture of Mara

1458
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
This is right when you get in the lobby

1459
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
This is a picture of Mara

1460
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
A nice looking picture

1461
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
First of all, does this picture look familiar to either of you?

1462
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
No, not to me

1463
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Okay, because you breezed by it

1464
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Because you're so mad at the light

1465
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Jason, does this look familiar to you?

1466
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
This picture

1467
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
I believe so

1468
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
You're all in the temple

1469
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
The only reason I ask is just because this ride

1470
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Is still packed with such cool stuff

1471
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
I was like, I don't even recognize this

1472
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
And then it's like, it's the first thing you see

1473
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
When you get in the queue

1474
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
It's like the first thing you see

1475
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
And I was like, geez, there's just so much cool stuff

1476
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Okay, so the whole idea of the ride

1477
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
This is a little recap, but I should say, go back and listen to Indiana Jones 1

1478
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
We do cover the basics of it

1479
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
But I will repeat it here again

1480
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Is that Mara is

1481
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Basically going to offer you

1482
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Eternal life

1483
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Ultimate knowledge

1484
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Or ultimate wealth

1485
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
As long as you don't look at the idol's eyes

1486
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
So here, this picture is supposed to represent

1487
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
All of those things

1488
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
There's jewels and money

1489
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Over here

1490
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
This eye, I think, is supposed to be knowledge

1491
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
And then I guess this water is supposed to be the fountain of youth

1492
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
The fountain of youth

1493
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
It's not future knowledge

1494
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
See the future

1495
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
It's seeing the future

1496
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Oh, sorry, yes, you're right

1497
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Seeing the future

1498
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
So Mara's pouring out the fountain of youth water

1499
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
But all this to highlight

1500
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
I'm like, this is awesome to me

1501
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
This is such a cool piece of art

1502
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
That really feels authentic

1503
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
To some old temple

1504
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
I'm going to look for it the next time I go

1505
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Look for it

1506
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Just give it a nod

1507
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
If you learn something on Podcast the Ride

1508
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Or hear about it

1509
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
I just want you to look at something, you go nod

1510
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
And then if you're feeling really excitable

1511
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
You nudge to your significant other

1512
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
And you go, hey, take a look at that

1513
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
And then they go, yeah?

1514
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Okay

1515
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
And then you keep moving through

1516
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
That's all I ask

1517
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Our job is done

1518
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
If that's what comes out of

1519
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Listening to Podcast the Ride

1520
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
So there's just a ton of that stuff

1521
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
There's little things, and we talked before about how

1522
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
There's like secret language

1523
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
That is written all over the temple

1524
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
And for a few years they gave out

1525
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
The decoder little cards

1526
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
That you could decode what the actual writing was

1527
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
And most of it is like

1528
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Just like, be careful

1529
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Don't be aware

1530
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
It's mostly warnings about Mara

1531
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Be scared of Mara

1532
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Don't do this thing

1533
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
But it is cool that it's all there

1534
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
But friends who grew up in Southern California

1535
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
And were kids

1536
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Were very excited about those

1537
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Decoder cards

1538
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
And did make the time pass a little

1539
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
In the temple

1540
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Yeah, that feels like

1541
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
That feels like a thing

1542
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
And they've kind of, they put it on an app

1543
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
One of the Disney apps or whatever

1544
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Where you can do it now

1545
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
But that does feel like an old, like 30 years ago

1546
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
You could occupy a kid by handing them a little piece of paper

1547
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
And then saying like, oh, look at the wall there

1548
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
And decipher what

1549
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I assume, like my daughter's brain is probably

1550
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Fried already from screens

1551
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
We've just

1552
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Decimated that thing

1553
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
She's already got ADHD probably

1554
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
And that's not going to play so well

1555
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
But I think there is some sort of app component to it

1556
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Where you can learn

1557
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
What it is on your phone

1558
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I don't know if it's Play Disney app

1559
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
I don't know if it's a Disneyland app itself

1560
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
But there's some way to still see all of it

1561
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
And then they also have all these things

1562
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Constructed to make it look like

1563
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Somebody is actively working on

1564
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
This temple

1565
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Which I think is a very cool detail too

1566
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
The temple is in construction as well

1567
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Like there's some great

1568
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
I don't know, I guess it would be a painter

1569
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Painting these images of Mara

1570
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Which

1571
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I like that it feels like

1572
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
We're still working on it

1573
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Like we're coming into an active site

1574
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Because the narrative of the ride is that

1575
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
They've turned this

1576
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
This is what we learned in the first episode

1577
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Sala has turned this into

1578
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
A weird tourist spot

1579
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Where he now is having to send tourists

1580
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Into the temple to earn money

1581
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
To keep this thing going

1582
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
So you were part of some weird

1583
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Pyramid scheme that Sala has

1584
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Concocted

1585
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Which I totally forgot about

1586
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
That we talked about that

1587
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Like I thought we were just

1588
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Looking for Indie and I think that's

1589
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
What it became

1590
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
But it's confusing because that is part of it

1591
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
And then we also on the other episode

1592
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Also talked about how Michael Eisner

1593
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
In a special said that they moved

1594
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
The temple from India

1595
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
That's the narrative, we moved the temple from India

1596
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
To Disneyland but then on the ride

1597
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
You're just supposed to be in India

1598
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
So some wires got crossed as far as what the official

1599
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Narratives of some of this stuff was

1600
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
What do you think is going to happen when this ride

1601
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Opens in Animal Kingdom?

1602
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Do you think the queue is going to be the same?

1603
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
No

1604
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
I think it will be a whole new

1605
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Ride elsewhere

1606
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
They usually

1607
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
They have a whole new story

1608
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Kind of a new set up

1609
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Are you excited for this

1610
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Indiana Jones

1611
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Attraction coming to Animal Kingdom Matt?

1612
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Very excited, I think Dinosaur

1613
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Sucks

1614
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
I think at a certain time it was excellent

1615
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
But now you ride through it

1616
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
It's like they've known for years they're shutting this shit down

1617
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
So much doesn't work

1618
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
So much is blacked out

1619
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
It's unfortunate because it was

1620
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
At one time such a fun

1621
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Innovative attraction

1622
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
But it's time to go, I do think it's interesting that

1623
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
How old is this ride?

1624
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Almost 30 years old

1625
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Just about

1626
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
That they're

1627
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Bringing us a 30 year old attraction

1628
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
So I wonder if there's going to be some updates

1629
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Because obviously technology has changed

1630
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
We do a lot of cool things

1631
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
But I don't ride this ride

1632
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Now and think it's outdated

1633
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
I think it's going to do a great job

1634
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
It's held up

1635
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
I think it's going to be

1636
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
They said a totally new story

1637
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
I think the queue will be way different

1638
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
I wonder if they keep it

1639
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
As a museum

1640
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Because you start out in a museum type way

1641
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
So I bet they keep that maybe

1642
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
And do something else with it

1643
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
I could be wrong, we'll see

1644
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
I think it's going to be a totally different story

1645
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
I think it'll be probably

1646
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
How

1647
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Tokyo is like different story

1648
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
But it's kind of the same

1649
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
It's like this will be somewhat

1650
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I think it will be way different than that

1651
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
I'm guessing, just because there's been so much time

1652
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
And why not do something a little bit different

1653
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Have you both done Tokyo?

1654
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Yeah I have, Jason hasn't

1655
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
I have not

1656
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Have you been to Tokyo or no?

1657
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
No I haven't been

1658
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
We got to get Jason there

1659
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
I say it every time we record

1660
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Disney Sea, it's like

1661
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
People ask me about Tokyo Disney Sea

1662
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I try to explain it like this

1663
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
I'm a psycho, and I'm sure you guys are as well

1664
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Sometimes I have dreams

1665
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
About fantasy theme parks

1666
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Or dreams about fantasy toy stores

1667
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Tokyo Disney Sea is like

1668
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
You woke up in that dream, but it's real

1669
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
It's unbelievable

1670
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
I can't even explain it to people

1671
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
I was trying to tell this to my mother the other day

1672
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
And I was like, no you don't understand

1673
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
It's a different thing

1674
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
And she's like, well I think I understand what you're saying

1675
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
You don't

1676
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
I was getting defensive before she even

1677
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Pushed back on me, and I don't know why

1678
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
But I was like, Sinbad

1679
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
You'll be reduced to tears on Sinbad

1680
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
And it's special because of the song

1681
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
But it's at a ride

1682
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Yes, but no ride has ever made me cry like this

1683
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Yeah, it's not

1684
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
It's not quite explainable

1685
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
The thing also

1686
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
I was thinking about this cue

1687
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Oftentimes when we're talking about

1688
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
We wish Disney would do a Horror Nights maze

1689
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
To do a Halloween maze

1690
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
In this line

1691
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
It might not make

1692
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
It might break some sort of code

1693
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
For putting performers in small spaces

1694
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
But this is the ultimate

1695
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Horror Nights maze

1696
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
In a lot of ways

1697
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
It's dark, it's cool, it's twisty

1698
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
It's perfectly themed

1699
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Without even the ride

1700
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
You are walking

1701
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
In the most highly themed maze

1702
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
You've ever been

1703
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
So even though I'm like, Disney doesn't

1704
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Other than in China

1705
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Which they have done a little bit of this

1706
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Disney hasn't done any crazy mazes

1707
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
That's what this is

1708
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
This is perfect for it

1709
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
I wish they would around Halloween

1710
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
I know they won't, but I wish around Halloween

1711
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Look, wrap up a couple people as mummies

1712
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Have them pop out

1713
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Jason could be involved

1714
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
He could dress as a mummy, or Brendan Fraser

1715
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Either one

1716
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Demanding coffee, yeah

1717
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
I want to get a little more scared even

1718
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
In this queue

1719
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
And I want to get more use out of it

1720
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Because I think the way that the line has been set up now

1721
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
People just breeze through this

1722
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
And at least let

1723
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Some young scare actor

1724
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Yell at me

1725
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
While I'm going through

1726
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
It kind of reminds me of the Kong in Universal

1727
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Yes, yes

1728
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
That's true, because they did have scare actors

1729
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
And then they stopped that, I believe

1730
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I believe they did

1731
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
I don't know if that's in the real queue

1732
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
I feel like a real snob on this

1733
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
You are, well no, but that's Scott's role

1734
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Is to be the one who says

1735
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
I don't care about the lines

1736
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I just want to go on the ride

1737
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
So you're filling a void right now

1738
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
But I do appreciate a good queue

1739
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
A good pre-show

1740
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Some rides just wouldn't be anything

1741
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Without the pre-show

1742
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Yes

1743
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Well it depends, I mean

1744
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Rides are placed in the park

1745
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
The way everything is set up

1746
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
There are so many other elements that

1747
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
End up, even taking a ride

1748
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
From a B to a C or a B to an A

1749
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
If there's certain

1750
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Ways to frame it

1751
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Rock and roller coaster, even though it's cheesy

1752
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
And you may not like Aerosmith

1753
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
But if it didn't have

1754
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Some of the pre-show elements

1755
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
I don't like the ride as much I think

1756
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Even though that ride is pretty simple

1757
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
I think the pre-show makes

1758
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
It's like a wrestling match

1759
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
If there's no story

1760
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
It just moves

1761
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
If there's no connection to the characters

1762
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
What are we doing here?

1763
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Yes, now you can

1764
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
With wrestling

1765
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
If the moves are cool enough I will like it

1766
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
And if the ride is cool enough I will like it

1767
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
But, doesn't it make it better

1768
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Will it stick with you forever?

1769
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
I don't know, you might forget it

1770
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
It depends, but yes, I agree

1771
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
I'm agreeing with you basically

1772
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
If rock and roller coaster

1773
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Outdoor coaster

1774
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
No theme

1775
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
I'd go on it once

1776
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
And go, oh that was really fun

1777
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
If it's not a long line I won't go again

1778
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
But seeing Steven Tyler

1779
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
The launch would be

1780
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
The thing that carried it

1781
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Without the pre-show

1782
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Yes, but even if

1783
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Even just the idea that you're in the

1784
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Even the idea that you're in a limo

1785
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Is fun

1786
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
You need the pre-show to set up that you're actually in a limo

1787
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
A super stretch

1788
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
A super stretch

1789
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
And it's doing a lot of heavy lifting

1790
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
For a pretty simple

1791
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Cheap ride

1792
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
It's a regular coaster

1793
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
With just some flats

1794
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
On the actual ride

1795
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
It's not even that great

1796
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
And it does not hold up

1797
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
That's why I'm a little worried about this Muppets

1798
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Just a fresh coat of paint might not be enough

1799
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Are you going to be

1800
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Going 60 miles per hour

1801
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
And they play Rainbow Connection

1802
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
That's what people have said

1803
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Even Moving Right Along

1804
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Is not a

1805
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Song as fast as some punk song

1806
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
It's not like a Germs song

1807
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Or Fugazi

1808
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Like Moving Right Along

1809
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Or whatever the song Dr. Teeth

1810
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Sings

1811
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
But they also have promised that they're going to have a festival

1812
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
With modern pop stars

1813
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Or something

1814
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
I think they are going to have some

1815
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
You're going to get Megan Trainor

1816
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Doing a duet with Piggy

1817
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Or something on this ride

1818
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
That's what they're teasing I think

1819
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Let me pull up the

1820
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Ride

1821
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
The pre-show video here

1822
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
The Sala video

1823
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Yes

1824
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Now a thing I never

1825
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Realized, oh you have the whole thing

1826
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
I have the whole thing

1827
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Also can I say

1828
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
I don't understand how people get these

1829
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Sometimes

1830
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
People go like

1831
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Here's Captain EO

1832
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
This doesn't look like it was recorded off a phone

1833
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
This looks like a master

1834
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Who got this

1835
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Especially the pre-show video for Indiana Jones

1836
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Who stole this

1837
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Has Disney arrested them

1838
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Did a cast member sneak this home

1839
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
That's the only way I can imagine

1840
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
It being procured

1841
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Jason were you saying something

1842
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Play the video because I think

1843
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
The thing I have will make more sense

1844
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
After the video

1845
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
So you're seeing Sala outside the

1846
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Temple of the Forbidden Eye

1847
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
And he's letting a bunch of

1848
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
People that look like old timey

1849
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
People onto the ride vehicle

1850
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Onto the jeep

1851
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
And there is a boy that looks like Alfalfa

1852
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
From the Little Rascals

1853
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
We talk about Little Rascals

1854
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
I feel like on this show a lot

1855
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
But I've never seen a full episode

1856
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
But I am smart enough to know that

1857
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
That is clearly Alfalfa

1858
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
That is an inside joke for all the

1859
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Little Rascals fans

1860
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
I've never noticed it

1861
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
So the ride goes on and there's a picture of

1862
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Sala that looks like

1863
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
He's been caught doing something bad

1864
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
In the car, in the jeep

1865
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
He looks like this is the police

1866
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Have found him

1867
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
And he's pantsless in the ride vehicle

1868
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
And here he is, he's been caught

1869
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
It looks like he's taken a number 2 in the bathroom

1870
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Well, thank you for cutting to the chase

1871
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
It looks like he's taking a shit in the jeep

1872
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
It looks like Bigfoot

1873
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
It looks like a blurry photo of Bigfoot

1874
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Yes, let me pause it

1875
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
The reason I'm showing this even

1876
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Is because there are these pre-show

1877
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Videos that become iconic

1878
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Like the Soren one

1879
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Everybody knows it, they know the lions, they know the characters

1880
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
It's very well known

1881
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
But this, I think the placement of it

1882
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Because it's up high and it's in such a

1883
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Big cavernous room

1884
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
That some of this stuff doesn't stick

1885
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
With you

1886
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
That these images don't last with people

1887
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
As much as something like Soren

1888
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
I was going to say

1889
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
To me, I've never seen this but I clearly have

1890
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
If I've been on the ride multiple times

1891
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
It's always playing when you're in that room

1892
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
And I just think it gets lost

1893
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Because there's so much going on

1894
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
How have I not noticed Alfalfa

1895
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
I should have noticed Alfalfa

1896
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
But the video itself is really great

1897
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
And deserves probably more love than it gets

1898
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Well, this is the thing

1899
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
That sticks with me

1900
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
He's holding a sign that says

1901
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Take heed

1902
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
And then there is

1903
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
A picture of like an adult

1904
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Dweeb

1905
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Who just keeps

1906
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
He does look, clearly

1907
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
He's looking at the idol

1908
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
And then he becomes a skeleton

1909
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Yes, so it looks like

1910
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Alfalfa from The Little Rascals

1911
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Father is

1912
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
On the ride and is on the ride with his son

1913
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
And he is following directions

1914
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
But Alfalfa's lame

1915
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Dweeb father is blowing

1916
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
It for everybody by looking into Mara's eyes

1917
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
They're not getting any of the prizes now

1918
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Because Alfalfa's dad fucked it up for them

1919
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
The video should end with

1920
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Alfalfa's dad getting beat up

1921
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
I think the thing

1922
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
That I didn't know

1923
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
I don't know how I never read this

1924
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Is that

1925
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
That is Jonathan Rhys Davies

1926
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
In

1927
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
The pictures

1928
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
But the voiceover is an actor

1929
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Named Bob Joles

1930
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Like it's someone else doing

1931
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
A Sala impression

1932
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Really? Why wouldn't he

1933
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Do his own voice?

1934
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
That's weird

1935
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
I have no idea, but I saw his name

1936
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Mentioned multiple places

1937
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
And he's like a go-to voice actor for Disney

1938
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Is it like Michael Jackson

1939
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
On the Simpson episode

1940
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
He would sing, but he would use his regular voice

1941
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Maybe he wanted to appear, but he didn't want to talk

1942
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
I don't know

1943
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Because he was in the opening special

1944
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Or

1945
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
We've heard a couple times now

1946
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Stories of people who do

1947
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
The pre-show videos

1948
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
And they do the whole dialogue

1949
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
They do the day, but then Disney fucks up the audio

1950
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
And they have to go back in and re-dub it

1951
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
And this is like

1952
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
These are major shoots

1953
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
You would imagine they wouldn't mess the audio up like that

1954
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
But we've heard two of these stories

1955
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Where they do all their lines

1956
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
And they have to go back and ADR it

1957
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Oh my god

1958
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Yes, which is a nightmare

1959
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Harrison Ford is not the voice on the ride

1960
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
No

1961
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
I was hoping that maybe

1962
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
I want to get Harrison

1963
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
There's pictures of Harrison and Calista

1964
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
And the kids

1965
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
On the ride

1966
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
He knows it exists, come on Harrison

1967
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Just give him a microphone

1968
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
While he was actually at the ride

1969
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
And say a couple of lines

1970
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Say it real quick

1971
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Or when they signed him for the

1972
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Star Wars movie

1973
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
And he also made a deal for Indiana Jones 5

1974
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Just say we're going to replace the actor

1975
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
And you have to do these ten lines

1976
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
I'm sure it's a lot of money

1977
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
I'm sure it's not an issue of can he do it

1978
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
How much are they going to pay

1979
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
He can do it

1980
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
I don't know if he's going to be on the house

1981
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
I'm just saying they should have done a deal

1982
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
When the contracts were written

1983
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
They should have done the Downey Jr. deal

1984
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
That he just got for doing Doctor Doom

1985
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Where now he's going to go back

1986
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
And he's going to do Iron Man in all the parks

1987
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
That's what they should have done

1988
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
But maybe they weren't thinking

1989
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Like that back then

1990
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Should have happened on the set of Dial of Destiny

1991
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
I watched that last night

1992
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
I watched Dial of Destiny last night

1993
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Because I hadn't seen it

1994
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
And I'm like okay

1995
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
We're doing the Indiana Jones recording tomorrow

1996
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Let me see if this gives any additional depth or whatever

1997
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
And the answer is not really

1998
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
It's fine

1999
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,000
I don't know why it was so long

2000
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Because the first few are under two hours

2001
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
And then with Last Crusade

2002
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
It's like two hours and two minutes

2003
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,000
And then Crystal Skull is like two hours and eight minutes

2004
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
And this one was nearly two and a half hours long

2005
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Might have been over

2006
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Might have been over

2007
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Might have been pushing three hours

2008
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
And I'm like I don't know why they did that

2009
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
My take is also

2010
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
They got a little cocky in that first section

2011
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Of the movie with that de-aging technology

2012
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
The technology is not there yet

2013
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
So you would want to hide it a little bit

2014
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
But oh they're shining a flashlight

2015
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
On his de-aged face

2016
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
And you're like I can tell

2017
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
That he's not that young

2018
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
And his voice is not that young anymore

2019
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
So I'm not sure why they were doing that

2020
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Oh well

2021
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
I maybe just didn't like the passage of time

2022
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Like everyone just looks so old

2023
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
You're saying

2024
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Yeah well I don't like the passage of time

2025
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
In general so

2026
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
I agree with that

2027
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
But Sala and spoiler alert

2028
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Marion

2029
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Everyone's older

2030
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
It depressed you

2031
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
The movie depressed you

2032
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
It was a little depressing

2033
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
I mean I like Mads Mikkel said a lot

2034
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
I thought he was a good villain

2035
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
And I like Phoebe Waller-Bridge

2036
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
I don't know why there was a kid

2037
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
I couldn't quite

2038
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Follow why there was also a kid

2039
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
He was fine

2040
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
He was a fine actor

2041
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
But I'm like there's a lot going on

2042
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
I don't think they're going to

2043
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Add the kid to the Indiana Jones adventure

2044
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
I think that's what you're getting at

2045
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
No

2046
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
We're already behind

2047
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Let's get to the big thing also that made me want to do this

2048
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
A couple weeks ago

2049
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
There's a plank that says

2050
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Send to Club Obi Wan

2051
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Which is a reference

2052
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
To Temple of Doom

2053
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Yes that's a fun thing

2054
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Club Obi Wan, Temple of Doom

2055
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
That's a club they go to and there's a little reference

2056
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
That's like the type of reference you'll get at the Jock Lindsay bar

2057
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
There'll be a sign that says

2058
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Go to the Club Obi Wan

2059
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Now if they opened up Club Obi Wan

2060
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
That's cool I would love that

2061
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
But they're not going to do that

2062
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
We talked about this a couple weeks ago

2063
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
In our Disneyland App episode

2064
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
There is a disagreement about

2065
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
What eyes

2066
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
You can't look into

2067
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
When it comes to Mara

2068
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Jason believes that

2069
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
There's a couple

2070
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
When you get in the ride vehicle

2071
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
You've loaded

2072
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
There's first a little Mara head with a blindfold on

2073
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
And then you're presented with

2074
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Three different doors

2075
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
And those are the things that represent the different

2076
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Gifts you could be given from Mara

2077
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Those doors used to move

2078
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
They have not in a very long time

2079
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
That's broken as well

2080
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
It would give you the illusion that you were going

2081
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
On a different path even though it was the same path

2082
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Every time

2083
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
So those are sort of stuck with

2084
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
They still do different

2085
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Projection mapping and different effects

2086
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Depending on what the gift

2087
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
You may receive is

2088
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
But the doors themselves don't move anymore

2089
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
I was wrong

2090
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
I was wrong

2091
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Because the new one makes it

2092
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Perfectly clear that it's the big

2093
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Mara you're not supposed to look at

2094
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
So but in your

2095
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
In your defense

2096
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
I don't think this is an uncommon

2097
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Misunderstanding

2098
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
I saw a lot of people online

2099
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Say they thought the eyes were the ones

2100
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Before you enter the big door

2101
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Now I think I on

2102
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
A text chain with Matt and Len

2103
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Ask this question

2104
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
I'm name dropping again

2105
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Forgive me but I believe

2106
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
I don't neither of you

2107
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Actually had a good answer for which eyes you thought

2108
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Was the right I had no idea

2109
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
What the hell you guys were talking you didn't know what I was talking

2110
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
About right so that

2111
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
I guess is another that's a third category

2112
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Some people don't even remember

2113
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
The eyes some people don't care I think Scott

2114
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Knows the eyes but maybe Scott if you were here would say

2115
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
What the fuck are you talking about what eyes

2116
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
But I saw a lot of people online

2117
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Say that those eyes here let me go let me

2118
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Show you what I'm talking about I'll jog your memory

2119
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Please show me these eyes

2120
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
You got to see the eyes because that's the whole point of the ride

2121
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Is that you're disobeying

2122
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
What Mara is saying

2123
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
But

2124
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
I think

2125
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
The new effects make it really

2126
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Clear and I think it's

2127
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Also a joke you can't

2128
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Practically drive

2129
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
The car without looking straight

2130
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Ahead at this giant

2131
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Monolith thing

2132
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
So it's a trick

2133
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Right okay so you have this Mara face

2134
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
That's right before you start the ride and it's got a

2135
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Blindfold on okay and that's just

2136
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
To remind you like don't look into Mara's

2137
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Eyes and then the ride starts

2138
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
And then you're oh yes are you there at Sala

2139
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
And this is the maintenance door that you never go

2140
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Down and then here you see the three different

2141
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Doors that rotate

2142
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
They don't rotate but they used to now

2143
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
I'm defending Jason here a lot of people thought

2144
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
That these eyes were the ones not to look into

2145
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
But you know

2146
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
These eyes are not the eyes you see they open

2147
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Here okay so then

2148
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Obviously you go in the big room and this is the

2149
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Big Mara that's the one where

2150
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
You don't look into its eyes

2151
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
That's what I would assume as well

2152
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Yes but again there's a lot

2153
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Of confusion online or at least a little

2154
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
I did try

2155
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
To reach Tony Baxter to ask

2156
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Him a question

2157
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
But there was no response

2158
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Damn okay well you tried

2159
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Yes I texted

2160
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Season pass podcast

2161
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Host Doug Barnes who's done

2162
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Maybe are the definitive interviews

2163
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
With Tony Baxter and I

2164
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Asked him I said Doug

2165
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
What eyes are the right eyes

2166
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
And he said the big Mara

2167
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Eyes are the eyes so that's as close

2168
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
I've gotten to a full confirmation from

2169
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Somebody involved in the project

2170
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Which is not a person involved in the project it is somebody

2171
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Who's interviewed a person involved in the project

2172
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
I think this is a version of like

2173
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Adding some special

2174
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Effects adding some new technology

2175
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Helps sell

2176
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
The story even more

2177
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Because

2178
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
The projection and the music

2179
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Sting and the

2180
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
The crazy

2181
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Indie with

2182
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Trying to close the door with a big vortex

2183
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Thing behind it

2184
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Is right after this

2185
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Here's what I'll say also

2186
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
I'm not a huge fan of

2187
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Projection I'll ask you guys

2188
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Projection mapping in general Scott actually

2189
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Said on the original Indiana Jones episode

2190
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
That he was not a big fan of

2191
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Like turning the castle into

2192
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
A big present or something

2193
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
You know it's making the castle look like something else

2194
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
With lights I don't

2195
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Love it they do it at France

2196
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
And they do it in the tower of terror

2197
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Is now a big gingerbread

2198
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
House or something or it's it's like

2199
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Supposed to be a scary hotel I do like it during

2200
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
The tower of terror is like a gingerbread house

2201
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
I mean I don't hate it but

2202
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
I just there's something about it where it's like

2203
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
I wish it was on a building that was

2204
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Less scary like it doesn't feel appropriate

2205
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
It should be scary

2206
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Stuff on tower of terror and then it

2207
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Should be I don't know there's not a big building

2208
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
They could use but

2209
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
I don't know there's something inappropriate

2210
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
About it to me I don't know

2211
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
I think my bigger problem is that oftentimes

2212
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
I feel like it doesn't look

2213
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
So good and maybe it's because there's too much

2214
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Light but like sometimes hard to make

2215
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Out what it is

2216
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Like I'm like oh is that Jeannie coming out

2217
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Of a window

2218
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Oh wait no that's Hades

2219
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
But they're too blue but is he a window

2220
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Oh no oh no it's Stitch never

2221
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Mind but I'll say it about projection

2222
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Mapping on Indiana Jones is awesome

2223
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
It looks so good

2224
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
And they've done it they've even redone it I feel

2225
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Like in the last 10 years since they started doing

2226
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
This it really looks amazing

2227
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
And I think it's probably because it's dark

2228
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
And they can control the environment but man

2229
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
This clip Mara looks like she's melting

2230
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
I think heightening the stuff

2231
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
That's already there is

2232
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
What I really like yes they're

2233
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Not painting a face on Mara with lights

2234
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
They're just you know accentuating what's there

2235
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Already but look at that that's like the liquid is literally

2236
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Coming off the effect is effective

2237
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Yes the effect is effective

2238
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
But even more

2239
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Effective way than any projection mapping

2240
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
I've seen it's plussing up the ride

2241
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
As you guys would say it really

2242
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Is yes I feel like

2243
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
This the lightning effects in

2244
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
This room have been improved over

2245
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
The years have been upgraded over the years

2246
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Yes and I

2247
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Think I like that

2248
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
I agree yes the

2249
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Lightning is very cool so on the right

2250
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
You get to the part where the Jeep takes the hard

2251
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Left and you get the big reveal of the whole

2252
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Temple and sometimes the effects aren't working

2253
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
But still this shot of seeing

2254
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
The whole temple is the biggest wow

2255
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Moment I agree I'm with you and even

2256
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
The AT-ATs are really cool

2257
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
On Rise of the Resistance

2258
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
And I was very excited I'm not trying to

2259
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
To shit on it or anything I'm just trying

2260
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
To think of other spectacle rides but this room

2261
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
More than anything in Rise of the Resistance

2262
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Still gives me the feeling of like oh this

2263
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Is 20 miles long

2264
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
This is I can't tell where I

2265
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Am or how far it goes it's it's unbelievable

2266
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
And like you said there's so much to

2267
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Look at even the AT-ATs

2268
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
You're just looking right there this you're like what

2269
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Am I looking at here where am I going because you kind

2270
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Of see some of the track you're like what

2271
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Am I what am I in store for here

2272
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Yes and also like you're getting to

2273
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
See an overview of the whole temple

2274
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
And you're going to get to see

2275
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
It from a bunch of different angles which is

2276
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Something we talk about all the time we like to

2277
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Look at rides from different vantage

2278
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Points so you're going to get

2279
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
To see the ride all over

2280
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
You're going to get to explore it

2281
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Really thoroughly which is

2282
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Really fun and satisfying and like the AT-ATs

2283
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Like you do get another view of them from

2284
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Up but man it really feels

2285
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Like you're exploring every part of this

2286
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Place. Are these flames projection

2287
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Or real flames I don't I don't quite remember

2288
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Or is it a mixture? I think it's a

2289
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Mix of it because like when a new Jeep pulls

2290
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
In to the actual temple a fighter should

2291
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Shoot out of that like one of the eyes of the skull

2292
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
But a lot of it I think is just

2293
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
You know orange lighting and to help

2294
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Accentuate the feeling of things on fire

2295
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
I think it

2296
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Can be really effective if triggered

2297
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Right. Yes

2298
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
I agree and it makes

2299
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
A noise too that it's

2300
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Like a hiss I can't even describe it

2301
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Really well I should try to find it somewhere

2302
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Which it's not as scary as

2303
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
The snake and the hiss because that's closer

2304
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
To you but it is still sometimes that

2305
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Like can kind of get me a little bit like

2306
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
A mild jump scare I'm not saying

2307
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
I'm going to like freak out but

2308
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
I go ah you know just like a quick one

2309
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Let me ask you this

2310
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
As far as the ride

2311
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
System itself you know it

2312
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Fucks you up a little bit it's

2313
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Which I like you know I don't think we've ever

2314
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Discussed it but I do you know I'm a listener of the show

2315
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
I want to feel like I'm in a little

2316
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Bit of danger on these things

2317
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Right okay so you agree with me

2318
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Yeah

2319
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
These ride vehicles are so

2320
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Unique I mean they've used them on the Indiana Jones

2321
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Rides and Dinosaur but they're

2322
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Not using it a ton

2323
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
And it's hard to even imagine

2324
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Like what you would use this

2325
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
For what other kind of rides

2326
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Like the trackless wifi stuff

2327
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Makes sense like there's a lot of applications

2328
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
For that but this

2329
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Feels like it like it has to be like a

2330
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
A rough jeep ride

2331
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
It has to be a rickety road

2332
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Unstable terrain and that's

2333
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
The only way you would want to use this

2334
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Well if they were ever to do a universal like a Jurassic

2335
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Park a new Jurassic Park and you're in the jeep

2336
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Oh yeah that's true

2337
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Because even the boat ride

2338
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
I mean that almost makes zero

2339
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Sense it should be a jeep

2340
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Right yes but it is

2341
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Like the ride vehicle still feels like

2342
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Really unique to me and yes

2343
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
It gives you it messes you up a little bit

2344
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Which is really

2345
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
What you want on some of the stuff

2346
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Sometimes

2347
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
So we should talk about there are

2348
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Different like little variations on the

2349
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Ride like sometimes

2350
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
The car will stall

2351
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
A little bit and make different noises

2352
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Sometimes certain effects will get triggered

2353
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Depending like I saw some

2354
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Like there's a bunch of little

2355
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Things that happen now I think this is smart

2356
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Because sometimes the ride will

2357
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Just break down or there's another

2358
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Thing happening like a ride

2359
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Vehicles it's taking a while to empty it so

2360
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Your car gets stuck on a bridge or something but

2361
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
It's hard to tell if it's one

2362
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Of the randomized events happening

2363
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
On the ride or something's

2364
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Wrong because this happens all

2365
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
The time where I go oh we're stuck on this

2366
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Bridge for a while

2367
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
I go maybe that's one of the randomized

2368
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Things is like your

2369
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Car won't start because that's you know they keep hearing

2370
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
The ignition sound effect which

2371
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
I think it took me a couple years to even realize

2372
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
That was fake

2373
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
That's just a sound effect

2374
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Obviously there's not a real

2375
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Car turning over

2376
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
I just didn't think I didn't it's not that I thought

2377
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
That it's just I never thought about it

2378
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
You were like oh that must be

2379
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
It is a great effect

2380
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
To buy time if there's a delay

2381
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Like oh your car stalled out

2382
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
That's what I'm saying where it's like

2383
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
I still to this day I'm not

2384
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Sure what is like what is an

2385
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Effect when it's just not working

2386
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
What is an effect that's randomized and

2387
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
When is it like oh shit like somebody

2388
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Had a medical emergency at the front of the ride

2389
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
And you're stuck now

2390
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
But I'm like oh wow they really randomized

2391
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
This thing this is awesome

2392
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
I'm getting a totally unique ride now because

2393
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Of like I don't know I still

2394
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Don't know and I can't find like a definitive

2395
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
List of all the different options you have

2396
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
When it comes to this stuff

2397
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Like I think sometimes maybe the snake doesn't

2398
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Like hiss at you but

2399
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Usually it does

2400
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
But again this would all be answered

2401
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
This will be answered in Indiana Jones 3

2402
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
With Tony Baxter

2403
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
We'll have to get Tony

2404
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
For one of these things

2405
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Okay let me let me get to

2406
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
The new stuff

2407
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
So I got very excited because

2408
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
And we've talked about this before Tokyo

2409
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Disney has their own Indiana Jones

2410
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
And they have stuff

2411
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
In probably the most criticized

2412
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Section of our

2413
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Disneyland version

2414
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
There's a room at the end with the blow

2415
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Darts or whatever you would call it

2416
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
It's kind of just painted like skeleton

2417
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Man on the wall

2418
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
And it really feels sort of unspectacular

2419
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Especially after what you've just seen

2420
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
And yeah and after that comes the ball

2421
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
And that's the big amazing thing at the end but you're still

2422
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Like ah this room feels like it'd be better

2423
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
It is better in Disneyland

2424
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
In Paris I was going to say Tokyo

2425
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Don't get me started on the Paris

2426
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Indiana Jones ride

2427
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Holy shit

2428
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Next

2429
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
It's just an outdoor coaster

2430
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Yes it's horrible

2431
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Yes so

2432
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Over a year ago at this point they were like oh my god

2433
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
They added stuff

2434
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
To Disneyland

2435
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
And I was like holy shit because what happens in Tokyo

2436
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Is there's a section where you turn around

2437
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
A corner and

2438
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
There's nothing there in the Disneyland version

2439
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
But in Tokyo a fireball

2440
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Shoots out of like some sort of

2441
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Idol's mouth at you

2442
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Using a very similar effect to what they do on Big Thunder

2443
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Now when there's a big dynamite explosion

2444
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
On the last lift hill

2445
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
So I was like holy shit they're doing it

2446
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
They're fixing the dead space

2447
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
So I don't know if you guys have not

2448
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Been on this since they fixed it

2449
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
So

2450
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
When they say fixed it I don't know

2451
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
I don't think it's fixed

2452
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
That's what I'm saying

2453
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Well they got rid of the projection

2454
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Of a branch with rats on it

2455
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Yes which we call

2456
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
You called out specifically on our first episode

2457
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Is that they used to do a thing with

2458
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
There was a shadow of a branch

2459
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
And a rat was running on it

2460
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
And it would like jump off the branch

2461
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
And that was supposed to like make you think

2462
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Oh there's a bunch of rats in our car now

2463
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
I don't know

2464
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
I didn't know what that was I didn't know what that was supposed to be

2465
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Until maybe Jason told me

2466
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
They've gotten rid of it

2467
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Which is good is a plus up I will say

2468
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
And they've added

2469
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Okay this is what they've added

2470
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
They've added some weird like kind of

2471
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Electricity

2472
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Now I don't know what that's supposed to be

2473
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
In the narrative of the ride

2474
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Like lightning demons or spirits

2475
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Or something

2476
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
I mean what is a lightning demon

2477
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Is that a demon made of lightning

2478
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Fair enough

2479
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
I mean I guess that's pretty self explanatory

2480
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Now that I think now that I asked the question

2481
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
So then you turn

2482
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
A corner and like okay that's fine

2483
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
I don't hate that I'm not mad at that

2484
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
So this is the part I'm like oh this is new

2485
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
This is new and they made like

2486
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Basically a little like doorway

2487
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
And there's two

2488
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Flame like I don't know what you call them

2489
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
You know

2490
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Torches

2491
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
And speaking back to

2492
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
When Matt said no screens

2493
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
There is a screen here

2494
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
That basically just shows like

2495
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Rocks collapsing

2496
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
And then you turn the corner

2497
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Into the room

2498
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
I just criticized

2499
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
And I will say kind of a let down

2500
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Yeah a little cheap looking

2501
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Kind of cheap looking

2502
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
I get what they're going for

2503
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
But I don't know

2504
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
That it's so much better than the rat

2505
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
You know

2506
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
I mean I'm not mad that I said I'm mad the rat

2507
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Is gone but it's a little bit

2508
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Underwhelming considering

2509
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
What you know you could get in Tokyo

2510
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
And I know that's a common

2511
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Thing to talk about

2512
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Is well man you should see what we get in Tokyo

2513
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
But

2514
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Yeah so that's there I'm not mad at it

2515
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
But it is adding a screen

2516
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
To Indiana Jones

2517
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Which kind of taints it a little bit doesn't it?

2518
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Yeah

2519
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
It's like why do we need to add a screen there

2520
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
It almost like dates it in a way

2521
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Because like so many times when you see things with screens

2522
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
In the era that it was made

2523
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
And Indiana Jones is so timeless because it's big sets

2524
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
I feel like

2525
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
That thing isn't going to last long

2526
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
A lot of the stuff in like Haunted Mansion

2527
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Where it's like the projections

2528
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
It takes me out of it

2529
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Like you said it's no longer timeless

2530
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
It feels like you said the year

2531
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
It was introduced

2532
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Yes and I'm like oh that's like

2533
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
It almost made me

2534
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
A little sad I was like oh don't remind

2535
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Me that this has to be like

2536
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Tied to an era

2537
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Now I'm sure

2538
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
I don't know well they'll maybe upgrade

2539
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Things but I could see this in ten years

2540
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
If they never give it another budget

2541
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
That screen is going to look really weird

2542
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
And I hate to harp on it it's such a short

2543
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Thing

2544
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
But it tainted our beloved

2545
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Indiana Jones with a little screen

2546
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
I don't know Jason do you feel anything about this

2547
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
You haven't been on it so you haven't seen

2548
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
The screen first hand to feel the sadness

2549
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
That I felt

2550
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
You know I like the blow dart room

2551
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
I think the audio

2552
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
The audio

2553
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
And the air puffs works

2554
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
For me I think it's a thing

2555
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
In these kinds of adventure movies

2556
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
That it's like oh it's cool to see that

2557
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Even if it is a cheaper version

2558
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
So you're a blow dart room

2559
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Defender

2560
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
I'm a blow dart room defender but I understand what you're saying

2561
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
About screens I think I like the

2562
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Lightning spirits

2563
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Even though they're kind of

2564
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
I'm not quite sure what that is

2565
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
The lightning demons

2566
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Your words not mine

2567
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
I like the

2568
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Lightning demons more than I like

2569
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
The door collapsing

2570
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Sure

2571
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Again I don't hate

2572
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
You know what's funny though it made me reevaluate

2573
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
The blow dart room

2574
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Because I was like I guess at the end of the day

2575
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
I'd rather have some like

2576
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Day glow looking

2577
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Like

2578
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Miniature golf course style

2579
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Skeletons painted on a wall

2580
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Than a screen

2581
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
You know what I'm saying

2582
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
It made me reevaluate on some level

2583
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
The blow dart room and I go well

2584
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
I'd rather maybe have this

2585
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Than some screens on here

2586
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Unless the screens are really fantastic

2587
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
So I don't know I don't think you're ever going to be able to do

2588
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
The full effect

2589
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
That I want from Tokyo but

2590
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
I don't know I'm sure they know

2591
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
The imagineers know that section needed

2592
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
From something and they're doing their best

2593
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Maybe they got a modest budget

2594
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
And maybe they'll continue to do stuff as

2595
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
The years roll on

2596
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
And maybe if Indiana Jones 6 of Harrison can get out of bed

2597
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
And do another Indiana Jones

2598
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
We can get some more stuff

2599
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
I would like one more

2600
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
You know what I want three more

2601
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Oh come on now we're pushing it

2602
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
I want him to be 90

2603
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Oh my god stop it

2604
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
I want it to be mostly

2605
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
CGI

2606
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
I want it to be replacing

2607
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
A young actor's face with Harrison Ford's face

2608
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
I do want to ask this ending scene

2609
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Yes go ahead

2610
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
I get a little confused trying to

2611
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Imagine the space of this scene

2612
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
What do you mean the ball

2613
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
The ball rolling

2614
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
The ball rolling and then he's standing

2615
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
In the rubble of the ball rolling

2616
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
So what exactly is it trying

2617
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
To convey

2618
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
What

2619
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
So the ball rolling is what an illusion

2620
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
That's a great job at that

2621
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
It's amazing and we talked on the first one

2622
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
About how your jeep

2623
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
The walls are

2624
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Moving it's a big part of it

2625
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
But you go down

2626
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Do you find a tunnel

2627
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Or an exit

2628
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
And then you're looking back at where the ball

2629
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Shattered a wall

2630
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
I see what you're saying

2631
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
I think I'm overthinking this

2632
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
It reads

2633
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
I know what you're saying

2634
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Your jeep go in a little secret hole

2635
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
And then turn a corner

2636
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
And see the ball

2637
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Are you supposed

2638
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
To have gone underground

2639
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
And then you're seeing the aftermath

2640
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Of the ball smashing through

2641
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
The earth or something

2642
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
I think so

2643
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
And if that's the general

2644
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
What you're supposed to take away

2645
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Fine maybe I'm

2646
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Overthinking it

2647
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
I think you're probably supposed to be like

2648
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Right at the last second

2649
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
You found a little part of the

2650
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Hill your car drives through it

2651
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
And then

2652
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
The car takes a right

2653
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
But maybe in the imagination

2654
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
You're just supposed to have turned the car

2655
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Around to see what happened

2656
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
And Indy is there with the ball that's broken

2657
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
And he has not been killed

2658
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
He's fine

2659
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
I think the ride

2660
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
There's just no way to do it

2661
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Because you can't go down turn around completely

2662
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
And see a broken ball

2663
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
I think it's just logistically there's just no way to do that

2664
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Right yeah okay

2665
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
This is generally what I thought

2666
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
But the more I thought about it

2667
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
As I was watching these videos

2668
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
I was like am I missing something

2669
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Like in the way

2670
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
I was looking at the wrong eyes

2671
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
You know

2672
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Or it's something like kind of headier

2673
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Where it's like you do get crushed by the ball

2674
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
And you die

2675
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Or you're like in purgatory

2676
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Or you're in heaven

2677
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
And you imagine that you got out safely

2678
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
And that Indiana Jones is there

2679
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
And then you leave

2680
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
I think that's a little too deep I don't know if that's it

2681
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
I think that's probably a little too deep

2682
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
But you know

2683
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
A great art is open to interpretation

2684
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Sure

2685
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
I guess another thing

2686
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
We're well past the snake room

2687
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
At this point

2688
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
But watching it all over the years

2689
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
In the snake room he says

2690
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Like snakes

2691
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
You guys are on your own

2692
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
That's not his line

2693
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
He's supposed to say snakes

2694
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Why did it have to be snakes

2695
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Now at the end he says

2696
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
One of his alt lines is like tourists

2697
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Why did it have to be tourists

2698
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
So

2699
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Did we say this on the first episode? These are some of the shittiest

2700
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Line reads

2701
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
I've ever heard

2702
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
He goes snakes

2703
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
You guys are on your own

2704
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
The take they got from an actor

2705
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Maybe it was a one taker

2706
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
He only would do one take maybe

2707
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
I don't know

2708
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Maybe they had a tight budget

2709
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Maybe it's the take that survived

2710
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
If they've had so many errors with the audio

2711
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
But where's the urgency

2712
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Indiana Jones is in a room full of snakes

2713
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
He's trying to get all these tourists

2714
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
The indie is cool

2715
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
But he goes

2716
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
He would be like snakes

2717
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
You guys are on your own

2718
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
You would be a little more like that

2719
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
The thing I didn't bring up on the first episode

2720
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Where is he

2721
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Where are we hearing him

2722
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Saying this from

2723
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Is he just like stuck in the temple somewhere

2724
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Maybe he's got himself

2725
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Is there a PA system

2726
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Is there a PA system

2727
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
In the temple maybe

2728
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
That Sala set up and he's like

2729
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
He's just giving you directions

2730
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Also not very heroic

2731
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
You got a bunch of dumb tourists in a car

2732
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
They're there because of Indiana Jones and Sala

2733
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
And he's going

2734
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Hey my hands are clean

2735
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
You guys get the fuck out

2736
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
It's a snake come on

2737
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
I know he's afraid of him

2738
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
But he's generally a hero that would even step up

2739
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
I feel like to help a bunch of dummies

2740
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Alfalfa and his father

2741
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Get out of a bad situation

2742
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
I feel like it's a little out of character

2743
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Also for him to say that

2744
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
That is also very funny

2745
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
In the new Indiana Jones

2746
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Where they encounter

2747
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Eels that are like snakes

2748
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
And I'm like

2749
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
What is the dry

2750
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Erase board where they were doing

2751
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Okay there's no snakes yet

2752
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
But the eels could come

2753
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
In the diving sea

2754
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Eels it looks like you guys are on

2755
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Your own

2756
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
I hate eels

2757
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
That is like a knock off

2758
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Indiana Jones

2759
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
But do you think if the movie was a hit they would replace this big snake

2760
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
With a big eel

2761
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Maybe

2762
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
It depends on how much money the movie made

2763
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
And that would have been a big change coming

2764
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Is that the big snake is going to be a big eel

2765
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Well maybe in the animal kingdom version

2766
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Oh very true yes

2767
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
It could be all based on

2768
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
The last Indiana Jones

2769
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
It could be okay you open up

2770
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
You open up in the ride

2771
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Let's brainstorm this real quick to end this episode

2772
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
You start in Indiana Jones

2773
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Sad old man apartment

2774
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Just like in the

2775
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
New movie

2776
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
But then you get a mission

2777
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
From Archimedes himself

2778
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Okay but I was going to say

2779
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Maybe slow down and you go through his mail

2780
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
And see if you get a social security check first

2781
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
And then

2782
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
You learn about all the people in his life

2783
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Who have passed away

2784
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
And then

2785
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
It's depressing oh man that's a depressing way

2786
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
To start the ride

2787
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
It is a depress but it is accurate to the film

2788
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Indiana Jones

2789
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Indiana Jones meets the dinosaurs

2790
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Was the way to go and I don't think they're going to do it

2791
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Indiana Jones fighting dinosaurs

2792
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Back in time was the way to go

2793
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
And it would have worked great for

2794
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
The overlay of dinosaurs

2795
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
They could have kept some of those animatronics

2796
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
That's what I'm saying I'm smart I'm thinking budget wise

2797
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
But yeah they'll probably

2798
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Indiana Jones is going to find

2799
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
I don't know what does he find in the movie

2800
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
He should find Crystal Skull

2801
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
The dial he finds

2802
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
He finds the dial of destiny

2803
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
And they travel back in time to the

2804
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Battle of Syracuse on the island of

2805
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Sicily

2806
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
You were really paying attention to this

2807
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
He just watched it yesterday

2808
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
I watched it like 12 hours ago

2809
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
I watched it like

2810
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
15 hours ago

2811
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
I think more of a Temple of Doom

2812
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Would be my way to go

2813
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
For the new Indy

2814
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
I'm a big Temple of Doom guy

2815
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
This kind of gives me Temple of Doom vibes though

2816
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
A little bit? Yeah it does

2817
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
There's for sure references to it

2818
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Even scary

2819
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
It's similar to the scary

2820
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Climax of Temple of Doom

2821
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
It's a lot of fire

2822
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
It's a lot of scary stuff

2823
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
It's less horrific than Temple of Doom

2824
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Disney's not going to do that

2825
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
They're not going to pull a heart out of a man

2826
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
I don't know if that's necessary

2827
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
Kids do go on this attraction

2828
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Kids do go on this attraction

2829
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
But it is scary

2830
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
At 13 I think you're ready to see a man

2831
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Get his heart pulled out of his chest

2832
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
That's just

2833
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
That's coming from a father

2834
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
These kids aren't going to go on the

2835
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
Encanto attraction

2836
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
And then they're going to walk

2837
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Half a block to watch a heart

2838
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Be pulled out of an animatronic

2839
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
Then they could sell

2840
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Hearts in the gift shop

2841
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Which by the way

2842
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
I don't even consider a gift shop

2843
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Because it's not attached

2844
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Well that is a thing

2845
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Yes, that's a good point

2846
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
The gift shop in a similar way

2847
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
To Haunted Mansion

2848
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
The way Haunted Mansion was out here

2849
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
The gift shop is far away from the ride

2850
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Which I'll be honest

2851
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
It is nice

2852
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
To have that difference sometimes

2853
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Because it does feel

2854
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
I don't know

2855
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
I'm torn

2856
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Sometimes it's nice to get emptied into the gift shop

2857
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
And exit into the gift shop

2858
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
I want to impulse buy something

2859
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
So you wish there was a full gift

2860
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
Well you did

2861
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
You bought a couple of things

2862
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
That's true

2863
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Maybe I'd buy a whip

2864
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
Something

2865
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
How many more hats would they sell

2866
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
If it was right off the ride

2867
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
So you're saying that maybe

2868
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
You're so jacked up

2869
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
After the ride

2870
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
It wears off by the time you

2871
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Walk across the way

2872
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
We almost got

2873
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
Slaughtered by this

2874
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Rolling giant ball

2875
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
We're on this high

2876
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
But then by the time we get out of there

2877
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Maybe we don't even see that gift shop across the street

2878
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Right, you don't even know it's there

2879
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
And you've heard the Glenn Miller music

2880
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
And now you're so calm and relaxed

2881
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Because that's the place I want to take a nap

2882
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Maybe you have a rush to get on another ride

2883
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
After you walk

2884
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
A half a mile back to Adventureland

2885
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Yeah

2886
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Gift shop

2887
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
I think Disney is just

2888
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
Sleeping on sales

2889
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Don't you think it would take a little of the class

2890
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
It feels like a classy ride

2891
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Because it doesn't have the gift shop right there

2892
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Well, but if you theme it to like

2893
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Sala is trying to make a book

2894
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Hmm

2895
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
It looks a little

2896
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Haphazard, you know

2897
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Yeah, and they sell a couple whips

2898
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Do they sell a whip? Can you get a whip in the park

2899
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
With a child?

2900
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
You used to be a few hundred percent

2901
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
You can buy a crystal skull

2902
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Not crystal head vodka, a crystal skull

2903
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
From crystal skull and it's like hundreds of dollars

2904
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
You can buy like the artifacts from each movie

2905
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
I don't know if they have a dial yet

2906
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
If they do

2907
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
I was just there, I should have checked to see if we could get a dial

2908
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
I want a dial

2909
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
I'll keep you posted, I'll be there in two weeks

2910
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Okay, let us know how many dials they have

2911
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
And if the dials are selling well

2912
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Because I suspect the dials aren't moving fast

2913
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
But I think I would keep the

2914
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
I would keep the gift shop away

2915
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
That's my opinion

2916
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Okay, fair, fair

2917
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Like Haunted Mansion, they of course

2918
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
I don't know if it will be open by the time you're there

2919
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Haunted Mansion has built a separate house

2920
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Right outside the exit

2921
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
And I know some people are mad at the scale of it

2922
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
I have yet to determine if I think that's right or not

2923
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
But it's

2924
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
That feels okay to me

2925
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Because it's close to the exit but it's not in the ride

2926
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
Okay, fair

2927
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
I'm getting some of the classiness of the ride

2928
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
But there are things

2929
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
I mean look, Rock and Roller Coaster you exit

2930
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Back when you could buy Aerosmith merch

2931
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
You exit right into the concert

2932
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
You're buying your Aerosmith merch right there

2933
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
I had some drumsticks

2934
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Yeah, I mean I got

2935
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
Scott, I have a GeForce record producer

2936
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
There you go

2937
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Yes, I have it just on the other side of the stable

2938
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
So

2939
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
I am pro

2940
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
Gift shop at Rock and Roller Coaster

2941
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Indiana Jones

2942
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Anyway, there's so much

2943
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Indiana Jones is amazing

2944
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
I hope every seven years we come back

2945
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
And talk about it

2946
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Because it deserves it

2947
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Matt Cardona, you have survived podcast the ride

2948
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Oh man, thank you so much guys

2949
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Please exit through the gift shop

2950
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Now, plug away

2951
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Now is this gift shop attached or is it across the street?

2952
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Since it's

2953
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Well, since it's your gift shop

2954
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
I guess you can choose so I guess it's attached

2955
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
That's what you want

2956
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Whatever the guest prefers

2957
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Guys, follow me on social media

2958
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
At the Matt Cardona

2959
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
If you like wrestling figures

2960
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Collectibles, I also have a podcast

2961
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
The Major Wrestling Figure Podcast

2962
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
And we sell our own figures over at

2963
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
CollectMajor.com

2964
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
And if you see me at Disneyland in a couple of weeks

2965
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
You're allowed to say hi, but I'm on the clock

2966
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
With that VIP tour, so don't chat too long

2967
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
You know what I'm saying

2968
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
You gotta make it quick

2969
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Can I real quick, I've said this before

2970
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
I think the people want

2971
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Jay Leno, Kevin Eubanks

2972
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Wrestling figures, I truly in my heart

2973
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
Believe that

2974
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
I would love a Jay Leno

2975
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
If you can get him to sign with

2976
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
With Major, I'm down

2977
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Okay, send me some paperwork

2978
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Look, he's got the garage out here

2979
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
We need to try to interview him

2980
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
One of these days

2981
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Because Jay with the blue

2982
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
That blue t-shirt

2983
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
And Kevin Eubanks, so his band leader

2984
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Had the cut off sleeves

2985
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
He looked good, he can interfere to the match

2986
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
I'm not against

2987
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Jay has to be first

2988
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
I know obviously Jay is the bigger name

2989
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
But Kevin was such a part of that match

2990
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
The Hogan D&P match

2991
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Sign me up

2992
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
I think a two pack with Jay and Kevin

2993
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Is what I want

2994
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
I want a Michael Eisner

2995
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
We need a Michael Eisner

2996
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Figure

2997
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Give us something

2998
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Somebody made us a custom Michael Eisner doll

2999
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
That I have in the closet

3000
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Over here

3001
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
We need official

3002
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
We've tried with Michael Eisner on the show too

3003
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
But he needs to sign with you guys as well

3004
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
I would love that

3005
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Matt, if you move fast

3006
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
You might be able to

3007
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Beat AEW

3008
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
And get the Rizzler, AJ and Big Justice

3009
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
I will say

3010
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
They have left me on

3011
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
Left on red

3012
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
I slid into the DMs

3013
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Left on red

3014
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
That's like Tony Baxter with me

3015
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
That's what

3016
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Knott's Berry Farm is doing to me too

3017
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Oh no

3018
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
So you feel my pain

3019
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
I bet Jay

3020
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
We can get Jay to sign on

3021
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Let's do it

3022
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
As for us

3023
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
We're on all the socials

3024
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Go to Patreon.com

3025
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
We have bonus episodes

3026
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
On a variety of topics

3027
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
We just watched a weird Thanksgiving parade

3028
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
That's half Macy's Day parade

3029
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Half a weird parade about Goofy

3030
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Where he's also a dinosaur

3031
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
And he golfs

3032
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
It's a very strange parade

3033
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
But anyway, Podcast the Ride

3034
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
At Patreon, that's not the website

3035
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
But you understand what I'm saying

3036
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Jason, anything else?

3037
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
No, the website is

3038
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Patreon.com slash Podcast the Ride

3039
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
A long time

3040
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Even though I think you've texted me

3041
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
What are these episode topics?

3042
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
You don't have to subscribe

3043
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
I'm not offended

3044
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
I'm going to stay subscribed

3045
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Why are you guys talking so much about Jay Leno?

3046
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Anyway

3047
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Again, you can cancel anytime

3048
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
I won't

3049
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Forever
